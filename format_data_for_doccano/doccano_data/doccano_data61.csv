Hachijojima is a volcanic Japanese island some 287 kilometers south of Tokyo, to which it belongs. 7,522 people live on its 63 km2 of area.

Image cropped from Google Maps.
What makes Hachijojima interesting climatically is its rural, non-urban features – in the middle of the ocean –  making station siting there less prone to factors that could corrupt the data, such as airports, asphalt, concrete, steel and other heat-sink-acting infrastructure.
Today we look at data from the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) going back almost 80 years. Hearing all the claims about a rapidly warming world from the media, many readers would think that there must be warming happening there as well. The data have a surprise in store.
Summer
Now that summer has ended, we plot the latest data to see if summers have indeed been warming at this island.

Data source: JMA
As the above data show, there has been virtually no trend at all over the past 80 years. Warming? Still no sign of it at all.

Winter
Next we look at the mean winter temperatures at this location since 1947:

Data source: JMA
Like summer, also winter has shown no long-term trend one way or the other. Where’s the bad climate change news here?
Annual
To round out the analysis and to summarize, we plot the annual mean temperature data recorded for Hachjojima:

Data source: JMA
Interestingly, the annual temperature behavior appears to follow a cyclic behavior that very much resemble some ocean surface temperature cycles we see from around the globe, like the PDO or AMO. Climate indeed changes, but what we see above it cannot be due to anything anthropogenic.

"About a fifth of the fresh food the UK imports comes from areas threatened with climate chaos, putting people’s health and diets at risk, MPs have found. The environmental audit committee called on ministers to set out a clear plan for how the UK’s food supplies could be protected from the climate emergency and to publish information on how food may be affected by Brexit.  Currently, 40% of the UK’s food is imported, according to the report published on Tuesday. In the very near future, people would be at risk from sudden lurches in food prices if a no-deal Brexit resulted in trouble with imports, including higher costs, delays and shortages. Mary Creagh, the chair of the committee, said: “We are facing a food security crisis, exacerbated by uncertainty over the UK’s future trading position with the EU and the rest of the world. Ministers must now publish all the information they hold from Operation Yellowhammer on food security and likely costs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.” Beyond the immediate effects of Brexit, the climate emergency and changing trade relationships may put the British diet in jeopardy. The MPs called for a national food council that would cover food production, nutrition and public health issues, and for stringent annual targets to reduce the UK’s high levels of food waste. Water consumption across the UK should be set at 100 litres (22 gallons) per person per day, the MPs found. This would require changes to water availability and potentially to metering. Sustainable cities should also be made more resilient to the effects of the climate crisis, and town planners should be more involved in improving the design of cities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, for instance through more efficient transport networks. The MPs also called for Public Health England to take on responsibility for adapting to the effects of the climate emergency – particularly through examining any measures needed to counter the spread, made easier by global heating, of emerging diseases such as Lyme disease, the incidence of which is rising. Already, “unprecedented” damage has been done to natural systems around the world, from water and clean air to a stable climate and flourishing nature, the MPs said. The chancellor, Sajid Javid, has unveiled plans for a new Treasury study on the economics of biodiversity, to be led by Sir Partha Dasgupta and Sir David Attenborough. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “We recognise the threat climate change poses to many facets of our national life, including our food production and supply, which is why the UK is the first major economy to legislate for net zero emissions by 2050. “We already have a highly resilient food supply chain in the UK, and our national food strategy review is considering how we can further address the challenges of a changing climate and continue to deliver safe, healthy, affordable food now and for generations to come.” Vicki Hird, a farming campaigner at the Sustain civil society organisation, said: “The MPs are spot on with this report, given the climate emergency and size of the challenge. “For far too long we’ve left our vital food supply to be dominated by complex global supply chains and the junk food industry. We now have a highly vulnerable, unsustainable and inefficient food system that needs to be repaired using all the tools available. A [government] champion putting this all together coherently would be handy.” She called for the government’s agriculture bill and environment bill to be brought back before parliament as a matter of urgency. “[We need] good farmers to be paid to produce more diverse and better food and to reduce reliance on vulnerable overseas suppliers,” Hird said."

"Former vice-president Joe Biden and the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, leading candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination, will miss an MSNBC forum on the climate crisis to be held in Washington later this week. The livestreamed event at Georgetown University, which will include hourlong interviews with presidential contenders on Thursday and Friday, is aimed at students and timed to align with global climate strikes inspired by young people. The California senator Kamala Harris, former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke and the Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar will also miss the event. The Vermont senator Bernie Sanders will be interviewed on Thursday. One Republican challenger to Donald Trump, former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld, will also appear. Organizers said most candidates who declined cited scheduling conflicts in the early voting state of Iowa, including for an LGBTQ forum in Cedar Rapids on Friday. Warren had prior commitments for that forum and a town hall, a spokeswoman said, adding that the senator plans to talk about the climate crisis at an Iowa campaign stop. None of the other campaigns responded to requests for comment. The MSNBC event is the second climate-focused discussion with presidential candidates this month, following a seven-hour CNN town hall. It will not be aired on the network in full, a factor which may have contributed to candidates declining. One person familiar with the MSNBC event said it seemed candidates felt they had “checked the box on climate” by appearing at the CNN event. The Democratic National Committee has refused to allow an official climate crisis debate. The debate in Houston last week included just one question on climate. Stephen O’Hanlon, a spokesman for the Sunrise Movement, said the youth-led activist group understands why some candidates could not attend the MSNBC event. “The CNN Climate Crisis Town Hall forced all the candidates to put forward serious plans to tackle the climate crisis and answer questions from voters on them,” O’Hanlon said. “That was historic.” But Sierra Club’s national policy director, Ariel Hayes, said: “If tackling the climate crisis is truly the priority for these candidates that it needs to be, they should be taking advantage of this opportunity to share their vision with the world.” Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, will appear on MSNBC and in Iowa. He will be interviewed at the climate forum on Friday morning before appearing at the LGBTQ forum that evening. Democrats running for president have laid out multifaceted plans for slashing the 15% of heat-trapping pollution the US contributes to the atmosphere, as scientists warn time is running short and Trump guts efforts to help. Miro Korenha, a co-founder of the newsletter Our Daily Planet and a planner of the MSNBC event, said she was disappointed candidates would miss an opportunity to talk with students. Polls show young Americans are more engaged on global warming than older adults. The MSNBC anchors Chris Hayes and Ali Velshi will question the candidates on how they would act to drastically reduce emissions from cars, power plants, industry and agriculture. Korenha said the CNN town hall was criticized for focusing on narrow questions about how candidates would change how Americans live, “from plastics … to cheeseburgers”. “We really hope to bring a lot of substance to this,” she said."

Global warming alarmists like to claim that tropical storms will intensify and become more frequent unless people stop using fossil fuels.
And recently these alarmists have had our attention steered to the Atlantic basin, where tropical storms this year have seen quite an active season thus far.
Another reason the focus has been on the Atlantic is because very little has been happening in terms of Pacific typhoons, and the alarmists don’t want to talk about that.
In fact this July is the first July to have seen no typhoons formed in the Pacific at all since statistics on this began in 1951, according to the data from the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA).

Data source: JMA, here and here. 
Normally between 3 to 4 typhoons form in the Pacific in July. Up to 8 have formed in the past, e.g. on 2017 and 1971. But this year July failed to see a single typhoon form – the first time this has occurred since 1951.

Trend contradicts the forecasts of climate scientists
But one year does not make a trend. Global warming alarmists say storms are getting and will be more frequent, and stronger. So let’s look at the data here as well.
The following chart shows the number of typhoons formed in the Pacific each year from January to July, since 1951:

Data source: JMA, here and here. 
Contrary to what global warming alarmists say, the trend has been downward! The year 2020 has been the second quietest on record – so far.
A warmer world is tamer?
Now we look at total number of typhoons formed each entire year:

Data source: JMA, here and here. 
Once again the global warming alarmists are shown to be wrong. In fact, it’s probably the other way around: A warmer planet leads to less storm activity. But this is not the message the purveyors of fear want us to hear.

"The Coalition’s “big stick” energy legislation to break up power companies is a “backdoor to privatisation” of electricity assets in states that have kept them in public hands, Mark Butler has warned. On Sunday Labor’s shadow climate change spokesman gave a clear signal it will continue to oppose the legislation in an interview renewing his calls for an “unsparing” election review and refusing to recommit to a 45% emissions reduction target by 2030.  On Saturday the Australian Financial Review reported the Morrison government is set to reintroduce legislation to give the treasurer power to compel companies to supply electricity on certain terms and for courts to force energy companies engaging in anti-competitive conduct to sell off assets. The bill was shelved before the election due to lack of Senate support and the risk of amendments hostile to coal, but Labor’s leader Anthony Albanese has so far refused to state a position on the bill after the surprise May election defeat. Butler told ABC’s Insiders that Labor would look to see if any changes had been made to the legislation but noted that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission had “explicitly rejected” the idea, suggesting it is not in consumers’ interests. “The Energy Users Association representing the biggest users of electricity in this country also said they were concerned this bill would simply smash investor confidence and force power prices up,” he said. “There’s also the added concern that we pointed to that this appears to be a backdoor to privatising electricity assets in Queensland and [Western Australia] and Tasmania where their communities have time and time again rejected the idea that their publicly owned assets should be put in private hands. “We have some very serious concerns about this.” Butler responded to a report that Labor may have to ditch its interim target of 45% emissions reduction by 2030 by noting that “all our policies are up for review” since the election defeat. Butler said setting medium-term targets is still best practice but noted the 45% target was set in 2015, suggesting he could not put a precise number or year on a new target. “What our position will be at 2022 at the election, obviously I’m not in a position to announce four months out from the last election.” He said Labor wanted to keep global warming below 1.5C and is committed to “net zero emissions by the middle of the century and medium-term targets consistent with those principles informed by the best scientific and economic advice”. Butler criticised the Coalition for the drought minister David Littleproud denying knowledge of a link between climate change and bushfires – a position he later retracted – and Australia’s record of steadily rising emissions. He said Scott Morrison would not attend the UN climate summit because Australia’s 26% emissions reduction target is “unanimously regarded as grossly inadequate, [and is] consistent instead with more like 3C or 3.5C of global warming which would be utterly catastrophic”. Australia is set to miss the “inadequate” 2030 target “by a mile”, Butler said. Asked about ALP president Wayne Swan’s view that Labor should stick to its tax-and-spend agenda to fix inequality, Butler replied that Swan was “very experienced” and entitled to put the view but even he “accepts … that this was a very deep election loss”. Butler said Labor needed “some deep reflection and that includes over our taxation policies, the spending commitments they were intended to fund, climate and energy and every other policy area” because it lost its third election in a row, with the lowest primary vote in 100 years to an outfit “Morrison himself described as the Muppet Show”. Butler also rejected allegations of racism in Labor questioning the government about Liberal MP Gladys Liu’s links to Chinese-government associations, noting it is pursuing the same questions as the national media. He attacked the Coalition’s record, including former attorney general George Brandis’s declaration people have “the right to be a bigot” in the context of attempting to water down race hate speech laws, and Morrison’s decision to label Sam Dastyari “Shanghai Sam” when he was embroiled in a donations scandal."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe consensus was that global erosion of mountains and the Earth’s surface had been accelerating over the last 5 million years. Well, guess what? This once long accepted hypothesis has just been smashed by researchers at the GeoForschungsZentrum in Potsdam Germany. They present their results in the May 13 issue of Nature.  GFZ Potsdam (click English top right). They write:
The globally observed four-fold acceleration of sedimentation is an artifact of the observations. Important geological hypotheses that are based on this observation now require revision.
Artifact of observation? Gee, where can one see that today? Hansen, are you reading?
Erosion of rocks and the Earth’s surface over the last 5 million years could be found as sediment. Measurements of the sediment layers suggested that erosion had increased over the last 5 million years. The question was why? What caused the acceleration?
Hypotheses for the cause included the increased global growth of mountains by movement of tectonic plates which resulted in accelerated erosion, or the onset of the ice ages 3 million years ago – which accelerated erosion. But neither of these hypotheses was satisfactory. Another wrench in the the machine was CO2 –  it just didn’t pan out.
GFZ-scientists Jane Willenbring and Friedhelm von Blanckenburg appear to have solved the riddle.
They found that the increase in sedimentation rates is a so-called “artifact” of the observations: the more detail geologists observe, the more sediment they discover. In younger geologic time the observations get better than those made on sediment millions of years in age. This is so because not all sediment, once deposited, survives the passage of geologic time. The increase in sedimentation therefore is not real – it merely mirrors the better preservation of younger sediment.
Read the GFZ Potsdam report to see how they used isotope Beryllium-10 to solve the riddle.
Of course other scientists could claim that the consensus supports the old view, and that the GFZ researchers are just a couple of fringe scientists that can’t be taken seriously.

"It has been a painted lady summer. Nearly half a million of the migratory creatures were counted in British parks and gardens as part of the biggest butterfly survey in the world. The painted lady topped the charts of the annual Big Butterfly Count with 420,841 recorded during high summer after their first big influx on British shores in a decade.  This year too there were greater numbers of common species than last year – 1.1 million of the most common five species combined were seen, compared with 660,000 in 2018.  There were big increases for peacocks (207,814), gatekeepers (161,987) and red admirals (91,146), while the number of marbled whites increased by 264% as global heating helped the butterfly move north through Britain. The count also revealed that global heating could be the cause of the mysterious decline of the once ubiquitous small tortoiseshell butterfly, whose numbers have fallen by 78% since the 1970s. Last summer was the worst for the species since the count began but this year it bounced back: 70,000 were spotted, up 167% and bringing its highest number for five years. Richard Fox, of Butterfly Conservation, which organised the survey, said the small tortoiseshell showed up well in Scotland and Northern Ireland, where it was the second most seen species, but struggled to make the top 10 in England and Wales. On average, count participants in Scotland and Northern Ireland saw more than twice as many small tortoiseshells as people in England. “We’re still trying to establish what is behind the long-term decline of the small tortoiseshell and while it is good news that the butterfly fared better this summer, the poor results in southern England in particular suggest that climate change may be having more of an impact on this species than we have previously realised,” Fox said. A record 113,500 people took part in this year’s count, spotting nearly 1.6m butterflies during the three-week recording period from the end of July. Numbers of common white species and blue butterflies slumped compared with last summer. The large white, small white, and green-veined white, fell by a combined 42%, the common blue was down 59% and the holly blue fell 54%.  1. Painted lady (420,841)2. Peacock (207,814)3.

Share this...FacebookTwitterEarlier this year in spring, the WMO and others warned of another record hot summer and drought. The German media went bonkers in response warning that 2020 could even be hotter and drier than the 2018 and 2019 summers.
But now that the meteorological summer (June 1 – August 31) has ended, the data show that these earlier predictions were WRONG.
Germany’s DWD national weather service, having tabulated data from some 2000 stations nationwide, has issued its preliminary report for the summer of 2020. The results: a near normal summer.
Only 1°C warmer than normal
According to the DWD,  the summer of 2020 was often variable, seeing only short periods of heat and that it was not until August that the midsummer “turned up the heat” for a spell of about 10 days.
With a mean of 18.2 °C, the summer of 2020 across Germany was was 1.1 C above the mean of the 1981 to 2010 period. In July, many locations did not see the thermometer reach even 30°C.
Only in August did a heat wave lasting several days see temperatures over 35°C.

Overall near normal rainfall
With an average of around 230 liters per square meter (l/m²) of precipitation nationwide, summer 2020 fell only slightly short of its long term mean of 239 l/m², the DWD reports. Thus the projection of a continued extreme drought such as seen in 2018 and 2019 failed to appear.
Some regions, such as the Uckermark, the Leipzig lowland bay, Saarland and along the Rhine, saw less than half of the typical rainfall. At the same time, there were continuous rainfalls, such as in early August in Upper Bavaria with up to 150 l/m² in 24 hours, which also brought flooding. In total, over 700 l/m² were measured in the Alps over the summer.
10% more sunshine (hence a bit warmer)
At around 675 hours, the sunshine duration in summer exceeded its long-term mean of 614 hours by around 10 percent. The coastal regions recorded over 700 hours of sunshine. In the western low mountain ranges, however, the DWD measured only 500 hours.
“Summer 2020 was completely normal”
Die kalte Sonne here summarizes Germany’s summer of 2020: “Summer 2020 was completely normal in terms of precipitation, including regional differences. One could have wished for an abnormally humid one after the dry years 2018 and 2019, but weather is not about wishful thinking. When it comes to precipitation (which is first and foremost decisive for drought), there has been no remarkable trend. Everything else you hear is not based on facts.”

"Scott Morrison will not attend the UN climate action summit despite him being in America to visit the Trump administration at the time – deploying the foreign minister, Marise Payne, and the Australian ambassador for the environment, Patrick Suckling, instead. Guardian Australia understands speaking slots at the event in New York on 23 September were reserved for countries announcing new emissions reduction targets or financial commitments to the UN Green Climate Fund – and Morrison has been signalling Australia won’t be going further, at least at this point, than commitments previously announced. A draft program for the summit, and a list of member states intending to present at the event, seen by Guardian Australia, did not include any reference to Australian participation. Morrison was asked by the Greens in question time on Wednesday whether he would attend the UN summit, and he said Australia would be represented at the event. Asked by Guardian Australia to confirm whether the prime minister would be the Australian representative, and whether the government would offer any new commitments, a spokesman for Morrison said: “Australia has already outlined our policies to tackle climate change including cutting our emissions by 26-28% and investing directly into climate resilience projects through our regional partners”. The spokesman confirmed Payne would attend the summit, not Morrison. “The foreign minister, accompanied by the ambassador for the environment, will be highlighting [the Coalition’s previously announced policies] when she represents Australia at the UN Climate Action Summit.” Morrison will go to New York later in the week as part of his US visit to address the UN General Assembly. Guardian Australia reported in July that the UN secretary general, António Guterres, as a prelude to the special climate summit on 23 September, had written to all heads of state, including Australia, asking countries to outline plans to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Morrison at the time dead batted what Australia might do at the UN event, but signalled Australia was only engaging on the process to 2030, not on the next round of commitments to 2050 flagged by the secretary general. Despite well-publicised differences at the recent Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) between regional leaders and Morrison about coal, Australia at the forum signed up to a statement that commits Australia to pursuing efforts to limit global warming to 1.5C, and to produce a 2050 strategy by 2020. Earlier this year, Australian government officials also restated a commitment to “review and refine” domestic policies aligned with the five-yearly review process under the Paris agreement. The Morrison government was challenged by the European Union and by China in June about whether Australia could meet its Paris commitments given the trend of rising emissions evident since the repeal of the carbon price, including increased pollution from vehicles. Australia needs to submit a new pollution reduction goal for post-2030 as part of the “review, refine and ratchet” mechanism under the Paris agreement. In response to questions ahead of a climate meeting in Bonn in June, Australian officials said of refine and review: “This approach will provide for integrated consideration of domestic policy and international targets, and provide guidance for industry about future policy review processes.” While Australia has made a commitment at PIF to develop a 2050 strategy next year, Morrison has made it clear the Coalition won’t be investing more in the UN climate fund, and will instead pursue investments in climate resilience directly with Australia’s regional partners. Morrison’s spokesman said Australia was pursuing direct investments because countries in the region had faced “frustrations with the UN’s Green Climate Fund”. Morrison at PIF offered $500m over five years from 2020 from existing aid funds for climate projects. Britain has been confirmed as the host of the COP26 meeting in December 2020. That meeting at the end of next year under UN auspices is regarded as the most important on the climate since the Paris process, because parties to the Paris agreement will review their pledges. The British government has privately appealed to senior Coalition ministers – including the energy minister, Angus Taylor, and Payne – to develop a more “ambitious” climate policy, amid growing concern that Australia is not doing enough to cut emissions. While the criticism of the government’s current policy offering on climate change is persistent from a range of stakeholders, Morrison declared in parliament on Wednesday Australia had no case to answer. “We are doing our heavy lifting. We are setting our targets. We are meeting our targets. We have the programs in place.”"
"On one level it appeared just another week in Australian climate politics. A ridiculous statement by a government minister made headlines; the crossbench pushed for stronger action; the prime minister’s office quietly suggested he may not fulfil the next step of the Paris agreement, a deal he has repeatedly promised voters he would honour. Meanwhile, much of the media coverage of climate policy focused on what the opposition might do if it wins power in three years’ time. But the repercussions from decisions made public this week may reverberate longer than was immediately obvious. First, the ridiculous. David Littleproud, the minister responsible for drought and natural disasters, made international news after telling Guardian Australia he did not know if climate change was manmade. By Thursday, he was saying he had always accepted the science on the role humans play in the climate changing. He blamed his initial statement on a TV interview being cut short, neglecting to acknowledge it first appeared in an email responding to questions from this publication. The minister’s position was backed to varying degrees by cabinet colleagues who played down the need to focus on the link between the climate crisis and bushfires ravaging Queensland and New South Wales or, in the case of the resources minister, Matt Canavan, volunteered that the government supported “sensible responses” to the issue that included supporting coal and gas developments. If this all sounds wearyingly familiar and anti-science, it is worth noting Littleproud’s past comments back his claim that he more or less accepts mainstream science and the need to respond, if not the urgency scientists say is necessary. Beyond reinforcing Australia’s reputation as a global laggard on the climate emergency, his misstep was extraordinary mostly for illustrating the extent to which relative centrists within the Coalition are tying themselves in knots to avoid the wrath of the hard right. But put Littleproud’s gaffe aside. Confirmation by my colleague Katharine Murphy that Scott Morrison will not attend a climate summit convened by the UN secretary general later this month, despite landing in the US that week to meet Donald Trump, is more significant – and not just for surface-level appearance reasons. Morrison was not offered a speaking slot at the summit because he turned down António Guterres’ call for leaders to come to New York armed with concrete plans to boost national climate commitments next year. The foreign minister, Marise Payne, will attend in his place. While it has received relatively little attention beyond the Guardian, international observers are interpreting it as a sign Australia is backing away from its pledge under the Paris agreement. It’s worth looking at what Australia signed up to in France in 2015. The overarching goal agreement is to limit global heating to well below 2C and as close to 1.5C as possible. To get there, countries included a “ratchet-up” mechanism. Every five years, they would update their commitments (known, in the UN’s typically alienating language, as “nationally determined contributions”) informed by the latest science. Everyone in Paris knew the initial targets set for 2030 were nothing like enough. Everyone knew the success of the pact would depend on countries lifting their commitments sooner rather than later. The point was reinforced last year when the world’s climate scientists, under the banner of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, released a major report examining what would be necessary to limit heating to 1.5C. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The report, which was requested by leaders in Paris, was stark. As Guterres has noted, it suggests a global 45% cut in emissions is needed by 2030 to keep the 1.5C goal within reach – a significant ask, but one in which analysts have found Australia could play its part. Armed with that information, leaders are now supposed to be doing their part: ramping up what they will do as we approach the first five-yearly update of the Paris agreement next year. As one of the world’s 15 biggest emitters and a wealthy developed country, what Australia does is noticed. But in a comment to the Guardian this week, Morrison’s office offered nothing to suggest a change was on the cards as promised. “Australia has already outlined our policies to tackle climate change including cutting our emissions by 26-28% and investing directly into climate resilience projects through our regional partners,” a spokesman said. Australia has an infamous history of fudging on its climate targets, dating back to the first stage of the Kyoto Protocol, when it demanded a target that allowed it to increase pollution by 8%. It also pushed for the inclusion of land-use changes in its baseline year of 1990, an historically high year for Australian carbon pollution from rampant land clearing in Queensland. As land clearing had already reduced in the years that followed, it meant Australia could meet its goal while it continued to dramatically expand fossil fuel operations. It set up a situation where it could claim to be playing its part while doing no such thing. That approach has continued. Australia has changed baseline years to make cuts appear deeper than they are and set targets that ignore scientific advice. Its has set low emissions reduction targets and then wants to claim extra credit towards its next target for beating the first goal. The credits go to Australia, not the atmosphere. As has been well documented, Australia’s national emissions have risen four years straight. Multiple analyses have found existing climate change policies are not enough to meet the current 2030 target. It would be foolish to be Pollyannaish about the state of international action to combat climate change. Global emissions increased last year after plateauing for a couple of years in the middle of the decade. The national governments of the biggest emitters, China and the US, either give mixed messages or are actively opposed to taking action. But most major players, China included, remain committed to the Paris process in a way Australia is not. High-level discussions between China and the European Union about increasing their emissions commitments are ongoing. India is watching those talks closely ahead of announcing its position next year. More than 60 countries have signed up to give a presentation at the NYC climate summit, according to an early list seen by the Guardian. Amid this, Australia’s plans are unclear at best. It has committed to develop a long-term strategy, but not explained what this will mean. It is possible it could still take an increased 2030 target to the UN climate conference in Glasgow next year. But it has said nothing to indicate this is likely. Why does this matter? Beyond it going against Australia’s pledge in 2015, it makes deeper cuts in the future that much harder. Bill Hare, the chief executive and senior scientist with Climate Analytics, says it is well established scientifically that inadequate emissions reductions by 2030 leaves little to no chance of reaching zero emissions by 2050, the underlying goal implied by the Paris deal. Visiting bushfire-damaged Queensland on Friday, Morrison followed a familiar formula. He accepted that climate change was a factor in what he was witnessing and claimed Australia was acting. “We have already responded and we will continue to respond, to take action on climate change. I do not accept any suggestion that we do not,” he said. It is a proven technique: straight denial despite all the evidence running the other way. But talk to international observers of climate efforts and the view is different. Australia is seen as a roadblock, more focused on expanding its coal and gas exports than supporting a global solution. As efforts build ahead of Glasgow next year, Morrison may find it is not just the Pacific pushing back."

"Firefighters in New South Wales are taking advantage of cooler conditions to undertake backburning operations, with hotter and windier conditions expected next week. Fire conditions eased again over the weekend in northern NSW, where residents had been told it was too late to leave after a bushfire jumped a highway.  An emergency warning had been issued for the bushfire near the town of Drake on Saturday afternoon as it headed straight for homes in the Rover Park and Red Rock areas. A change in wind lowered the fire’s threat by the evening, prompting the Rural Fire Service to downgrade its warning to an advice level. Another out-of-control fire at Glen Innes Severn was also downgraded from an emergency warning level to watch-and-act, although the RFS continued to warn of spot fires ahead of the main fire. Residents of the Wytaliba area had been told to seek shelter as the fire approached, and those in the Newton Boyd and Wytaliba areas were told to be aware of embers. Overall, the number of out-of-control fires fell from 14 uncontained bushfires at midday on Friday to two late Saturday afternoon, with firefighters making the most of favourable weather conditions. Does climate change cause bushfires? The link between rising greenhouse gas emissions and increased bushfire risk is complex but, according to major science agencies, clear. Climate change does not create bushfires, but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity.  What is the evidence on rising temperatures?  The Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk. What other effects do carbon emissions have? Dry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth.  So is climate change making everything dryer?  Dryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past. What do recent weather patterns show? The year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 has been the fifth driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970. Is arson a factor in this year's extreme bushfires? Not a significant one. Two pieces of disinformation, that an “arson emergency”, rather than climate change, is behind the bushfires, and that “greenies” are preventing firefighters from reducing fuel loads in the Australian bush have spread across social media. They have found their way into major news outlets, the mouths of government MPs, and across the globe to Donald Trump Jr and prominent right-wing conspiracy theorists. NSW’s Rural Fire Service has said the major cause of ignition during the crisis has been dry lightning. Victoria police say they do not believe arson had a role in any of the destructive fires this summer. The RFS has also contradicted claims that environmentalists have been holding up hazard reduction work. The RFS said firefighters also took advantage of cooler conditions to undertake backburning around the state, with warmer and windier conditions expected again next week. The federal government has activated the disaster recovery allowance in Armidale, Bellingen, Clarence Valley, Glen Innes, Inverell, Tenterfield, Uralla and Walcha in NSW. The allowance provides an additional support payment for up to 13 weeks to those who have lost income as a result of the bushfires. It is equivalent to the maximum rate of the Newstart allowance. Meanwhile, conditions have eased for firefighters battling Queensland’s bushfires but the fire danger was set to increase in coming days. On Sunday firefighters continued to battle about 50 bushfires in tinderbox conditions across Queensland. Crews from Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and New Zealand were lending a hand to fight blazes that have razed homes, businesses and an estimated 55,000 hectares of land. But the relief brought on by eased weather conditions was not expected to last as forecasts showed the fire danger was set to increase in coming days. Moist winds could continue to cool the south-east of the state on Sunday. The most serious fires across the state, near Rockhampton, Monduran, Peregian on the Sunshine Coast and at Applethorpe, were sitting at an advice level warning. Of concern to authorities was the Sarabah fire in the Gold Coast hinterland, because it was the biggest. However, the fire danger remained high ahead of deteriorating firefighting conditions forecast to arrive early next week, the Bureau of Meteorology said. “It’s going to be very warm through southern Queensland on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday,” meteorologist Sam Campbell said late on Saturday. “Unfortunately, the hot dry weather is set to continue.” The premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, visited burned-out properties in the Gold Coast hinterland community of Beachmont on Sunday. “Some people here have lost their worldly possessions but they haven’t lost their lives,” she said. “They’ll be able to rebuild, and we’ll help them rebuild.” She asked Queenslanders to give generously to a bushfire appeal to support those who lost everything. The 10-day emergency has seen some 1,200 bushfires burning across the state, with more than 600 community warnings issued in the past two weeks. Officials have warned some fires could burn for months because the ground was bone-dry and there was no significant rain in sight. Fires continued to burn in the Lamington national Park, near Binna Burra, in Sarabah and Lower Beechmont. The Ballandean blaze, south of Stanthorpe, continued to burn within containment lines and on Sunday morning there was no threat to property."
"Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg – who has inspired young people around the world to strike in protest of inadequate government action on the crisis – accompanied her American counterparts in the youth climate movement at a rally near Donald Trump’s White House on Friday. Thunberg quietly joined near the edge of the group, whispering along with chants and shaking her head when thanked by other advocates.  The protesters were so surrounded by reporters and TV cameras that they had difficulty beginning a planned march toward the White House. Thunberg fell back in the crowd. “We love you, Greta,” fans yelled. Trump, who has repeatedly denied climate science, has opposed major US efforts to stem greenhouse gases from fossil fuels that are heating the globe, as well as rolling back or attempting to dilute other environmental protections related to air and water quality and wildlife protection. He recently feuded with his own government scientists about the expected path of a the deadly Hurricane Dorian that hit the Bahamas catastrophically before grazing the US east coast last week, with the president appearing in front of a map at the White House altered by a permanent marker. “No more Sharpies, lies and censorship,” one protest sign read. Most other nations are off track to meet the goals needed to keep temperatures from rising to dangerous levels. They are already 1C higher than before industrialization. The gathering of a few hundred preteens, teenagers and their supporters chanted: “Protect our future.” On Wednesday, Thunberg will testify before the US Congress and then join young Americans who are suing the government over the crisis, speaking from the steps of the US supreme court. Thunberg, who sailed to the US last month instead of flying, will participate in a global strike next Friday. It is partly inspired by her decision to spend Fridays protesting outside the Swedish parliament, a campaign that has become known as Fridays for Future. The annual UN general assembly will meet in New York to discuss the climate crisis later this month, and activists will target the global fossil fuel chief executives’ conference taking place in the city the same day. Thunberg briefly took the megaphone at the gathering, to enthusiastic cheers. She had seemed to deliberately keep to the fringes of the event, chanting rather shyly. She said she wouldn’t give a speech because previous speakers “have already said everything”. But she added: “I just want to say I’m so incredibly grateful for every single one of you, I’m so proud of you, who have come here and I, it’s a lot of people … this is overwhelming. Just never give up, we will continue and see you next week on 20 September” - for the planned global climate strike. There appeared to be several hundred people at the event. “We’re striking today to save tomorrow, not to save life in 50 years but to save tomorrow,” said Nadia Nazar, a 17-year-old organizer with the youth group Zero Hour. The world’s leading climate scientists warned last year that humanity only has until 2030 for global heating to be kept to a maximum of 1.5C, beyond which even half a degree will significantly worsen the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people."
"The climate crisis is making people sicker – worsening illnesses ranging from seasonal allergies to heart and lung disease. Children, pregnant people and the elderly are the most at risk from extreme weather and rising heat. But the impact of the climate crisis – for patients, doctors and researchers – is already being felt across every specialty of medicine, with worse feared to come. “There’s research suggesting that our prescription medications may be causing harm because of changing heat patterns,” said Aaron Bernstein, a pediatric hospitalist who is the co-director of the Center for Climate, Health and the Global Environment at Harvard University. “There’s evidence that extreme weather events are affecting critical medical supplies so we can’t do things as we normally would do because IV fluids aren’t available. “And there’s evidence that extreme weather events are knocking out power more and more, and that is a huge issue for providing care in healthcare facilities.” In a recent example, a study in the Journal of the American Medical Associationfound that lung cancer patients undergoing radiation were less likely to survive when hurricane disasters disrupted their treatments. An August article in the New England Journal of Medicine lays out dozens of similar studies to show how the climate crisis affects each practice of medicine. Renee Salas, a co-author of the report, who teaches emergency medicine at Harvard Medical School said: “The climate crisis is impacting not only health for our patients but the way we deliver care and our ability to do our jobs. And that’s happening today.” Climate change makes allergies worse. As temperatures increase, plants produce more pollen for longer periods of time, intensifying the allergy seasons. Increased concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere can make plants grow more and cause more grass pollen, which causes allergies in about 20% of people. Carbon dioxide can also increase the allergy-causing effects of pollen. Neelu Tummala, an ear, nose and throat specialist at the George Washington Medical Faculty Associates in Washington DC, said she sees many patients with allergic rhinitis, or inflammation of the nasal cavity, congestion and post-nasal drip. “It used to be that tree pollens were only in spring, grasses were just in summer, ragweed was just in fall,” Tummala said. “But the timing of those is starting to overlap more.” One of Tummala’s patients, Kelly Kenney, had minor seasonal allergies as a child but now suffers from year-round from sinus pains, ear pressure and congestion. “The last four years, my symptoms have gotten increasingly worse,” Kenney said. Pregnant people are more vulnerable to heat and the air pollution that is being made worse by climate change. Bruce Bekkar, a San Diego-based obstetrician gynecologist who stopped practicing six years ago to spend more time as a climate activist, has compiled 68 studies from the continental US on the association between heat, smog and the tiny particles of pollution that come from fossil fuels and how they are connected with premature birth, low birth weight and stillbirth. More smog forms when it is hot, and some research suggests particulate matter also increases with the climate crisis, although the data is less robust. Bekkar said he and his co-authors found a significant association in 58 of the 68 studies. The body of research covers 30m births in the US. Bekkar said doctors should talk to their patients about how heat waves could lead to premature births and how staying away from air pollution can help them keep their children healthy. “We’re finding that we have increasing numbers of children born already in a weakened state from heat and air pollution. That’s a totally different story than thinking about climate change as the cause of hurricanes over Florida … It’s a much more pervasive and ongoing impact.” In the developing world pregnant people can also suffer from food and water scarcity. Insect-borne illnesses – such as the Zika virus, which was spread by mosquitoes – are also a hazard to developing fetuses. Air pollution gets worse as temperatures rise, stressing both the heart and lungs. The fossil fuel pollution that causes the climate crisis also is linked with increased hospitalizations and deaths from cardiovascular disease, and it is connected with more asthma attacks and other breathing problems. More intense wildfires spew dangerous smoke into the air, as documented in the western US this year. And hotter days make more smog, which the American Lung Association describes as acting “like a sunburn on your lungs which may trigger an asthma attack”. Children under the age of five experience the majority of the health burden from climate change, according to Salas’ report. Samantha Ahdoot, a pediatrician in Alexandria, Virginia, treated an 11-year-old and a 13-year-old who moved from Florida after a hurricane destroyed their community and their medical records at their doctor’s office. One needed surgery for a heart condition and had to start from scratch with a new cardiologist. Both had attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) that was harder to treat amid the major life disruption and without records on adjustments to medication dosages. Ahdoot, who also founded the group Virginia Clinicians for Climate Action, said she has seen an influx of families moving because of weather disasters. Much hotter days make it harder to stay hydrated. They are linked with electrolyte imbalances, kidney stones and kidney failure. Patients who need dialysis as their kidneys fail can have trouble getting treatment during extreme weather events. Higher temperatures and the depletion of the ozone layer increase the risk of skin cancer. The same refrigerants and gases that damage the ozone layer contribute to climate change. Heat is linked with higher risks for salmonella and campylobacter outbreaks. Extreme rains can contaminate drinking water. Harmful algae blooms that thrive in higher temperatures can cause gastrointestinal problems, too. Changing temperature and rainfall patterns allow some insects spread farther and transmit malaria, dengue, Lyme disease and West Nile virus. Waterborne cholera and cryptosporidiosis increase with drought and flooding. The American Psychological Association created a 69-page guide on how climate change can induce stress, depression and anxiety. The group says “the connections with mental health are often not part” of the climate-health discussion. People exposed to or displaced by extreme weather or violent conflict are at higher risk for mental health challenges. Extreme heat can also make some mental illnesses worse. The University of Maryland’s Howard Center for Investigative Journalism found emergency calls relating to psychiatric conditions increased about 40% in Baltimore in summer 2018, when the heat index surged above 103F, as reported on NPR. And some psychotropic medications interfere with the body’s ability to regulate temperature – increasing vulnerability to heat. Fossil fuel pollution can increase the risk of stroke. Coal combustion also produces mercury – a neurotoxin for fetuses. Diseases spread by mosquitoes and ticks increase the chance of neurological problems. Extreme heat is also linked with cerebrovascular disease, a disorder that affects blood supply to the brain. Carbon dioxide emissions are lowering the nutritional density of food crops, reducing plant levels of protein, zinc and iron and leading to more nutritional deficiencies. Food supplies are also disrupted by drought, societal instability and inequity linked with climate change. Extreme weather events, including hurricanes, floods and wildfires, often cause physical injuries. Doctors see minor fractures, crush injuries and smoke inhalation. Extreme heat is also linked with aggression and violence, and the climate crisis globally is connected with violent conflict and forced migration."
"In September 2007, as credit was “crunched” and the financial crisis began to unfold, a group of economists and environmentalists, including the future Green party MP Caroline Lucas, met regularly in my small London flat. Supping on comfort food and wine, we argued furiously while drafting a plan we hoped would transform the economy and protect the ecosystem. We called it the Green New Deal. Little did we know that the ideas we seeded then would be adopted by a shooting star of the Democratic party, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, as part of her bid for a New York congressional seat in 2018.  Fast forward to 2019 and the Green New Deal is now at the centre of the 2020 US presidential campaign. Bernie Sanders last week declared the climate crisis a national emergency and launched his version of the deal – a $16.3 trillion plan that includes massive investment in renewable energy, green infrastructure for climate resilience and money for research.  Sanders is vague about his financing plans. He suggests that cuts in military spending could generate cash, but also proposes a rise in tax for big corporations. These are welcome proposals, but our group has one quibble. Big transformational projects are not financed from taxation. Kennedy’s moonshot wasn’t, nor is Britain’s HS2 rail project. Suggesting that the deal can be paid for through tax (even from big corporations) will rightly raise suspicions. Ordinary taxpayers will assume – as they did during the US debate about inheritance tax (reframed by the right as “death taxes”) – that the burden of such a carbon levy will fall instead on their shoulders. So where should the money come from? There are fundamentally only two sources of financing. The first is borrowing (credit). This is achieved by applying for a loan, or issuing a bond. The second is existing savings. To raise the money for a green deal, governments would have to draw on their equivalent of a giant credit card, but would also be able to take advantage of investment by savers. Thankfully, the creation of millions of jobs will generate the income and tax revenues needed to repay any borrowing. As Sanders argues, the whole thing will pay for itself. First, the borrowing: credit issued by a commercial bank, as we all know from spending on our credit cards, does not draw on our existing deposits or savings. Instead it is a promise to pay in the future. OECD governments (backed by millions of taxpayers) are the most trusted borrowers, which is why their promises (bonds) are in such demand. Savings, by contrast, already exist – in bank deposits and savings accounts. When a government borrows, as it has for financing HS2, that leads to investment and the creation of paid jobs in public and private sectors, and to private sector profits. Both employment income and profits generate tax revenues. Tax revenues are, therefore, a consequence of spending or investment – and can be used to pay back the borrowing. They need not be used directly to finance that investment. During the second world war commercial banks provided credit to the government in the form of Treasury deposit receipts. They could do so again. But the government also has its own bank, the Bank of England, which issues credit, too (currently known as quantitative easing, or QE), and could use this to purchase government bonds. To appeal to savers, the government could issue bonds to be repaid over different time periods – short, medium or long-term. These would attract pension funds and insurance companies, but also different kinds of individual savers. They would be able to invest their money in transforming the economy away from fossil fuels, while receiving a regular income in the form of interest. For this to happen, governments would have to be “in the driving seat” when it comes to issuing bonds. Currently they’re more passive – relying almost entirely on demand from private capital markets. As you can see, this system of financing is entirely doable. However, to succeed, our plan demands a decisive rupture from the neoliberal consensus of pairing expansionary monetary policy (QE) with contractionary fiscal policy (austerity). The original Green New Deal group continues to meet, to argue, to indulge in good food and wine, and to plot the defeat of that consensus. Later this week, Caroline Lucas, together with Clive Lewis MP, will launch a bill embracing key principles of the plan. From small beginnings, a great change could soon be on its way. • Ann Pettifor is the author of The Case for the Green New Deal, published by Verso "
"The Australian Capital Territory plans to phase out natural gas, electrify its bus fleets and public school buildings, and introduce incentives for drivers who buy electric cars. The ACT government announced its climate strategy for 2019-25 on Monday, with several nation-first policies it said would further the territory’s “global leading climate efforts”.  The ACT chief minister, Andrew Barr, said the plan had significant environmental objectives as the territory moved to cut emissions by 50-60% on 1990 levels by 2025, and transition to net zero emissions by 2045. But he said the territory also wanted to make sure the transition was “a just one for our community” that capitalised on the economic development opportunities of shifting to a carbon-neutral economy. “At a high level I think it demonstrates national leadership, international leadership in certain areas, and provides us with a very clear, considered pathway forward as we respond to the challenges of climate change,” Barr said. Barr said there was public appetite for change and “a lot of distress at the lack of action at a national level” as the impacts of the climate crisis became more visible. “Rightly there is a focus on state and territory and local governments to show some leadership here and to work with their local communities, and that’s what we’re doing,” he said. The government said a number of its proposals were firsts for an Australian jurisdiction. They include the development of a plan to achieve net zero emissions from gas by 2045, applying a social cost of carbon in government procurement and capital works, and meeting the ACT’s emissions reduction targets without the purchase of offsets. Under the plan, all new ACT public schools and government buildings would be 100% powered by renewable electricity and the territory’s bus fleet will be entirely electric by 2040. The ACT is due to achieve its target of 100% renewable-generated electricity on 1 October. The next wave of policy is focused on transport and gas because those sectors make up 61% and 22% of the territory’s emissions respectively. But the government acknowledged that drastically reducing emissions from those sectors would require behavioural change from the community. In the case of transport, 95% of the territory’s emissions come from privately owned vehicles. The new strategy says the uptake of electric vehicles will naturally increase as they move closer to cost parity with petrol and diesel in coming years, but also notes it will require incentives for drivers to speed up that transition. The government said it would also have to invest more in infrastructure that will “Copenhagenise” the city by encouraging walking and cycling. The ACT’s climate change and sustainability minister, Shane Rattenbury, said the plan was aimed at preparing the national capital for “a hotter and drier future”. In January the ACT recorded four consecutive days above 40C – a record for the capital – and its mean maximum was a record breaking 34.5C (6.3C above average). The new climate strategy includes a 30% tree canopy target to reduce the impacts of urban heat and a 30% surface permeability target – that is, surfaces made from materials that retain more moisture. It also proposes assistance for low-income residents and retraining of workers in affected industries. “We will need to work with the community,” Rattenbury said. But he said it was “imperative we make these changes” because without action “people’s lives will change for the worse whether they like it or not”. "
"This story originally appeared in the Nation. It is republished here as part of the Guardian’s partnership with Covering Climate Now, a global collaboration of more than 250 news outlets to strengthen coverage of the climate story. As world leaders converge on New York City for the United Nations climate action Summit on 23 September, they enter what may be the most consequential week in climate politics since Donald Trump’s surprise election as president of the United States in 2016. Trump, of course, announced soon after taking office that he was withdrawing the US from the Paris agreement, the landmark treaty signed at the last big UN climate summit in 2015. António Guterres, the UN secretary general, convened this week’s summit precisely because the US and most other countries remain far from honoring their Paris pledges to reduce heat-trapping emissions enough to prevent catastrophic climate disruption. The events of the coming days – including a global climate strike on 20 September by the activists whose protests in the past year have pushed the term “climate emergency” into news reports around the world – may help answer a question that has loomed over humanity since Trump’s election: can the rest of the world save itself from climate breakdown if the richest, most powerful nation on earth is pulling in the opposite direction? Adopted in December 2015, the Paris agreement stands as the strongest achievement of climate diplomacy since governments first debated the issue at the UN Earth Summit in 1992. In a shock to climate insiders, the agreement not only committed signatory governments to limit temperature rise to the relatively less dangerous level of 2C. It also obliged governments to keep temperature rise “well below” 2C and, in a major victory for the most vulnerable countries, to strive for 1.5C. That half-degree may not sound like much, but it spells the difference between life and death for low-lying coastal nations such as Bangladesh and island states such as the Maldives – two of many places that, science says, would literally disappear beneath the waves with more than 1.5C of warming. The announced US withdrawal from the Paris agreement was big news but also widely misunderstood news. Despite Trump’s bluster, the US withdrawal still has not happened. Precisely to guard against such capriciousness, the negotiators in Paris stipulated that every signatory was legally bound to remain in the agreement until four years after the treaty took effect, which would only happen after countries responsible for 55% of global greenhouse gas emissions ratified it. Thus, the Paris agreement did not take effect until 4 November 2016. That means the US cannot leave until 4 November 2020 – which, not by accident, is one day after the US 2020 presidential election. If Trump loses that election, his successor almost certainly would move to keep the US in the Paris agreement. “Don’t bring a speech, bring a plan!” For months now, that’s what Guterres has been telling heads of state and government. Instead of the endless blah-blah-blah heard at most UN meetings, Guterres wants this summit to be more like “show-and-tell”, a meeting where governments share concrete and replicable examples of how they are cutting emissions and boosting resilience to the climate impacts already unfolding. As such, the summit aims to address a glaring deficiency of the Paris agreement. In part, because the agreement made emissions cuts voluntary, global emissions have continued to increase since 2015. On current trends, the earth is heading towards 3-5C of temperature rise – enough, scientists warn, to destroy civilization as we know it. “The secretary general has very clearly demanded that all participants identify very concrete measures that can be implemented immediately,” Luis Alfonso de Alba, Guterres’s special envoy for the summit, said in an interview with Covering Climate Now, a collaboration of 250 news outlets around the world to strengthen coverage of the climate story. “What we need is for all actors to put in practice their commitments [and to] recognize that whatever they had in mind before, they need to do much more – because climate change is running faster than we are, the situation is much more serious than we thought.” Asked how the world can meet the “well below 2C” target when the current US government is doing all it can to increase global warming, Alba, a career diplomat from Mexico, steered clear of criticizing the Trump administration. “We need higher political will not only in one country but in a number of them,” he said, before adding: “We’re very much impressed by what states, cities and businesses are doing in the US to move into renewables … We are quite confident that the US will contribute to solutions, even if the decision to withdraw by the current administration is maintained.” Indeed, then governor Jerry Brown announced at a climate summit last September that he signed an executive order committing California, the world’s fifth-biggest economy, to achieve zero carbon emissions by 2045. This summer, New York state, whose economic output is roughly equivalent to Russia’s, passed a law requiring the state to achieve 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040. The Under2 Coalition, a group of more than 220 state and local governments around the world representing 43% of the global economy, is likewise committed to keeping temperature rise well below 2C. The climb remains very steep, however. Scientists with the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change declared last October in their landmark Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5C that humanity had to slash emissions by 45% by 2030, on the way to net-zero by 2050, to hit the 1.5C target. Failure to do so would condemn many millions of people, particularly in poor and vulnerable countries, to destitution and death and make irreversible global warming more likely. Such dramatic emissions reductions, the scientists added, would require the transformation of the global energy, agricultural, transportation and other sectors at a speed and scale without precedent in human history. China, the other climate superpower along with the US, will therefore have to do better as well. China won plaudits in the lead-up to the Paris summit in 2015 by closing many of its coal-fired power plants. But coal burning in China has recently crept back up, and Beijing has also financed construction of coal plants in other countries, particularly in support of its massive “Belt and Road” initiative to construct ports, railways and other infrastructure across Asia to the Middle East, Africa and Europe. Alba commends China for promising to go beyond the emissions reductions it pledged in Paris, but he adds, “We are asking them to do much more and in particular to green the Belt and Road initiative. It’s quite important because of the scale of that initiative that they do not support coal plants but instead renewable energy.” When Guterres gavels the summit’s plenary session to order next Monday, the 12-year deadline outlined by the IPCC scientists will have shrunk closer to 11. Meanwhile, the burning of the Amazon, Hurricane Dorian’s devastation of the Bahamas, this summer’s heatwaves across much of the northern hemisphere, and countless less-heralded disasters illustrate that climate disruption is no longer a worrisome future specter but a punishing current reality. Alba nevertheless draws hope from the heightened public concern and activism against the climate threat. “Compared to 10 years ago, the level of public involvement is very different,” Alba said, “and that’s to a large extent because the news media is talking about it more and young activists are demanding action.” In the United States, activists with the Sunrise Movement and other groups have protested against Democratic and Republican politicians alike and demanded that the government implement a Green New Deal. Championed by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive congresswoman from New York, and modeled on the New Deal jobs and investment programs President Franklin Roosevelt implemented to pull the US out of the Great Depression in the 1930s, the Green New Deal calls for the government to kickstart the transformations of energy and other sectors the IPCC says are needed. Such a massive investment program will also, the activists say, create millions of jobs and reduce economic inequality. Central to the plan is “climate justice”, the notion that poor and non-white individuals and communities have suffered worst from climate change and therefore should get precedence for the jobs and opportunities flowing from a Green New Deal. Activist pressure has helped make the Green New Deal the de facto position of the Democratic party in the US, while also spreading the idea overseas. Each of the leading Democratic candidates in the race to replace Trump has endorsed one version or another of a Green New Deal. Bernie Sanders proposes a particularly robust program that will, he promises, “end unemployment” by creating 20m new jobs and also help developing nations dump fossil fuels in favor of renewables. Guterres has gone out of his way to boost the visibility of the climate youth, most notably Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teenager who is the best-known face of the climate movement. Thunberg’s “School Strike For Climate”, begun a year ago in her home town of Stockholm, spread like wildfire around the world, inspiring hundreds of thousands of students to skip classes and take to the streets to demand that governments, in Thunberg’s words, “act like the house is on fire – because it is”. Guterres has invited Thunberg to keynote a special one-day youth climate summit on 21 September and also to address world leaders at the plenary session on 23 September. Alba recognizes that the public is sometimes skeptical of UN conferences, and he acknowledges that the UN “does not have the means to enforce” the commitments made by governments in the Paris agreement. Instead, he puts his faith, again, in the ability of public pressure to compel governments to do the right thing. “As in many other parts of international law,” he says, “the enforcement rests in the follow-up and the ‘name and shame’ role of civil society – to expose that a country is not complying with what they’ve committed to. The media plays an important role there, and so do activists.” Meanwhile, Alba’s own teenage son has given him advice on how to make the case for action: don’t talk so much about the future that youth will inherit but rather about the climate disasters happening now. “He had a point,” says Alba. “This is an emergency we need to deal with today, not tomorrow. Talking about 2030 and 2050 is important because science gives us those dates for achieving certain objectives, but there’s the danger that it tells people that we have time to make these changes. And that is a mistake.” This article was amended on 20 September 2019 after originally reporting that EPA administrator Andrew Wheeler would lead the US delegation to the UN Climate Action Summit. In fact, the delegation will be led by Marcia Bernicat, the principal deputy assistant secretary of state in the state department."

Share this...FacebookTwitterI noticed Google today had a graphic up, as it often does, that you can click on. What’s the occasion today? Oh! It’s Earth Day!
Earth Day was started by Gaylord Nelson, the Democratic senator from Wisconsin. It was the single largest national demonstration in American history. 20 million Americans participated in the first Earth Day on April 22, 1970.
What did Earth day preach back in 1970? Here are some examples from washingtonpolicy.org:
• By 1995, “…somewhere between 75 and 85 percent of all the species of living animals will be extinct.” Sen. Gaylord Nelson, quoting Dr. S. Dillon Ripley, Look magazine, April 1970.
• Because of increased dust, cloud cover and water vapor “…the planet will cool, the water vapor will fall and freeze, and a new Ice Age will be born,” Newsweek magazine, January 26, 1970.
• The world will be “…eleven degrees colder in the year 2000. This is about twice what it would take to put us into an ice age,” Kenneth Watt, speaking at Swarthmore University, April 19, 1970.
• “We are in an environmental crisis which threatens the survival of this nation, and of the world as a suitable place of human habitation,” biologist Barry Commoner, University of Washington, writing in the journal Environment, April 1970.

• “By 1985, air pollution will have reduced the amount of sunlight reaching earth by one half…” Life magazine, January 1970.
• Paul Ehrlich predicted that in 1973, 200,000 Americans would die from air pollution, and that by 1980 the life expectancy of Americans would be 42 years.
• “It is already too late to avoid mass starvation,” wrote Earth Day organizer Denis Hayes, The Living Wilderness, Spring 1970.
• “By the year 2000…the entire world, with the exception of Western Europe, North America and Australia, will be in famine,” Peter Gunter, North Texas State University, The Living Wilderness, Spring 1970.
Sound familiar? Of course these prophets of doom were wrong – spectacularly wrong. Today things are much better by almost every measure. Four decades later the apocalypse has been pushed back 50 or 100 years, and this time it will be caused by manmade global warming.  This time, they insist, they are certainly right. You see, now they’ve got computer models!
The circus continues.

"Brazil’s environment minister, Ricardo Salles, will meet a rightwing US advocacy group that denies climate change, just four days before the United Nations Climate Action Summit. Salles will meet representatives from the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) at the headquarters of the US Environmental Protection Agency on 19 September, Brazil’s Folha de S Paulo newspaper revealed.  The meeting was immediately condemned by environmentalists, who said it showed that the government of the far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, had no commitment to fighting the climate crisis. News of the meeting emerged a day after Brazil’s foreign minister questioned the scientific proof for global warming in a convoluted speech in Washington. Addressing the Heritage Foundation, Ernesto Araújo said “there is no climate catastrophe” and described efforts to fight climate change as a plot to destroy national sovereignty. Brazil is doubling down on its efforts to convince the world the Amazon is in safe hands, despite soaring deforestation and a huge spike in seasonal fires that provoked an international crisis. Bolsonaro is due to address the UN general assembly on 24 September. “This is a government that makes efforts to deny the problems, not to face them,” said Marcio Astrini, director of public policy at Greenpeace Brasil. A spokesman for Salles said he could not confirm nor deny the meeting and a spokeswoman for the Competitive Enterprise Institute did not respond to requests for comment. The CEI’s director for energy and environment, Myron Ebell, led Donald Trump’s transition team at the Environmental Protection Agency. His biography quotes Business Insider, which said: “Myron Ebell may be enemy #1 to the current climate change community.” “Climate change does not endanger the survival of civilization or the habitability of the planet. So-called climate solutions are bureaucratic power grabs and corporate welfare schemes with no detectable climate-related benefits,” read a June article on the CEI site. Before Salles took office in December, a São Paulo judge found he had altered plans for an environmentally protected area in order to favour businesses while state environment secretary. Salles denied the accusations and is appealing against the ruling. In July he said that Brazil was not far from “zero illegal deforestation”. Satellite date from Brazil’s Space Research Institute calculated a 278% increase in deforestation in July. The institute’s director was fired after Bolsonaro described the data as “lies”. Its data showed more than 30,000 fires in the Amazon in August, the highest since 2010. In a recent interview with the far-right Canadian YouTuber Stefan Molyneux, Salles hailed Brazil’s conservation record. The minister argued that a primary cause of deforestation was the lack of proper documentation for Amazon land, despite widespread evidence that much degradation takes place in protected areas and indigenous reserves and has been partly fuelled by Bolsonaro’s attacks on environment agencies and protection."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman professor, co-founder of modern environmental movement, says climate science is exaggerated, filled with fairy tales and believes the Paris Accord is “already dead”. 
In an interview with publicist Roland Tichy, Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt – one of the founders of Germany’s modern environmental movement – said we have in fact three generations time to revamp the world’s energy supply system to one that is cleaner and sustainable.
He rejects the Fridays For Future claim that there are only 12 years left.

Climate catastrophe not taking place
In the interview, moderator Tichy reminded that civilization began 7000 years ago, a time when it was “3°C warmer than today”, and Vahrenholt responded saying he expects civilization to continue for another seven thousand years. There was no tipping point back then, why would there be one today? “Warmth and moisture have always been good for mankind,” said Vahrenholt. “Cold has been man’s worst enemy.”
Plenty of time to move rationally
The German professor also said that the claimed catastrophe “is not taking place” and that policymakers are trying to use “panic and fear to get the people to act.”  Much of the warming measured since 1850 is the result of natural warming taking place due to the end of the Little Ice Age, he explained.
Germany’s green fantasy

Later the German professor of chemistry calls the belief that wind and sun are able replace fossil fuels “fantasizing” and that Germany, with its 2.3% share of global CO2 emissions, can rescue the global climate “a fairy tale”.
Meanwhile, the warming of the last 150 years is in large part caused by natural cycles. “In the 20th century the sun was more active than at any time over the past 2000 years.”
Economically, Vahrenholt believes that a frenzied rush to renewables will lead to “horrible” economic consequences from European industrialization.
On the topic of a scientific consensus, the German professor says this is a claim made by the IPCC, which run by the UN with an agenda behind it.
Electric cars a “crackpot idea”
Vahrenholt also believes electric cars powered by batteries is not a feasible technology, and that other experts quietly call it “a crackpot idea”, and don’t speak up for fear of losing research funding. The vast majority of funding comes from the German government.
“Paris Accord already dead”
The professor of chemistry, co-author of a recent bestseller, also describes Germany as a country in denial when it comes to the broader global debate taking place on climate science, and declared the Paris Accord as being “already dead”.
“The Accord is already dead. Putin says it’s nonsense. […] The Americans are out. The Chinese don’t have to do anything. It’s all concentrated on a handful of European countries. The European Commission in massively on it. And I predict that they will reach the targets only if they destroy the European industries,” said Vahrenholt.
He characterizes Europe’s recent push for even stricter emissions reduction targets to madness akin to Soviet central planning that is doomed to fail spectacularly.

"From weakening vehicle emissions to blocking warnings about how coastal parks could flood or the impact on the Arctic, the Trump administration is accused of muzzling climate science. Here six whistleblowers and former government scientists describe being sidelined by the administration – and why they won’t be quiet. What did the work involve? “I was an engineer at the EPA, working for 40 years in a very technical job. In 2009, after the election of Barack Obama, the EPA started working on greenhouse gas standards for vehicles for the first time. It felt like we were making history. “There was a team of around 25 people producing thousands of pages of analysis for the standards. We knew it would be controversial but it was a very big deal, the first critical steps to address the climate crisis.” What changed under the Trump administration? “Once Trump was elected it became pretty clear that things would change. The president came out to Michigan in March 2017 and gave a speech where he said he’d look at the standards, that they hurt economic activity and jobs. That was an obvious sign, really. “In August 2018 the administration proposed an eight-year freeze of the greenhouse gas standards. It was unbelievable, really – for the first time in the history of the EPA the political leadership decided to change pollution standards that were doing well without allowing the career staff and experts to play any sort of role. We were completely locked out. “There was no scientific or technical rationale to rolling back the standards, the analysis they used was the most biased thing I’ve ever seen. They cooked the books and changed every assumption they could to get the answer they wanted. It was so bad that some EPA career staff asked their bosses to take the EPA name off it all.” How do you feel about your experience? “It broke my heart. I’d had this wonderful career, playing a small role in making the world a better place. Then we had a political leadership making decisions on ideology, denying science, basically being climate deniers. It felt horrible. “I was 62 years old and there were a few family things going on, but the Trump administration made a difficult decision to retire much easier. I felt I could do more good on the outside, educating the public on what’s going on. By the time I left, the morale was the lowest I’d seen in 40 years. Our work had become irrelevant.” Asked by the Guardian on Monday about the concerns outlined by four former EPA scientists, the EPA spokesman Michael Abboud said in a statement: “The EPA under President Trump has strived to create an agency that is responsive to the American people.” The statement said this included “proposing the Safe (Safer Affordable Fuel Efficient) rule that will save lives and produce savings for American consumers, working on the first major update to the lead and copper rule in nearly three decades”. It added the agency was also “on track to become the first administration to complete an ozone NAAQS (National Ambient Air Quality Standards) in the five-year review cycle envisioned by Congress”, and had deleted 22 sites from the national priorities list of those eligible for Superfund cleanup, the most since the financial year 2005. What did the work involve? “I was studying how climate change will affect 118 coastal parks in the US for the National Park Service. I started this work in July 2013, it was my baby.” What changed under the Trump administration? “My study went through peer review and was ready to be released but I was told by the NPS a few days after Donald Trump’s inauguration that they were ‘waiting for messaging’ first. I thought that was no big deal but then nothing happened and I started calling up every few weeks to say, ‘We’ve got to get this out, it’s getting stale.’ “The excuses varied but became ever more vague, such as ‘we are ever so busy’ or that it would worry people during hurricane season because it mentions storm surge in coastal areas. A superior said they wanted to keep a low profile on climate change for four or maybe eight years while Trump was around, which really upset me because we don’t have four to eight years to do nothing. I felt I was being silenced. “I went on maternity leave around Christmas 2017 and the report still hadn’t been released. I got an email from a colleague saying, ‘Congrats on the baby, by the way you should know they are editing your report.’ “We had a conference call and it became clear that any mention of human-caused climate change had been taken out. I was asked how I would feel if they didn’t release the report at all, which felt like a threat. I stood my ground and was told ‘they aren’t going to be happy about this from above.’ It was never clear who ‘they’ were – perhaps Trump himself or Ryan Zinke [the then secretary of the interior]. “I then had a meeting with a senior NPS official who came out from Washington DC. The other report co-authors were there, too. That’s when it all unravelled, it became incredibly hostile. I was told not to attribute changes in public lands to human actions. “I felt like we worked for the American people and I didn’t want to lie to them. But a superior said that we in fact work for the executive branch of which the president is the head. The president is the boss and we are going to put our heads down and put out the line of the administration. “A journalist did a freedom of information request and saw all the emails of us fighting over this and asked me for a statement. I ended up going on the record because I thought it was a very important issue. I was aghast I was being asked to lie. These people were violating the mission of the NPS. “After I came back from maternity leave I was demoted to be an intern on $25,000 a year. And then in February this year they said there was no money left at all and that I would have to leave. It was devastating. I offered to work for free as a volunteer but was turned down, which shows that it wasn’t a money issue really. I packed up my office and I was gone. I filed a whistleblower complaint in July.” How do you feel about your experience? “I have faced retribution, I was threatened and placed in a hostile work environment. It’s clear in some agencies there’s a culture of fear where scientists are being intimidated. When I wrote this report, politics was the last thing on my mind, I was thinking about climate change and these coastal parks. “It’s very frustrating, it’s not where I pictured where my career would be at this time in my life. I don’t even know if I have a career any more. What’s left is in tatters.” Response from the National Park Service A statement from the NPS said it was “confident in the quality and accuracy of the science behind the sea level rise and storm surge projections presented in the report” and staff involved showed “utmost professionalism”. It added: “The report underwent several rounds of internal and external scientific peer review to ensure that it is most helpful and relevant to the intended audience of park managers and planners…” The NPS said understanding how climate change “affects park resources and infrastructure is part of our core responsibility to protect parks”. What did the work involve? “The Clean Air Science Advisory Committee (Casac) is required to inform the EPA administrator over air quality standards, if they are sufficient to protect public health or not [under the Clean Air Act]. The EPA’s Science Advisory Board is a much larger committee that takes on all sorts of things – clean water rules, vehicle greenhouse gas standards, rules about transparency and so on.” What changed under the Trump administration? “Initially there was a neglectful relationship with the new Trump administration; they seemed uninterested and the amount of scientific advisory board work dropped off. Then, from October 2018, there were the first signs of the ideological assault on scientific advice at the EPA. “Scott Pruitt [then administrator of the EPA] wrote a memo that said that researchers that have received grants from the EPA aren’t allowed to serve on panels because of a perceived conflict of interest. But there was no prohibition on industry people serving and the number of them on the panels has increased. It’s been a way to kick qualified people off the boards and get cronies in their place. “There was a complete turnover of Casac and it shows in meetings. They now bumble through things because they don’t understand the process and the Clean Air Act. Political appointees are interfering with the selection of candidates, essentially picking those sympathetic to the agenda of the administration, even if they have fringe views like climate change isn’t happening, that kind of stuff. “I was on a panel looking at the risks posed by particulate matter. We had a lot more work to do but we were disbanded four days before the EPA released an assessment that we would’ve reviewed. The timing was mind-boggling. I found out by seeing a press release on the EPA website, which was followed by an email saying our services were no longer needed. “I was also a nominee for a panel on ozone but then they said they wouldn’t go ahead with that. It was a little frustrating for me personally, but it’s more of a loss to the American public. The EPA has always been thought of as a science-based agency; what we see now is no basic respect for science.” How do you feel about your experience? “There’s not even lip service to the science. Science can’t be controlled like ideological spin, so the administration is afraid of that. They don’t want scientists and their evidence-based opinions – they’d rather have cronies trot out the same tired talking points on fringe scientific views.” What did the work involve? “I was at [the department of the] interior for nearly seven years. I started on 3 January 2011 – I know the exact date because of how excited and inspired I was at the thought of serving in the federal government. I was hired as a senior executive to run the office of policy analysis, which sits in the office of the secretary. “One of the main areas of focus was addressing the impacts of climate change in the Arctic, which is warming two to three times faster than the rest of the planet. Entire Alaska native villages are threatened by rapid coastal erosion and storms because they no longer have a sea ice curtain to protect them from fierce Arctic storms in the fall and early winter, and the ground beneath their feet is falling away as the permafrost thaws.” What changed under the Trump administration? “The new Trump team was very thin and most of them knew very little about the agency mission – they were mostly oil and gas lobbyists and some campaign workers. Whatever they were talking about up on the secretary’s hallway, it sure wasn’t being shared with the career staff at the agency. So you basically had 70,000 employees scratching their heads and getting back to doing their jobs while a couple dozen political appointees tried to get their act together to lead them. It was surreal. “But this neglect soon turned into scorn, characterized by comments from the new secretary, Ryan Zinke, that the staff were disloyal. Morale began to quickly plummet as the political ranks showed not only ignorance of, but disdain for the wide-ranging agency mission. Here you had tens of thousands of people working hard in public service and being told what they do is not important. “The National Park Service and Fish and Wildlife Service had it worst because they didn’t have anything to do with oil and gas or mining permitting process, and the lobbyists in charge had no interest in wildlife, conservation or biodiversity. “But every agency suffered, because the mantra of the administration was to drain the swamp – and it quickly became clear that the swamp was not the high-paid lobbyists, but the rank-and-file government professionals who serve the country. “On a Thursday night in June, just a week after I’d been in New York to speak at the United Nations about climate change adaptation issues, I received an email that said I was being moved to a new position. “It was quickly obvious that this was a retaliatory action, as I was moved away from any climate change work to the office that collects royalty income from oil, gas and mining companies – an auditing position for which I had zero expertise. The email explained that because I had economists on my policy staff that I must clearly know about numbers, so I’d be good in an auditing office. “I’d heard that they were looking for a job that I would not want, in hopes that I would quit. It’s not unusual for senior executives to be reassigned, it’s part of the job, but reassignment can’t be used to get people to quit – and Secretary Zinke testified to Congress a week later that he was using reassignments, among other methods, to trim the workforce. Sadly, I was only one of dozens of executives who were reassigned that night, many of us for clearly retaliatory reasons. “I found legal counsel and eventually filed a whistleblower complaint and went public with an op-ed in the Washington Post. I wasn’t worried too much about my job at that point, I was worried about the work I’d been doing on behalf of Alaska Natives, and it was clear they had no intention of continuing to work to help those frontline communities. “A couple months later I decided that they’d already taken my job, but there was no way I’d let them take my voice, so I resigned and continued to speak publicly about these abuses and the implications for American health and safety.” How do you feel about your experience? “The Trump administration is threatened by evidence, by science and by expertise. These things interfere with their ability to hobble government agencies and reduce oversight. It’s mind-boggling and a profound threat to democracy but it also increases risks to American health and safety. Every American should be concerned, regardless of political stripe.” A Department of the Interior spokesperson said in a statement to the Guardian: “The department works to ensure that the scientific activities that it carries out use the best science and are the result of robust and independent processes.” The department said it was required by law to research and publish reports regarding the changing conditions of the climate and has a “rich and longstanding culture of scientific integrity that prevails independently of individual administrations”. What did the work involve? “I was at the EPA for 33 years, starting in 1984. I worked in the water program and on Superfund cleanups, working on the criteria for drinkable water.” What changed under the Trump administration? “I left in August 2017 and made a very public retirement statement about how bad this administration is and its assault on science. It went viral and since then I spend 20 to 30 hours a week helping the press and Congress understand the impact of what the Trump administration is doing. “We’ve never seen anything like this complete abandonment of science, solely to maximize corporate profits. Everything changed after the election. The climate change section of the EPA website came down and Scott Pruitt came in and brought in a bunch of political appointees who didn’t need Senate confirmation. “I was working on a chemical safety rule that was rewritten by Nancy Beck, someone from the American Chemistry Council [an industry lobby group] who Pruitt brought in. It basically repeated the talking points she used on the chemistry council. “Pruitt never spoke to any of the career staff before he made decisions on replacing rules. I worked on a rule that would require coal-fired power plants to treat toxic waste rather than simply dump it into leaky ponds. Pruitt met with Bob Murray [head of the coalmining firm Murray Energy Corporation] and decided to postpone the rule and the first we knew about it was when we were asked to check a draft press release about the rollback. “Scientists are really irrelevant at the EPA now, their input isn’t requested. They are simply directed by the political team to help fulfill the desires of political donors, no matter the cost to Americans. At the moment it’s just a logistical question of how fast they can go on this. They have something like 70 regulation repeals under way and because it will be hard to do this with legal challenges they want to undermine the underlying science.” What happened after you left? “Within a couple of days of me leaving an opposition research firm did a freedom of information request for all my emails and the EPA immediately handed them over. I found out they made a big effort to connect with all the rightwing media to trash me. They made up this lie that I was being paid more than a Congress member for every year of my retirement. It got really ugly, so I got off social media. “The same opposition group then tried to find out if any EPA employees donated to [Bernie] Sanders or [Elizabeth] Warren. It’s stunning to target federal employees like that. I’ve never seen that before.” What did the work involve? “I was brought in by the EPA to do climate change work for the office that oversees the Superfund site program, which are toxic areas that require a federal cleanup. “I was specifically working on the Superfund site program because President Obama had issued an executive order for any federal agencies that would put forward new federal dollars into infrastructure. Essentially, he wanted those agencies to incorporate climate change into flood risk for that infrastructure. “The model essentially looks at how much sea level rise is expected over the next 100 years. Plus what did the extreme floods look like in those areas? And I combine those two sets of data to create a model that is predictive of these future extreme floods that we’re seeing more of currently and are expected to see more of in the future.” What changed under the Trump administration? “I knew from President Trump, then candidate Trump’s campaign, how he felt about climate change, that I was likely on the chopping block because I was a postdoctoral fellow and my contract was sort of on a year-to-year basis. “And so after the transition occurred, I was there for a couple of weeks and then one day my boss came to my office and said: ‘I think you should probably start looking for another position.’” How do you feel about your experience? “It was a very difficult time for me, absolutely. I was extremely sad and depressed. I really liked the work that I was doing. I felt like I was doing research that was really going to have a significant impact. “I had worked really hard on it. To see something like that just get sort of tossed out the window was really disheartening to see. And the fact that they were just going to completely dismiss this climate change work altogether was also really disheartening. So, yeah. It was a very sad time for me. I will not lie. “There’s a ton of different scenarios that have occurred that show that this administration really does not care about progressing climate change or climate science, in general. “I mean, any time you see some sort of report come out of the agency that even mildly mentions climate change and maybe its impacts to national parks, or something to that extent, the administration tries to downplay human connection to climate change. They try to downplay the role of climate change and federal scientists’ work in press releases. “They try to downplay the role of climate change and research that they’re funding. So even in grants that the agencies are receiving, they’re now being vetted by political officials to essentially make sure that climate change is not mentioned in those proposals. It’s not a great time to be a climate change scientist in the federal government.” • This article was updated on Tuesday September 24 2019 to add a statement from the National Park Service.

"In this age of rapidly melting glaciers, terrifying megafires and ever more puissant hurricanes, of acidifying and rising oceans, it is hard to believe that any further prod to climate action is needed. But the reality is that we continue to live in a business-as-usual world. Our media is filled with enthusiastic announcements about new fossil fuel projects, or the unveiling of the latest fossil-fuelled supercar, as if there’s no relationship between such things and climate change. In Australia, the disconnect among our political leaders on the deadly nature of fossil fuels is particularly breathtaking. Prime minister Scott Morrison continues to sing the praises of coal, while members of the government call for subsidies for coal-fired power plants. A few days ago, the energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, urged that the nation’s old and polluting coal-fired power plants be allowed to run “at full tilt”. In the past, many of us have tolerated such pronouncements as the utterings of idiots – in the true, original Greek meaning of the word as one interested only in their own business. But the climate crisis has now grown so severe that the actions of the denialists have turned predatory: they are now an immediate threat to our children. Each year the situation becomes more critical. In 2018, global emissions of greenhouse gases rose by 1.7%, while the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere jumped by 3.5 parts per million – the largest ever observed increase. No climate report or warning, no political agreement nor technological innovation has altered the ever-upward trajectory of the pollution. This simple fact forces me to look back on my 20 years of climate activism as a colossal failure. Many climate scientists think we are already so far down the path of destruction that it is impossible to stabilise the global temperature at 1.5℃ above the pre-industrial average without yet to be developed drawdown technologies such as those that remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. On current trends, within a decade or so, stabilising at 2℃ will likewise be beyond our grasp. And on the other side of that threshold, nature’s positive feedback loops promise to fling us into a hostile world. By 2100 – just 80 years away – if our trajectory does not change, it is estimated that Earth will be 4℃ warmer than it was before we began burning fossil fuels. That future Earth may have enough resources to support far fewer people than the 7.6 billion it supports today. British scientist James Lovelock has predicted a future human population of just a billion people. Mass deaths are predicted to result from, among other causes, disease outbreaks, air pollution, malnutrition and starvation, heatwaves and suicide. My children, and those of many prominent polluters and climate denialists, will probably live to be part of that grim winnowing – a world that the Alan Joneses and Andrew Bolts of the world have laboured so hard to create. How should Australia’s parents deal with those who labour so joyously to create a world in which a large portion of humanity will perish? As I have become ever more furious at the polluters and denialists, I have come to understand they are threatening my children’s wellbeing as much as anyone who might seek to harm a child. Young people themselves are now mobilising against the danger. Increasingly they’re giving up on words and resorting to actions. Extinction Rebellion is the Anthropocene’s answer to the UK working class Chartists, the US Declaration of Independence and the defenders of the Eureka Stockade. Its declaration states: This is our darkest hour. Humanity finds itself embroiled in an event unprecedented in its history, one which, unless immediately addressed, will catapult us further into the destruction of all we hold dear […] The wilful complicity displayed by our government has shattered meaningful democracy and cast aside the common interest in favour of short-term gain and private profit […] We hereby declare the bonds of the social contract to be null and void. Not yet a year old, Extinction Rebellion has had an enormous impact. In April it shut down six critical locations in London, overwhelmed the police and justice system with 1,000 arrests and forced the British government to become the first nation ever to declare a climate emergency. So unstable is our current societal response that a single young woman, Greta Thunberg, has been able to spark a profoundly powerful global movement. Less than a year ago she went on a one-person school strike. Today school strikes for climate action are a global phenomenon. On Friday in Australia and elsewhere, school principals must decide whether they will allow their students to march in the global climate strike in an effort to save themselves from the climate predators in our midst, or force them to stay and study for a future that will not, on current trends, eventuate. I will be marching with the strikers in Melbourne, and I believe teachers should join their pupils on that day. After all, us older generation should be painfully aware that our efforts have not been enough to protect our children. The new and carefully planned rebellion by the young generation forces us earlier generations of climate activists to re-examine our strategy. Should we continue to use words to try to win the debate? Or should we become climate rebels? Changing the language around climate denialism will, I hope, sharpen our focus as we ponder what comes next.

"When we’re faced with threats of inundation, our reaction has traditionally been to build walls. Sea-level rises, storms and floods have been held back with solid barriers, seawalls and dykes. We have used walls to keep out people, too: the fact that this has failed throughout the ages has not stopped its recent revival in the United States. The climate crisis threatens global sea-level rises of well over half a metre if we fail to act, while tidal storm surges will reach many times that height. Fiercer and more frequent hurricanes will batter us, and millions of people who live in areas where crops have failed and wells run dry will be forced to flee their homes. But walls will not work with the climate crisis, even if the temptation to try to keep out the consequences, rather than dealing with the causes, is as strong as ever. The prospect of a “climate apartheid”, in which the rich insulate themselves from the impacts of the climate emergency while the poor and vulnerable are abandoned to their fate, is now real. According to the UN, climate-related disasters are already taking place at the rate of one a week, though only a few of them – such as Hurricane Dorian – get reported. Nowhere on Earth will be untouched, with the number of people facing water shortages set to leap from 3.6 billion today to 5 billion by 2050. At least 100 million people will be plunged into poverty in the next decade, and in the decades following that, rising sea levels will swamp coastal cities from Miami to Shanghai, wiping $1tn a year from the global economy. Agriculture will become increasingly difficult, with more people displaced as a result, searching for liveable conditions elsewhere. The Global Commission on Adaptation, headed by Bill Gates and Ban Ki-moon, warned this week that we have failed to plan adequately for a crisis that is now upon us. At a series of high-level meetings beginning in the next few weeks, and continuing into next year, world leaders and representatives of civil society and businesses will try to devise a better response. Among the questions they face will be how to set new targets, secure new funding and take more effective action to help the world not just prevent further warming, but to adapt to the impacts already being felt. Currently, 20 times more is being spent on reducing emissions than building resilience to the effects of rising temperatures and extreme weather, according to the Commission on Adaptation. That seems patently unbalanced, and neglecting adaptation is putting millions of people and their livelihoods in danger now, as well as storing up problems for the future. What’s more, money invested today will pay dividends in the near future. Spending less than $2tn by 2030 would result in more than $7tn saved in damage avoided and better economic growth. These sums sound huge, but are a fraction of the amount the world will spend on infrastructure in the next decade. And modern adaptation means more than building seawalls. Restoring natural features, such as mangrove swamps and wetlands, can do far more to protect coastal regions, as well as nurturing biodiversity and tourism. New technology will play a key role, as early warnings of extreme weather give people time to take shelter or protect their property. Engineering climate-ready infrastructure encompasses everything from porous pavements to urban trees to provide shade. What’s clear is that we need to adapt and build resilience now, because climate change is no longer a comfortably faraway problem. The predicted ravages have come sooner than expected: heatwaves over much of the northern hemisphere last year, floods and extreme weather in south-east Asia, Arctic ice melting at unprecedented levels this summer, and Hurricane Dorian, one of the strongest ever recorded. Worse still, some of these effects are likely themselves to increase temperatures further, in a series of feedback loops. The fires in the Amazon are destroying a vital “carbon sink”. Shrinking ice reveals darker water that absorbs more heat than highly reflective snow. Melting permafrost releases methane, a greenhouse gas many times more powerful than carbon dioxide. It is tempting, in the face of these events, to suggest that the game is up for trying to prevent climate change. The emissions reductions needed to stop it are so vast, and the changes to our way of life so total, that it may seem like all we can do is adapt to the consequences. The hastening prospect of a “climate apartheid” is morally revolting as well as politically alarming, and could lead to a kind of paralysis. The view that adapting to inevitable climate change should be our priority, over futile and ruinously expensive attempts to cut emissions, has been spread by those who want to continue to emit CO2, come what may. Fossil fuel companies saw adaptation, along with the idea that we could geo-engineer our way out of trouble, as a way to keep selling oil while paying lip service to the climate science. Now it is gaining traction among more respectable thinkers. Jonathan Franzen, the American novelist and nature lover, whipped up a storm when he suggested in the New Yorker that: “In the long run, it probably makes no difference how badly we overshoot 2C … Every billion dollars spent on high-speed trains … is a billion not banked for disaster preparedness, reparations to inundated countries, or future humanitarian relief.” It’s true that spending on adaptation is a good deal. It saves lives, and if used wisely could stave off the climate apartheid that experts foresee. But setting up adaptation versus emissions-cutting as an either-or choice is a grave mistake. Trying to adapt to the consequences of climate change while continuing to burn fossil fuels is like trying to mop up an overflowing sink while the taps are still running. As long as we continue to pump CO2 into the air, we are fuelling rises in temperature. We cannot outrun global heating any more than we can hold back the rising sea with dykes. And the fires blazing through the Amazon show that without action, things could easily get much worse. It can seem that in a world of finite resources, we need to make a binary decision about where to put our efforts. That is an illusion. The truth is that dealing with the climate emergency requires an across-the-board approach, for the simple reason that all of our resources – economic, physical, social – are at stake. If we do not throw everything we can at the problem, there won’t be much left anyway. In short, there is no wall high enough to keep out the consequences of inaction on emissions. • Fiona Harvey is an environmental journalist for the Guardian"

Share this...FacebookTwitterMichael Krüger of Readers Edition has a post on Germany’s first offshore Alpha Ventus windpark located in the North Sea, 30 miles from shore. Alpha Ventus has 12 5-MW wind generators. The electricity will have to cost 7 – 8  US-cents per kwh just to cover the construction costs. That’s about the price electricty is traded at on German commodity markets. But then you have to add the operating, maintenance and dismantling costs after the expected 20 years of operation. Also the added cost of expanding the electrical grid to accommodate the wind parks has to be added in.
In general windparks cannot compete against conventional power plants. That’s why the German government subsidizes windpark operators and guaratees them 19 US cents per kwh. The higher costs are of course borne by the consumers and industrial customers.
Contribution to “climate protection”. So what is the consumer getting for his money? Using IPCC data and forcings, Krüger calculated how much Alpha Ventus will help to reduce the global temperature:
Without the assumed positive feedbacks: 0.000001°C,  with the assumed positive feedbacks 0.000005°C.
That’s right – a whopping few millionths of a degree! Boy can you feel it already?
Protest: The offshore windparks also kill a considerable number of migratory birds, and so environmentalists are already protesting the planned construction of 11 additional offshore parks. Indeed a Folks’ Initiative protest against wind energy is taking place in Berlin this coming weekend: http://www.volksinitiativewindrad.de/.

"Why are you publishing this book now?I still feel that the way that we talk about climate change is too compartmentalised, too siloed from the other crises we face. A really strong theme running through the book is the links between it and the crisis of rising white supremacy, the various forms of nationalism and the fact that so many people are being forced from their homelands, and the war that is waged on our attention spans. These are intersecting and interconnecting crises and so the solutions have to be as well. The book collects essays from the last decade, have you changed your mind about anything?When I look back, I don’t think I placed enough emphasis on the challenge climate change poses to the left. It’s more obvious the way the climate crisis challenges a rightwing dominant worldview, and the cult of serious centrism that never wants to do anything big, that’s always looking to split the difference. But this is also a challenge to a left worldview that is essentially only interested in redistributing the spoils of extractivism [the process of extracting natural resources from the earth] and not reckoning with the limits of endless consumption.  What’s stopping the left doing this?In a North American context, it’s the greatest taboo of all to actually admit that there are going to be limits. You see that in the way Fox News has gone after the Green New Deal – they are coming after your hamburgers! It cuts to the heart of the American dream – every generation gets more than the last, there is always a new frontier to expand to, the whole idea of settler colonial nations like ours. When somebody comes along and says, actually, there are limits, we’ve got some tough decisions, we need to figure out how to manage what’s left, we’ve got to share equitably – it is a psychic attack. And so the response [on the left] has been to avoid, and say no, no, we’re not coming to take away your stuff, there are going to be all kinds of benefits. And there are going to be benefits: we’ll have more livable cities, we’ll have less polluted air, we’ll spend less time stuck in traffic, we can design happier, richer lives in so many ways. But we are going to have to contract on the endless, disposable consumption side. Hundreds of newsrooms around the world are banding together this week to commit their pages and air time to what may be the most consequential story of our time. As world leaders descend on New York for the UN Climate Action Summit on 23 September  – and millions of activists prepare for a global climate strike on 20 September – the media partnership Covering Climate Now is launching its first large-scale collaboration to increase climate coverage in the global media and focus public attention on this emergency. The Guardian is the lead partner in Covering Climate Now, which was founded earlier this year by the Columbia Journalism Review  and the Nation. The partnership currently includes 250 newsrooms representing 32 countries with a combined monthly reach of more than a billion people. The network represents every corner of the media including TV networks (CBS News, Al Jazeera), newspapers (El País, the Toronto Star), digital players (BuzzFeed, HuffPost, Vox), wire services (Getty Images, Bloomberg), magazines (Nature, Science), and dozens of podcasts, local publishers, radio and TV stations. You can learn more about the initiative here. Do you feel encouraged by talk of the Green New Deal?I feel a tremendous excitement and a sense of relief, that we are finally talking about solutions on the scale of the crisis we face. That we’re not talking about a little carbon tax or a cap and trade scheme as a silver bullet. We’re talking about transforming our economy. This system is failing the majority of people anyway, which is why we’re in this period of such profound political destabilisation – that is giving us the Trumps and the Brexits, and all of these strongman leaders – so why don’t we figure out how to change everything from bottom to top, and do it in a way that addresses all of these other crises at the same time? There is every chance we will miss the mark, but every fraction of a degree warming that we are able to hold off is a victory and every policy that we are able to win that makes our societies more humane, the more we will weather the inevitable shocks and storms to come without slipping into barbarism. Because what really terrifies me is what we are seeing at our borders in Europe and North America and Australia – I don’t think it’s coincidental that the settler colonial states and the countries that are the engines of that colonialism are at the forefront of this. We are seeing the beginnings of the era of climate barbarism. We saw it in Christchurch, we saw it in El Paso, where you have this marrying of white supremacist violence with vicious anti-immigrant racism. That is one of the most chilling sections of your book: I think that’s a link a lot of people haven’t made.This pattern has been clear for a while. White supremacy emerged not just because people felt like thinking up ideas that were going to get a lot of people killed but because it was useful to protect barbaric but highly profitable actions. The age of scientific racism begins alongside the transatlantic slave trade, it is a rationale for that brutality. If we are going to respond to climate change by fortressing our borders, then of course the theories that would justify that, that create these hierarchies of humanity, will come surging back. There have been signs of that for years, but it is getting harder to deny because you have killers who are screaming it from the rooftops. One criticism you hear about the environment movement is that it is dominated by white people. How do you address that?When you have a movement that is overwhelmingly representative of the most privileged sector of society then the approach is going to be much more fearful of change, because people who have a lot to lose tend to be more fearful of change, whereas people who have a lot to gain will tend to fight harder for it. That’s the big benefit of having an approach to climate change that links it to those so called bread and butter issues: how are we going to get better paid jobs, affordable housing, a way for people to take care of their families? I have had many conversations with environmentalists over the years where they seem really to believe that by linking fighting climate change with fighting poverty, or fighting for racial justice, it’s going to make the fight harder. We have to get out of this “my crisis is bigger than your crisis: first we save the planet and then we fight poverty and racism, and violence against women”. That doesn’t work. That alienates the people who would fight hardest for change. This debate has shifted a huge amount in the US because of the leadership of the climate justice movement and because it is congresswomen of colour who are championing the Green New Deal. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib come from communities that have gotten such a raw deal under the years of neoliberalism and longer, and are determined to represent, truly represent, the interests of those communities. They’re not afraid of deep change because their communities desperately need it. In the book, you write: “The hard truth is that the answer to the question ‘What can I, as an individual, do to stop climate change?’ is: nothing.” Do you still believe that?In terms of the carbon, the individual decisions that we make are not going to add up to anything like the kind of scale of change that we need. And I do believe that the fact that for so many people it’s so much more comfortable to talk about our own personal consumption, than to talk about systemic change, is a product of neoliberalism, that we have been trained to see ourselves as consumers first. To me that’s the benefit of bringing up these historical analogies, like the New Deal or the Marshall Plan – it brings our minds back to a time when we were able to think of change on that scale. Because we’ve been trained to think very small. It is incredibly significant that Greta Thunberg has turned her life into a living emergency. Yes, she set sail for the UN climate summit in New York on a zero carbon yacht ...Exactly. But this isn’t about what Greta is doing as an individual. It’s about what Greta is broadcasting in the choices that she makes as an activist, and I absolutely respect that. I think it’s magnificent. She is using the power that she has to broadcast that this is an emergency, and trying to inspire politicians to treat it as an emergency. I don’t think anybody is exempt from scrutinising their own decisions and behaviours but I think it is possible to overemphasise the individual choices. I have made a choice – and this has been true since I wrote No Logo, and I started getting these “what should I buy, where should I shop, what are the ethical clothes?” questions. My answer continues to be that I am not a lifestyle adviser, I am not anyone’s shopping guru, and I make these decisions in my own life but I’m under no illusion that these decisions are going to make the difference. Some people are choosing to go on birth strikes. What do you think about that?I’m happy these discussions are coming into the public domain as opposed to being furtive issues we’re afraid to talk about. It’s been very isolating for people. It certainly was for me. One of the reasons I waited as long as I did to try and get pregnant, and I would say this to my partner all the time – what, you want to have a Mad Max water warrior fighting with their friends for food and water? It wasn’t until I was part of the climate justice movement and I could see a path forward that I could even imagine having a kid. But I would never tell anybody how to answer this most intimate of questions. As a feminist who knows the brutal history of forced sterilisation and the ways in which women’s bodies become battle zones when policymakers decide that they are going to try and control population, I think that the idea that there are regulatory solutions when it comes to whether or not to have kids is catastrophically ahistorical. We need to be struggling with our climate grief together and our climate fears together, through whatever decision we decide to make, but the discussion we need to have is how do we build a world so that those kids can have thriving, zero-carbon lives? Over the summer, you encouraged people to read Richard Powers’s novel, The Overstory. Why?It’s been incredibly important to me and I’m happy that so many people have written to me since. What Powers is writing about trees: that trees live in communities and are in communication, and plan and react together, and we’ve been completely wrong in the way we conceptualise them. It’s the same conversation we’re having about whether we are going to solve this as individuals or whether we are going to save the collective organism. It’s also rare, in good fiction, to valorise activism, to treat it with real respect, failures and all, to acknowledge the heroism of the people who put their bodies on the line. I thought Powers did that in a really extraordinary way. What are you views on what Extinction Rebellion has achieved?One thing they have done so well is break us out of this classic campaign model we have been in for a long time, where you tell someone something scary, you ask them to click on something to do something about it, you skip out the whole phase where we need to grieve together and feel together and process what it is that we just saw. Because what I hear a lot from people is, ok, maybe those people back in the 1930s or 40s could organise neighbourhood by neighbourhood or workplace by workplace but we can’t. We believe we’ve been so downgraded as a species that we are incapable of that. The only thing that is going to change that belief is getting face to face, in community, having experiences, off our screens, with one another on the streets and in nature, and winning some things and feeling that power. You talk about stamina in the book. How do you keep going? Do you feel hopeful?I have complicated feelings about the hope question. Not a day goes by that I don’t have a moment of sheer panic, raw terror, complete conviction that we are doomed, and then I do pull myself out of it. I’m renewed by this new generation that is so determined, so forceful. I’m inspired by the willingness to engage in electoral politics, because my generation, when we were in our 20s and 30s, there was so much suspicion around getting our hands dirty with electoral politics that we lost a lot of opportunities. What gives me the most hope right now is that we’ve finally got the vision for what we want instead, or at least the first rough draft of it. This is the first time this has happened in my lifetime. And also, I did decide to have kids. I have a seven year old who is so completely obsessed and in love with the natural world. When I think about him, after we’ve spent an entire summer talking about the role of salmon in feeding the forests where he was born in British Columbia, and how they are linked to the health of the trees and the soil and the bears and the orcas and this entire magnificent ecosystem, and I think about what it would be like to have to tell him that there are no more salmon, it kills me. So that motivates me. And slays me. • Naomi Klein will be in conversation with Katharine Viner at a Guardian Live event on 15 October."

Indeed environmental restrictions have made a contribution in cleaning up the environment. But technology, awareness and the overall continued path of progress have also made major contributions. And keep in mind that placing stifling regulation on industries at home often prompts them to move to countries where they are allowed to produce more pollution, and more cheaply. So the net result is MORE pollution, not less, and lost jobs. I guess we could impose rigid environemntal regulations on poor coutries like China, India, Mexico etc., but if you’re honest you have to agree that they just aren’t that far yet.
This reminds me a little of the bio-fuels debacle. Sure biofuels are renewable and can cut fossil fuel CO2, but we have seen the far greater unintended catastrophic consequence on food prices and accelerated deforestation. This is one example of the importance of thinking things through first.  Sending the masses and policy makers into an uncontrolled, panicked stampede won’t work. Best is to explain it over time, and step by step we’ll get there in an orderly way. Hard working people are capable of understanding.
On feeding the hungry, huge progress has been made thanks to great strides in agricultural technology, expansion of free market principles throughout the globe, improved transportation and logistics, refrigeration and information management. Adam’s Smith’s invisible hand has played a huge role. Indeed the environment does best in developed, free-market oriented countries.

"People in Denmark will be able to “plant trees” from the comfort of their sofa in what is believed to be the world’s first TV fundraiser for forests. On Saturday the national broadcaster TV2 will air Denmark Plants Trees, a two-and-a-half hour live benefit event which will ask viewers to donate funds to plant 1m trees across the country.  Planting trees helps to reduce levels of CO2 and is seen as a central part of the climate crisis solution. The telethon will take place in the middle of Gisselfeld Klosters Skove forest with the prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, planting one of the first trees. Martin Sundstrøm, a producer for the event, said viewers would be encouraged to raise 20m kroner (£2.4m) to help the Danish Society for Nature Conservation plant 1m trees, while 10% of the money raised would go to WWF to help save tropical forests. Nicolai Hansson, the editor of TV2, said: “We know we won’t solve the climate crisis just by planting trees, but hopefully people will feel that it’s something tangible that they can be an active part of and enjoy afterwards when they visit the new forests and watch them grow and flourish.” Those who donate to the cause will become a member of a new “folk forests” initiative, which will be created close to Danish cities. The project has 600 hectares (1482 acres) of land ready, and more will be added in the future. “All potential areas have been evaluated and prioritised based on suitability by forest experts from the Danish Society for Nature Conservation,” Sundstrøm said. “After Saturday there will be a number of tree planting events all over Denmark. The first events will be this autumn and then in spring 2020 a larger number of events will take place depending on how much we raise. If we raise the funds to plant one million trees we expect around 30 events.” Sundstrøm said he hoped to see Denmark Plants Trees lead to similar events in other countries. “I hope events like this might spread to other countries in order to engage the public, like Live Aid did in 1985.” Sara Lom, CEO of the UK’s Tree Council charity, said she would welcome a tree planting telethon in the UK. “To plant enough trees to help tackle climate change we will need everyone to get involved – and fast,” said Lom. “A national TV telethon – or a tree-athon if you will – would be a wonderful way of engaging people around the country to raise money to plant and care for more trees.”"
"An area of forest the size of the UK is being lost every year around the world, the vast majority of it tropical rainforest, with dire effects on the climate emergency and wildlife. The rate of loss has reached 26m hectares (64m acres) a year, a report has found, having grown rapidly in the past five years despite pledges made by governments in 2014 to reverse deforestation and restore trees. Charlotte Streck, a co-founder and the director of Climate Focus, the thinktank behind the report, said: “We need to keep our trees and we need to restore our forests. Deforestation has accelerated, despite the pledges that have been made.” The New York declaration on forests was signed at the UN in 2014, requiring countries to halve deforestation by 2020 and restore 150m hectares of deforested or degraded forest land. But the rate of tree cover loss has gone up by 43% since the declaration was adopted, while the most valuable and irreplaceable tropical primary forests have been cut down at a rate of 4.3m hectares a year. The ultimate goal of the declaration, to halt deforestation by 2030 – potentially saving as much carbon as taking all the world’s cars off the roads – now looks further away than when the commitment was made. In Latin America, south-east Asia, and Africa – the major tropical forest regions – the annual rate of tree cover loss increased markedly between 2014 and 2018, compared with 2001 to 2013. While the greatest losses by volume were in tropical Latin America, the greatest rate of increase was in Africa, where deforestation rates doubled from less than 2m hectares a year to more than 4m. The report uses data up to 2018 in most cases, so the figures do not include the impact of the most recent burning in the Amazon. The report’s authors note that in June, deforestation rates in the Brazilian Amazon rose by 88% compared with the same month last year. Streck warned the recent fires were a particular concern because, whereas in previous decades when the humid nature of the rainforest made it hard to burn, with the lush vegetation acting as an effective firebreak, global heating in recent years has dried out parts of the forest and made it easier to combust. “The fires are coming at the beginning of the dry season, which is when you would have expected the forests to be at their wettest and hardest to burn,” she said. “This shows we could be entering into a feedback loop.” Feedback loops are feared by climate scientists because they amplify the effects of heating. In the case of forests, climate change dries out trees, making them more flammable, and increasing temperatures so they burn more easily, which then contributes more carbon dioxide, which fuels heating. Keeping existing forests standing, particularly in tropical regions, and restoring wooded areas that have been damaged, has long been recognised as one of the cheapest ways of tackling the climate crisis. The cost of preserving key forests globally has been estimated to be in the tens of billions of dollars a year, compared with the trillions needed to shift to low-carbon infrastructure. Jo House, a reader in environmental science and policy at the University of Bristol, said: “Deforestation, mostly for agriculture, contributes around a third of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. At the same time, forests naturally take up around a third of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. “This natural sink provided by forests is at risk from the duel compounding threats of further deforestation and future climate change. The continued loss of primary forests, at ever-increasing rates, despite their incalculable value and irreplaceability, is both shocking and tragic.” One of the difficulties highlighted by the report is that of gaining private sector support and investment for keeping forests standing. While there are clear economic benefits to cutting down forests, in the form of timber production and expanded agriculture, there are few investments being made in keeping existing forests healthy. Another complicating factor is that many governments offer subsidies to agriculture, which provide perverse incentives for deforestation. The report from a coalition of 25 organisations is being presented in New York before a series of events focusing on the climate crisis in the run-up to the UN secretary general’s summit later this month. At the meeting, world leaders are expected to come up with new proposals for tackling the climate emergency. But Streck said the failure to meet the pledges made five years ago undercut the value of such promises if they were not backed up with finance, detailed plans and on-the-ground implementation. “We don’t need more important guys standing up making pledges,” she said. “We need to go beyond declarations. Implementation is complicated, but it’s what we need.” There have been some bright spots. The rate of loss of primary forest in Indonesia slowed by nearly one-third between 2017 and 2018. Palm oil plantations in the country are a major cause of deforestation, but companies and the government have come under pressure from consumers and aid donors. Wetter weather that reduced forest fires also helped. While some countries have embarked on tree-planting schemes, notably in Ethiopia, but also in Mexico and El Salvador, these have been far outweighed by the loss of existing forests. Tree planting does not compensate for the loss of standing forests, because established growth yields benefits beyond carbon uptake, through the whole ecosystem. “It can take centuries for forests to recover their full carbon-absorbing and weather-regulating capabilities,” Streck said."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThings have really gotten desperate for the CAGWists also here in Germany. That’s what a little Climategate and Germany’s coldest winter in 46 years can do to a junk-science theory.
Dirk Maxeiner brings up a piece appearing in the German online Frankfurter Rundschau titled: Campaign of Lies McCarthy Style Click here!
The piece describes how more than 250 scientists, among them 11 Nobel Prize recipients, have expressed their outrage in a letter published in Science claiming they’ve been the targets of McCarthy-like attacks. The Frankfurter Rundschau says the attacks are coming from “Konservative Think-Tanks” and “Republikaner”, among them the Heartland Institute, and James Inhofe, all designed to “torpedo the urgently needed climate protection measures”, and blah blah blah.
The tone of the piece of course is that sceptics are bad and the warmists are good. The piece also heavily bemoans the rapidly eroding public concerns of AGW as an issue, and asks: Who’s behind all that irresponsible scepticism?
Prof Hans Joachim Scellnhuber, an IPCC lead author, explains it for them. Here’s the text in German, then followed by the translation in English:

Sie versuchen erst gar nicht, bei einer sachlichen Debatte erfolgreich zu sein, sondern vielmehr grundsätzliche Zweifel an der Wissenschaft als Instrument der Wirklichkeitserklärung zu säen.” Damit fänden sie große Sympathie “bei vielen antiaufklärerischen Kräften’.
In English:
Potsdam climate researcher Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber, a signatory of the Science Letter, thinks the sceptics in Germany have less influence than in the USA. They involve very different groups, the Director of the Institute for Climate Impact Research told the Frankfurter Rundschau. Most of them ‘operate from the safety of anonymity in the internet. They don’t try at all to do it successfully through a factual debate; rather they attempt to sow scepticism on science being an instrument to explain reality.’  This is how they gain much sympathy ‘from the many forces of anti-science’.
In Schellnhuber’s world, scepticism is anti-science. And if you doubt their science, then you are anti-science.
Oh, by the way, let’s not forget that reality and science for them are doctored up iStock polar bear photos and manipulated temperature curves. And who are the ones who keep running and hiding from debate?
What about the polar bear photo in the Frankfurter Rundschau piece? The caption reads: “Polar bears searching for food”. But at least that photo, as far as I can tell, hasn’t been doctored.

"In 1991, 17-year-old Alex Lockwood was flipping through the Guardian Weekend magazine in his family’s car, en route to a family Sunday roast, when he spotted an image that changed his life. A harpooned whale, its body bloodied and lifeless, drew him to a feature about its killing. “That picture just shook me; it seemed so wrong. When I got to my nan’s house it hit me that the roast on the table was an animal that had also been killed.” He became vegetarian, then vegan, and nearly three decades later is one of the founding members of Extinction Rebellion’s new sister organisation, Animal Rebellion, which formed in June and plans to blockade London’s Smithfield Market – Britain’s largest meat distribution market – in October.  For almost a year Extinction Rebellion has made the headlines with its use of civil disobedience to pressure governments and corporations to act on the climate crisis, prompting MPs to pass a motion declaring a climate emergency in May. Inspired by its success, Animal Rebellion has set its sights on making Britain’s food system plant-based. While the group believes the meat and dairy industry is inherently cruel, the focus is predominantly on the environmental arguments. Lockwood, now a senior lecturer focusing on vegan and environmental issues at the University of Sunderland, says: “We can’t fix the climate emergency without ending the animal agriculture industry.” Veganism as a solution to the climate crisis has become a key discussion point in recent months. Amid record-breaking temperatures over the summer, the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) proposed a major shift towards plant-based diets, warning that it will be impossible to avert climate catastrophe by reducing carbon emissions from manufacturing, power plants and transport alone. As thousands of fires blazed in the Amazon rainforest in August – many of them started to clear land for cattle rearing – and released huge quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, calls for boycotts of beef and other animal products grew louder. Animal agriculture accounts for 14.5% of all greenhouse gas emissions, according to the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization, more than all transportation combined. Animal Rebellion wants everyone to go vegan – but, like Extinction Rebellion, its main goal is system change rather than telling individuals to change habits. Tomorrow about 50 activists from the group plan to stage a “reforestation” protest in Parliament Square: armed with spades, they aim to plant a two-metre-high walnut tree there, as well as dozens of seedlings, though they aren’t sure how far they will get before police make arrests. “We’re doing this because we need the government to act to stop deforestation,” says Simone Scampoli, Animal Rebellion’s action team coordinator. “We’ve all seen images of the Amazon on fire, but deforestation is happening all over the world to rear animals and grow crops to feed them. We know trees are essential for absorbing the greenhouse gas emissions that are driving global warming.” Tomorrow’s protest is also a practice run of civil disobedience for the Smithfield Market blockade, which will be part of Extinction Rebellion’s next “movement of movements”, International Rebellion, encompassing other groups, starting 7 October. About 2,000 volunteers are signed up to take part in the blockade, set to begin with a training session at an undisclosed location, before they march to the market ahead of its opening for business at about 11pm. Protesters will camp in front of the market overnight and aim to hold on to the site for two weeks, blocking vans and lorries from entering. “It’s going to be lively and joyous, with singing, dancing, a boat, lots of fruit and veg stalls, a festival atmosphere,” Lockwood says. “We want to turn Smithfield Market into Britain’s most vibrant and colourful fruit and vegetable market.” Animal Rebellion says it has received messages on social media threatening violence if they go ahead with the protest. “We’re a peaceful, non-violent group and we’re all quite scared about that,” Lockwood admits. “We don’t want to cause trouble or hurt people’s livelihoods. But Smithfield is the symbolic seat of the UK meat industry, which is driving climate change, and if we carry on our current trajectory there won’t be any jobs left.” To many, Animal Rebellion’s goal of ending animal agriculture may seem unthinkable – much of the current debate revolves around reducing meat and dairy rather than cutting it completely. Commenting on Animal Rebellion’s planned protest, a spokesperson for the National Farmers Union said: “Farmers take the issue of climate change extremely seriously, which is why we have set our own target to be net zero by 2040. We believe British livestock has a crucial role to play in achieving our ambition. Our extensive grass-fed system means British farmers produce some of the most climate-friendly meat in the world. It is already 2.5 times more efficient than the global average.” Lockwood says that the 2040 goal is too late and relies on technology that has not yet been developed. Also commenting on the protest, James Tumbridge, chairman of the City of London Corporation’s markets committee, which includes Smithfield Market, said: “We will work positively with any protesters to allow peaceful demonstration, but our first aim must be the uninterrupted safe operation of the market. The intended protest is potentially very damaging to the workers at Smithfield Market. The men and women who work there are vital to feeding London, and we have a duty to protect their livelihoods and the food supply.”Animal Rebellion has been trying to engage Smithfield Market in dialogue, Lockwood says. “We recognise that butchers and meat industry workers have a deep pride in feeding the nation,” he explains. “We want them to carry on feeding people, but with plant-based food, in a way that’s sustainable and just.” Who are Animal Rebellion? Founded by around 12 people in June, including Dr Alex Lockwood (44), Dan Kidby, animal rights activist and the core founder of Animal Think Tank, Dilan Fernando, a 25-year-old from Australia who left his banking job to focus on organising social movements, and Esther Salomon (19), who has deferred starting her politics degree at Edinburgh University to work for Animal Rebellion full-time. How big is the group? Around 100 organisers, with 2,000 volunteers signed up for the Smithfield protest next month. What are its aims? To get the government to tell the truth about the climate emergency, reduce greenhouse gases to net zero by 2025, and set up a citizens’ assembly. Also to start a debate on switching to a plant-based food system."
"Nationals MPs have snubbed a farmers’ group launching a major climate change report that warns the Australian agricultural sector faces “significant threats to viability” without a new national climate strategy. The report, launched by the Farmers for Climate Action group at Parliament House on Monday, warns that agricultural production will fall, farm profits will decline and food insecurity will increase if the government does not come up with a cohesive national strategy on climate change and agriculture. Lucinda Corrigan, the chair of Farmers for Climate Action, said she had wanted Nationals MPs to attend the event, saying she believed cross-party support was needed given the challenge facing producers. “It would have been great if they had been there because they need to take this seriously,” Corrigan said. “Because being green is actually our agenda, it’s actually a conservative agenda, being a conservationist is a conservative agenda, it is not a green agenda, it has been taken from us and we actually want it back.” She also said Nationals MPs should consider the concerns within the agricultural sector about climate change separately to the issues affecting the energy sector. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “People see it as an and/or thing, and it is not and/or – this is something that needs to happen for the future of food and agriculture in Australia. What we do about the coal industry and the transition to clean energy is really a different conversation, even though it is equally important.” While no Nationals MPs attended the event, the environment minister, Sussan Ley, launched the report, saying she believed it was important that conservation and agriculture were “on the same page”. “I share the view that we face very real challenges from climate change now and in the years ahead,” she said. “There is no question that our climate is changing, and the science on that is conclusive.” Ley’s comments come after the Nationals MP David Littleproud last week cast doubt on the science of climate change, saying he was not sure if human activity was contributing. He later said he accepted that he accepted the science. Richard Heath, the executive director of the Australian Farm Institute, which completed the report, said that Australian agriculture needed a “national cohesive climate change strategy”. “We need this strategy because Australian agriculture is both partly responsible for and increasingly impacted by the impacts of climate change,” Heath said. “The pace and extent of change that the climate is now experiencing is going beyond the capacity of even the best farmers using the best practices and technologies to adapt.” Jody Brown, a farmer from drought-riven Longreach in Queensland in Littleproud’s electorate of Maranoa, said that a growing number of farmers were recognising the threat of climate change, but that some felt targeted in a city-country divide over the issue. “It’s a very difficult topic for a lot of graziers and some ways it is like the frog in the boiling water because it is not immediately obvious – it has always been hot and dry up there, it is just getting hotter and drier. But she said she believed Nationals MPs would be forced to confront the issue as support for action grew, saying she was frustrated at the lack of political will for a national strategy as politics lagged industry support. “If politicians are not taking this seriously it is quite negligent,” she said."
"Australians overwhelmingly support business leaders speaking out on social and political issues, according to a new survey that conflicts with government efforts to paint such efforts as corporate kowtowing to “noisy elites”. However, the new survey, from the Committee for Economic Development of Australia (Ceda), also shows that when chief executives do speak out they are regarded as doing so out of self-interest.  The survey of 3,000 Australians and 59 bosses showed 78% of the general public supported corporate leaders speaking out on issues of public importance, but 52% thought that when they were did, they were talking in the interests of their own company. The 2019 Ceda Company Pulse also reveals that big business chief executives are completely at odds with the public on where the fruits of increased productivity should go, with bosses wanting to return the spoils to shareholders while ordinary Australians think they should be distributed as higher wages and lower prices. “Despite all this talk about declining trust in business and business being on the nose, people understand the importance of big business,” the Ceda chief executive, Melinda Cilento, said. She said a majority of Australians wanted big business to speak out on social and environmental issues. “It’s a healthy majority around the country – this isn’t just a healthy majority in the inner-city CBD,” she said. “There’s a really small proportion of people in that camp that says business should only really comply with the law. “When it comes to these issues about social and environmental performance there was support for that.” Release of the survey on Monday follows a week of attacks by the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and his government on big business for talking about social issues and the environment. On Thursday, Morrison’s assistant minister Ben Morton used a speech to the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry to launch a ferocious attack on the big end of town, saying chief executives “too often succumb or pander to similar pressures from noisy, highly orchestrated campaigns of elites typified by groups such as GetUp or activist shareholders”. In what was seen within business circles as an attack on one of Australia’s biggest resources companies, BHP, he mocked companies for “pretending you love paying tax or that you’re building electric cars rather than mining coal”. BHP boss Andrew Mackenzie has drawn the ire of rightwing commentators for announcing in July that the company would be taking action to reduce its carbon emissions, including those made by customers, and comparing the efforts needed to combat climate crisis to the mobilisation for the second world war. It is understood the pushback has not changed Mackenzie’s position, which is supported by the BHP board, and the company intends to push on with its plans to link executive pay to carbon emissions. As  Guardian Australia revealed last month, the company is also considering quitting the Minerals Council over its positions on coal and climate policy. Some in the investment community are sceptical of the push for greater engagement on social and environmental issues, with one market source saying there was a strong cohort who wanted business to stick to its knitting of making money for shareholders. BHP’s conversion to climate crisis activism has also prompted cynicism due to the company’s role in dramatically weakening the Rudd government’s proposed mining tax. “They privately admit the Minerals Council was the best return on investment ever given the billions they saved on the Resources Super Profits Tax,” one market source said. The report also showed the when companies lower costs, 52% of people surveyed thought the savings should be passed to customers and 38% said wages should increase. But just 14% of business leaders thought cost savings should result in wages going up, and only 31% thought customers should benefit. Instead, 56% said the extra money should go to shareholders. “There has to be a more clear discussion around how productivity does benefit workers and how it will flow through to them in higher wages and job opportunities,” Cilento said."

Though not as eccentric as Mullis, Norwegian mechanical engineer Ivar Giaever describes how he won the Nobel Prize in physics. In the following video link, he tells what he feels is important to win a Nobel Prize. His tips:
1. Give talks, don’t be afraid of criticism.
2. Check yourself – try to prove yourself wrong.
3. It’s not proving theories, it’s about disproving famous ones.
4. You have to be curious.
5. You have to be competitive.

About 400 to 500 million years ago, Earth’s ocean temperatures averaged 35-40°C and atmospheric CO2 concentrations were “5-10x higher than present day values” (Henke et al., 2018). During this period, the marine biosphere thrived (Voosen et al., 2019).

Image Source: Voosen et al., 2019 and press release
During the last 5.4 million years, CO2 has varied between 180 and 500 ppm (Fletcher et al., 2019). During the Pliocene (5.4 to 2.5 million years ago), Arctic temperatures were said to have been 22°C warmer than today (Fletcher et al., 2017) and tropical ocean temperatures were 3-6°C warmer than present (Wycech et al., 2020).

During the peak of the last glacial (the Last Glacial Maximum) 19,000 years ago, the Southern Ocean was 2°C warmer than it is today even though CO2 levels were a dangerously low 180 ppm at this time. This was also the same period when the Earth’s bottom water temperatures warmed up by about 2°C 1,000 years before the oceans’ surface began warming and CO2 began to rise (Stott et al., 2007).

Image Source: Stott et al., 2007
As recently as 10,000 years ago, the Arctic Ocean’s bottom water temperatures were 6-10°C warmer than they are today (Beierlein et al., 2015).

Image Source: Beierlein et al., 2015
Global ocean temperatures were still warmer than today througout nearly all of the last 10,000 years (Rosenthal et al., 2017), including the Medieval Warm Period (Gebbie and Huybers, 2019).

In sum, paleoclimate research strongly suggests there is nothing unprecedented or even unusual about ocean temperature changes in the modern era.

Share this...FacebookTwitterExtensive hake (fish) skeletal remains in ocean waters too cold for this species to occupy today suggest past ocean temperatures were several degrees warmer.
Fish habitats are limited by specific temperature boundaries. In a new study, for example,  Wheeland  and Morgan (2020) found there was a pronounced ocean warming from the 1980s to late 1990s off the coasts of Greenland. This temperature shift changed the distribution of halibut habitat. Since then, however, there has been no net warming in the study region (through 2016).

Image Source: Wheeland  and Morgan, 2020
In a new study, Bas et al. ( 2020)  document a large presence of a temperature-sensitive fish species (hake) at 53°S (southernmost South America) when current hake venture no further south than 47°S. This latitude differential for hake habitat suggests the ocean was 4-5°C warmer than today about 5000 years ago (Mid-Holocene).

Image Source: Bas et al., 2020
Evidence for anomalously cold present-day sea surface temperatures in southern South America relative to past millennia has also been documented by Caniupán et al., 2014. This region’s temperatures may actually be nearly the coldest of the last 10,000 years – cooler than the temperature depths reached during the “global Little Ice Age”.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt the German Readers Edition, Rudolf Kipp has a short write-up poking fun at Kevin Trenberth’s missing heat. http://www.readers-edition.de/2010/04/18/raetsel-geloest-globale-erwaermung-versteckt-sich-in-den-ozeanen/. I’d like to build further on that.
Kevin Trenberth is a devout believer in AGW. Unfortunately measurements haven’t been cooperating and they show the world hasn’t warmed up at all over the last years. Frustrated, Trenberth was unable to contain his exasperation in a Climategate e-mail:
The fact is that we can’t account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is a travesty that we can’t. 
If that weren’t bad enough, new studies now show the oceans, where most of the thermal energy is stored, are cooling. http://wattsupwiththat.com/2009/03/21/recent-ocean-heat-and-mlo-co2-trends/
Still, like a true believer, Trenberth denies it and insists the heat is there – somewhere. It’s just simply hidden. After all the climate models say the heat has to be there. And so he warns us:
The heat will come back to haunt us sooner or later.

In the meantime more signs are mounting that we should be preparing for cooling due to quiet solar activity, which some scientists are now realising there’s strong evidence of a link. http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/5/2/024001/fulltext   
In May 2008 Mojib Latif was one of the first established climate scientists to recognise cooling, writing that the missing heat was due to ocean oscillations and that it would last another 10 to 20 years. http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v453/n7191/abs/nature06921.html and http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17742-worlds-climate-could-cool-first-warm-later.html?DCMP=OTC-rss&nsref=online-news.
Meteorologist Joe Bastardi has also been beating the drums of a cooling period, saying the current El Nino is about to fizzle out and that we can expect a La Nina with a couple of cold years ahead. And recall that a recent survey showed that a large majority of meteorologists believe climate is driven by natural factors, and much less so by man.
Dr. Don Easterbook and others are convinced that the cooling will indeed be longterm. Kevin Mooney writes: http://www.sott.net/articles/show/206060-21st-century-global-cooling-trend-debunks-United-Nations-computer-climate-models
The momentum is now very much with researchers who have identified natural forces as opposed to human activity as the primary driving force behind warming and cooling trends. Ideally, they should find greater expression.
But devout believers will hear none of it and they continue to believe in the Hidden Heat. Stefan Rahmstorf even defiantly offered to bet “big money” that average temps will continue to rise through 2020. http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/05/global-cooling-wanna-bet/langswitch_lang/en.  Of course Rahmstorf would not be so careless as to forget a back-door escape clause, just in case:
 To be fair, the bet needs an escape clause in case a big volcano erupts or a big meteorite hits the Earth and causes cooling below the 1994-2004 level.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Polarstern ice breaker of the government-funded Alfred Wegener Institute is now returning from a 7-month long expedition to the Antarctic, putting 37,000 nautical miles behind it. A total of 150 scientists from 15 countries have taken part in the Antarctic research expedition. here
Onboard in the ship’s cargo bays are 1000 meters of sediment cores, weighing 11 tonnes in total. These cores will now allow the researchers to extract climate information for the period from 400,000 to 4 million years ago.
There’s already considerable knowlege going back about 600,000 years.
But beyond that it starts to get awfully fuzzy. We do know that it has been trending colder over the last 5 million years.
The period from 400 thousand to 4 million years back is not well-researched, and so the sediment cores will certainly deliver key information on how the climate developed in leading up to the periodic ice ages, clues about ice behaviour, and ocean currents. Surely it’ll take some time to extract the data and digest them. We’re certainly looking forward to the first results.
Normally the AWI provides a translation of their press releases in English. I expect one will be out shortly.

Mother Jones took a look at the solar industry, and what they found isn’t pretty. It cites a survey conducted by the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition (SVTC) with 25 solar cell companies, and this is what was found: http://motherjones.com/blue-marble/2010/03/are-your-solar-panels-toxic

 – Only 14 companies responded to the survey.
 – Six companies reported their products contain lead.
 – Three companies said their products contain cadmium, a known carcinogen.
 – One company uses nitrogen triflouride, a potent greenhouse gas 17,000 times more powerful than CO2.

       This is only on the production side, and does not look at how production is done in China, for example, where many cells are produced cheaply and with practically no environmental standards.
      Then there are the environmental hazards of disposing of used solar cells.
      Keep in mind that many are being replaced long before their 20 year lifetime is reached because the new ones are more efficient. California and Europe have exempted solar manufacturers from strict recycling laws. Solar panel manufacturers are barricading against any regulation that would require them to deal with the waste they produce. Indeed only eight companies said they would support “extended producer responsibility” laws that would require them to take back and recycle their waste.
So just how much waste is expected to be produced?
In the coming years, SVTC estimates that 1.5 billion pounds of solar panel waste containing 2 million pounds of lead and 600,000 pounds of cadmium will be disposed of in California alone. 
Now just throw in all those mercury-filled light bulbs, and you get your Green Revolution (For the toxic material industry, that is).

Share this...FacebookTwitterAccording to Die Welt online, a team of German physicists at the Freiburger Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems set a new world record by making a solar cell that can convert 41.1% of the sun’s light into electricity. Today’s typical silicium panels on homes don’t even reach 20%.
http://www.welt.de/wissenschaft/innovationen/article7498251/Weltrekord-beim-Strom-aus-Sonnenlicht.html
How did they do it? According to Die Welt, the solar cells have 3 layers stacked on top of each other, each converting a certain part of the sunlight.
In the first layer the visible light spectrum is converted into electricity. The thermal spectrum of sunlight passes through the first layer and is absorbed by a 2nd layer and converted into electricity. Especially longwave infrared light is converted by a third layer.
In addition to the three layers, which are made of elements such as gallium, germanium, indium and arsenic, the cells also have 22 micrometer–thin layers that perform special electrical functions. Physicist Frank Dimroth, who with his team worked 10 years to reach the record, says:
 It’s all horribly complicated.
There are other drawbacks. The cells are efficient only in intensive, direct sunlight, which means they will find only a use in dry equatorial regions and will have to be equipped with a sun-tracking system to follow the sun from morning until evening.
They are also very expensive. The manufacturing cost is 50 times more than today’s conventional solar cells. Still, Dimroth hopes that production costs can be brought down to earthly levels by mass production. There’s no mention in the report of recycling and disposal costs.

The Conference has begun – I’ll get right to the points.
1) How’s the mood going to be over there? Like a funeral?
LOL! Yeah, like dancing on the grave of your most bitter and hated enemy. I wish I could be there. It goes without saying, the mood will be festive, buoyant, and giddy. So much has happened since the last Conference back in June in Washington. Just 11 months ago who would have ever thought science would progress so much and that the ugly truths behind the CAGW science would be exposed like they have been?
2. What has changed since the last Conference?
The last 11 months in climate science have been like a millenium.  Huge seismic events have occurred, namely the scandal that was Climategate and the debacle that was the IPCC’s 4th Assessment Report. The report has been completely discredited. Chairmann Rajendra Pachauri surely will be forced to go. The CAGW science has been reduced to a heap of crushed ice.
3. What about the program there?
First of all, let the guys and gals celebrate a little. It’s good they are getting away from their laptops and blogs and coming together to talk face-to-face. As mentioned in Pt. 2, there’s a lot to talk about. This year the program is much bigger than last year’s.  The roster of speakers is second to none. There are other speakers I’d like to see, but I guess you have to draw the line somewhere.

4. What about inviting the warmists?
That’s been done. The sceptics don’t hide behind closed, locked doors. The doors are wide open and I’m sure the sceptics would even roll out the red carpet for the warmists. Note how the sceptics have no qualms about opening the Conference up to other points of view. That’s how science works. Compare that to how the warmists conduct their conferences, making sure no dissenting views are expressed. Personally I don’t know why people like Mann should be invited. He’s a climate science fraud and criminal. His hockey sticks have proven that. Others like Hansen, Gavin, etc. – okay. Red carpet’s waiting just for you!
5. What are they going to accomplish there?
It’s a chance  to spawn new initiatives and to communicate other points of view to the public. Sure the old washed up MSM won’t be there. But my view is: Who cares! I hope Talk Radio mentions it and maybe Fox News will do a story or two. Otherwise, the growing internet media will do the rest.
6. How do the warmists feel about the Conference?
They can’t stand it. Already many are peeing and moaning about how demoncracy doesn’t work anymore, and that the media gives the sceptics too much coverage, and that they are in a way aiding and abetting the “denialists”. Of course this shows what they really think of free speech and democracy. They’d prefer not have them. Yesterday I wrote about Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, IPCC lead author and Director of Germany’s Postdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, who said:
They [sceptics] don’t try at all to do it successfully through factual debate; rather they attempt to sow scepticism on science being an instrument to explain reality. 
In Schellnhuber’s world, scepticism is anti-science. And if you doubt his science, then you are anti-science.
Well Schellnhuber, the doors to debate are wide open in Chicago. You only need the courage to walk through them.

"Australia is experiencing one of its most severe droughts on record, resulting in desperate water shortages across large parts of New South Wales and southern Queensland. Dams in some parts of western NSW have all but dried up, with rainfall levels through the winter in the lowest 10% of historical records in some areas. The crisis in the far west of the state became unavoidable after the mass fish kills along the lower Darling River last summer, but now much bigger towns closer to the coast, including Dubbo, are also running out of water. Residents of three distinct areas talked to Guardian Australia about the state of their towns under extreme stress from water shortages, expressing anxiety about their future but also determination to keep communities alive. It seems unthinkable that the city of Dubbo, with a population of 40,000 and home to the Western Plains Zoo, could be facing the prospect of running out of water by mid- 2020. But as the drought enters its second summer, that’s exactly what is facing the main town in the central west of NSW. It’s also raising questions about management of water in the region, as irrigators in the basin have been permitted to continue to take water in the expectation that inflows would occur. Instead inflows into the Macquarie River are at historic lows. The vast Burrendong dam on the Macquarie – six times the size of Sydney Harbour and the main water source for Dubbo, Wellington, Narromine, Nyngan, Cobar and Warren – is now at 4.5% capacity and dwindling rapidly as unseasonably high temperatures hit the region. This is not just a matter of water restrictions and inconvenience. The drought and water shortages spell potential economic catastrophe for Dubbo as farmers leave fields unplanted and sell off stock, tourist numbers wither and parks and gardens turn brown. Dubbo still looks like an oasis in the brown landscape that surrounds it, despite being on level two restrictions. But tougher level three restrictions are imminent if there is no spring rain, as the Bureau of Meteorology is forecasting. Then the city will rapidly go to level five, then level six. That means no watering of lawns and parks. Some of the council’s pools will be emptied and residents will be required to use no more than 120 litres a day – half the amount now permitted. That means short showers and limited use of evaporative coolers, in a summer when the temperature on most days will be well over 30C. “There are no records of the sort of drought that we are experiencing,” says the chief executive of Dubbo council, Michael McMahon. “At the same time the population has grown and there are more businesses here.” A fortnight ago the state government announced a $30m program to sink more bores, and McMahon says he hopes to shift to roughly 50/50 bore and dam water by March. But there are serious questions about whether groundwater in sufficient quantity and quality can be found to support all the people who rely on Burrendong. “I’m quite concerned that the groundwater they find won’t be enough or of good enough quality to help Dubbo,” says the Healthy Rivers Dubbo convenor, Melissa Gray. She points to a risk assessment by state water authorities in November 2018 that found the risk of compaction and subsidence, caused by extraction of groundwater, was high in several zones of the Macquarie aquifer. There is also a high risk of poor quality water travelling through the aquifer as water is withdrawn at other points. Bill Johnson, a former Murray-Darling Basin Authority senior staff member, says the problem is the climate is getting hotter and drier but allocations are being made on the expectation of previous dry times. “There isn’t plenty of water for towns now because too much has been given to irrigation in the recent past,” he says. McMahon also acknowledges concerns about bore water. He is confident it can be treated to provide drinking water but says there are limits to how much can be extracted. Astoundingly, farms with groundwater entitlements are still permitted to extract from underground aquifers for irrigation, Gray says. “They can still flood irrigate with groundwater so, despite the conditions, there will be cotton grown in this region this year.” In the meantime some of the city’s big water users, including the zoo, are trying to reduce water use further. The zoo has a 500-megalitre allocation from Burrendong, which it uses for its non-potable water, mainly for the irrigation of lawns, for water features and moats around enclosures, and for growing “browse” feed for animals. The zoo’s director, Steve Hinks, says it has already cut irrigation back significantly to 340ML a year but is looking at what else can be done, through greater recycling. “We hold 50ML on site at any one time,” he says. “The water is stored in a reservoir and flows through a lake system, so the hippo lake here is one of the last lakes in our natural system.” The zoo is installing a pump system to take the hippo lake water back to the reservoir, where it will run through a series of natural wetlands to purify it. “We can not only reuse the water and get a longer lifespan, but we are creating an environment for a lot of the native bird species,” Hinks says. “Even if it rains in the next few months we will forge ahead with this project as it sets us up for the future, because historically droughts are cyclical, and historically people tend to put the changes on hold. “We are planning for the eventuality of no water in Burrendong but I don’t think we would necessarily close the zoo or drastically reduce the animals here. We are working closely with Water NSW and council about options such as sinking bores on site, and desalination and sewage treatment and recycling.” The further you travel from Dubbo, the more acute the problems are. Nyngan, which sits on the red soil plains 120km to the north-west, was seared into the national consciousness in 1990 when the Bogan River overran its banks, inundating the town of just over 2,000 people. Such excesses are now a distant memory. There has been no rain since 2016 and the town is relying on a combination of its off-river storage, shrewdly built by the council in 2017, and a channel that brings water from Dubbo and the Burrendong. “Having this backup makes it a lot better than it would be,” says Nyngan’s water manager, Trevor Waterhouse. It holds about 700ML, which is close to a year’s water for the town, particularly with water restrictions. But it depends on water from Burrendong, brought by the 66km Albert Priest channel. Further west along the road to Bourke, the situation is already dire. Girilambone, population 26, is already part of the way towards becoming a ghost town but this drought could be the last straw. The town water supply ran out six months ago and water is now trucked in every two days. The rail line to Bourke closed in 1986 and, since then, the town has been in retreat. The station is derelict. The hotel burned down. The general store and petrol station closed two years ago.  “The mines [at Cobar and Girilambone] have already had meetings and said if they don’t have rain before January, it’s no more,” says Darren Painter, who runs the hotel in the old RSL. “This is the only small business here. In turn that will shut us too. “There’s not much laughter here in the pub these days. The farmers try to come in to buy two beers but then they have to go. “Ah, but it will be all right. We’ve got through this before.” After 73 days it rained a trickle in the southern Queensland town of Warwick in August. Few locals celebrated the end of the longest dry spell in living memory. The drought had passed the point where 5mm in the rain gauge could make a drop of difference. “Warwick is a fantastic town, a very proud town, but it’s on its knees,” says Ian Macdonald, who runs a local garden nursery with his son, Brent. “I don’t know how we ever come back from this. Because if it rained tonight, it doesn’t rain money and we’re about a quarter of a million dollars down the gurgler.” Warwick is on track to run out of water within months. Roadside signs heading into town remind residents of the new restrictions: 100 litres per person, per day. Locals take pride in their rose gardens – shopping centres and hotels and Chinese restaurants are named after Warwick’s signature flower. Each year in October the Rose and Rodeo festival is the town’s showpiece event. “We can’t afford the money to bring in roses this year because no one is buying and you’d quite easily do your arse taking a gamble,” Macdonald says. “What people don’t get about a drought is that it hurts everybody … If the farmers have got no money, none of us have got any money ... People don’t buy plants to take home. They don’t stop after the cattle sales and buy a pie at the pie shop.”  In Stanthorpe, 60km to the south, “day zero” – when drinking water supply runs dry – is approaching just as quickly. The towns in Queensland’s Southern Downs and Granite Belt are hubs for primary producers; mostly fruit and vegetable growers. Last month the Granite Belt Growers Association estimated the reduction in wages and expenditure would cost the local economy $100m. Ann Bourke from Jester Hill Wines – a spokeswoman for the Granite Belt Wine Tourism body – says the latest vintage was picked a month earlier than usual, and most local winemakers now have business plans that assume they will lose one harvest in every five. “It’s costing us $2,000 a week to buy in water,” Bourke says. “We’re still in two minds, do we throw the dollars at buying more water and have a vintage, or do we concentrate on just keeping the vines alive?” Some of the bigger farms have decided not to plant this year, which means there is no additional work, and few backpackers in town. “That means there’s less people employed, families might move away, next year our school numbers will drop,” says Amanda Harold, the secretary of the Stanthorpe chamber of commerce. “It’s very scary and very stressful for everyone.”  Harold says Stanthorpe faced a similar situation 10 years ago, when the community was months away from running out of water. She, like many locals, thinks authorities should have acted more quickly to build the Emu Swamp dam. The dam tends to split opinion, but most accuse successive councils and governments of failing to plan properly. Rick Humphreys, a small producer, decided not to grow his primary crop – parsley – this year. He says there’s an increased acceptance that climate change will force farmers to adapt their practices. “I think people now acknowledge that we’re in uncharted territory,” says Humphreys, who is a member of the group Farmers for Climate Action. “A lot of the old blokes, whose families have been keeping records a long way back, they say this is the worst drought on record … “If the numbers are right a version of this is going to become the new normal in the mid-term and we need to think differently about how we produce things and what we produce. The worst thing we can do is carry on farming ... the way we always have.” Macdonald says he was called “a communist” by a local Warwick identity for suggesting the weather patterns had changed and that October thunderstorms were no longer a regular occurrence. “I’d be too frightened to talk about [climate change] in this town,” he says. “It doesn’t get through to people at all. Not one bit.”  The far western town of Walgett will be back on bore water again next week. Rain in March sent the last natural flow down the once-mighty Barwon River, and the quality of what remains has been declining ever since. On 3 September the shire council warned locals to boil water for drinking and food preparation owing to “high turbidity” – a level of murkiness that can indicate the presence of disease-causing bacteria such as E coli. Locals say the water coming out of the tap is brown, brackish and smells bad. “It’s yucky water,” says Clem Dodd, from the Dhariwaa elders group. “It stinks. You can’t wash in it or wash your clothes in it, or they’ll stink too.” Walgett shire’s general manager, Greg Ingham, agrees the situation is “pretty dire”. “I really do feel for the community about the river,” he says. “It’s sad to go down and see what was a thriving lifeblood of our community just a dry, parched riverbed.” Walgett’s bore water is high in sodium, which can pose a risk for people with heart disease, diabetes and other chronic health conditions. The water supply is regularly independently tested, and the NSW health department has said it is safe but the taste can be unpalatable. Ingham says the shire is in discussions with the state government to install a desalination system but that in itself will not solve the town’s water woes. “The output of any desalination treatment won’t be the same as what is currently going through our treatment plant. Desalination on its own won’t be enough to supply all our needs. We might have to look at a blend of the two.” For the past year locals have been buying bottled water or receiving crowdfunded donations shipped in by truck and car. When Walgett’s only supermarket burnt down after an electrical fault in June, locals had to make an 80-minute round trip to Coonamble to buy water, or go further afield. A temporary shop opened in August. “We’ve had various campaigns,” Ingham said. “We’ve had a lot of bottled water coming in, through GoFundMe pages. Then we had a concern about all those small empty bottles piling up here, not being great for the environment. “Now 20- to 50-litre-sized containers are being delivered to households. But the bottom line is we’re no different to any other part of regional Australia suffering through the drought. The only real long-term solution is rain.” The Walgett Aboriginal Medical Service and the Dhariwaa elders group have been distributing bottled water, and delivering water to housebound elders. “Buying water is expensive,” says a local Gamilaraay woman, Vanessa Hickey, “having to spend extra, to wash fruit and veggies.” Both she and Dodd have started to think about what the lack of water might mean for the future. Dodd says moving away is a possibility but Hickey says she’s not going anywhere. “They’ve already ruined our rivers with cotton, coal seam gas and mining. But I’m not moving. The community suffers from other people’s wrongdoing. It’s not our fault but we’re the ones who suffer the most. “They want us gone because they want the land; they want what’s under the land. But where can we live in the city? We only live in the country. I’d rather live in a tent on the riverbank – only we’ve got no river to live on.”"
"Fiona Harvey is surely right when she says “adaptation alone won’t save us from climate disaster” (Journal, 12 September). She gives an apt metaphor that adaptation “while continuing to burn fossil fuels is like trying to mop up an overflowing sink while the taps are still running”, but she still talks of mechanisms for “better economic growth”. Political leaders worldwide need to recognise the causal connection between economic growth and global heating, manifest in fossil fuel consumption. To save the planet, fossil fuels need to stay underground – unused by the greed of humankind. Our energy must come from wind, wave, hydraulic and solar sources, but this will be insufficient to maintain many of our industries and, consequently, many jobs will be lost.  Societies need to adapt so that acquisitive individualism is replaced by cooperative community life. Partly self-sustaining communities need to be created where home workers (ie, non-wage workers) can find worthwhile activity in home care, environment care, vegetable gardens, allotments, orchards, community social activities and other unpaid pursuits. To alleviate the potential poverty of those losing jobs, universal citizen’s income will be needed – recovered in taxation from those in wage-paying work. Come the next general election, would-be MPs should tell us how they propose to tackle climate change and how they intend to engage in worldwide discussion of necessary measures.Michael BasseyNewark, Nottinghamshire • Does Fiona Harvey go far enough in her judgment that emissions reduction, adaptation and coastal protection constitute the main “tools in the box” for averting such a disaster? An analysis of the stress exerted on our climate and ocean system by the growing excess of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere suggests an aim which is fundamentally more appropriate: the retrieval of this overload, with the goal of returning carbon dioxide’s concentration to its stable and pre-industrial level of 280 parts per million, from the present, and growing, 408ppm. Ultimately, taking care of the stressor would take care of the raised temperatures which we so rightly fear. Such a policy would demand a great deal of money, more perhaps than the public and financial institutions are currently willing to part with. And it would necessitate the worldwide adoption of technologies in which fossil fuels would no longer play a part. These technologies are known to many, and are already developing fast. We need to displace fossil fuels and embrace all that solar energy has to offer in the forms of electricity, heat and hydrogen derived from solar-electrolysed water. And we need to develop forms of enhanced photosynthetic growth, in expanding forests and in harvesting specially planted grasses, ensuring that the carbon thus embedded in their tissues is never returned to the atmosphere.Mike KoefmanDirector, Planet Hydrogen, Manchester • Fiona Harvey stated two profound truths. The first in the title; the second in the words: “As long as we continue to pump CO2 into the air, we are fuelling rises in temperature.” But it is the second truth that identifies the fundamental solution – to pump CO2 out of the air faster than the rate at which it is being pumped in. This is known as greenhouse gas removal, the subject of a 2018 report from the Royal Society, in which we read that “reducing emissions is not enough – we must also actively remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere”. So perhaps Fiona Harvey should be less dismissive of geoengineering. Funding a major project to develop large-scale ways to extract greenhouse gases from the atmosphere will save the planet.Dennis SherwoodRutland, East Midlands • Fiona Harvey says: “Melting permafrost releases methane, a greenhouse gas many times more powerful than CO2.” While the levels of methane gas should certainly be reduced, that phrase demonises methane over CO2. According to Simon Fairlie in his Meat: A Benign Extravagance, methane doesn’t stay in the atmosphere for longer than 12 years, while the same value of CO2 has its effect spread out over two centuries. By demonising methane, it will be more likely that rural communities whose modest lifestyles include a few ruminants and timber-fuelled sources of energy would be penalised over industrial-scale CO2 producers and users. This would be patently unfair.Ann SpencerHarefield, Middlesex • Fiona Harvey is absolutely right that there is going to be no wall high enough to keep out the consequences of inaction on greenhouse gas emissions. All the more disappointing therefore that she seems to buy into the Global Commission on Adaptation’s assumption that investment now is about buying us “trillions of dollars in potential growth”. That’s a priority one might expect from Bill Gates, but the work of thinkers from sociologists like Jem Bendell to economists like Tim Jackson now suggests that we won’t really get started on adapting and building resilience until we accept that growth of any kind is over. The planet simply cannot cope with any more of it. The vitally urgent need now is to find a just and viable post-growth way of life.John FosterDepartment of politics, philosophy and religion, Lancaster University • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

Image cropped from Twitter GIF file.
Here’s a short but interesting report on how all the climate alarmism in Germany is now taking a psychological toll, especially on the youth.
Hat-tip Die kalte Sonne.
German broadcaster RTL here has an article at its site titled: “Climate Change and Psyche: Burnout Courses for Demonstrators“. According to RTL:
One year after the start of the Fridays for Future protests in Lower Saxony, psychologists are observing that the climate crisis may be putting a heavy emotional strain on young people. Psychotherapists are therefore now offering free workshops, for example in the Hanover region. Nationwide, therapists have joined forces with “Psychologists for Future” – an environmental group of psychologists that now has 400 volunteers who want to support the climate activists.”
Die kalte Sonne comments: “If you preach climate catastrophe all day long, you will eventually believe it yourself. Then burnout is not far off. Fortunately there are now courses against it. Will the health insurance soon pay for it? Will ‘climate alarmism’ now be a recognized disease?”

Share this...FacebookTwitterTrees don’t absorb CO2 late evenings and at night, so it makes climate sense to move your barbecue from the evening to the morning, radical German environmentalists suggest. 
Also don’t use charcoal or real meat! And check your lighter fluid to be sure it’s not wrecking out atmosphere.

The wrong way to barbecue, German environmentalists say. Image: Barbeque block party Kansas City. CC BY-SA 3.0, Source: Wikipedia.
Today’s article may have useful tips for readers who feel compelled to worry about everything. For the rest of us, it’ll be entertaining. So grab yourself a bag of popcorn as we take a short trip through the wacky world of radical environmentalists.
Today’s topic comes from Germany’s chapter of Friends of the Earth, BUND Hamburg: how to barbecue in a more environmentally friendly way.
Use the proper charcoal
First the BUND Hamburg advises that if you insist on using charcoal, use only the stuff from European hardwood forests – not from tropical forests – and make damn sure it’s FSC certified.
And if burning what used to be living trees is not an acceptable option, then the BUND Hamburg suggests using “olive stone briquettes, which are made from the waste product of the olive oil production process. “No tree has to be used for this type of charcoal.”
The BUND Hamburg also suggests using grapevines, or barbecue charcoal made of bamboo or coconut shells – ” currently available mainly in organic markets.”
Don’t ignite with cancer-causing lighter fluid

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




When it comes to lighting up the grill, the BUND warns: “Under no circumstances should the grill be ignited with chemical ignition aids, paper or pine cones, as this releases carcinogenic substances.” Instead you need to to use “pressed wood with oil or wax, brushwood or wood shavings”.
Never grill real meat, instead grill eggplants!
Now that the grill has been lit and is hot enough for cooking, the BUND writes that under no circumstance shall you throw real meat on it. It doesn’t matter if this is what grilling is all about! The BUND recommends vegan and vegetarian foods during barbecues. Example meat substitutes the BUND recommends are: “peppers filled with mozzarella, grilled and pickled eggplants or mushrooms with herb butter” are enough.
Avoiding meat and sausage “protects the environment and climate”. Every single kilogram of beef “requires 15,000 litres of water and emits almost 30 kilograms of carbon dioxide,” says the BUND. “In addition, farm animals are usually kept in huge stables under conditions that are not appropriate for their species.”
“Piles of rubbish”
Another reason barbecues are bad thing is because they create “large piles of rubbish”. But, if you cannot the resist the temptation of having a summertime barbecue, then please at least have the courtesy of using “reusable barbecue utensils instead of plastic dishes and disposable barbecues,” the BUND Hamburg says. Also avoid the use of aluminum!
Barbecuing in the evening is bad for the climate!


Another tip is provided by career environmental whiner Georg Etschelt, who cites tips from a Hamburg newspaper:
Perhaps in order to alleviate the summer barbecue problem a little, the main barbecue times could be shifted by decree from the evening – when most people are at home and do not want to be disturbed – to the early morning.”
“This would also make sense from a climate policy point of view. ‘Trees absorb CO2 during the day, so hobby cooks should only use the barbecue during the day,’ was recently reported in the Hamburger Abendblatt newspaper on a course titled ‘Green barbecue.'”
“‘In the dark, the trees emit CO2, which is why they cannot absorb the gases from the barbecue.'”

Share this...FacebookTwitterAbout 70% of the Earth’s post-1980s vegetative greening trend has been driven by CO2 fertilization. More greening has offset or reversed 29% of recent anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Greening also has a net cooling effect on surface temperatures.
Earlier this year we highlighted a study (Haverd et al., 2020) asserting rising CO2 and warming are the dominiant drivers of Earth’s strong post-1980s greening trend. This greening expands Earth’s carbon sink so profoundly that by 2100 the greening of the Earth will offset 17 years (equivalent) of anthropogenic CO2 emissions.
A 17% offset over 80 years, or net CO2 emissions reversal, would easily supplant the effectiveness of Paris climate accord CO2 mitigation policies.

Image Source: Haverd et al., 2020
Now another new study (Piaoet et al., 2020) expands upon these same principles, further suggesting the net effect of more CO2-driven greening is more cooling and carbon sink expansion.
Since the 1980s, 29% of human CO2 emissions were cancelled out by the CO2-induced greening of the Earth. The post-2000 vegetative greening expansion has been so massive (5.4 million km²) its net areal increase is equivalent to a region the size of the Amazon rainforest.
“Vegetation models suggest that CO2 fertilization is the main driver of greening on the global scale, with other factors being notable at the regional scale. Modelling indicates that greening could mitigate global warming by increasing the carbon sink on land and altering biogeophysical processes, mainly evaporative cooling.”

===============================================
By AR Göhring at EIKE
(Text translated/edited by P. Gosselin)
Not only at Daimler, Volkswagen and others, but elsewhere the working people have to fear for their jobs after Brussels and Berlin have declared war on Germany’s most important industry. Now the automotive supply chain is also being hard hit.
Berlin, Brussels tighten the screws
The value-adding industry has already been badly shaken by the exaggerated, simply senseless corona measures of the Merkel IV government. Now the Brussels EU government (including former German minister Ursula von der Leyen) are tightening the screws even more as they love to ban internal combustion engines completely. The EU has just tightened the rules for limiting CO2 emissions. Not only the well-known car manufacturers are under pressure, but also their suppliers, hardly known by name, such as Mahle from Stuttgart.
Mass job losses

The globally producing parts manufacturer still has around 12,000 employees in Germany (72,000 globally). In the country, 2,000 workers are expected to lose their jobs, globally 7,600, and this despite a partial switch to e-car parts. It’s not enough, says a works council member, because there is no concept for the domestic combustion engine factories to convert over to electrical parts.
E-mobility not economically feasible
Why should there be, one might ask, since hardly anyone is buying e-cars anyway? Significant sales figures can only be achieved through massive tax incentives, but the government cannot keep this up forever. In other words, a complete “transformation” to e-mobility cannot be economically feasible.
It would make sense to downsize existing locations and let them settle for the winter. Only develop and produce burners in climate fanaticism-proof countries like Russia, Mexico and possibly the USA. As soon as Merkel’s energy transition in Germany crashes for all to feel and a rationally acting government comes to the helm again, the locations could be rebuilt and production could be brought back.
Highly skilled workers risk going idle
The problem is that machines and buildings are only a part of the company portfolio. The most important factor of a medium-sized manufacturer, however, is its skilled workforce, whose skills, acquired and honed over decades, are not so easily exported or imported. So Mahle and Co. would have to send their Swabian skilled workers with good programs and a lot of money to a safe foreign country for a few years. Is that possible? With difficulty. Home, mortgage, children, school, friends, family … skilled workers are people.
Mahle is unfortunately not the only supplier who is being needlessly driven out or exiled by the misguided caste of the political media. Well-known companies such tire manufacturer Continental will also have to take massive hits – Continental plans to cut 30,000 jobs worldwide.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA survey on climate science views conducted at Hans von Storch’s blogsite klimazwiebel has yielded some interesting results. Though the survey sampled only a small group of persons and not conducted scientifically, the klimazwiebel claims to be: “the only site which is almost equally well attended by skeptics and warmists, etc. Another factor that may help retrieve quite useable data is the good geographical distribution of survey attendees.”
Some findings:
1. The survey showed only a weak correlation between belief in AGW and political orientation.
2. Of all those counted, more than three quarters were non-alarmist, i.e. either lukewarmer, sceptic or denier.

I remember seeing Gallup polls listing Global Warming and Environment separately, and almost always near the bottom on the list of concerns. But I don’t ever recall GW being relegated to obscurity – but maybe I’m wrong here. Anyway the “climate crisis”, as Gore likes to call it, is not even among the top 10  concerns for Americans. Here are the latest Gallup poll results.

Maybe global warming has been lumped in under Environment, along with air and water pollution, littering, lawnmower noise and plastic bags.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe April 21, 2010 German edition of the Russian news website RIA Novosti has a piece with a possible explanantion as to why Antarctic sea ice is expanding while the rest of the globe is warming. http://de.rian.ru/science/20100421/126005955.html
A Russian scientist believes it is due to the ozone hole over the South Pole. According to Alexander Klepikov of the Research Instritute for Arctic and Antarctic at the Conference Maritime Research of Polar Regions of the Earth in the International Polar Year:
Over the last 3o years of satellite measurement, the growth of the ice amount in the Southern Ocean which surrounds Antarctica was more than 4 percent.
Klepikov emphasised that sea ice growth around the Antarctic coast was irregular and occurred at different areas. There was an especially large amount of sea ice growth in the Ross Sea located in the western part of the Pacific sector. Klepikov says British researchers, using mathematical models and analysis of meteorological data, could attribute the increasing sea ice trend to the so-called ozone anomaly in the South Pole region.
Reduced ozone concentrations over the South Pole leads to cooling of the upper atmosphere, and eventually leads to a strengthening of the circumpolar circular flow – winds that blow along the Antarctic coast and protect the Antarctic zone against the effects of warmer air. The same mechanism has the opposite effect on the Larsen Ice Shelf, causing increased melting.

Share this...FacebookTwitterRecently I wrote a post about Reiner Fuellmich, a German trial lawyer who is certified to practice in both Germany and California.
PCR test is a fraud
Over the years, Fuellmich has landed some awfully impressive trophies, among them Deutsche Bank and VW. Now he’s taking aim at Big Pharma and tech companies for what he considers to be crimes against humanity, mainly that the PCR test is a fraud. .
Designed to make people panic, submit to Big Tech
In a recent video he talks about how all the COVID-19 measures imposed, such as social distancing, wearing a mask, lockdown and quarantine are designed to “make people panic so that they believe without asking questions that their lives are in danger so that in the end the pharmaceutical and tech industries can generate huge profits from the sale of PCR tests, antigen and antibody tests and vaccines, as well as the harvesting of our genetic fingerprint.”
Hat-tip: Reader Sommer
Fuellmich sees nothing less than attempted crimes against humanity taking place.
What follows is his video on the subject, and well worth viewing.

It’s terrible what’s going on. People are made to believe that we are now bearers of dangerous pathogens and that we need to be continuously tested, drugged, covered up and controlled. We’re on the brink of what was once thought to be an unimaginable dystopia.

"Shane Warne has called for cricket to be “proactive, not reactive” about the dangers the sport faces due to the climate crisis, after being shocked by a report that called on the authorities to act now against “humanity’s most pressing challenge”. Warne was part of the MCC World Committee that was last month given a preview of the Hit for Six report, published on Tuesday, which examined the threats that face cricket-playing nations, many situated in areas of the world most vulnerable to the changing climate. “At times in the past, it has been hard to know who to believe, but I think we all have to admit now that climate change is a huge issue,” the former Australian leg-spinner said. “Scientists with proven facts are telling us things we can’t dispute about the rising temperatures, the rising sea levels. “Before I’d seen the report I hadn’t really thought about how it would impact the game of cricket. Some of the stuff that we were presented with: how hot it was for some of the players at certain times – up to 50 degrees in the middle – how dangerous it was for them. How the risks affects local club cricket, how clubs have had their changing rooms destroyed by flooding in the UK, how the rising temperatures affect the way grass grows, was scary.” The report, written by academics and sports scientists, focused particularly on how heat affects players and called for cricket’s administrators to protect players and reduce the game’s own carbon footprint. It pointed out that batsmen and women are uniquely vulnerable to the heat, covered up by protective clothing which limits their ability to sweat, and running a succession of 22-yard sprints for up to eight hours a day. It came up with a number of recommendations, from players wearing shorts to play being abandoned during the hottest parts of the day. “The game has to have a plan, a strategy for how we adapt for it. It wasn’t something I’d really talked about with ex-cricketers until this year at Lord’s. I was really taken aback,” Warne said.  “I’m lucky enough to be on these committees with some very intelligent people and I hope they can come up with something. I’m more than happy to put my hand up, and sit down at a round-the-table discussion.  “I have got three children – 22, 20 and just about to turn 18 – it’s a different world for them. People want to put their head in the sand, and say I’m not going to be around in 50 years. That’s just wrong.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn a just published 43-page paper, leading scientists and professors are calling for a completely new direction in climate policy after what they call “The Crash of 2009”. http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/mackinderProgramme/pdf/HartwellPaper07052010.pdf
This was made public this morning by Dr Reiner Grundmann, one of the paper’s authors, at http://klimazwiebel.blogspot.com.
In its Executive Summary, the paper states that climate policy “has failed to produce any discernable real world reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases in fifteen years”, adding:
…UNFCCC/Kyoto model was structurally flawed and doomed to fail because it systematically misunderstood the nature of climate change as a policy issue between 1985 and 2009.
In my view this paper reveals that many scientists and policymakers are now realising what many of us already knew: Radical regulation and taxation of carbon is not going to work. The paper proposes a much watered down version of what governments, interest groups and activists were previously pushing for. Its authors are still calling for a tranformation in energy supply and consumption, but in a more measured and targeted approach using low taxes and through the development of unsubsidised energy sources.
The authors say of their paper:
It explains radical and practical ways to reduce non-CO2 human forcing of climate. It argues that improved climate-risk management is a valid policy goal, and is not simply congruent with carbon policy.
Well at least governments now have an option: they can continue to allow energy policy to be formulated and driven by zealots, or they can hand the job over to the lukewarmers, who are promising a less painful approach, one that respects human dignity.

"Britain’s greenhouse gas emissions from road transport have continued to grow since 1990 despite more efficient cars because traffic has increased by almost a third, according to government figures. Cutting emissions on Britain’s roads remains a significant challenge, according to the report from the Office for National Statistics, citing a 6% rise in greenhouse gases in the past three decades. More fuel-efficient vehicles have mitigated but not stopped the increase in emissions, as traffic rates rose from 255bn miles travelled a year in 1990 to 328bn miles in 2018. Greenhouse gas emissions, primarily carbon emissions, or CO2, peaked in 2007 before levels of road traffic tumbled during the financial crisis. But road emissions have steadily risen again since 2013 to more than 118m tonnes in 2017, more than a fifth of the UK’s total emissions. Campaigners said the figures showed car use had to be curbed, and that private vehicles were “locking us in to a high-carbon future”. Car owners were encouraged by government in previous decades to switch to diesel, a policy that helped limit carbon emissions but contributed to worsening air quality in urban areas. Though greenhouse gas emissions improved relative to the volume of traffic, the slow rate of change has resulted in the transport sector overall – including rail and domestic aviation – overtaking energy production as the most polluting sector. Overall UK emissions dropped by almost a third in the same period. Jenny Bates, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “Despite noise made by vehicle manufacturers about cleaner petrol and diesel technology, transport is still the most climate-polluting sector and it’s clear petrol and diesel sales have to stop as soon as possible. Admittedly there has been some progress but the ever-increasing number of car miles is still locking us in to a high-carbon future, as well as causing health-damaging air pollution. “The only way to stop transport from leading us to further climate breakdown is to drastically cut the miles travelled by car. Cleaner options such as bicycles, buses and trains need to me made more accessible and more affordable, which will be good for the health of people and the planet.” Campaigners’ calls for a modal shift in transport come in the face of figures showing declining use of buses. The number of annual journeys in England has fallen by more than 300m in the last five years, to 4.3bn in the year to March, and the Local Government Association repeated warnings last week that half of all routes were at risk. Fares on buses, as on trains, have risen faster than inflation. China produces the most heat-trapping pollution, followed by the US. But historically, the US has contributed more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than any other nation. The US also has high emissions per capita, compared to other developed countries. And Americans buy products made in China, therefore supporting China's carbon footprint.  Hopes for bringing down emissions otherwise lie in the swift uptake of low- and zero-emission cars. The Tesla Model 3 helped sales of battery electric vehicles surge last month to a record 3.4% of the UK market, although there was an accompanying slump in sales of hybrids from last August, after subsidy cuts at the turn of the year. The business minister Nadhim Zahawi said: “As electric vehicle sales reach a record high, the potential of this market for the UK car industry and wider economy is huge. We are committed to achieving our aim for all new cars and vans to be effectively zero emission by 2040.” Although motor manufacturers have said the viability of that transition remains in doubt, in May the Committee on Climate Change recommended bringing forward the deadline so that only zero-emission vehicles would be sold after 2035. By the end of last year, while almost 2% of new registrations were ultra-low-emission vehicles, they comprised only 0.5% of all cars on UK roads, the ONS said. Research published on Monday by Go Ultra Low, a joint government and industry campaign to promote electric vehicle (EV) use, found that despite low current sales, EVs were regarded as increasingly normal. It found 69% of people expected “electric cars” to be referred to simply as “cars” by the end of the decade. Almost half cited concerns over the availability of charging points as the biggest deterrent to buying an electric car."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThanks to reader ThomasJ, who provided this link to a Norwegian documentary about bird-killing windfarms. It might take a few moments to load. And although the clip is in Norwegian, the pictures themselves tell the story. The Norwegian windfarms are turning once majestic landscapes into a nightmare. http://www1.nrk.no/nett-tv/klipp/282395
I’m also amazed at the number of websites, blogs, documentaries, reports, etc. popping up and casting light on this large-scale avarian slaughter by windmills. Expect resistance to this failed experiment to grow. The Green Movement is quickly proving to be an abject folly.
Aren’t all those windmills along Norway’s prestine natural coastline just lovely?
Update: No problem littering the landscape with bird-chopping windmills – but try putting up a new bridge. http://www.thelocal.de/society/20100513-27141.html

Share this...FacebookTwitterWe hear it from the panic-obsessed media and politicians all the time. Even kids too have to go to school with masks and maintain distance from one another. Large events are being called super-spreaders and so being shut down. Global travel restrictions abound.
The virus is far more dangerous than the influenza and we are living in a worldwide pandemic, they say. Moreover, all the world citizens are being told that restrictions – and vaccinations – may be mandatory. So get used to the idea. But it’s all for our own good, leaders and  media want us to believe.
All the panic, however, is based on rising “new cases”. And charts from Worldometer show that new cases are indeed on the rise in many countries and that the second wave has come!
But how dangerous is this second wave really?
Today we look at the statistic that really counts: the daily death rate. Here in Germany, where tens of thousands of anti COVID-19 restriction protesters are now being savaged by the media as ignorant everything under the sun because they dared to question the restrictions, the death rate has in reality been close to zero for some 2 months now.

Skyrocketing new cases in France, but deaths near zero!
Lately France has seen a sharp rise in “new cases”, as the chart below shows. But the next chart shows that despite all the “new cases”, there have been virtually no change in the number of daily deaths, which are very close to zero.

Viva bella Italia 
Next we look at the situation in Italy – the epicenter of the COVID pandemic earlier this year, which the media and leaders shamelessly used to spread mass panic worldwide.

Images cropped from worldometer.com
Also Italy has just experienced a “second wave” of the “deadly virus”, but as the above chart shows, there have been almost zero daily deaths since early July!
Experts also say that many of the new cases are not even showing any symptoms.
The story is very much the same at many locations around the world. Lots of testing, lots of false positives and so lots of panic reports – but the deaths in Europe are increasingly rare.
Time to end the public health insanity
Despite the low death numbers, the panic has taken on new, unprecedented dimensions of public health hysteria and absurdity.  Though the virus in combination with the lack of preparedness indeed had posed a risk earlier this year, the situation today is totally better now and there is no need to continue on with all the restrictions. Very few people are dying of it in Europe.
All the mass economy-killing restrictions are in fact leading to far greater death numbers, especially in poor countries. It’s time to end the insanity.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA new study finds that 26 to 19 thousand years ago, with CO2 concentrations as low as 180 ppm, fire activity was an order of magnitude more prevalent than today near the southern tip of Africa – mostly because summer temperatures were 3-4°C warmer.
We usually assume the last glacial maximum – the peak of the last ice age – was signficantly colder than it is today.
But evidence has been uncovered that wild horses fed on exposed grass year-round in the Arctic, Alaska’s North Slope, about 20,000 to 17,000 years ago, when CO2 concentrations were at their lowest and yet “summer temperatures were higher here than they are today” (Kuzmina et al., 2019). Horses had a “substantial dietary volume” of dried grasses year-round, even in winter at this time, but the Arctic is presently “no place for horses” because there is too little for them to eat, and the food there is to eat is “deeply buried by snow” (Guthrie and Stoker, 1990).
In a new study (Kraaij et al., 2020) find evidence that “the number of days per annum with high or higher fire danger scores was almost an order of magnitude larger during the LGM [last glacial maximum, 19-26 ka BP]  than under contemporary conditions” near Africa’s southernmost tip, and that “daily maximum temperatures were 3-4°C higher than present in summer (and 2-4°C lower than present in winter), which would have contributed to the high severity of fire weather during LGM summers.”
Neither conclusion – that surface temperatures would be warmer or that fires would be more common – would seem to be consistent with the position that CO2 variations drive climate or heavily contribute to fire patterns.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLeading German virologist Professor Hendrik Streeck is skeptical about a quick vaccine for COVID-19, reports t-online.de.

Virologist Prof. Hendrik Streeck. Image: Cropped here, University of Bonn. 
When asked in an interview why he was so skeptical, Streeck, director of the Institute of Virology at the University Hospital in Bonn, said
nobody can say exactly when the vaccine against Covid-19 will be available and thinks “a Covid-19 vaccine in the near future is unlikely”.
Currently several vaccine projects are currently in the final clinical trial phase on volunteers. Streeck told t-online: “It may be that the next vaccine will work wonderfully. But it may also be that all vaccines that are in Phase III do not work. This simply cannot be seriously predicted.”
To caution against a new vaccine, Streeck cites  a 1961 vaccine against RSV, where “everything went well” in initial tests on children. Later it turned out it could make the disease even worse. “As a result of the vaccine trials in 1961, two children who had previously received the vaccine died. We know the same phenomenon from dengue and other pathogens,” he told t-online.
He added another example: an AstraZeneca vaccine, which he says is likely to cause someone to become infected and so the ” virus can still be passed on”.
According to Streeck, it’s far too early to say when a vaccine will be ready and effective. “I’m just saying we don’t know.”
Streeck also criticizes the lack of coordination and cooperation in the research and some researchers are more concerned about their egos than getting good results. “The research is not done together, everyone tries to be the fastest for himself. This is a pity, because it is partly about delivering fast results, so that the individual distinguishes himself with a better publication,” Streeck told t-online. “A pandemic should lead to a distribution of tasks among all researchers. That is my vision for science, that we all work together – worldwide.”
Virologist Streeck is sure about one thing: ”There is no question that the number of infections will increase.”

"It is impossible to disagree with the Food and Land Use Coalition report’s findings ($1m a minute global farm subsidies ‘are destroying the world’, 16 September). Yet it would be wrong to dispense with all agricultural support programmes, particularly in the UK. Big changes are needed, but there will always be targeted support to certain sectors and farm types. First, we do need to support the small-scale, family-based business structure. This is the only way of sustainable farming in the uplands and less productive land areas. All land use requires management, even woodland. This is not poor resource use; it is supporting public benefit from business centres that would otherwise not be financially viable.  Second, good sustainable farming can be compatible with good wildlife and habitat management. I do it every day. But it requires some well-thought-out financial incentives in small, monitored quantities. Finally, we need a micro-management farm-level approach to this funding.

In the German edition of Ria Novosti, Russian scientist Oleg Pokrovsky of the Main Geophysical Observatory says the world should expect cooling – and not warming – and that this will interfere with Russia’s plans to exploit the Arctic’s rich resources. The climate has been cooling since 1998.
At a climate research conference for the Arctic and Antarctic in St. Petersburg, Friday, Pokrovsky said the Earth’s temperature fluctuates in 60-year cycles.
There isn’t going to be an ice age, but temperatures will drop to levels last seen in the 1950s and 1960s.
Pokrovsky adds:

Right now all components of the climate system are entering a negative phase.  The cooling will reach it’s peak in 15 years. Politicians who have geared up for warming are sitting on the wrong horse.
The Northeast Passage will freeze over and will be passable only with icebreakers.
Pokrovsky also claims that the IPCC, which has prophesized global warming, has ignored many factors. He also noted that most American weather stations are located in cities where temperatures are always higher.
We don’t know everything that’s happening. The climate system is very complex and the IPCC is not the final truth on the matter.

Share this...FacebookTwitterStarting tomorrow another Corona lockdown goes into effect in Germany
By A.R. Göhring
(Text translated/edited by P. Gosselin)
The government factions and the Greens decided on a significant increase in CO2 price – from 10 euros per ton up to 25 euros. Not only heating and filling the gas tank will become even more expensive from January 2021, but other sources of energy as well.
In the “climate package” of Autumn 2019, a price of 10 euros per ton of emitted CO2 was agreed upon, but this was criticized by the German Greens and their affiliated Fridays for Future organizations and numerous editorial offices because a curbing effect would not result from the low price.
In plain language, it probably means that not enough money is coming in to pay the profiteers, and therefore the many green lobbyists put pressure to raise the carbon price significantly. And with success: the German Parliament decided to more than double the price to 25 euros per ton.
And since the lockdown has already ripped huge holes in the wallets of many employees and self-employed persons since March, the rising prices of consumer products across the board will put German citizens economically under even more pressure.
Although taxpayers saw some relief from the lowered  value added tax to 16%, it is of no use: the reduction expires already on New Year’s Eve.
But, the additional additional revenue from CO2 taxes is also aimed at reducing the burden on citizens, for example the EEG feed-in levy to promote green electricity will be lowered and the commuters will be given tax breaks. But this does not benefit producers, which is why the German Chamber of Industry and Commerce has demanded subsidies. Not without reason: Otherwise, our companies could migrate to nearby foreign countries where no fanatic climate activists are at work.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWood pellets.
Swiss meteorologist Jörg Kachelmann calls it “the dumbest energy and environmental policy ever”. Now, finally, after years of being warned, Germany’s mainstream media are finally showing signs of waking up to it.

Idiots and energy policy: Burning of “CO2-friendly” wood pellets driving mass European deforestation. Illustrative photo by P. Gosselin
Germany’s flagship ARD public broadcasting recently presented a report earlier today about how “CO2 neutral” wood burning is leading to widespread deforestation across northern Europe – a rather embarrassing development for the Europeans, who  recently expressed their condemnation over Brazilian forest policy.
Deforestation up 49%
The ARD’s “Das Erste” reports how satellite images show deforestation has risen 49% since 2016 in Sweden, Finland and the Baltic countries. The reason: “Because of the CO2 targets. That sounds totally crazy but precisely because of the trend to renewable energies is in part responsible for deforestation in Estonia,” says the Das Erste moderator.

//-->




Having spent some time working for the EU, Liiana Steinberg explains in the report how she recently returned to her native Estonia and was shocked to see how much deforestation had taken place over the recent years (2:25). “I discovered how the forests no longer exists here left and right.”
For “CO2-neutral” wood pellets
Where once massive hardwoods once stood now grows tiny fir trees. The harvested trees, the report says, were used for wood pellets – a form of renewable green energy. The trees, the pellet industry says, will grow back.
Not only are the forests taking a hit, but so is the wildlife that once inhabited in them. According to Ms. Steinberg, bird life has fallen some 25%. “It’s wasted. Now we have to start all over again.”
Idiots “follow the science”
Climate activists, including the media like ARD, have long insisted that burning trees was good for the climate and environment because the emitted CO2 would simply be recycled back into nature – “follow the science” they insisted again and again.  But they failed to understand that trees, depending on their age, acted as sinks and that some 100 years of stored carbon would be unloaded into the atmosphere in just a matter of hours if burned for heat.
It’s sad that they are just waking up to this (maybe).

"The Fijian prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, has called on Australia to be “far more ambitious” in reducing greenhouse gases, linking the climate crisis to extreme weather events in the Pacific including drought and bushfires in Australia. On the final official day of his visit to Australia, Bainimarama nominated the “varied level of ambition when it comes to confronting the threat of climate change” as a key difference between the two countries and called for everyone to “unite behind the science” of limiting global heating to 1.5C.  Bainimarama’s visit follows his heavy criticism of Scott Morrison at the Pacific Islands Forum, where he said the Australian prime minister had insulted and alienated Pacific leaders over his failure to back stronger emissions targets. In a speech at the Australian War College in Canberra, Bainimarama said Fiji was seeking “common ground” with Australia, praising the two countries’ shared values and thanking Australia for its support in the aftermath of cyclone Winston. But Bainimarama said that nations – as with families – “only thrive when those living under the same roof are considerate of each other”, acting “in the collective interest of the household and not just their own”. A “degree of frankness that might sometimes offend” is essential to preserving any relationship, he said. “I understand that politics is the art of the possible. I understand the depth of feeling in coal-producing communities in Australia and the wider economic imperatives at state and federal level. “But I also hope that we can eventually find more common ground in our vuvale [partnership] on the climate issue. “Because it is the greatest threat to our security in the Pacific and for my own people, and other Pacific Islanders, the impacts are really starting to bite. “Not only extreme weather events like Winston but the rising seas and changes to agriculture and fisheries that threaten our food security and our livelihoods.” Bainimarama said that millions of Australians are also bearing the brunt of climate change, in recent bushfires, ongoing drought and severe water shortages. He said the “steady deterioration in the state of the only planet we have” means that all nations need to be more ambitious in cutting greenhouse gas emissions. “We must all unite behind the science and the IPCC report that calls for the average global temperature to be capped at 1.5C above that of the pre-industrial age.” Bainimarama called on Australia to “join us in stepping up our collective response to the climate threat”, including by putting the IPCC report back on the agenda at COP25 in Chile in December. “Fiji and the other Pacific nations have already declared a crisis in our own region in the Kainaki II Declaration arising from last month’s meeting of the Pacific Islands Forum in Tuvalu. “This was the strongest declaration from the PIF on climate and we appreciate Australia’s support as a signatory to the declaration.” Bainimarama suggested Australia could also help Fiji with renewable energy research, development and investment, reduce dependency on fossil fuels and increase carbon stocks through better management of landscapes and soils. Guardian Australia reported last week that Morrison will not attend the upcoming UN climate action summit despite him being in America to visit the Trump administration at the time – sending the foreign minister, Marise Payne, instead – because speaking slots were reserved for countries announcing new emissions reduction targets or financial commitments to the UN Green Climate Fund. On Sunday Labor’s climate spokesman, Mark Butler, recommitted to a target of net zero emissions by the middle of the century. He warned the Coalition’s target of 26% reduction by 2030 is “unanimously regarded as grossly inadequate, [and is] consistent instead with more like 3C or 3.5C of global warming, which would be utterly catastrophic”."

Taxes, surcharges and a catalogue of other fees make up 53.6% of Germany’s electricity price, only Denmark has a higher share at 67.8%. Only five European countries have seen electricity prices drop over the last 10 years.
Soaring prices in Latvia and Great Britain
No country has seen electricity rates rise more than in Latvia and Great Britain, where the price has risen a whopping 55% and 46% respectively over the past 10 years.
What’s behind the high electricity prices? According to the STROM-REPORT: “The biggest intra-European differences are caused by taxes and duties. The EU average is 36.6%. But the values vary from country to country and are highest in Denmark with 63.7%. In Germany, where the government-induced price components also account for more than half [52.3%] of the price, the EEG levy, which enables the expansion of renewable energies, is included at 21.5%.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterA survey appearing in the Journal Global Environmental Change shows climate scientists fly more often than other researchers. 
On average, climate researchers travel by plane more often each year than other scientists, the large, international survey and experimental study of academic travel found.
Especially professors, fly more than other researchers.
The paper’s abstract follows:




Aviation is a fast-growing sector, releasing more carbon dioxide per passenger kilometre than other transport modes. For climate change researchers, work-related travel – including for conferences and fieldwork – is a major carbon-emitting activity. At the same time, many argue that climate scientists have an important role in curbing their own aviation emissions to align their practices with their assertions in relation to emissions reduction. We examine the tensions between competing professional demands in relation to flying; measure levels of flying by climate and non-climate researchers; assess influences on choices and attitudes; and consider how information provision and structural changes might enable changes in practice. Study 1 entails a large, international survey of flying undertaken by climate change (including sustainability and environmental science) researchers and those from other disciplines (N = 1408). Study 2 tests effects of varying information provision on researchers’ behavioural intentions and policy support to reduce flying (N = 362). Unexpectedly, we find climate change researchers – particularly professors – fly more than other researchers, but are also more likely to have taken steps to reduce or offset their flying. Providing information about the impacts of aviation increases behavioural intentions and support for institutional policies to reduce flying, particularly amongst more pro-environmental respondents. However, while attitudinal factors (e.g., personal norm) predict willingness to reduce flying, structural/social factors (e.g., family commitments, location) are more important in predicting actual flying behaviour. Recent initiatives to develop a low-carbon and more inclusive research culture within climate science and the broader research community thus need to be supported by broader policies and technologies to encourage and enable low-carbon and avoided travel.




More than 1,400 scientists from 59 countries are being asked how often they fly and why. Most respondents came from the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Australia. Climate experts fly on average five times a year according to the study.
Experienced climate scientists fly 9 times a year
Also air travel becomes more frequent with increasing professional experience. Climate research professors fly nine times a year on average.
Lorraine Whitmarsh, environmental psychologist at the University of Bath, UK, who led the study, said: “These figures are pretty blatant and should be a wake-up call for the entire scientific community.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterScientists continue to document severe discrepancies between climate modeling and observations in newly published scientific papers.
1. Models run too hot and yield “unrealistically high” estimates of the climate’s sensitivity to CO2 forcing.
McKitrick and Christy, 2020
“All model runs warmed faster than observations in the lower troposphere and midtroposphere, in the tropics, and globally. On average, and in most individual cases, the trend difference is significant.”
“[W]e present evidence that the distribution of ECS [equilibrium climate sensitivity] values across the model is unrealistically high.”
2. Models can’t decide if cloud feedbacks are positive or negative. Half think they’re positive, the other half negative.
Block et al., 2020
“Very intriguing is however, that 7 out of 13 models show positive ΔR [cloud feedbacks] in the Arctic while the other 6 have negative values. This implies that half of the models analyzed here simulate local runaway climate systems in which the gain of energy is larger than the loss of energy if advection is not taken into account. These models increase the initial radiative perturbation rather than to reduce it. On the other hand, models exhibiting little warmings tend to be dominated by the negative Planck feedback and can be brought back to radiative balance without the contribution of advection.”
3. Long-term climate (rainfall) projections are “dubious” and almost “non-informative,”  calling into question their “theoretical and practical relevance.”
Iliopoulou and Koutsoyiannis, 2020

“A relevant case study by Lee and Ouarda (2010) concluded that predictions of decadal streamflow extremes using the NAO as a covariate were impacted by large uncertainty to the point of almost being non-informative.”
“From a systematic investigation of long-term rainfall records, corroborated by simulation results, we have verified that local trends have poor out-of-sample performance, being outperformed in their predictions by simpler models, as the local mean. This empirical finding suggests that the large inherent variability present in the rainfall process makes the practice of extrapolating local features in the long-term future dubious, especially when the complexity of the latter increases. This in turn questions the theoretical and practical relevance of projections of rainfall trends and the grounds of the related abundant publications.”

4. Contrary to climate model claims that warming induces perpetually rising positive feedbacks with water vapor, producing even more warming, the observed “buoyancy effect” suggests higher atmospheric water vapor means outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) is enhanced, not reduced. This negative water vapor feedback stabilizes the Earth’s climate and prevents runaway warming.
Yang and Seidel, 2020
“We propose that the vapor buoyancy effect can increase Earth’s OLR and helps stabilize Earth’s climate by regulating the atmosphere’s thermal structure. Figure 1 shows the temperature and virtual temperature (buoyancy) fields in the moisture space from 2°S to 2°N using NASA AIRS data. In the free troposphere (p < 850 hPa), buoyancy is horizontally uniform because of the small Cori olis parameter and efficient gravity waves (Charney 1963; Bretherton and Smolarkiewicz 1989; Sobel et al. 2001; Yang 2018a). However, temperature increases toward dry columns due to the vapor buoyancy effect. Moving toward the dry columns, moisture and its associated vapor buoyancy are reduced. To maintain uniform buoyancy, temperature has to increase.”
“Although there is no such constraints in the boundary layer, we can assume that ∆T = 0 at the surface temperature because of the uniform sea surface temperature (SST). We, therefore, require ∆T equals ∆TW BG in the free troposphere but smoothly decays to 0 at surface: ease with climate warming due to increasing atmospheric moisture, leading to enhanced OLR over the dry area. This is a negative feedback which can help to stabilize Earth’s climate.”

"Climate activists have welcomed the launch in the Northumberland countryside of a “vegan Silicon Valley”, which is aimed at helping to fight climate change. The 55-acre site, the brainchild of the entrepreneur Heather Mills, will offer manufacturing, storage and business space exclusively to vegan entrepreneurs and plant-based businesses.  The valley, 10 miles from Newcastle, has been nicknamed Plant-based Valley. There are hopes for it to be at the centre of a food revolution as the world increasingly turns toward plant-based diets and more people change their eating habits in an attempt to halt the climate emergency. Mills said it would make the region a “world centre for the creation of planet-rescuing ideas” and the “northern powerhouse for the brightest vegan minds”. She has previously given her backing to several vegan startups. In 2009 she launched a food range, VBites, which distributes products around the world. “This is not merely a business and investment enterprise, this is an enterprise on which the future of the planet is going to depend,” said Mills at the launch of the project at her VBites factory at Seaton Delaval, near Newcastle. “I have been warning about this for more than 20 years and it is now an accepted scientific fact, endorsed by everyone from the United Nations to David Attenborough to Greta Thunberg’s teens-based movement, that the cattle culture diet is having a disastrous effect on the climate and it threatens our very existence.” Climate activists and the Green party welcomed news of the launch, pointing out the need for humans to cut down on their meat and dairy consumption to halt climate breakdown. Alex Lockwood, a spokesperson for Animal Rebellion – a partner organisation of Extinction Rebellion – said the launch showed north-east England would take a leading role in the UK’s transition to a plant-based food system. “Newcastle and the north-east has a strong activist community and is rich in vegan cafes and eateries, but for animal justice activists this is fantastic news, because it is creating jobs that people can be proud of and shifting farm and slaughterhouse workers away from animal agriculture and into more secure and sustainable jobs,” Lockwood said. “The north-east was the seat of the industrial revolution. And here it is again, leading the way in the UK’s plant-based revolution.” Clare Oxborrow, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “As more people choose to eat less meat or cut it out altogether, this move to repurpose an abandoned factory site and support plant-based innovation could be a timely development.” The Green party’s deputy leader, Amelia Womack, said: “As the IPCC report argued a few months ago, we need to reduce our reliance on meat supply chain to reduce its impact on the climate. “The UK as a whole should support initiatives and businesses that give us healthy food and at the same time reduce our carbon footprint.” During the launch, Mills also called on the government not to abandon plans for HS2, which she said provided an “essential artery” for businesses in the north. “HS2 is not only crucial to bolstering the economy of the north and the north-east, it is indispensable to the key role that the [region] can have in providing a manufacturing innovation, which will be a lifeline not only for the UK but for the planet.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterMany people around the world play at online casinos, and thats fine if its your only source of gambling. However, online casinos situs bola are nowhere near as close to the real thing when it comes to simulation. Take Craps for example. The casino determines what number rolls by using a random number generator. However, just how random is random? If you have been in a casino, you know that every single person at a table has a unique rolling pattern. Some stack the dice and casually vault them into the air. Others shake them up and rocket them to the back wall, while other frequently launch the dice off the table or fall short of the back wall. There are even players who change their rolling pattern every roll or point.
An online casino does not have the ability to simulate this. Sure, they can manipulate the random number generator, but theres still no way to accurately simulate table action. Having programmed, I know that a random number generator is not all that random. Worse, if the computer simply picks a number, it is not even a proper setup to being with. Lets keep looking at Craps. Does the casino have a random number generator that simply picks a number between one and twelve? If so, all the numbers have an even shot at coming out, which is against true probability. Perhaps they list out all probable combinations and then the computer selects one. This would be a little more accurate, probability wise, but it still lacks the real randomness of live actionand weird events are more likely to ensue.
What Im about to tell you is true and happens more frequently that one would imagine. A tester recently played at an online casino (Craps) to monitor number frequency in the field. Within the span of just 150 rolls, the computer rolled 11 non-field numbers in a row and then followed it up a handful of rolls later by rolling 12 non-field numbers in a row. Whats the big deal you ask? Well, first, the field has a 44.5% chance of winning on every roll and second; the probability of throwing 11 non-field rolls in a row is .0015%. The probability of throwing 12 non-field numbers in a row is .0008%. These events should happen once every 667 rolls and once every 1176 rolls respectively, yet both where seen within a handful of rolls from each other within the 150 rolls monitored.
But wait, theres more. Within these same, now historic, 150 rolls, a six was not thrown for 13-16 rolls 5 times. The probability of not throwing a six 13 times is 14.5% (9% for 16 rolls)this happened 5 times in 150 rolls. The same happened to the eightin factthere were two instances where an eight was not thrown for 18-20 times. The probability of this happening is 5-7% and it happened twice.
When you add all of these things together, you get a more accurate picture of just how unrealistic random number generators are for simulating real casino action. I am not trying to scare you away from playing. In fact, money can be made and fun can be had at online casinos. However, you need to realize that you are playing in a different environment with different rules. You cant go chasing bets thinking they are overdue, mathematically, to come in, because this is a different world with a different way of producing outcomes. Playing strategies that you would use in a real live casino might not be applicable in an online casino.

"The climate crisis was on the agenda again at London fashion week on Monday, with sustainability experts and activists taking part in a symposium at the Finnish Institute focusing on creativity and sustainability. It was in keeping with fashion week so far, which has seen Extinction Rebellion activists stage a “die-in” and swarm the Victoria Beckham show, one of the week’s highest-profile events, hoping to force the industry to take the climate emergency seriously. The symposium was a follow-up to July’s Helsinki fashion week, which is open exclusively to designers and brands who produce sustainable collections. Similar events have already taken place in New York, and there are more planned for Paris and Milan – part of a programme focusing on sustainability and the identity of each host city. For London’s instalment, which was chaired by Helsinki fashion week’s founder, Evelyn Mora, creativity was deemed an appropriate topic given the British capital is, in her words, “the belly of the beast”, known for its fashion-forward approach to design.  The audience was a mix of activists and fashion insiders wearing Matrix glasses and cowboy boots. Hung around the space – and worn by model-activists Nimue Smit and Aine Campbell, who were in attendance – were garments from some of the designers who showed at Helsinki, including the young Liverpudlian Patrick McDowell (whose work using unwanted fabrics has garnered him big-name fans such as MIA), Ka Wa Key, young n sang and Bleu Chose. Mora, who founded Helsinki fashion week in 2014, said designers often asked her whether creativity is an obstacle to sustainability. For her, they are not mutually exclusive: “Innovation to me is no longer about travelling to the moon; it is about finding something new in the old.”  The panel also included Sara Arnold, a founding member of Extinction Rebellion; Charlotte Turner, the head of sustainable fashion and textiles at Eco-Age, a London-based sustainability consultancy; Dr Amy Twigger Holroyd, a professor of the school of art and design at Nottingham Trent University and Bel Jacobs, a former Metro fashion editor and Extinction Rebellion member. Each were invited to give their take on what creativity means. All agreed the focus need not be simply on creating new products, but also on finding solutions. Holroyd, who is a board member of the Council of Concerned Researchers in Fashion, said: “maybe answers already exist in different contexts and cultures.”  Jacobs spoke of creativity stemming from limitation, saying she had seen innovative design starting with what material was available – “I only have these things; what can I make with them?” – rather than with the end garment already in mind. She added that it was about rethinking what it is to be creative. Extinction Rebellion puts an emphasis on creativity via reusing what is already out there. Arnold said it was about “going into secondhand and vintage shops and finding something that means something to you and chimes with your personality,” as well as looking into your own wardrobe. As she pointed out: “we probably already have enough clothes in there to last us the next 20 years.” Jacobs pointed to Sara’s fashion-forward vintage glasses, often the subject of comments, for proof that “we’re not saying [we need to see] the end of creativity”. What did need to change, she said, was “the system of production, consumption, disposal.” Creativity will also be necessary in rethinking the fashion industry as a whole – according to Arnold, “we need to start envisioning another world.” Holroyd spoke of the need to acknowledge that the capitalist model was inherently unsustainable, while Mora said the industry was broken and needed to come together before it could move forward. Turner said getting companies to implement a living wage was key: “The whole fashion system is basically propped up by the fact they are currently able to employ people and not pay them a living wage.” A living wage, she said, “will force brands to realise that if they want to keep producing at such high volumes they will need to rethink their whole supply chain.” For Extinction Rebellion, solutions need to be drastic – in line with the 18 months some scientists say we have left to save the planet – and cannot work within the current capitalist system. They are hoping their London fashion week interventions, which will culminate in a funeral march for the fashion industry on Tuesday, will help. For Jacobs, the British Fashion Council (BFC) standing up and saying we are in a climate emergency would be a powerful step. While the BFC has spoken of a commitment to sustainability goals, it is a far cry from Helsinki fashion week, which is known, even among the eco-conscious fashion weeks of Scandinavia, as a pioneer. At this year’s instalment, animal leather was banned, with designers encouraged to use plant-based leathers and other sustainable textiles. While the picture is bleak – the 63% projected increase in global apparel consumption by 2030 sits uneasily next to news of melting ice caps and species being driven to extinction – there were also words of encouragement from the panel. Arnold put fashion at the heart of affecting change, rather than being simply an ill that needed remedying: “Think how you can use the communicative power of fashion to get this message out there,” she said, having earlier cited the practice of printing T-shirts people already own with slogans. “As a communication tool, fashion is so influential – we all have to put clothes on and that has power.” Holroyd spoke of “creating visions of alternative worlds” as a “creative, powerful, playful and highly subversive act”. Earlier in the talk, she also cited Ursula K Le Guin: “We live in capitalism, its power seems inescapable – but then, so did the divine right of kings.” "

Germany’s Dieter Nuhr slams “McCarthy-like mood” in science after DFB German Research Foundation takes down his statement. Image cropped from nuhr.de/
A message to Ramstorf, Mann, Greta, media, alarmists who declare their science as The Truth.
German, high profile satirist Dieter Nuhr, who earlier criticized Greta’s hysteria, recently saw his statement taken down by the German Research Foundation (DFG) in the latest wave of scientific censorship. 
What follows is Nuhr’s response to the DFG takedown of his statement he posted at Facebook, translated in the English (my emphasis added)
===========================================
“In July I was asked to send in a 30-second voice message on science for the German Research Foundation’s campaign #DFG2020. I made the following original statement:
‘Knowledge does not mean you are 100% sure, but that you have enough facts to have a reasoned opinion. But many people are offended when scientists change their mind: That is normal! Science is just THAT the opinion changes when the facts change. This is because science is not a doctrine of salvation, not a religion that proclaims absolute truths. And those who constantly shout, “Follow science!” have obviously not understood this. Science does not know everything, but it is the only reasonable knowledge base we have. That is why it is so important.’

‘The DFG would like to start by thanking you for your contribution.’ It wrote to me: ‘We thank you very much for your wonderful statement – your trenchant commentary on the relevance and explanation of science.’
The article was then published by the DFG and, due to the ‘strong and very critical response’, was taken down again on July 30th to ‘protect the DFG’ (quoted verbatim).
I find this more than alarming. The fact that criticism comes up when I express myself does not surprise me anymore. No matter what I say, as soon as it becomes public on the Internet, it gets met with organised hate. This is obviously a campaign organized in the Internet to discredit me as a participant in the forming of opinion. It is obvious that this is ideologically based, because I am politically critical of the left AND the right and I am always against any political extremism. This outrages both left and right fanatics, and since I also repeatedly express criticism of religion, I am also criticized from the religious side. As a satirist, you have to live with that.
What’s new is now an organization like the German Research Foundation, which should stand for free thinking like no other, is giving in to the ideologues on the Internet. This is not only astonishing, but also frightens me, because I now perceive a McCarthy-like mood in the country and, in the course of the Cancel culture, I also see the freedom of thought and research in general in danger.
I have been told by the DFG that it is necessary to ‘give in to criticism’ in order to ‘avert damage from the DFG’. I fear that the greater damage will be done if the German Research Foundation is involved in silencing critical and by no means extremist or conspiracy-theoretical voices.
I have never (!!!) argued in an anti-scientific way; on the contrary, I have always stood up against the misuse of science. One example: I have ALWAYS said that I think the Friday For Future movement is basically sympathetic, but that I find the phrase “Follow science” questionable because it suggests that there is one, untouchable opinion and solution strategy for climate change, because this way science is declared a narrative of redemption. That is the opposite of science.
There are different scenarios and different solution strategies not only among the population but also among climate scientists. It is even a basic condition of free research that different theses are allowed and discussed. This is what happens in science. In the public, however, diversity of opinion is increasingly actively suppressed by denunciation. Individual groups proclaim inviolable truths, claim that science is on their side and accordingly treat critical thinkers as heretics, then lump them together with madmen and conspiracy theorists and try to discredit them. That is Dark Ages and frightening.
In these times, shit-storms are increasingly replacing factual argumentation. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE RESPONSIBLE PEOPLE AT THE DFG TO HAVE FOUND SOMETHING “ANTI-SCIENTIFIC” IN ME, IF ONLY BECAUSE IT DOES NOT EXIST. They ‘reacted to criticism’. In other words, the DFG submitted to the rioters who systematically work on the Internet to suppress critical voices at the center of the political spectrum. No one can seriously place me on the fringes of politics anywhere.
The DFG is thus actively involved in pursuing criticism as heresy and muzzling dissenters. However, I consider this to be a phenomenon that seriously endangers democratic discussion, if only because it has reached the scientific community worldwide. At universities, however, massive efforts are being made everywhere to ensure that dissenters are no longer allowed in at all. This is not only outrageous, but frightening. What kind of country do we want to live in? In a country where public reflection is increasingly punished by denunciation and social exclusion? It scares me.”

"Australia’s minister responsible for drought and natural disasters, David Littleproud, now says he accepts the science on manmade climate change, and “[I] always have”. Littleproud’s comments to the House of Representatives on Thursday were entirely at odds with a written statement he made to Guardian Australia on Tuesday. In response to questions, Littleproud said: “I don’t know if climate change is man-made.” “I’m about practical outcomes, whether that’s about having a cleaner environment or giving farmers and emergency services the right tools to adapt,” the minister said in that statement. “I am responsible for making sure we have the tools we need to adapt to a changing climate.” Guardian Australia approached Littleproud to clarify his position after comments he made to the ABC at the start of the week about the relationship between early spring bushfires in Queensland and climate change. David Littleproud - Australia’s minister responsible for drought and natural disasters - now says he accepts the science on man-made climate change: ‘I’m just a poor humble bloke with a Year 12 education but I’m prepared to accept what our scientists are telling us"". pic.twitter.com/dQljftGhpp On Monday, Littleproud told ABC’s Radio National that Australia has been “adapting to a changing climate since we first settled this country and we’ll have to continue to do that and do that with the best science we’ve got available.” When asked whether human-induced climate change was making bushfires more intense, Littleproud replied: “We’re adapting to it as the climate continues to change and we’ll continue to equip our service workers … Whether it’s manmade or not is irrelevant.” The link between rising greenhouse gas emissions and increased bushfire risk is complex but, according to major science agencies, clear. Climate change does not create bushfires, but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity.  The Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk. Dry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth.  Dryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past. The year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 has been the fifth driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970. Not a significant one. Two pieces of disinformation, that an “arson emergency”, rather than climate change, is behind the bushfires, and that “greenies” are preventing firefighters from reducing fuel loads in the Australian bush have spread across social media. They have found their way into major news outlets, the mouths of government MPs, and across the globe to Donald Trump Jr and prominent right-wing conspiracy theorists. NSW’s Rural Fire Service has said the major cause of ignition during the crisis has been dry lightning. Victoria police say they do not believe arson had a role in any of the destructive fires this summer. The RFS has also contradicted claims that environmentalists have been holding up hazard reduction work. The minister suggested there were “extremes from both sides” of the debate, which should be about “do we want to breathe healthy air”. He said his job was to ensure emergency services “are given the tools and resources they need, [and] they have the science to understand that these events could become more severe”. Asked by Guardian Australia why he had stepped around the human contribution to climate change given expert scientific advice on the increased frequency of really bad fire days, Littleproud’s office supplied a written answer attributable to the minister: “I don’t know if climate change is man-made.” Later on Tuesday, Littleproud told Sky News in response to a question from the network’s political editor, David Speers, about whether manmade climate change was real: “I am going to be honest with you – I don’t have an opinion.” But Littleproud launched a complete about-face in parliament on Thursday, saying: “I accept the science on manmade impact on climate change. Always have.” “I accept the science. I’m just a poor humble bloke with a year 12 education but I’m prepared to accept, prepared to accept what our scientists are telling us – it’s as simple as that.” Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In defence of his position, Littleproud pointed to his positive record on climate change, which included driving a climate adaptation response in the agriculture portfolio. In an interview with Guardian Australia last June, Littleproud said the climate was changing and the transition in the energy market – with renewables displacing traditional generation sources – was “exciting, not only for the environment but for the hip pocket”. The Queensland National said then the climate had been changing “since we first tilled the soil in Australia” and he did not care whether the change was due to human activity or not. “I’m not losing any sleep on that, whether you want to prove it is manmade or not – I want to be pragmatic.”"

"Two-thirds of Americans believe climate change is either a crisis or a serious problem, with a majority wanting immediate action to address global heating and its damaging consequences, major new polling has found. Amid a Democratic primary shaped by unprecedented alarm over the climate crisis and an insurgent youth climate movement that is sweeping the world, the polling shows substantial if uneven support for tackling the issue. More than a quarter of Americans questioned in the new CBS News poll consider climate change a “crisis”, with a further 36% defining it as a “serious problem”. Two in 10 respondents said it was a minor problem, with just 16% considering it not worrisome at all. More than half of polled Americans said they wanted the climate crisis to be confronted right away, with smaller groups happy to wait a few more years and just 18% rejecting any need to act. “Americans are finally beginning waking up to the existential threat that the climate emergency poses to our society,” said Margaret Klein Salamon, a clinical psychologist and founder of the Climate Mobilization Project. “This is huge progress for our movement – and it’s young people that have been primarily responsible for that.” But while nearly all of those questioned accept that the climate is changing, there appears to be lingering confusion over why and scientists’ confidence over the causes. There is a consensus among climate scientists that the world is heating up due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels for electricity generation and transportation, as well as cutting down forests. However, just 44% of poll respondents said human activity was a major contributor to climate change. More than a quarter said our impact was minor or nonexistent. There is an even starker split on the findings of climate scientists. According to the CBS poll, 52% of Americans say “scientists agree that humans are a main cause” of the climate crisis, with 48% claiming there is disagreement among experts. “This remains a vitally important misunderstanding – if you believe global warming is just a natural cycle, you’re unlikely to support policies intended to reduce carbon pollution, like regulations and taxes,” said Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, which has made similar findings in its own, long-running polling. “These results also again confirm a longstanding problem, which is that many Americans still believe scientists themselves are uncertain whether human-caused global warming is happening. “Our own and others’ research has repeatedly found that this is a critical misunderstanding, promoted by the fossil fuel industry for decades, in order to sow doubt, increase public uncertainty and thus keep people stuck in the status quo, in a ‘wait and see’ mode.” Similar to previous polls, the CBS research finds sharp ideological differences in attitudes to the climate crisis. While nearly seven in 10 Democratic voters understand that humans significantly influence the climate and 80% want immediate action, just 20% of Republicans think humans are a primary cause and barely a quarter want rapid action. On the science, nearly three-quarters of Democrats said almost all experts agree that humans are driving climate change, with just 29% of Republicans saying the same. Age is another key variable. While 70% of 18- to 29-year-olds think climate change is a serious problem or crisis, just 58% over 65 concur. Younger people are far more likely to consider it a personal responsibility to address the climate crisis and to believe that a transition to 100% renewable energy is viable. Young people have been galvanized by climate science being taught in schools as well as a spreading global activist movement spearheaded by Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teenager who started a wave of school walkouts to demand action. Thunberg recently arrived in the US on a solar-powered yacht, ahead of a major United Nations climate summit in New York on 23 September. This generational divide even cuts across party affiliation, with two-thirds of Republican voters aged under 45 considering it their duty to address the climate crisis, according to the CBS poll. Just 38% of Republicans aged over 45 feel the same. “Younger Republicans are much more convinced climate change is a crisis and are supportive of action than older Republicans – which has big implications for the future of the party,” said Leiserowitz. Around three-quarters of all respondents said they understand that climate change is melting the Arctic, raising sea levels and causing warmer summers. A further two-thirds accept that hurricanes will be made more severe by global heating. Hurricane Dorian, which recently devastated parts of the Bahamas, made 38% of Americans more concerned about the climate crisis, with 56% unswayed. Leiserowitz said that the relationship between extreme weather events and concern over climate change is a complex one, with people already worried the most likely to say that their alarm has increased when a major storm or flood hits. Regardless of concern over climate change there appears to be skepticism among Americans about how much humans can do about it. Just 19% said humans can stop rising temperatures and the associated impacts, with nearly half thinking it possible to slow but not stop the changes and 23% refusing to believe humans can do anything at all. This may well influence the views of leading presidential contenders’ climate plans. Democratic hopeful Bernie Sanders, for example, has proposed a rapid remodeling of society where planet-warming emissions from transport and power generation are eradicated within just 11 years. “By saying we should merely slow and not reverse global warming, we are passively accepting the deaths of billions of people,” said Margaret Klein Salamon, of the Climate Mobilization Project. “The only thing that can protect us is an all-out, all-hands-on-deck mobilization, like we did during the second world war. Avoiding the collapse of civilization and restoring a safe climate should be every government’s top priority – at the national, state and local levels.”"
"Media interest in natural disasters concentrates on events such as hurricanes that happen over a short period in a specific area. Sometimes, though, destructive weather effects build up gradually across a region over many months, like the floods afflicting the American midwest this year. A blizzard described by the National Weather Service as “of historic proportions” in March added to already deep snow cover. Spring rains rapidly melted the snow and the inundation began. Above-average rainfall has continued through August, and a slow-motion disaster has played out.  Farmlands and roads have been flooded, and communities evacuated. Emergencies were declared over a wide area, with 11 states requesting federal disaster relief. One Nebraska official described the flooding there as “biblical”. Satellite data indicated that the Missouri, Mississippi and Arkansas rivers had all reached record-breaking levels. Millions of acres of farmland have been underwater for months. There have been few deaths, though, and the communities affected are mainly in poor rural areas, so the floods rarely make the national news. The damage already runs to billions of dollars, but a full assessment is impossible until the waters recede and the impact on the harvest is known. Recovery is likely to take at least a decade, and this would be set back if there is further flooding during that period."

Share this...FacebookTwitterHaving received a request to cease and desist airing the famous self-made “Hide the Decline” G-rated YouTube political satire video, the Minnesotans For Global Warming have grown weak-kneed and decided to take down the video, which had been viewed more than half a million times on YouTube and was even featured on the Rush Limbaugh show (20 million listeners). But Michael Mann, the target of its satire, was not amused. And when the cat says meow, mice run.
Of course I’m not familiar with the details and legal fine points of the issue, but I have seen much worse go unchallenged. When George W. Bush was President, much worse videos were made. Barack Obama has to take the same treatment too – like all public figures.  Obviously the video had gotten under Mann’s thin skin. Mann, a professor at Penn State, creator of the phony, discredited hockey stick graph, a public employee as far as I know, has demanded that the M4GW stop practicing its right to free speech.
Personally I can’t believe the M4GW waved the white flag so quickly. I thought they had more guts than that. But I guess Beauregard’s French genes got the best of him. Now some goofball No Cap & Trade organisation will have to storm the beach and take the bullets.  M4GW have sent a disturbing message by cutting and running.
They ought to put the video back up and take Mann on like a man.
And what do I think of the NO Cap & Trade Hide the Decline II?  It’s crap. But I’m sure they’ll be enough dim bulbs out there who will accept it and think it’s cute.  Bring back the original!

The German Research Foundation is back, again in favor of diversity of scientific opinion! Image: Galileo fails to change Catholic Church doctrine.
After widespread criticism, the German Research Foundation (DFG) has decided to reverse its July 30th decision to take down a dissident climate science statement from prominent German satirist Dieter Nuhr (background here).
The DFG has put Nuhr’s statement back online again after realizing it had blundered when it caved in to activists and had not acted in the interest of science (pdf here).
What follows is DFG’s new statement in English (my emphasis added) expressing its regrets and announcing that Mr. Nuhr’s statement has been put back:
The DFG expressly regrets that the statement by Dieter Nuhr was taken hastily from the website of the online campaign #forknowledge. Mr. Nuhr is a person who stands at the heart of our society and is committed to science and rational discourse. Even if his pointed satirical nature may be irritating for some people, an institution like the DFG in particular is committed to the freedom of thought based on the Enlightenment. We have therefore reinstated his statement. The discussion about his statement exemplifies the developments that currently characterize many public discussions about science.

“A culture of debate has developed in various sectors of our society, in which it is often not the objective and stronger argument that counts, in which less is listened to and inquired about, but rather increasingly judged and condemned hastily. Instead of joint dialogue, increasingly polarized and divisive debates are taking the place of mutual dialogue. Particularly in the case of central issues such as climate change or the coronavirus pandemic, this hinders the really necessary discussion of scientific topics and the constructive exchange between science and society. Scientists who make their findings public and describe political options for action are increasingly the target of unobjective attacks and personal defamation. This also applies to social movements that advocate science and publicly call for scientific findings to be made more of a basis for decisions and actions.”
“These developments are not beneficial to society and are all the more worrying as science plays a central role in meeting current challenges, with which it is currently strongly perceived and valued in society. For its part, it is dependent on a critical, OPEN and constructive culture of communication.”
“The DFG would like to take these observations as an opportunity to initiate an intensive debate on the current debate culture surrounding science. The DFG stands for diversity of opinion and freedom of expression as well as for a differentiated culture of discussion. It will continue to do everything in its power to achieve this in the future – together with other figures from science, media, politics and other areas of society, both in Germany and abroad.”
What follows below is Nuhr’s original statement which the DFG “hastily took down” when it caved to public pressure from activists and ideologues. There’s nothing wrong with this statement:
Knowledge does not mean you are 100% sure, but that you have enough facts to have a reasoned opinion. But many people are offended when scientists change their mind: That is normal! Science is just THAT the opinion changes when the facts change. This is because science is not a doctrine of salvation, not a religion that proclaims absolute truths. And those who constantly shout, “Follow science!” have obviously not understood this. Science does not know everything, but it is the only reasonable knowledge base we have. That is why it is so important.”
Now after public outrage across Germany, Nuhr’s statement has been reinstated. A big victory for open science!

"This week I had a mole checked on my leg and my doctor quickly agreed it should be removed. While I contemplated the anxiety of what that could mean I did not sit there wondering which day it was that I got sunburned which caused the corruption of a cell that has started to turn the mole abnormal. Was it from the time I spent summers working as a fruit-picker during university? Or those many afternoons down on the banks of the River Murray swimming with friends during high school? Was it the time I got absolutely burned to a crisp on an overcast day holidaying on the Gold Coast in my early 20s? We don’t ask this because it is in essence unanswerable, but we also know that – as the advert says – every tan is doing you damage. And I know that my lack of care during my youth while out in the sun is the reason I am going to get the mole removed (and hopefully will not require much more surgery after that). We don’t stop to ask for a specific causal event to give us proof of the link between sunburn or a tan and skin cancer. And yet change the topic to climate change and immediately we demand specifics. This week the fires burning in southern Queensland, though started by a vandal, thrived in conditions brought about from climate change. The summer ahead looks to be a horror one for bushfires, with the latest Bureau of Meteorology outlook suggesting most of the continent has a less than 30% chance of exceeding its average rainfall for October to December. But were the bushfires this week caused by climate change? No – at least not definitively so. It is quite difficult to attribute any individual bushfire or cyclone or drought to climate change, because what climate change affects is long-term trends – trends that will see more droughts and less rainfall in certain areas, as well as conditions more conducive to longer bushfire seasons. It is much the same as with gun laws in the US. The lack of gun laws does not cause every single gun fatality to occur, but they cause a situation that makes gun fatalities much more likely to occur. While with melanoma we grasp the long-term and act and adapt accordingly – actions that help reduce the likelihood of melanoma through “slip-slop-slap”, and adaptation required in lieu of being unable to reverse the past (ie checking moles for changes). But on climate change we are like some old bloke who has spent his life in the sun saying sunburn never killed him, all the while ignoring the mole on his back growing larger and more discoloured every month. Most of our politicians – and certainly our government – are not even at the stage of adaptation, let alone ready to take actions that might prevent further damage. The link between rising greenhouse gas emissions and increased bushfire risk is complex but, according to major science agencies, clear. Climate change does not create bushfires, but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity.  The Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk. Dry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth.  Dryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past. The year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 has been the fifth driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970. Not a significant one. Two pieces of disinformation, that an “arson emergency”, rather than climate change, is behind the bushfires, and that “greenies” are preventing firefighters from reducing fuel loads in the Australian bush have spread across social media. They have found their way into major news outlets, the mouths of government MPs, and across the globe to Donald Trump Jr and prominent right-wing conspiracy theorists. NSW’s Rural Fire Service has said the major cause of ignition during the crisis has been dry lightning. Victoria police say they do not believe arson had a role in any of the destructive fires this summer. The RFS has also contradicted claims that environmentalists have been holding up hazard reduction work. I had a check of my skin because this week the Labor MP Jason Clare tweeted an image of his bandaged leg after he had had a melanoma removed. It was one of those cases where whenever you hear of anyone who has had a melanoma removed it is used as the perfect time to remind everyone to go get checked, to wear sunscreen and to do all you can in effect not to get skin cancer. But when a bushfire or a cyclone or a drought occurs, there is conversely always the push to not politicise it, to not talk about climate change. I suspect this is because if we did so we might have to start wondering why we were not doing anything about it. So we had the bizarre situation this week of the minister for natural disasters, David Littleproud, telling Guardian Australia in writing that “I don’t know if climate change is manmade”. He then went on Sky News and told the same thing to David Speers before in parliament on Thursday suggesting that it was all a mistake and he really does think climate change is manmade. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Littleproud is not one of the climate change looneys in the government, so it did smack a little bit of him seeking to placate the ignorant in his party before realising that it made him look ignorant before the entire nation. The ALP was not exactly covering itself in climate change sunscreen this week either. On Wednesday the Greens moved a motion which, after acknowledging the early fire season and the critical role of emergency services, called on the government to “urgently take action to address climate change and manage the risk and severity of bushfires, invest in community adaptation efforts to build resilience to climate change in moderate and high risk areas, and commit to action to progress a rapid and just transition to clean and renewable energy sources to reduce the harmful emissions driving climate change”. In essence, to act and adapt. The ALP voted against the motion because, as senator Katy Gallagher stated, it sought “to politicise the emergency in Queensland, where 72 fires are currently burning”. The ALP senator Murray Watt echoed these thoughts on Twitter and he replied when I (and others) criticised him by referring to a speech he had made on the issue the day before. In that speech on the bushfires his one reference to climate change was this: “It is of concern that so many bushfires of this severity are occurring so early in the year, and this should prompt further thought by all in this place.” Yeah. That’ll do it. It is bizarre the Cancer Council hasn’t gone with the campaign slogan of “the growing number of moles on your body should prompt further thought”. We need to be as loud and active about combating climate change as we are about skin cancer. Stop seeking excuses not to act, stop demanding definitive proof for every single incident, and look at the overall trends. We need to use the moments when bad things happen to remind everyone that further action and further adaptation is needed unless we want to see more severe events occur more often. Oh, and also go have a mole check up. Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist"

Share this...FacebookTwitterA new potentially dangerous fungus seems to have appeared in the Northwest US and British Columbia, this according to Reuters. http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/N22129903.htm
‘This novel fungus is worrisome because it appears to be a threat to otherwise healthy people,’ said Edmond Byrnes of Duke University in North Carolina, who led the study.
When I was reading this, I thought it’s just a question of time, maybe a few days, before someone claims it’s all because of climate change. Well I didn’t have to wait long. The last sentence of the report:
Freezing can kill the fungus and climate change may be helping it spread, the researchers said.
So there it is. Everytime something potentially threatening appears, the first suspect is automatically climate change. It’s gotten that bad.

Doran et al (2002) reported “a net cooling on the Antarctic continent between 1966 and 2000”.

Image Source: Doran et al., 2020
Obryk et al. (2020) – with P.T. Doran a co-author – have extended the Doran et al. (2002) record to 2017 and found the -0.7°C cooling that lasted from 1986 to 2000 persisted until 2006. A recovery since 2006 has been observed, but not enough to be documented as statistically significant.

Image Source: Obryk et al., 2020
Turner et al. (2020) report cooling of the Antarctic Peninsula since about 2000 and no net warming in East Antarctica since the early 1980s.

Image Source: Turner et al. (2020)
Hrbáček and Uxa, 2020 report a “significant air temperature decrease started around 2000 along most of the Western AP [Antarctic Peninsula].” Specifically, “the north‐eastern AP region exhibited a MAAT more than 1°C lower in the period 2006–2015 compared to 1996–2005, and autumn (MAM) air temperature was even about 1.5°C lower.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe forcing uncertainties and lack of observational measurements in the top-to-bottom global ocean preclude an assessment that modern warmth is due to anthropogenic activities.
Key points from a new paper (Gebbie, 2021):
• 93% of the changes to the Earth’s energy budget, manifested as warming of the Earth system, are expressed in the global ocean. Just 1% of global warming is atmospheric.
• Even with the advent of “quasi-global” temperature sampling of the ocean since 2005 (ARGO), these floats “do not measure below 2,000-m depth.” This means that temperature changes in “approximately half the ocean’s volume” are still not being measured today.
• To detect the effects of anthropogenic forcing, it would require energy budget imbalance measurement precision of 0.1 W/m² at the top of the atmosphere (TOA). Uncertainty in the forcing changes affecting climate are ±4 W/m², meaning that uncertainty is about 80 times greater than an anthropogenic signal detection.
• Past changes in global ocean heat content, such as the last deglaciation, have been 20 times larger than modern changes.
• Ocean heat storage during the Medieval Warm Period (Medieval Climate Anomaly, or MCA) was much greater than modern. Modern global ocean heat uptake is “just one-third” of what is required to reach the levels attained during Medieval times.

One final point. Dr. Gebbie asserts that approximately 15% of modern global warming (ocean) can be attributed to geothermal heat fluxes through the sea floor that “persistently heat the ocean.” Interestingly, he also assesses that the value attained for geothermal heating of the ocean, 87 mW/m², is similar to that which is required to end a glacial period (melt ice sheets) and transition into an interglacial.

Images Source: Gebbie, 2021
Considering the ocean bottom waters warmed up 2°C from 19,000 to 17,000 years ago about 1,000 years before the surface warmed (and CO2 began rising) (Stott et al., 2007), and that Arctic bottom waters were 6-10°C warmer than today at the beginning of the Holocene about 10,000 years ago (Beierlein et al., 2015), geothermal heat fluxes could potentially explain a large portion of glacial-interglacial transitions – as well as millennial-scale global ocean temperature changes.

Wetteronline.de also noted that on Germany’s highest mountain, Zugspitze, “about 30 centimetres of fresh snow fell in the morning at minus 2 degrees.”
“Employees of the Zugspitzbahn were in continuous operation to clear paths and the visitor platforms from the summer snow masses.”
DWD national weather service labels a cooler than normal July “quite warm”
Meanwhile Germany’s DWD national weather service recently issued what I’d call a press release that is designed especially for stupid and lazy journalists who won’t bother fact-checking. In its preliminary report on July weather in Germany, the DWD announced that the mid summer month this year was “rather warm”.
According to the DWD, the average temperature in July for Germany was 17.7°C, which was “0.8°C above the value for the internationally valid reference period 1961 to 1990.”
But what the DWD fails to tell us is that the 1961-1990 period was a cold one. And not only that, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) no longer uses the 1961-1990 reference period. Instead it uses the 1981-2010 period to calculate the means.
The DWD does mention that July 2020 was 0.3°C too cold compared with the valid reference period 1981 to 2010. So at the DWD, 0.3°C below the valid mean is in their eyes “rather warm”.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHave you ever read something about yourself in the newspaper and thought: “Man, they got it wrong”?
Yesterday I summed up in English and posted a German-language piece put out directly by RIA Novosti (see post from yesterday) http://de.rian.ru/science/20100423/126040500.html.  Then a few hours later WUWT posted an English version of the same story released by the UPI. The two versions could hardly be different. It’s one thing to get some things wrong, but it’s quite another to write a whole new story.
1. The UPI opens with:
A Russian scientist says the Arctic may be getting colder, not warmer, which…
But the German version, direct from RIA Novosti, says:
Not warming, but cooling will impact the Earth’s climate over the next few years….

2. The UPI wrote:

An Arctic cold snap that began in 1998…

But the German version says:
The climate has been cooling since 1998…  
When translating, you’ll rarely get it 100% right. Translators try to get as close as possible. But here there really is no excuse for screwing up cooling will impact the Earth’s climate and writing instead: Arctic may be getting colder.  In no. 2 they translate “climate“ to “Arctic“!
The UPI then leaves out (censors?) a large portion of the text as well. For an issue on which the future of humanity hinges, one that is as grave as WWII, the UPI translation sure was awfully careless. It gets a failing grade. Readers – check your sources!

Share this...FacebookTwitterPrompted by the observation that dramatic COVID-related reductions in 2020 human CO2 emissions had zero impact on the Earth’s CO2 concentration, two scientists conduct extensive statistical probability analyses to conclude temperature changes lead CO2 changes, not the other way around.
The nearly global acceptance of economically-devastating lockdowns as a mitigating response to the COVID-19 pandemic has inspired many to question the assumption humans drive changes in CO2 concentration.
As Drs. Koutsoyiannis and Kundzewicz  point out in their iconoclastic new study, “despite unprecedented decrease in carbon emission, there was an increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration, which followed a pattern similar to previous years.”

Image Source: Koutsoyiannis and Kundzewicz, 2020
Utilizing the obvious condition that causes precede effects, or that effects do not lead causes, the authors first point out that the paleoclimate record shows CO2 changes follow temperature changes by about 1000 years. Then they examine the sequential relationship between global temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentration during 1980–2019.
While they find the causality direction for CO2 leading temperature (T) changes does exist, the results of their study clearly “support the hypothesis that the dominant direction is T → CO2,” not CO2 → T.
In fact, the statistical probability is so robust “the p-values in the direction T → [CO2] are always smaller than in direction [CO2] → T by about 4 to 5 orders of magnitude, thus clearly supporting T → [CO2] as dominant direction.” Temperature is shown to lead CO2 changes by about 6 months to a year.
Drs. Koutsoyiannis and Kundzewicz acknowledge the perspective “CO2 → T prevails in public, as well as in scientific, perception.” So they point out that an IPCC analysis has natural ground (soil) CO2 emissions reaching 114 to 119 gigatons of carbon (GtC) per year, whereas ground (fossil fuel) emissions from anthropogenic sources only amount to 8 or 9 GtC per year. Consequently, the “change in carbon fluxes due to natural processes is likely to exceed the change due to anthropogenic CO2 emissions” as the “the intensity of biochemical process increases with temperature [and] leads to increasing natural CO2 emission.”

This study is not without precedent. Another analysis of the temperature-CO2 phase relation for 1980-2012 (Humlum et al., 2013) indicated “changes in atmospheric CO2 are not tracking changes in human emissions” and “changes in global atmospheric CO2 are lagging 9.5-10 months behind changes in global air surface temperature.”

Atmospheric physicist Dr. Murry Salby authored a textbook highlighting the dependence of CO2 emissions on temperature. He insisted that “a significant portion” of the recent increase in CO2 “derives from a gradual increase in surface temperature” (pg. 253).
But there is also a “major inconsistency” in the currently accepted paleoclimate and straight-line (Mauna Loa) CO2 progressions, as they imply CO2 molecules do not respond to temperature like they are observed to do so chemically.
He concludes: “The two proxies of previous climate are incompatible. They cannot both be correct.”

A critical analysis of the paleoclimate CO2 record (Jaworowski et al., 1992) suggests the assumption we can accurately determine the entire Earth’s CO2 concentration by examining ancient polar ice bubbles – 36 to 100% of which are contaminated by exposure to today’s air – is “shown to be invalid.”
In Holocene-era ice cores, CO2 reaches 2500 ppm, 2900 ppm, even 7400 ppm per measurements taken in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. These values were selectively rejected by those seeking to reach “consensus” that modern CO2 concentration values are unprecedented.

To further illustrate the currently accepted paleoclimate CO2 records are likely to be invalid, consider the fact that modern CO2 concentrations beneath snowpack in forests and meadows range from 600 to 1800 ppm and these concentrations can fluctuate by as much as 200 ppm within a period of just 4 days (Massman and Frank, 2006).
If this kind of flux can be observed for modern conditions, assessing the CO2 concentration beneath snowpack that is thousands of years old is little more than fanciful speculation.

"I am not stockpiling for Brexit – that seems wildly melodramatic. Instead, I find myself waking up in the night, wondering whether to arm myself. By dawn, of course, this seems a little extreme, too. Somehow, by breakfast, I have reminded myself I am not in Cormac McCarthy’s The Road, feasting on a foetus, and that in fact I live near a well-stocked Tesco Metro. Yet, if Brexit is a vast psychodrama that is never about what it says it is about (no one is that emotionally invested in tariffs, whatever they suggest), then it is bound to provoke some deeply peculiar feelings. Some of my friends have become very anxious – about food supplies, medicines, civil unrest. We had some of this before 2016: food banks and riots, anyone? But the media ramps up these feelings by the hour. The message is that democracy has toppled and everything will close down on 1 November; in truth, this is the day negotiations will start for real.  Like everyone else, I absorb all this unease, which largely goes unspoken unless someone in the country happens to be vox-popped by a passing journalist. I asked my teenager the other day: “Should I buy, like … some extra chickpeas?” She no longer gets the news from what she calls the MSM, meaning mainstream media (places such as the Guardian), so Brexit barely registers for her. The whole situation is just another stupid thing adults have done to ruin everything. “You mean prepping, Mum?” she said. “Prepping?” “For the end of the world. We should be preppers.” She read about this in some Extinction Rebellion essays and thinks I should take it far more seriously. I know only about the Silicon Valley billionaires who are preparing for the breakdown of civilisation by building underground residences in New Zealand, but this doesn’t seem all that relevant, since I have never been to New Zealand and don’t have a private plane. Like my daughter, I find the climate crisis scarier than Brexit, because it is already happening: the flooding, the hurricanes, the desertification, the fires. There are already poor, desperate people who can’t get clean water. Will that one day be us? It will all come down to water in the end.  My daughter and I are suffering from what is now called “eco-anxiety”. Therapists and mental health experts are reporting that many children are now terrified of climate catastrophe. While this should be recognised as a psychological phenomenon, it is not a mental illness, because it is rational. For older people, Brexit now shades into a feeling of utter doom and powerlessness. My daughter says that, like those billionaires, we need to build a bunker. This seems wise, possibly. But, since New Zealand doesn’t look like an option and our money is far from limitless, where? I argue that we will have to leave London and get on to higher ground. I remember the strange couple I interviewed in 1999 about the Millennium Bug, who were taking to the hills. Nothing much happened, except they ended up divorcing. “We need to grow our own vegetables,” I say authoritatively, having grown up in Suffolk. The only problem is that you need a fair bit of land to feed a family; currently, we have decking. I tell my daughter that we will have to get rid of it, which comes as a bit of a shock to her. All of it is, really. The people who survive will be the people who know stuff or know how to find things out without the internet, I explain. This makes her anxious. “They’ll switch off the internet?” I don’t know who “they” are now. The government? Mark Zuckerberg? Vladimir Putin? Jean-Claude Juncker? If the internet goes down, “then I will die”, she says, matter-of-factly. “Don’t be ridiculous,” I say, while secretly thinking much the same. This is as far as we have got with the prepping. The reality is that, as we all know, anxiety is fuel for tyranny. Fear begets fear. Building my own bunker will not save me. That much I know. This comes as a relief – it would probably need planning permission. •Suzanne Moore is a Guardian columnist"

"Many moons ago in Tibet, the Second Buddha transformed a fierce nyen (a malevolent mountain demon) into a neri (the holiest protective warrior god) called Khawa Karpo, who took up residence in the sacred mountain bearing his name. Khawa Karpo is the tallest of the Meili mountain range, piercing the sky at 6,740 metres (22,112ft) above sea level. Local Tibetan communities believe that conquering Khawa Karpo is an act of sacrilege and would cause the deity to abandon his mountain home. Nevertheless, there have been several failed attempts by outsiders – the best known by an international team of 17, all of whom died in an avalanche during their ascent on 3 January 1991. After much local petitioning, in 2001 Beijing passed a law banning mountaineering there. However, Khawa Karpo continues to be affronted more insidiously. Over the past two decades, the Mingyong glacier at the foot of the mountain has dramatically receded. Villagers blame disrespectful human behaviour, including an inadequacy of prayer, greater material greed and an increase in pollution from tourism. People have started to avoid eating garlic and onions, burning meat, breaking vows or fighting for fear of unleashing the wrath of the deity. Mingyong is one of the world’s fastest shrinking glaciers, but locals cannot believe it will die because their own existence is intertwined with it. Yet its disappearance is almost inevitable. Khawa Karpo lies at the world’s “third pole”. This is how glaciologists refer to the Tibetan plateau, home to the vast Hindu Kush-Himalaya ice sheet, because it contains the largest amount of snow and ice after the Arctic and Antarctic – the Chinese glaciers alone account for an estimated 14.5% of the global total. However, a quarter of its ice has been lost since 1970. This month, in a long-awaited special report on the cryosphere by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), scientists will warn that up to two-thirds of the region’s remaining glaciers are on track to disappear by the end of the century. It is expected a third of the ice will be lost in that time even if the internationally agreed target of limiting global warming by 1.5C above pre-industrial levels is adhered to. Whether we are Buddhists or not, our lives affect, and are affected by, these tropical glaciers that span eight countries. This frozen “water tower of Asia” is the source of 10 of the world’s largest rivers, including the Ganges, Brahmaputra, Yellow, Mekong and Indus, whose flows support at least 1.6 billion people directly – in drinking water, agriculture, hydropower and livelihoods – and many more indirectly, in buying a T-shirt made from cotton grown in China, for example, or rice from India. Joseph Shea, a glaciologist at the University of Northern British Columbia, calls the loss “depressing and fear-inducing. It changes the nature of the mountains in a very visible and profound way.”  Yet the fast-changing conditions at the third pole have not received the same attention as those at the north and south poles. The IPCC’s fourth assessment report in 2007 contained the erroneous prediction that all Himalayan glaciers would be gone by 2035. This statement turned out to have been based on anecdote rather than scientific evidence and, perhaps out of embarrassment, the third pole has been given less attention in subsequent IPCC reports. There is also a dearth of research compared to the other poles, and what hydrological data exists has been jealously guarded by the Indian government and other interested parties. The Tibetan plateau is a vast and impractical place for glaciologists to work in and confounding factors make measurements hard to obtain. Scientists are forbidden by locals, for instance, to step out on to the Mingyong glacier, meaning they have had to use repeat photography to measure the ice retreat. In the face of these problems, satellites have proved invaluable, allowing scientists to watch glacial shrinkage in real time. This summer, Columbia University researchers also used declassified spy-satellite images from the cold war to show that third pole ice loss has accelerated over this century and is now roughly double the melt rate of 1975 to 2000, when temperatures were on average 1C lower. Glaciers in the region are currently losing about half a vertical metre of ice per year because of anthropogenic global heating, the researchers concluded. Glacial melt here carries significant risk of death and injury – far more than in the sparsely populated Arctic and Antarctic – from glacial lake outbursts (when a lake forms and suddenly spills over its banks in a devastating flood) and landslides caused by destabilised rock. Whole villages have been washed away and these events are becoming increasingly regular, even if monitoring and rescue systems have improved. Satellite data shows that numbers and sizes of such risky lakes in the region are growing. Last October and November, on three separate occasions, debris blocked the flow of the Yarlung Tsangpo in Tibet, threatening India and Bangladesh downstream with flooding and causing thousands to be evacuated. One reason for the rapid ice loss is that the Tibetan plateau, like the other two poles, is warming at a rate up to three times as fast as the global average, by 0.3C per decade. In the case of the third pole, this is because of its elevation, which means it absorbs energy from rising, warm, moisture-laden air. Even if average global temperatures stay below 1.5C, the region will experience more than 2C of warming; if emissions are not reduced, the rise will be 5C, according to a report released earlier this year by more than 200 scientists for the Kathmandu-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD). Winter snowfall is already decreasing and there are, on average, four fewer cold nights and seven more warm nights per year than 40 years ago. Models also indicate a strengthening of the south-east monsoon, with heavy and unpredictable downpours. “This is the climate crisis you haven’t heard of,” said ICIMOD’s chief scientist, Philippus Wester. There is another culprit besides our CO2 emissions in this warming story, and it’s all too evident on the dirty surface of the Mingyong glacier: black carbon, or soot. A 2013 study found that black carbon is responsible for 1.1 watts per square metre of the Earth’s surface of extra energy being stored in the atmosphere (CO2 is responsible for an estimated 1.56 watts per square metre). Black carbon has multiple climate effects, changing clouds and monsoon circulation as well as accelerating ice melt. Air pollution from the Indo-Gangetic Plains – one of the world’s most polluted regions – deposits this black dust on glaciers, darkening their surface and hastening melt. While soot landing on dark rock has little effect on its temperature, snow and glaciers are particularly vulnerable because they are so white and reflective. As glaciers melt, the surrounding rock crumbles in landslides, covering the ice with dark material that speeds melt in a runaway cycle. The Everest base camp, for instance, at 5,300 metres, is now rubble and debris as the Khumbu glacier has retreated to the icefall. The immense upland of the third pole is one of the most ecologically diverse and vulnerable regions on Earth. People have only attempted to conquer these mountains in the last century, yet in that time humans have subdued the glaciers and changed the face of this wilderness with pollution and other activities. Researchers are now beginning to understand the scale of human effects on the region – some have experienced it directly: many of the 300 IPCC cryosphere report authors meeting in the Nepalese capital in July were forced to take shelter or divert to other airports because of a freak monsoon. But aAside from such inconveniences, what do these changes mean for the 240 million people living in the mountains? Well, in many areas, it has been welcomed. Warmer, more pleasant winters have made life easier. The higher temperatures have boosted agriculture – people can grow a greater variety of crops and benefit from more than one harvest per year, and that improves livelihoods. This may be responsible for the so-called Karakoram anomaly, in which a few glaciers in the Pakistani Karakoram range are advancing in opposition to the general trend. Climatologists believe that the sudden and massive growth of irrigated agriculture in the local area, coupled with unusual topographical features, has produced an increase in snowfall on the glaciers which currently more than compensates for their melting. Elsewhere, any increase in precipitation is not enough to counter the rate of ice melt and places that are wholly reliant on meltwater for irrigation are feeling the effects soonest. “Springs have dried drastically in the past 10 years without meltwater and because infrastructure has cut off discharge,” says Aditi Mukherji, one of the authors of the IPCC report. Known as high-altitude deserts, places such as Ladakh in north-eastern India and parts of Tibet have already lost many of their lower-altitude glaciers and with them their seasonal irrigation flows, which is affecting agriculture and electricity production from hydroelectric dams. In some places, communities are trying to geoengineer artificial glaciers that divert runoff from higher glaciers towards shaded, protected locations where it can freeze over winter to provide meltwater for irrigation in the spring. Only a few of the major Asian rivers are heavily reliant on glacial runoff – the Yangtze and Yellow rivers are showing reduced water levels because of diminished meltwater and the Indus (40% glacier-fed) and Yarkand (60% glacier-fed) are particularly vulnerable. So although mountain communities are suffering from glacial disappearance, those downstream are currently less affected because rainfall makes a much larger contribution to rivers such as the Ganges and Mekong as they descend into populated basins. Upstream-downstream conflict over extractions, dam-building and diversions has so far largely been averted through water-sharing treaties between nations, but as the climate becomes less predictable and scarcity increases, the risk of unrest within – let alone between – nations grows. Towards the end of this century, pre-monsoon water-flow levels in all these rivers will drastically reduce without glacier buffers, affecting agricultural output as well as hydropower generation, and these stresses will be compounded by an increase in the number and severity of devastating flash floods. “The impact on local water resources will be huge, especially in the Indus Valley. We expect to see migration out of dry, high-altitude areas first but populations across the region will be affected,” says Shea, also an author on the ICIMOD report. As the third pole’s vast frozen reserves of fresh water make their way down to the oceans, they are contributing to sea-level rise that is already making life difficult in the heavily populated low-lying deltas and bays of Asia, from Bangladesh to Vietnam. What is more, they are releasing dangerous pollutants. Glaciers are time capsules, built snowflake by snowflake from the skies of the past and, as they melt, they deliver back into circulation the constituents of that archived air. Dangerous pesticides such as DDT (widely used for three decades before being banned in 1972) and perfluoroalkyl acids are now being washed downstream in meltwater and accumulating in sediments and in the food chain. Ultimately the future of this vast region, its people, ice sheets and arteries depends – just as Khawa Karpo’s devotees believe – on us: on reducing our emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants. As Mukherji says, many of the glaciers that haven’t yet melted have effectively “disappeared because in the dense air pollution, you can no longer see them”."
"Citizens’ assemblies will decide what action should be taken on the climate crisis, the Treasury’s ability to stymie green measures will be neutralised and the Green Investment Bank will be revived under proposals set to be key planks of the Liberal Democrats’ general election bid. Along with sweeping reform of Whitehall, including bringing back a department of climate change, local government would be given new powers to cut emissions, there would be a moratorium on airport expansion and an end to fracking, and the UK would achieve net-zero carbon status by 2045 – five years sooner than the current government goal.  “Moving to net-zero is a complete game-changer,” Wera Hobhouse, the Lib Dem spokesperson for the environment and climate change, told the Guardian. “The whole of government and society need to understand the need to get to net-zero – everything we do needs to be seen in terms of that target.” Under the proposals to be presented to the Lib Dem conference in Bournemouth this weekend, a new minister, who will attend cabinet, would be appointed chief secretary to the Treasury and oversee policy across departments to ensure it meets the zero-carbon pledge. “The biggest hurdle [to climate policies] was always the Treasury,” said Hobhouse. Soon after Theresa May unveiled her zero-carbon target this summer, her chancellor, Philip Hammond, claimed it would cost too much. “Having a chief secretary to keep reminding the chancellor of the need to get to net-zero is key,” said Hobhouse. To gain public support for urgent action on emissions, the Lib Dems would convene citizens’ assemblies across the country to debate new measures. These would include ways to ensure a massive expansion of electric vehicles and better public transport, and how to encourage new technology such as heating homes with hydrogen instead of gas. Councils would also be given greater powers over planning, for instance to promote electric vehicles, cycling and walking. “Citizens’ assemblies would not replace politicians’ decision-making, but would inform the options,” said Hobhouse. “We need decisive action – the government is not doing anything, they are dithering.” The Green Investment Bank, created under the coalition government, was sold off under George Osborne. Under a Lib Dem government, a replacement would be set up with public money, and have the powers to borrow money from the private sector. Hobhouse said Brexit was getting in the way of tackling the climate emergency: “Brexit means having less money, and it is very counterproductive. We need international cooperation – climate change is a global problem.” The Lib Dems would end the sale of diesel and petrol cars by 2030 – 10 years sooner than the Conservatives – and stop fracking. There would also be more support for onshore wind and solar, which Hobhouse said the Conservatives had “stopped in their tracks” by drastically changing incentive schemes and planning laws. Green campaigning groups, keen that the climate crisis should not be overshadowed by Brexit as a general election looms, welcomed the Lib Dems’ focus. “Our country may be divided over Brexit, but it is not divided over the need for action on the nature and climate emergency – polling is consistently showing that concern over climate is at an all-time high and a large majority support urgent action,” said Gareth Redmond-King, head of climate change at WWF-UK.  “Now we need the climate and nature crisis prioritised at the highest level of government, and billions in new funding, to deliver on the rhetoric. We must stop things like airport expansion that make meeting net-zero even more difficult.” Jenny Bates, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “With the government’s net-zero target currently lacking anywhere near enough policy to back it up, we’d like to see all parties thinking about what they’d do to make sure the target is actually reached. It’s no good talking about a net-zero future while pursuing a programme of roadbuilding, airport expansion and fracking.”"

Dr. Ulrich Keck called in on a German ARD public television talk show to express his views on the new lockdown that has just been imposed across Germany.

According to the German dentist (65), the lockdowns are causing more harm than the disease itself due to the added massive poverty they are causing globally.
He claims the “collateral damage” is being completely ignored.
“For example, 15,000 children die of hunger every day on the planet, now it’s 30,000 because the paths to supply them have been interrupted,” says Keck. He characterizes the German lockdown as completely unnecessary because the country has plenty of intensive care beds available. Keck then pleads for an end to the panic spreading.
At the end Keck concludes: “When you sacrifice freedom for security, you end up with neither.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterNot only is flying ash over Europe causing air traffic disruptions, about 800 people have been forced to evacuate their homes around the Eyjafjallajokull volcano in southern Iceland because the flooding cut roads. A huge cloud of ash from the 2nd major eruption in less than a month blew eastwards and closed major airports more than 1700 km away in London. The volcano on the Eyjafjallajokull glacier erupted just after midnight on Wednesday.
The ash is about 8-10km in the air and cannot been seen from the ground. But experts say it’s a danger to jet engines and restricts visibility.
