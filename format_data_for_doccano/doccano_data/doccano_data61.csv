"Billions of dollars of public money was sunk in new fossil fuel projects by the world’s major development banks in the year after the Paris climate change deal was agreed, according to campaigners who are calling for the banks to halt their financing of coal, oil and gas. The new analysis also reveals that some of the taxpayers’ money given to coal and gas projects was counted as “climate” finance.   Funding for fossil fuel projects from the six main international development banks totalled at least $5bn in 2016, according to a report from researchers at Oil Change International (OCI). In particular, OCI estimate the funding for exploration for new oil and gas more than doubled in 2016, to $2.1bn. Funding for clean energy also grew by more than a third, to $11.4bn.  A second report from analysts at E3G suggests that in recent years the World Bank and European Bank for Development and Reconstruction (EBRD) have given similar levels of funding to fossil fuels as to climate-friendly energy projects.  “Despite the Paris Agreement being reached, multilateral development banks that say all the right things on climate are still financing billions of dollars in oil, gas, and coal projects,” said Alex Doukas at Oil Change International. “They are using relatively scarce public resources that need to be used as strategically as possible if we have a hope of meeting the agreement’s aims. If they really want to help lift people out of poverty, taxpayer-funded banks can no longer finance climate destruction. They must stop funding fossil fuels.” Helena Wright at E3G said: “Development banks must do more to green their investments. As a first step, the banks should commit to ending finance for fossil fuel exploration. Obviously exploration for new resources is not in line with the Paris goals – we have got enough fossil fuels already to go over 2C of warming.”  Scientists showed in 2015 that to keep under the internationally agreed 2C warming limit, then most existing fossil fuel reserves need to stay in the ground. In July, the G20 nations were accused of hypocrisy for talking tough on global warming but providing four times more public finance for fossil fuels than for renewables. Wright also found that millions of dollars given by the EBRD for a coal port in Morocco were counted as climate finance on the grounds the port contributed to adaptation to climate change. In another example, millions of dollars given by the EBRD for an offshore gas exploration project in Azerbaijan were also counted as climate finance on the basis that it reduced emissions compared to baseline. “It seems a bit ridiculous,” she said. However, a spokesman for the EBRD said it strongly disagreed with the analysis in the new reports and the way in which the projects were categorised. He said the EBRD spent 2.7 times more on energy-related climate projects than on fossil fuels and that the analyses had not included lending that went to projects via partner banks. A World Bank spokesman also disputed the analyses and emphasised the bank’s clean investments: “Over the last five years, the World Bank Group has invested more than $11bn in renewable energy and $4.5bn in energy efficiency. We are now the largest multilateral provider of finance for renewable energy and energy efficiency projects in developing countries.” Both of the new reports analysed the lending by the World Bank, EBRD, the African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, European Investment Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank. The OCI report estimated significant rises in fossil fuel funding in 2016 by the Asian Development Bank, where it leapt fivefold, and at the World Bank. The E3G report judged the Inter-American Development Bank as the greenest, giving over five times more to climate-friendly energy projects between 2013 and 2015 than to fossil fuel schemes. Yongping Zhai, energy advisor at the Asian Development Bank, said: “ADB will continue to expand climate finance, while still providing access to energy in the most cost effective manner to support progress for developing countries. ADB’s financing to fossil fuel in 2016 was limited to natural gas, which is an important transition fuel, [with] lesser carbon.”"
"Queensland is again back in the news for all the wrong reasons. Coal capital, One Nation on the rise and now once again a world beater at clearing the bush.  For 30 years, Queensland was my home. I left for love and to start a family but my heart stayed in the state. The beauty of the rainforests, the splendour of the reef, the vast forested wildness of Cape York and the expanses of the outback all left an indelible impact. I also miss the honesty, directness and the no nonsense approach of Queenslanders.  For a generation, Queenslanders from all walks of life sought to create a new and vibrant Queensland after the repressive nothingness of the long Bjelke-Petersen era. We were sick to death of being called the police state, of being the place where creativity was mocked, where race relations resembled apartheid-era South Africa and where the natural environment was under constant siege from all manner of state-sanctioned exploitation. As a young “greenie” in Brisbane in the 1990s, one of the hardest things about being a Queenslander was the knowledge that massive amounts of forests and bushlands clearing was going on up and down the coast and throughout the vast rangelands of the interior. All through the 1990s, hundreds of thousands of hectares of bush were levelled by enormous bulldozers and massive metal chains each and every year. In the year 2000, almost 800,000 hectares of forests and bushlands were lost. The cost to wildlife was massive with conservative estimates of tens of millions of animals killed each and every year. And then after 30 years of unabated destruction, Queenslanders from all walks of life came together to say enough was enough.  Across the state, communities convinced the government of Peter Beattie to step in and stop the chop. After a few missteps, in 2004, Beattie included tough new laws to dramatically decrease deforestation. These laws passed with the support of the Queensland Liberals, then in one of their periods of independence from the Queensland Nationals. Even the peak farm body, Agforce, provided muted support for the new laws. It appeared Queensland had turned the page on a new chapter, one in which protecting the environment and building a sustainable economy was paramount.  In Canberra, the Howard government supported the laws – reducing the rates of deforestation in Queensland meant a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and meant Howard could claim that Australia was on track to meet emissions reduction targets required under the Kyoto protocol. And the laws worked. By 2010, clearing had reduced to 78,000 hectares, still a lot but substantially less than the bad old days. But then the tide turned. In 2012, the newly-elected government of Campbell Newman broke an explicit election promise and gutted the land clearing laws. The old school Nationals were jubilant and the dozers were back into the bush en masse. The legacy of Newman’s folly is written large in destroyed forests, soaring greenhouse gas emissions and further stress on an already critically ill Great Barrier Reef. The release on Thursday of the 2015/16 annual land clearing data is heart breaking. Incredibly, 396,000 hectares of forests and bushlands were cleared, a 33% increase on clearing from the previous year of 2014/15. In total, a staggering 1.25m hectares of bush have been cleared since Newman took the axe to the laws. Attempts by the new Queensland government to strengthen the laws in 2016 were defeated by the LNP and the cross benches. The cost to wildlife is staggering with a recent report by CSIRO estimating that 50 million mammals, birds and reptiles are killed every year due to deforestation in Queensland and New South Wales. Soaring emissions from deforestation, conservatively estimated by the Australian government as releasing 49m tonnes of greenhouse gases per year (9% of all Australian emissions), have almost completely cancelled out reductions in emissions delivered through the federal $2.24bn Emissions Reduction Fund. And finally, massive amounts of clearing in the catchments that feed that Great Barrier Reef make a mockery of iron clad guarantees to reduce clearing made by the Australian and Queensland governments as part of the multi-billion-dollar Reef 2050 plan which saved Australia from the embarrassment of having the reef listed as “world heritage site in danger”.  Queensland has a brighter future than this and Queenslanders, when confronted with the awful reality of what is happening, will again demand action and leadership.  It is time for the LNP to recognise the folly of their actions in 2012, it is time for the Australian government to be firm and demand change on climate, reef protection and environmental grounds, and it is time for the Queensland parliament to commit to strong laws to end deforestation in Queensland."
"Tony Abbott titled his London speech on climate change “Daring to Doubt” – a challenge, if you will, to reject mountains of evidence and instead lick your fingers and shove them into the plug socket of denial. Go on, I dare you.  Throughout his speech, the former Australian prime minister urged listeners to think that dismissing decades of research backed by the world’s leading scientific institutions required bravery and fortitude, rather than other less celebrated human attributes. But what would constitute bravery for a conservative politician like Abbott? Changing your mind when the evidence tells you you’re dead wrong, or saying what you’ve always said, using the logical fallacies that you’ve always used? One step is brave, the other is cowardly. Abbott was giving the Global Warming Policy Foundation’s annual lecture – an “honour” previously bestowed on his spiritual and political mentors John Howard and Cardinal George Pell.  Nobody should be surprised that what we got was an absolute crap speech from a man who confessed he still thinks climate science is “absolute crap”. Abbott went for the whole canon of tired climate science denial talking points – carbon dioxide is just food for plants, the climate has always changed, it’s the sun – in what constituted a warmed-up meal of misinformation with a side order of supercilious gravy. Several leading Australian climate scientists have hit back. How tired they must get of debunking this stuff. Abbott’s speech was also chock-full of internal contradictions. He suggested a conspiracy to tamper with temperature readings, but admitted the globe was warming. He described carbon dioxide as a “trace gas” and dismissed its role in warming, but elsewhere thought warming (which might not be happening) would be good. And the “trace gas” is insignificant, but not when it comes to its ability to “green the planet” and help plants grow.  Professor Steve Sherwood, deputy director of the University of New South Wales Climate Change Research Centre, read the speech and said it was “the usual mix of misdirection, falsehoods and tirades against ‘brigades’ who supposedly say this and that but are never clearly identified”. The @thegwpfcom wouldn't let me attend @TonyAbbottMHR's speech. But here's what he said https://t.co/cutUHcZZ4L pic.twitter.com/peDjtdveC4 Abbott told the thinktank – which had denied requests from seasoned climate reporters to attend – that past climate changes that occurred millions of years ago showed there was nothing to worry about now. “Abbott is trying to hide the fact that it is the scientists themselves – who know more about past climate changes than he does – who are sounding the alarm,” said Sherwood. The former prime minister confined his scientific missteps to seven or eight paragraphs in the middle of his speech.  Professor Mark Howden, director of the ANU Climate Change Institute, said Abbott’s claim that other factors, such as sunspots cycles or wobbles in the Earth’s orbit could be just as important as carbon dioxide, was simply false. “The evidence that our climate is changing due to human activity is overwhelming,” said Howden. “2016 was globally the hottest year on record, surpassing the 2015 record, surpassing the 2014 record. There is 99.999% certainty that humans are driving the observed temperature rises via greenhouse gas emissions.” Abbott’s claim that “no big change has accompanied the increase in carbon dioxide concentration” was “problematic”, said Howden, given “research shows that the world has already warmed by approximately 1C since pre-industrial times”. “We are already experiencing changed patterns of rainfall, more and more days with extreme temperatures, increasingly intense natural disasters and rising sea levels, impacting on almost all facets of life in Australia.” Professor Andrew Pitman, director of the Australian Research Council’s Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes, said while it was true that CO2 is essential to life, “life also requires many trace elements that at higher concentrations are toxic”. “It is a myth to imply that because CO2 is essential to life, more of it is good.” Abbott also deployed another favourite talking point from climate science misinformers – that warming (which, remember, he thinks might not be happening) will cut the number of people dying of cold.  Pitman said this argument, too, was misleading, saying: “It is true that in rich countries which tend to be in the mid to higher latitudes, some warming might help reduce deaths from cold. In the lower latitude countries – the subtropics and tropics – people rarely die of cold. In contrast they die of heat and lack of clean water.  “So, countries responsible for global warming might gain a minor benefit from warming while those least responsible will wear the consequences.”  Dr Liz Hanna, an expert on the impacts of climate change on human health, said human-caused warming was already implicated in the deaths of many thousands. “In 2003, 70,000 people died in western Europe, and in 2010 a further 55,000 people died in Russia and eastern Europe. These figures far exceed deaths from cold snaps. The decade 2001-2010 saw a 2,300% increase in heat deaths above the previous decade. Mr Abbott’s assertions don’t tell the whole story, as they’re based on what has happened in the past rather than what is projected to happen in future. While more people die from cold than heat in Melbourne at the moment, this will reverse as more summer days reach the high 40s.” Away from his errors on the evidence, Abbott tried to characterise climate science and environmentalism as being hamstrung by a religious-type fervour that gets in the way of “common sense”. Abbott said: Environmentalism has managed to combine a post-socialist instinct for big government with a post-Christian nostalgia for making sacrifices in a good cause. Primitive people once killed goats to appease the volcano gods. We’re more sophisticated now but are still sacrificing our industries and our living standards to the climate gods to little more effect. Beware the pronouncement, ‘the science is settled’. It’s the spirit of the Inquisition, the thought-police down the ages. Almost as bad is the claim that ‘99% of scientists believe’ as if scientific truth is determined by votes rather than facts. As a Roman Catholic libertarian free market ideologue, Abbott is, presumably, immune to such group think. Climate scientist Ben Henley, of the University of Melbourne, also spots Abbott’s facile argument. In an email he told me: “By implication, Abbott superstitiously questions the foundations of science, and in doing so, he questions the same scientific method which discovered wifi and penicillin, and proved the Earth was not flat. “Abbott presents an absurdly and intentionally distorted viewpoint, reminiscent of a conspiracy theorist.” Abbott’s attitude to climate change seems to rest on a Boy’s Own “who dares wins” approach to policy that’s neither brave or daring. It’s stupid.  Graham Readfearn is the Guardian’s Planet Oz opinion columnist"

"Sea ice levels in Antarctica dropped to a record low this year, but experts say there is not a clear link to climate change. More than 60 meteorologists and scientists from around the world are holding a week-long meeting in Hobart, Tasmania, to better understand sea ice changes on the frozen continent.  Dr Jan Lieser from the Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre said sea ice levels had experienced a “massive increase” in variability over the past few years.  Sea ice coverage fell to 2.075m sq km in March, the lowest since satellite observations began in 1979. But just three years earlier it hit a record high of more than 20m sq km. Lieser said increasing ocean surface temperatures melt the ice but may also be helping it refreeze.  “More warmth into the system reduces the sea ice cover but there’s also other mechanisms,” he said. “Increased warmth increases the melt underneath shelves – that increases the fresh water balance of the ocean. “Fresh water more readily freezes at the surface, which increases the sea ice again.” Better mapping and predicting these changes to aid polar shipping is the goal of the International Ice Charting Working Group Tasmanian meeting.  Unpredictable sea ice levels are creating headaches for an increasing number of tourist and research boats visiting the Antarctic. The working group estimates about 50 cruise vessels took almost 35,000 tourists to the Antarctic last year. In late 2013 Russian ship Akademik Shokalskiy got stuck in thick ice for a fortnight. The Aurora Australis icebreaker was one of several boats to help ferry crew and passengers to safety. Australian Antarctic Division operations manager Robb Clifton said the amount and location of sea ice played a big role in planning this summer’s trip.  “With less ice this year, we’re certainly thinking about whether or not we’ll be able to operate with vehicles, or whether we need to gear up for more aviation operations,” he said.  The co-chair of the working group and director of the Danish Meteorological Institute, Marianne Thyrring, said more data from the Antarctic needed to be gathered.  “We have to be more on our toes to make people operate safely in these polar areas,” she said. “The seasons are being different and are developing differently each year.”"
"John Akomfrah grew up in the 1960s, in the shadow of Battersea power station in south London. As a child, he remembers “feeling as if I was enveloped in something whenever I played on the street. You could sense it in the air, you felt it and saw it, whatever was emanating from the huge chimneys. We were being poisoned as we played, but no one spoke about it. The conversations in the pub tended to be about football rather than carbon monoxide poisoning.” Fifty years on, the local has become the global. Akomfrah’s latest art work, Purple, is an immersive, six-channel video installation that attempts to evoke the incremental effects of climate change on our planet. Shot in 10 countries and drawing on archive footage, spoken word and music alongside often epic shots of contemporary landscapes that have been altered by global warming and rising temperatures, Purple eschews a linear narrative for an almost overwhelming montage of imagery and sound.  Like all of Akomfrah’s work, it requires the viewer to surrender to sensory overload, while remaining alert to the often oblique connections being made throughout. “I kept thinking back, while making this work, to the local, working-class community I grew up in and how innocent we were in terms of trusting authority. One of the complex questions I am asking is about the relationship between our locality and the bigger issue of how we belong on the planet. Who can we trust with our collective future?” Akomfrah’s ambition is nothing less than epic, the timespan of Purple stretching from the industrial age (images of factories, mills, machines and mass employment) to the digital revolution and beyond (the possibilities promised by biotech research, artificial intelligence and genetics). The looming threat of ecological disaster is implicit throughout, most ominously in the recurring appearance of lone, white-coated, hooded figures who gaze silently at landscapes threatened or already blighted by human progress. “The kind of work I make is essentially time-based,” says Akomfrah, who is working on a new film project in New Orleans. “For that reason alone, I felt I had to widen my focus to take in the bigger narrative we are now all caught up in. Once you become aware of the implications of climate change for future generations, it is almost as if you have to respond. But I’m not a scientist or a campaigner, I’m an artist. I’m interested in the philosophy of climate change rather than the hard science.” More than once, Akomfrah describes Purple as “a response to Anthropocene”, the term coined by scientists for the geological age in which we are now living, a period defined by the influence of manmade activity on climate and the environment. A major source of inspiration for Purple is a 2013 book called Hyperobjects: Philosophy and Ecology After the End of the World. Written by Timothy Morton, an English academic, it posits the idea that global warming is the most dramatic illustration of a “hyperobject” – an entity of such vast temporal and spatial dimensions that it baffles our traditional ways of thinking about it and, by extension, doing something about it. In a perhaps unconscious way, Akomfrah’s overwhelming film evokes that very dilemma: our apparent helplessness as individuals in the face of rising sea levels and temperatures, droughts and melting icecaps. Against a stirring contemporary classical soundtrack, his film begins by summoning up the momentum of industrial England, a world of mass production that signals – but is utterly unlike – the hyper-reality of contemporary globalism and digital interconnectivity. “I’m fascinated by the strange interregnum that stretches from the post-industrial to the digital present,” Akomfrah explains. “Right now, as I speak to you, I am looking at the outlines of oil refineries and sugar factories on the horizon. They are still there, still pumping out their poisons, but they seem to belong to a different age. Their numbers have dwindled, but they still have an impact on the environment and they still speak of a history of technology and exploitation. They cast a long shadow.” This notion of the past – and, in particular, the colonial past – haunting the present is another recurring theme in Akomfrah’s work. It is there in the raw, turbulent montage of images and sound that marked his debut film, Handsworth Songs, which he made in 1986 as part of the Black Audio Film Collective. Its subject was the race riots in London and Birmingham the previous year and, in its blending of archive footage, still photos and newsreel, it set the tone for much of what was to follow, creating a formal signature known as bricolage, the creation of a new work from the layering and juxtaposition of various existing sources. Akomfrah, who is of Ghanaian parentage, grew up in Britain and was influenced by the late Stuart Hall, arguably this country’s most influential black academic and cultural theorist. Hall’s writings on memory, time and identity in the wake of colonialism inform Akomfrah’s earlier films and he remains an abiding, if not so obvious, presence on Purple. “In a way, this is a person of colour’s response to the Anthropocene and climate change, which is not just a white, European fixation, though it is often presented that way. When I stand on a street in Accra, I can feel that it is a city that is literally at boiling point. It is way hotter than it was in the 1960s or even the 1980s. We need to start looking at climate change in radically different ways, not just as part of a western-based development narrative. It’s a pan-African concern of great urgency, but how long it will take people to see it as such is a whole other problem.” In 1989, Akomfrah had what he calls “a major turning point”, when he travelled to Alaska to make a documentary for the BBC about the Exxon Valdez oil spill and its disastrous impact on the Alaskan ecosystem. “The destruction of the livelihoods of the Inuit community immediately resounded with me because it recalled the worst excesses of colonial exploitation. It felt like I was in a post-colonial space that was very much haunted by the past.” In 2015, Akomfrah’s three-screen film installation, Vertigo Sea, marked another turning point, a shift in tone and scale that signalled the grand ambition of Purple. In contrasting the brutality of the whaling industry with the experience of generations of migrants who crossed the sea out of necessity in search of a better life, he was struck, he says, “by the realisation that everything overlaps at some profound level, that the great shifts in human progress that are made possible by technology can also cause the profoundest destruction and suffering”. All these big themes are embedded in Purple, but may remain elusive to those unfamiliar with the tropes of conceptual art and experimental, non-narrative film-making. I was baffled, for instance, by recurring appearances of those mysterious silent figures who stand mute before often elemental landscapes on Alaska, Greenland and Skye. “In a very real way, I’m present in the film. I’m the figure in the brown shirt who gets rained on,” says Akomfrah, laughing. “It sounds a bit mystical, but for me everything starts with place. Wherever we filmed, it began with me asking the landscape the same question: ‘What can you tell me about the nature of climate change?’ As an artist and film-maker, I’m dependent on the responses I get from the environment.” Is he aware, given the often bitterly contested nature of the public climate change debate, that a multiscreen, non-narrative conceptual art film that provides no answers may be greeted by a degree of scepticism, if not outright dismissal, from those on both sides demanding hard facts and evidence? “Well, I’m an artist. I make work for a gallery. I’m not attempting to make a science documentary. I’m coming at it from a different perspective by asking the question: what is philosophically, ethically and morally at stake here if we continue on this course? I don’t think you need to be licensed by the scientific community to ask that sort of question about the times we live in or to reflect on the anxiety many of us feel about the future of the planet. My son is old enough to become a father. On a purely personal level, it certainly felt like the right time for me as an artist to be asking these questions.” Purple is exhibited from 6 Oct to 7 Jan at the Curve, Barbican, London"
"The International Monetary Fund has told rich countries they must do more to help poor nations cope with climate change or suffer from the weaker global growth and higher migration flows that will inevitably result. In a chapter released ahead of the publication of next month’s World Economic Outlook, the Washington-based IMF said low-income countries had contributed little to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations and could not afford to tackle the problem from their own meagre resources.  “Rising temperatures would have vastly unequal effects across the world, with the brunt of adverse consequences borne by those who can least afford it,” the IMF said. “The international community will have a key role to play in fostering and coordinating financial and other types of support for affected low-income countries. With advanced and emerging market economies contributing the lion’s share to the warming that has occurred so far and is projected to continue, helping low-income countries cope with its consequences is a humanitarian imperative and sound global economic policy.” Using conservative assumptions, the IMF said that by 2100 income per head in a typical low-income country would be 9% lower than it would be in the absence of temperature increases. It added that the present value of these losses would amount to the loss of an entire year of current economic output for a poor nation. The adverse impact of climate change would be long-lasting and would be felt through lower agricultural output, reduced productivity in sectors exposed to the weather, weaker investment and poor health. Higher temperatures constrained growth in the hot regions of emerging and developing economies significantly more than in hot regions of rich nations, underlying the importance of development in reducing vulnerability, the IMF said. The chapter noted that low-income countries had “huge spending needs and scarce resources to undertake the investments necessary to cope with climate change.” The United Nations has agreed a set of sustainable development goals to be met by 2030, but achieving them would require poor countries to increase public spending by up to 30% of gross domestic product. This would not be possible for most countries, the IMF said. “Moreover, domestic policies alone cannot fully insulate low-income countries from the consequences of climate change as higher temperatures push the biophysical limits of these countries’ ecosystems, potentially triggering more frequent epidemics, famines, and other natural disasters, at the same time fuelling migration pressure and conflict risk,” the chapter said. It warned that “substantial migration flows, potentially spilling across country borders, could arise if climate change leads to a significant rise in sea levels.” On current global warming projections, hundreds of millions of people in low-lying areas could become vulnerable to flooding, forcing them to abandon their homes.  The international spillovers from the most vulnerable countries, through depressed economic activity and potentially higher conflict and migration flows, could be considerable, the IMF said. “Going forward, only a global effort to contain carbon emissions to levels consistent with an acceptable increase in temperature can limit the long-term risk of climate change.” "
"Rebuffing the Trump administration, a federal judge on Wednesday ordered the Interior Department to reinstate an Obama-era regulation aimed at restricting harmful methane emissions from oil and gas production on federal lands. The order by a judge in San Francisco came as the Interior Department moved to delay the rule until 2019, saying it was too burdensome to industry. The action followed an earlier effort by the department to postpone part of the rule set to take effect next year.  US Magistrate Judge Elizabeth Laporte of the northern district of California said the department had failed to give a “reasoned explanation” for the changes and had not offered details why an earlier analysis by the Obama administration was faulty. She ordered the entire rule reinstated immediately. The rule, finalized last November, forces energy companies to capture methane that’s burnt off or “flared” at drilling sites on public lands during production because it pollutes the environment. An estimated $330m a year in methane is wasted through leaks or intentional releases on federal lands, enough to power about 5m homes a year. Methane, the primary component of natural gas, is a leading contributor to global warming. It is far more potent at trapping heat than carbon dioxide but does not stay in the air as long. “It’s a good thing the courts are protecting Americans from oil and gas industry pollution, because the Trump administration has completely abdicated that responsibility,” said Michael Saul, a senior attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity, one of the groups that challenged the Trump rule along with California and New Mexico. “The methane rule puts modest constraints on a dirty practice that endangers public health and wastes billions of taxpayer dollars,” Saul said. President Donald Trump and the interior secretrary, Ryan Zinke, “are not above the law and the court has made it clear they have to stop putting polluters above the people they were sworn to protect,” Saul said. The court ruling follows a defeat in Congress, when the Senate unexpectedly turned back a bid to overturn the methane rule after three Republicans joined Democrats in voting to uphold it. The vote prompted Interior Department officials to promise to suspend, revise or rescind the regulation as part of a wider effort by the Trump administration to unravel what it considers burdensome regulations imposed by former president Barack Obama. The methane rule imposes a “significant regulatory burden that encumbers American energy production, economic growth and job creation,” especially in North Dakota, Colorado and New Mexico, the department said. Environmental groups sharply disagreed. Rolling back the methane waste rule “makes no sense and is yet another example of the lengths this administration will go to sell out our public lands,” said Jenny Kordick, an energy policy expert for The Wilderness Society. Democratic senator Tom Udall from New Mexico said the methane rule provides badly needed revenue to states such as New Mexico for public education and other services. Prior to the rule, an estimated $100m in taxpayer-owned natural gas was wasted each year from oil and gas wells operating on public lands in New Mexico, Udall said, adding that the rule has helped to reduce dangerous air pollution across the west, including a methane cloud the size of Delaware that hangs over the Four Corners region of New Mexico, Utah, Arizona and Colorado. “This rule is simply good policy good for taxpayers, good for the economy and good for the environment,” Udall said. He and other Democrats encouraged the public to speak out to defend the rule during a 30-day public comment period that begins on Thursday."
"Global leaders must do more to protect indigenous people fighting to protect their land and way of life if the world is to limit climate change, according to the UN special rapporteur Victoria Tauli-Corpuz. Speaking ahead of key climate talks in Bonn next month she urged politicians to recognise that indigenous communities around the world were the most effective custodians of millions of hectares of forest “which act as the world’s lungs”.  “Indigenous people’s rights need to be protected in the best way possible, not just for them but because they are also able to provide solutions to many of the world’s problems from climate change to biological diversity.  “It is in the self interest of states and even corporations in the medium and long term to protect and listen to these people – the question is, will they realise this in time?” said Tauli-Corpuz. A recent study found that a quarter of the carbon stored above ground in the world’s tropical forests is found in the collectively managed territories of indigenous peoples and local communities. In Brazil, deforestation in indigenous community forests from 2000 to 2012 was less than 1%, compared to 7% outside those areas. “They are the most effective stewards of these key areas,” said Tauli-Corpuz. “The needs of these indigenous people are converging with the wider environmental needs to protect these areas.” Indigenous people are locked in fierce conflicts with mining, logging and agricultural companies and their private security firms in hundreds of places from Indonesia to Brazil. 2016 was the deadliest year on record for land rights defenders with about 200 people killed in conflicts in Latin America, Africa and Asia. In addition, thousands more community activists were threatened or harassed. A Guardian project working with Global Witness is highlighting the pressure many of these groups face and has identified at least 134 people who have been killed so far this year. Tauli-Corpuz, who was speaking at the launch of a new global institution dedicated to securing the land rights of tens of millions of indigenous people, said there was an atmosphere of fear and intimidation in many of these communities. The event in Stockholm was the official launch of the International Land and Forest Tenure Facility which aims to help communities protect their land resources as well as combat climate change. Funded by Sweden, Norway and the Ford Foundation, a US charity, the Tenure Facility, has already provided grants and guidance for pilot projects in six nations. The Ford Foundation president Darren Walker said it was an important development in the fight against climate change and inequality. “Creating mechanisms that allow indigenous peoples and local communities to gain tenure over their land or forests is a way to tackle both these problems.” The Ford Foundation has pledged $5m, and Norway has announced a grant of $20m over the coming years. Sweden pitched in $10m during the pilot phase and will fund future projects. Walker said he expects donations to rise to $100m overall within a year. The project aims to boost forestland properly titled to indigenous peoples by 40m hectares, an area twice the size of Spain, within a decade. Organisers say this would prevent deforestation of 1m hectares and the release of 500m tonnes of CO2, more than the annual emissions of Britain or Brazil. Indigenous leaders representing tens of millions of people involved in land disputes in Asia, Africa and South America attended the conference. They said the tenure programme was an important step towards stopping the persecution of indigenous communities – but warned more needs to be done. Rukka Sombolinggi, the first female secretary-general of the world’s largest indigenous organisation, Aman, which represents 17 million people in Indonesia, said: “Our houses are being burnt down, people are being killed, tortured, and sent to jail as we speak.” Sombolinggi said some progress had been made, with much of the forests where indigenous communities live in Indonesia mapped for the first time. And she said “dominant communities” would benefit, not only environmentally from more rights for indigenous people, but argued they could also learn important lessons from the way many of these groups lived. “If we want to see the beautiful centuries ahead … we need to shift our paradigm of what constitutes wealth or prosperity because too many people see happiness only in terms of material goods and achievements and it is having a devastating impact. Many of us have lost our ability to connect with natural things and no longer seem able to live in harmony with the simple happiness around us.”"
"If the outlook for marine life was already looking bleak – torrents of plastic that can suffocate and starve fish, overfishing, diverse forms of human pollution that create dead zones, the effects of global warming which is bleaching coral reefs and threatening coldwater species – another threat is quietly adding to the toxic soup. Ocean acidification is progressing rapidly around the world, new research has found, and its combination with the other threats to marine life is proving deadly. Many organisms that could withstand a certain amount of acidification are at risk of losing this adaptive ability owing to pollution from plastics, and the extra stress from global warming.  The conclusions come from an eight-year study into the effects of ocean acidification which found our increasingly acid seas – a byproduct of burning fossil fuels – are becoming more hostile to vital marine life. “Since ocean acidification happens extremely fast compared to natural processes, only organisms with short generation times, such as micro-organisms, are able to keep up,” the authors of the study Exploring Ocean Change: Biological Impacts of Ocean Acidification found. Marine life such as crustaceans and organisms that create calcified shelters for themselves in the oceans were thought to be most at risk, because acid seas would hinder them forming shells. However, the research shows that while these are in danger, perhaps surprisingly, some – such as barnacles – are often unaffected, while the damage from acidification is also felt much higher up the food chain, into big food fish species.  Ocean acidification can reduce the survival prospects of some species early in their lives, with knock-on effects. For instance, the scientists found that by the end of the century, the size of Atlantic cod in the Baltic and Barents Sea might be reduced to only a quarter of the size they are today, because of acidification. Peter Thomson, UN ambassador for the oceans and a diplomat from Fiji, which is hosting this year’s UN climate change conference in Bonn, urged people to think of the oceans in the same terms as they do the climate. “We are all aware of climate change, but we need to talk more about ocean change, and the effects of acidification, warming, plastic pollution, dead zones and so on,” he said. “The world must know that we have a plan to save the ocean. What is required over the next three years is concerted action.” The eight-year study was carried out by the Biological Impacts of Ocean Acidification group (known as Bioacid), a German network of researchers, with the support of the German government, and involved more than 250 scientists investigating how marine life is responding to acidification, and examining research from around the world. The study was initiated well before governmentssigned a global agreement on climate change at Paris in 2015, and highlights how the Paris agreement to hold warming to no more than 2C may not be enough to prevent further acidification of the world’s seas. Governments will meet in Bonn in November to discuss the next steps on the road to fulfilling the requirements of the Paris agreement, and the researchers are hoping to persuade attendees to take action on ocean acidification as well. Ocean acidification is another effect of pouring carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, as the gas dissolves in seawater to produce weak carbonic acid. Since the industrial revolution, the average pH of the ocean has been found to have fallen from 8.2 to 8.1, which may seem small but corresponds to an increase in acidity of about 26%. Measures to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide reaching the atmosphere can help to slow down this process, but only measures that actively remove carbon already in the atmosphere will halt it, because of the huge stock of carbon already in the air from the burning of fossil fuels. Worse still, the effects of acidification can intensify the effects of global warming, in a dangerous feedback loop. The researchers pointed to a form of planktonic alga known as Emiliania huxleyi, which in laboratory experiments was able to adapt to some extent to counter the negative effects acidification had upon it. But in a field experiment, the results were quite different as the extra stresses present at sea meant it was not able to form the extensive blooms it naturally develops. As these blooms help to transport carbon dioxide from the surface to the deep ocean, and produce the gas dimethyl sulfide that can help suppress global warming, a downturn in this species “will therefore severely feed back on the climate system”."
"Unfortunately, humans don’t have infinite brain capacity, so no one can become an expert on every subject. But people have found ways to overcome our individual limitations through social intelligence, for example by developing and paying special attention to the consensus of experts. Modern societies have developed entire institutions to distill and communicate expert consensus, ranging from national academies of science to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Assessments of scientific consensus help us tap the collective wisdom of a crowd of experts. In short, people value expert consensus as a guide to help them navigate an increasingly complex and risk-filled world. More generally, consensus is an important process in society. Human cooperation, from small groups to entire nations, requires some degree of consensus, for example on shared goals and the best means to achieve those goals. Indeed, some biologists have argued that “human societies are unable to function without consensus.” Neurological evidence even suggests that when people learn that they are in agreement with experts, reward signals are produced in the brain. Importantly, establishing consensus in one domain (e.g. climate science) can serve as a stepping stone to establishing consensus in other domains (e.g. need for climate policy).  The value of consensus is well understood by the opponents of climate action, like the fossil fuel industry. In the early 1990s, despite the fact that an international scientific consensus was already forming, the fossil fuel industry invested in misinformation campaigns to confuse the public about the level of scientific agreement that human-caused global warming is happening. As has been well-documented, fossil fuel companies learned this strategy from the tobacco industry, which invested enormous sums in marketing and public relations campaigns to sow doubt in the public mind about the causal link between smoking and lung cancer. However, some academics have recently argued that communicators and educators should not inform the public about the strong scientific consensus on climate change. UK sociologist Warren Pearce and his colleagues recently published a commentary (and corresponding Guardian op-ed) arguing that communicating the scientific consensus is actually counter-productive. John Cook published a reply, which we summarize here. By the late 1990s, political strategists recognized the importance of perceived scientific consensus. Market researcher Frank Luntz advised Republicans and then-president George W. Bush to cast doubt on expert agreement in order to reduce public support for climate policy. To stall climate policy, he argued, the Bush Administration should seek to convince the public that scientists were still arguing whether climate change is real or human-caused. Luntz was ahead of his time. It was over a decade before social scientists began studying this phenomenon and converged on the same result. A 2011 study found that support for climate policy was linked to perceptions about scientific agreement on climate change. This finding has since been independently replicated by other research, as well as randomized experiments conducted in Australia and the United States. Still other research confirmed these results using John Oliver’s viral TV segment illustrating the issue of “false balance” to the public.  Conversely, telling people that experts disagree was found to decrease their support for environmental policy and other actions, such as vaccinations.  Opponents of climate action may reject scientific evidence supporting the reality of human-caused climate change, but they have diligently applied the social scientific evidence indicating how to reduce public support for climate action. An analysis of conservative op-eds found their most common claim was “there is no consensus.” An analysis of a six-month period in 2016 found that the most-shared climate article on social media was about an online petition designed to cast doubt on the scientific consensus. It’s why the Trump administration wants to televise a Red Team/Blue Team climate debate. To push back against the decades-long disinformation campaign, numerous scientists have made efforts to quantify and communicate the scientific consensus. Meanwhile, disinformers have doubled down on their efforts to confuse the public about the consensus. The commentary by Pearce and company plays into their hands by arguing the climate community should surrender this argument to the misinformers. In the Guardian, Pearce argued: the public have already heard enough about the scientific evidence to make up their mind, without being fed increasingly esoteric information about levels of scientific agreement … valuable media and political attention has been expended on boosting the 97% meme, crowding out deeper conversations about policy framing However, in the United States, only 70% of Americans understand that global warming is happening, and only 58% understand it is human-caused. Further, only 13% of Americans realize the expert consensus on human-caused global warming exceeds 90%.  And multiple empirical studies, conducted in different countries, have found that informing people of the scientific consensus has a small but significant influence on their own subsequent judgements about the reality of human-caused global warming. While discussion about climate policy is urgently needed, establishing and communicating the scientific consensus about human-caused climate change is not a competitor to policy discussion; it is a complement.  No one argues that the scientific consensus is the one and only message that needs to be communicated - public responses to climate change are often as complex as society itself. But informing the public about the scientific consensus that the problem actually exists can support the discussion on how to best solve the problem. The argument that we have to choose between debunking the climate policy opponent’s disinformation about the scientific consensus or engage in meaningful policy dialogue is a false choice.  Disinformation about the scientific consensus that human-caused climate change is happening has been used to delay serious conversations about climate policy in the United States and a few other countries. Moreover, the argument that communicators should not talk about a scientific consensus when one exists is deeply troubling. In the history of science, it is relatively rare that such strong agreement emerges about basic scientific facts. When it comes to issues such as the future of our planet, recommending that we withhold this information from the public is unethical.  American policymakers have struggled to implement national climate policies, but not for lack of policy discussion “crowded out” by consensus messaging. Carbon tax and cap and trade bills have been introduced regularly, including by Republicans like Senator John McCain, and in the current session by Democratic Senators Whitehouse and Schatz. One climate bill even passed the House of Representatives in 2009 before failing in the Senate. Those climate policy proposals failed in large part because they were opposed by most Republican members of Congress, many of whom continue to deny the very existence of human-caused climate change. Denial of the scientific consensus has long been one of the primary arguments used to justify their rejection of climate policy. Likewise, many members of the public don’t yet understand that climate scientists have reached near-unanimous agreement that climate change is real and human-caused, and thus are either uncertain or doubtful about whether this is a real and urgent problem. Consensus messaging is one tool (of many) to help people understand the reality and importance of the issue. Moreover, what happens if we follow Pearce’s recommendations and stop communicating the fact of the scientific consensus, while opponents of climate policy continue to misinform? Two recent independent experimental studies (by the US and Australian authors of this article) found that when disinformation is not countered, people’s misunderstanding of the consensus increases, while decreasing their acceptance of the reality of human-caused climate change.A growing body of empirical research across different fields has established that perceived scientific consensus is an important influence on action (or inaction). Opponents of climate action have understood this for decades.  It is unfortunate that Pearce ignores this body of empirical research, thus making recommendations that play into the hands of those who deny climate science and seek to maintain the status quo. To be sure, science includes doubt, healthy skepticism, and disagreement, but that does not mean that efforts to quantify and communicate scientific consensus should have no place in society or policy development. Advocating such a stance is counterproductive and would keep the public uninformed about this important consensus of experts.

"Even if the Paris agreement to limit the global temperature rise to below 2C is met, summer heatwaves in major Australian cities are likely to reach highs of 50C by 2040, a study published on Wednesday warns. Researchers led by the Australian National University in Canberra used observational data and simulated climate models to assess future extreme weather events in New South Wales and Victoria. They examined what these weather extremes might look like even if the Paris agreement target of limiting climate change to a 2C increase is met.   The lead author of the study, the climate scientist Dr Sophie Lewis, said Sydney and Melbourne could expect unprecedented summer temperatures of 50C under two degrees of global warming. The researchers concluded this could be avoided by limiting global warming to 1.5C, the best-case scenario target set under the Paris agreement, though the researchers did not project what temperatures could be expected under this reduced global target. “What previous studies have done is look at changes in the frequency of record-breaking temperatures so, for example, how much more common 40-degree days might be in future,” Lewis said. “Our study wanted to look at what the maximum temperatures in an extreme summer of the future would be. That is what we need to know to plan for the future. We know that two degrees of global warming doesn’t sound like much of an increase but it in fact will lead to extreme weather events becoming more severe.” Governments needed to start thinking about how the public transport system would cope during peak hour in extreme temperatures, how emergency departments would respond to increased demand from elderly people and others vulnerable to heatstroke, and how energy requirements would be met during peak temperatures, she said. “The only thing we can do to prevent these extremes is to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions as quickly and deeply as we can, though some warming is already locked in the system so we will see some increase in the extremity of temperatures regardless,” Lewis said. The research was published in the science journal Geophysical Research Letters. The Environment Victoria chief executive, Mark Wakeham, described the findings as “alarming”. “It’s preposterous that in the face of these warnings and clear signals that we don’t have a plan to cut emissions,” he told Guardian Australia. “Beyond that we must dramatically improve our built environment to cope.” Housing standards needed to be improved, including retrofitting older homes to make them more energy efficient and cooler, and more shade needed to be incorporated into cities and towns, he said. “We also need updated emergency management plans for extreme heatwaves,” he said. “This study by respected researchers confirms that climate change is not just an environmental disaster but it presents an enormous challenge to human health and the economy.  “I don’t think we have any plans in place that would be adequate to withstand days of 50 degrees and it is another urgent warning to our leaders and all levels of government that we need a strong plan to cut commissions and deal with climate change.”"
"Portuguese schoolchildren from the area struck by the country’s worst forest fires are seeking crowdfunding to sue 47 European countries, alleging that the states’ failure to tackle climate change threatens their right to life. The children, from the Leiria region of central Portugal, where fires this summer killed more than 60 people and left hundreds injured, are being represented by British barristers who are experts in environmental and climate change law.   Supported by the NGO Global Legal Action Network (Glan), they are seeking an initial £35,000 to mount the case in the European court of human rights. The crowdfunding bid was published on Monday on the platform CrowdJustice, which has raised millions to help bring citizen-led cases to court. Lawyers will seek a ruling from the court that the countries being sued must significantly strengthen their emissions reduction policies and commit to keeping the majority of their existing fossil fuel reserves in the ground. The lead counsel, Marc Willers QC of Garden Court Chambers, said: “This case intends to build on the successes which have been achieved through climate change litigation across the world so far. “It will be unique because it will be the first case in which multiple governments are brought before a court at the one time in relation to their failure to properly tackle climate change.  “Climate change poses a major and increasingly worsening threat to a number of human rights and governments in Europe are simply not doing enough to address it.” The children, aged between five and 14, all come from Leiria, which suffered Portugal’s deadliest fires this summer. Some experts have blamed the increase in forest fires in Europe on climate change.  A 14-year-old who is part of the group taking action said: “Climate change causes many problems, but if I had to name the ones that worry me the most, it would be the sea level rise, which leads to the destruction of shores and infrastructure such as dams, roads and houses, and also the increase in the number of forest fires that we’ve been observing lately – especially this summer, as the fires caused many deaths and left our country in mourning.” The legal action will target the 47 nations who are the major emitters in Europe – including the UK, Ireland, Germany and France. These 47 were collectively responsible for roughly 15% of global emissions and held a significant proportion of the world’s known fossil fuel reserves, said the Glan director, Dr Gearóid Ó Cuinn. European court of human rights decisions are binding on these states. The case is also being taken to raise public awareness about what Glan says are the shortcomings in government policies on climate change. Ó Cuinn said: “We will work with civil society organisations throughout Europe to use our case to highlight the fact that unless governments urgently take much stronger action to prevent the release of greenhouse gas emissions, it is only a matter of decades before we’ll be witnessing the catastrophic consequences of insufficient action.” Two years ago a group of Dutch citizens – organised by the NGO Urgenda – successfully sued their government for negligence for knowingly contributing to a breach of the 2C maximum target for global warming.  Three judges ordered the Dutch government to cut its emissions by 25% by 2020, saying their lower targets were unlawful given the scale of the threat posed by climate change."
"Earlier this summer, a paper published in the journal Nature captured headlines with a rather bleak forecast. Our chances of keeping global warming below the 2C danger threshold are very, very small: only about 5%. The reason, according to the paper’s authors, is that the cuts we’re making to greenhouse gas emissions are being cancelled out by economic growth.  In the coming decades, we’ll be able to reduce the carbon intensity of the global economy by about 1.9% per year, if we make heavy investments in clean energy and efficient technology. That’s a lot. But as long as the economy keeps growing by more than that, total emissions are still going to rise. Right now we’re ratcheting up global GDP by 3% per year, which means we’re headed for trouble.  If we want to have any hope of averting catastrophe, we’re going to have to do something about our addiction to growth. This is tricky, because GDP growth is the main policy objective of virtually every government on the planet. It lies at the heart of everything we’ve been told to believe about how the economy should work: that GDP growth is good, that it’s essential to progress, and that if we want to improve human wellbeing and eradicate poverty around the world, we need more of it. It’s a powerful narrative. But is it true? Maybe not. Take Costa Rica. A beautiful Central American country known for its lush rainforests and stunning beaches, Costa Rica proves that achieving high levels of human wellbeing has very little to do with GDP and almost everything to do with something very different. Every few years the New Economics Foundation publishes the Happy Planet Index – a measure of progress that looks at life expectancy, wellbeing and equality rather than the narrow metric of GDP, and plots these measures against ecological impact. Costa Rica tops the list of countries every time. With a life expectancy of 79.1 years and levels of wellbeing in the top 7% of the world, Costa Rica matches many Scandinavian nations in these areas and neatly outperforms the United States. And it manages all of this with a GDP per capita of only $10,000 (£7,640), less than one fifth that of the US.  In this sense, Costa Rica is the most efficient economy on earth: it produces high standards of living with low GDP and minimal pressure on the environment.  How do they do it? Professors Martínez-Franzoni and Sánchez-Ancochea argue that it’s all down to Costa Rica’s commitment to universalism: the principle that everyone – regardless of income – should have equal access to generous, high-quality social services as a basic right. A series of progressive governments started rolling out healthcare, education and social security in the 1940s and expanded these to the whole population from the 50s onward, after abolishing the military and freeing up more resources for social spending.  Costa Rica wasn’t alone in this effort, of course. Progressive governments elsewhere in Latin America made similar moves, but in nearly every case the US violently intervened to stop them for fear that “communist” ideas might scupper American interests in the region. Costa Rica escaped this fate by outwardly claiming to be anti-communist and – horribly – allowing US-backed forces to use the country as a base in the contra war against Nicaragua.  The upshot is that Costa Rica is one of only a few countries in the global south that enjoys robust universalism. It’s not perfect, however. Relatively high levels of income inequality make the economy less efficient than it otherwise might be. But the country’s achievements are still impressive. On the back of universal social policy, Costa Rica surpassed the US in life expectancy in the late 80s, when its GDP per capita was a mere tenth of America’s. Today, Costa Rica is a thorn in the side of orthodox economics. The conventional wisdom holds that high GDP is essential for longevity: “wealthier is healthier”, as former World Bank chief economist Larry Summers put it in a famous paper. But Costa Rica shows that we can achieve human progress without much GDP at all, and therefore without triggering ecological collapse. In fact, the part of Costa Rica where people live the longest, happiest lives – the Nicoya Peninsula – is also the poorest, in terms of GDP per capita. Researchers have concluded that Nicoyans do so well not in spite of their “poverty”, but because of it – because their communities, environment and relationships haven’t been ploughed over by industrial expansion.  All of this turns the usual growth narrative on its head. Henry Wallich, a former member of the US Federal Reserve Board, once pointed out that “growth is a substitute for redistribution”. And it’s true: most politicians would rather try to rev up the GDP and hope it trickles down than raise taxes on the rich and redistribute income into social goods. But a new generation of thinkers is ready to flip Wallich’s quip around: if growth is a substitute for redistribution, then redistribution can be a substitute for growth.  Costa Rica provides a hopeful model for any country that wants to chart its way out of poverty. But it also holds an important lesson for rich countries. Scientists tell us that if we want to avert dangerous climate change, high-consuming nations – like Britain and the US – are going to have to scale down their bloated economies to get back in sync with the planet’s ecology, and fast. A widely-cited paper by scientists at the University of Manchester estimates it’s going to require downscaling of 4-6% per year.  This is what ecologists call “de-growth”. This calls for redistributing existing resources and investing in social goods in order to render growth unnecessary. Decommoditising and universalising healthcare, education and even housing would be a step in the right direction. Another would be a universal basic income – perhaps funded by taxes on carbon, land, resource extraction and financial transactions.  The opposite of growth isn’t austerity, or depression, or voluntary poverty. It is sharing what we already have, so we won’t need to plunder the earth for more. Costa Rica proves that rich countries could theoretically ease their consumption by half or more while maintaining or even increasing their human development indicators. Of course, getting there would require that we devise a new economic system that doesn’t require endless growth just to stay afloat. That’s a challenge, to be sure, but it’s possible. After all, once we have excellent healthcare, education, and affordable housing, what will endlessly more income growth gain us? Maybe bigger TVs, flashier cars, and expensive holidays. But not more happiness, or stronger communities, or more time with our families and friends. Not more peace or more stability, fresher air or cleaner rivers. Past a certain point, GDP gains us nothing when it comes to what really matters. In an age of climate change, where the pursuit of ever more GDP is actively dangerous, we need a different approach."
"I noticed the Eagle Creek fire when I was 14,000 feet in the air above Oregon in early September. I was preparing for my third skydive of the day and, through the plane door, I spotted a vertical plume of smoke that hadn’t been there on my previous jump. A lot of fires pop up at this time of year, so it wasn’t surprising – but I didn’t realise how big it would become or that it was Eagle Creek, which is one of my favourite trails to hike. A couple of days later, after the fire had spread, I went to take photos. I ended up being redirected and found myself in the parking lot of a golf course that I didn’t know existed. I completely stumbled on this scene.   There was nobody on the green when I started shooting. I just wanted to capture the fire, which was both beautiful to look at and horrifying to think about. When the golfers turned up, they were in the way of my picture! But I realised it was a cool shot with them in it. It was their last hole of the day and, to me, the scene sums up how life goes on regardless. They might look as if they’re oblivious to this huge thing going on behind them but the picture is just 1/800th of a second in time. They were very concerned and talking about how terrible it was.  This image was a lucky shot – no pun intended; I’m not a professional photographer. You can tell from the picture that I don’t entirely know what I’m doing – it’s a little grainy, there’s a bunch of ash in the air. I was trying to change my camera settings to get the best picture but the light was changing constantly. The fire would flare up, then get covered by smoke. But it’s the image, not the quality of the print, that caught people’s attention. I understand why the picture is seen as a metaphor for climate change. But according to reports, the fire was caused by a 15-year-old who tried to throw a firework into Punch Bowl falls. He missed and started a load of havoc. People say it was dangerous to be out there, but that’s not true. The fire was more than a mile away across the river, and although embers can cross water, a fire needs fuel to burn. The golf course was well watered with no dry trees. You couldn’t even feel the heat from where we were. I was not prepared for the reaction to the photo. A friend posted it to Reddit – I didn’t even know what Reddit was. Then one day I turned on the TV, and there was my picture on the morning news show. I was like: “How did they get that on there?”  I heard that someone called David Simon had tweeted the photo. [He posted it on Twitter with the caption: “In the pantheon of visual metaphors for America today, this is the money shot.”] I thought “OK, well, whatever.” Then someone said: “Is that the David Simon who created The Wire?” I was like, oh my God, that’s my favourite TV show. The reaction has been overwhelming. Some people think the picture is faked and I can see why. It’s a crazy, bizarre scene – who golfs next to a fire? Also, I don’t have a great lens on my camera – you can see a line at the point where the darkness of the golfers in black meets the lightness of the green grass, which makes it look altered. But that’s just an effect called chromatic aberration, and if I had a better camera it wouldn’t be there. Maybe after this I will buy a camera with a better lens. The fire spread across almost 50,000 acres, and it’s still smouldering today despite four days of rain. It will be a long time before anyone can get back on the trails: several big trees are still to fall and there will be landslides during the rainy season. But the Pacific Crest Trail Association does an amazing job of fixing things. I normally take pictures of birds, waterfalls and flowers, which I put on calendars for friends and family. I don’t play golf, but my parents and several friends do, so this picture will probably end up on their calendars next year. Born: Spokane, Washington, 1966. Training: “No training – I’m an amateur photographer.” Influences: “Nature and wildlife inspire most of my shots. I see beautiful pictures on social media, and think, how can I learn to take a picture like that?” High point: “This picture.” Low point: “Losing an SD card full of pictures I hadn’t backed up.” Tip: “Always keep a camera with you – you never know what you might find.” "
"It was well that Tony Abbott gave his climate change denying speech this week in London, because his thinking betrays a bizarre Euro-centric conservative outlook that constantly ignores multiple studies that show Australia’s economy will suffer greatly from climate change.  His speech to the Global Warming Policy Foundation was a typical Abbott speech: a greatest hits of climate change denying canards that collapsed under its own lack of internal logic.   It was redolent of the shallow conservative thinking that unfortunately dominates far too much Australian commentary – especially when it comes to climate change.  They think climate change is a myth but it doesn’t matter because global warming will be good because, as Abbott put it, “far more people die in cold snaps than in heatwaves”.  And as with most dull conservative thinking in Australia, it is a very European perspective that oddly would have you believe that Australia is located nearer to Austria than Asia.  The idea that increased temperatures may have some positive aspect for colder parts of the world is neither new nor insightful. The 2006 Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change noted that, in higher latitudes, “cold-related deaths will decrease” as a result of warming .  And if you stop there – as in effect Abbott did – all sounds good. But the report’s next sentence notes climate change will “increase worldwide deaths from malnutrition and heat stress”. Climate change is much easier to stomach when you ignore the fate of a majority of the world’s population. Abbott’s weird approach of viewing climate change as though we live in some snowbound country is the type of thinking that leads to the Carmichael coalmine despite a lack of financial viability and great environmental negatives.  The Australian’s Paul Maley, for example, responded to Abbott’s speech in praise-worthy tones, suggesting it was “was a thoughtful speech that deserved to be taken seriously”. He suggested that Abbott raised many good questions but that “a richer vein would have been the inherent tension between poverty reduction and climate mitigation measures”. He is right, but wrong in picking what that tension is.  The argument offered by Maley is one that echoes Abbott and other conservatives such as Barnaby Joyce and Matt Canavan that industrialisation powers economic growth and thus it would be wrong for us to deny this to other nations.  Maley argues that “this begs an awkward question: are we really opposed to climate change in all its forms? What if coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef is the price we must pay for affordable energy in south Asia? What if renewables, for all their promise, can’t provide the horsepower required to lift millions out of poverty?” It is a line of thinking that writer Richard Cooke recently suggested to me involves shouting how Greenies want us to go back to horses and carts, while at the same time arguing that we can only ever use 19th century modes of power generation. Not only will Australia suffer much more from climate change than just coral bleaching but the economies of south Asia are going to be hit harder than just about anywhere else.  In a nice bit of timing, the day after Abbott’s speech, the IMF released its latest World Economic Outlook, which contained a chapter on the economic impact of climate change.  The reported noted (much as the Stern review did) that climate change may actually have some positive economic affects for countries in colder parts of the world.  The IMF noted rising temperatures have “uneven macroeconomic effects”. If you live in a place where the climate is colder, warmer temperatures may actually lead to increased crop production.  But the report also notes that there will be “adverse consequences concentrated in countries with relatively hot climates, such as most low-income countries”. The IMF argues that in these countries climate change will lead to lower per capita output, in both the short and medium term. Even worse, they suggest the effect will be “long-lasting” and widespread. “[It] operates through several channels: lower agricultural output, depressed labour productivity in sectors more exposed to the weather, reduced capital accumulation and poorer human health”. And just in case you were hoping the problem might be able to be mitigated, the IMF found that “data indicate that macroeconomic outcomes have not become any less sensitive to temperature shocks in recent years, pointing to significant adaptation constraints”. That is, such countries are not going to be able to just adapt to the higher temperatures and carry on as before.  It rather slaps down the faux altruistic excuse for supporting the Carmichael mine as being important to help India’s economy, given the IMF finds that India’s economy will be among those most affect by climate change.  But while you might think it doesn’t really affect us, it is worth noting that when the IMF talks of economies with “relatively hot climates’ it refers to “117 economies with average temperature greater than 15°C.” And among those 117 economies is a rather familiar island continent known as Australia.  While the economic output of the southern parts near the coast of Australia are projected to be relatively unaffected, the IMF projects significant output per capita drops for the rest of Australia. The agricultural areas will be hardest hit – something that you would think might worry the National party. We need to shift from treating our nation as though its climate is that of Europe. We like to think our economy is linked with Asia more than Europe; our climate certainly is and we need to act accordingly. "
"Planting forests and other activities that harness the power of nature could play a major role in limiting global warming under the 2015 Paris agreement, an international study showed on Monday.  Natural climate solutions, also including protection of carbon-storing peatlands and better management of soils and grasslands, could account for 37% of all actions needed by 2030 under the 195-nation Paris plan, it said.   Combined, the suggested “regreening of the planet” would be equivalent to halting all burning of oil worldwide, it said.  “Better stewardship of the land could have a bigger role in fighting climate change than previously thought,” the international team of scientists said of findings published in the US journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The estimates for nature’s potential, led by planting forests, were up to 30% higher than those envisaged by a UN panel of climate scientists in a 2014 report, it said.  Trees soak up heat-trapping carbon dioxide as they grow and release it when they burn or rot. That makes forests, from the Amazon to Siberia, vast natural stores of greenhouse gases.  Overall, better management of nature could avert 11.3bn tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions a year by 2030, the study said, equivalent to China’s current carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel use.  The Paris climate agreement, weakened by US president Donald Trump’s decision in June to pull out, seeks to limit a rise in global temperature to “well below” 2C above pre-industrial times.  Current government pledges to cut emissions are too weak to achieve the 2C goal, meant to avert more droughts, more powerful storms, downpours and heat waves.  “Fortunately, this research shows we have a huge opportunity to reshape our food and land use systems,” Paul Polman, CEO of Unilever, said in a statement of Monday’s findings.  Climate change could jeopardise production of crops such as corn, wheat, rice and soy even as a rising global population will raise demand, he said.  The study said that some of the measures would cost $10 a tonne or less to avert a tonne of carbon dioxide, with others up to $100 a tonne to qualify as “cost-effective” by 2030.  “If we are serious about climate change, then we are going to have to get serious about investing in nature,” said Mark Tercek, chief executive officer of The Nature Conservancy, which led the study.

"The clownfish, the colourful swimmer propelled to fame by the 2003 film Finding Nemo, is under threat from warming ocean waters wreaking havoc with sea anemones, the structures that serve as its home, a study has found. Closely related to corals, sea anemones are invertebrate marine creatures that live in symbiosis with algae, which provide them with food, oxygen and colour. Clownfish, also known as anemonefish, in turn use the structures as shelter to lay their eggs and raise their young – keeping the anemones clean in return. For the study, published in the journal Nature Communications, a research team monitored 13 pairs of orange-fin anemonefish living among the coral reefs of Moorea Island in the South Pacific. They were monitored before, during and after the El Niño weather event that in 2016 caused major coral bleaching as the Pacific Ocean warmed. Half of the anemones in the study “bleached”, expelling the algae that live on them and turning bone white, the team found. This happens in response to environmental stress, such as ocean warming or pollution. “Among the clownfish living in the bleached anemones, the scientists observed a drastic fall (-73%) in the number of viable eggs,” said a statement from France’s CNRS research institute. “These fish were laying eggs less frequently and they were also laying fewer and less viable eggs.” No changes were observed among fish with unbleached abodes. Blood samples showed a sharp increase in levels of the stress hormone cortisol in the affected fish, and a “significant drop” in sex hormones that determine fertility, the team reported. The health of the anemones and the fish improved three to four months after the end of the warming event. Further research is needed, the team said, to examine the effects of a longer, or more intense, warming period, and whether affected fish would deal better or worse with a new bleaching episode. Exceptional ocean warming events are predicted to become more frequent as the average global temperature rises. Nearly 200 nations agreed under the 2015 Paris agreement to limit warming to two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) over industrial levels. A level of about 1C has already been reached and scientists fear the ceiling will be shattered, with potentially disastrous consequences for the Earth’s climate. In June last year, a study said many of the real-life Nemos swimming in children’s fish tanks around the world were caught using cyanide – another threat to the species. Finding Nemo, the movie about the quest of a young fish separated from its family, resulted in more than a million clownfish being harvested from tropical reefs as pets."
"Leading climate scientists have warned that geoengineering research could be hijacked by climate change deniers as an excuse not to reduce CO2 emissions, citing the US administration under Donald Trump as a major threat to their work. David Keith, a solar geoengineering (GE) expert at Harvard University has said there is a real danger that his work could be exploited by those who oppose action on emissions, at the same time as he defended himself and colleagues from the claims GE strengthens the argument for abandoning the targets set by the Paris climate agreement.   “One of the main concerns I and everyone involved in this have, is that Trump might tweet ‘geoengineering solves everything – we don’t have to bother about emissions.’ That would break the slow-moving agreement among many environmental groups that sound research in this field makes sense,” Keith said on the sidelines of the Climate Engineering Conference (CEC) in Berlin.  Indeed, utterances from people in or close to the Trump administration – most notably GE proponent secretary of state Rex Tillerson, who has referred to climate change as “just an engineering problem” – make it clear they either tacitly or directly support the idea of climate engineering. Earlier this year, Keith, a professor of applied physics at Harvard announced plans to conduct an outdoor trial into stratospheric aerosol injection, involving launching a high-altitude balloon that will spray a small quantity of reflective particles into the stratosphere. Keith believes the experiment may help to measure the feasibility and risks involved in GE, an umbrella term for a range of techniques to deliberately adjust the climate in an effort to mitigate global warming. They include reflecting sunlight from space, adding huge quantities of lime or iron to the oceans, pumping deep cold nutrient-rich waters to the surface of oceans and irrigating vast swaths of desert to grow trees. Supporters of research into geoengineering argue that its techniques – roughly-speaking divided into carbon dioxide removal (CDR, or negative emission technologies) which removes greenhouse gases, and solar-radiation management (SRM or solar geoengineering) which reduces the amount of solar energy warming the planet – could help to lessen some of the consequences of climate change. However, the common consensus is that the techniques should be used in addition to reductions in CO2 emissions. This week’s conference drew attention to the huge risks involved. “All the techniques being proposed have potentially severe environmental impacts,” said Silvia Ribeiro of the ETC Group, leading campaign monitors of new technologies and their possible impact on the world’s poorest.  “They also ignore the question as to why there’s not enough political will to have done more to tackle climate change until now and they in turn serve to justify the inaction,” she added. Concerns focus on techniques such as stratospheric aerosol injection, which some experts say has the potential to reduce the amount of rain from Asian and African monsoons and could have a devastating impact on the food supply of billions of people. Aerosol injection also has the potential to reduce the ozone layer and heighten the risk of exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Other possible side effects of GE may be an increase in ocean acidification, a change in weather patterns, a rapid rise in temperatures, and a huge uptake in the use of agricultural land, all of which could prompt mass migration of millions of climate change refugees.   But scientists such as Keith, and Mark Lawrence, scientific director of the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies (IASS) in Potsdam, argue that with the Paris agreement goals to limit temperature rise to two degrees or less, almost impossible to achieve, the world has little choice than to thoroughly explore technical intervention and the potential it has to avoid global disaster. “It will be very difficult to achieve the Paris agreement calls without some form of climate engineering,” Lawrence said. “It’s not impossible, but it’s hard to imagine we would make the major changes in our infrastructure and lifestyles in the time necessary.”  Keith also dismissed the view that climate engineers like himself were on a mission to prove that climate engineering worked at all costs, or else see the importance of decades of their life’s work evaporate. “At the best climate engineering is a supplement, and it could be that we shouldn’t do it,” he insisted. “Our work is to inform better choices and it would actually be very useful to know for sure it didn’t work. Right now there are heads of state and others in leadership who are explicitly assuming it could work, that it’s there if we need it. But let’s say we found something deep in the climate models which suggested we were overoptimistic about solar geoengineering, then I would say ‘abandon it’. That would be great. I’d love to publish that.”      "

"As a Caribbean climate scientist, I am often asked to speak about how climate change affects small islands. In the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, one of two category five storms to batter the eastern Caribbean in just a week, three words resonate in my mind. The first word is “unfamiliar”. Scientific analysis shows that the climate of the Caribbean region is already changing in ways that seem to signal the emergence of a new climate regime. Irma and Maria fit this pattern all too well. At no point in the historical records dating back to the late 1800s have two category five storms made landfall in the small Caribbean island chain of the eastern Antilles in a single year.  The intensification almost overnight from a tropical storm to a category five hurricane and the devastating intensity that lingered for several days are also unfamiliar, even to a region that is used to seeing hurricanes. Alongside other emerging climate patterns, there is a strong case to be made that there is something unfamiliar about the Caribbean’s climate today. We are seeing repeated and prolonged droughts, an increase in the number of very hot days, intense rainfall events causing repeated localised flooding, and rising sea levels that are consuming the beautiful beaches on which tourism in our region depends. The problem with unfamiliarity is that daily existence in the Caribbean is built on familiar patterns of climate. Our economies are premised on industries and sectors that are extremely sensitive to climate variations, such as tourism and agriculture. In a year that follows expected patterns and pulls no surprises, we see favourable economic growth and improvements in our quality of life. Even when we’ve seen bad weather, we have always had a certain familiarity with the limits of how bad it can be. Until now, newer infrastructure in the Caribbean has largely withstood the ravages of hurricanes and tropical storms, as their design has accounted for the upper bounds of extreme weather experienced in the past. Irma and Maria threw out the notion of planning and preparedness based on the expected and the familiar. Their ferocity destroyed even the strongest evacuation shelters and brought devastation of catastrophic proportions to our tiny islands. Just as climate change is heralding in an era marked by the unfamiliar, we need a paradigm shift in our approach to development planning in highly vulnerable regions.  The second word that comes to mind is “unprecedented”. A business-as-usual scenario without global action suggests that by the end of the current century, the Caribbean region will warm a further 2-3C over the 1C already seen in the last century. We project annual rainfall amounts will decrease by up to 40%, posing a significant challenge to already water stressed islands. Projections also show sea levels rising by 1-2 metres, far exceeding the rise already recorded.  Most frighteningly, given our experience in the last few weeks, is the expectation that we will see more of the strongest tropical Atlantic hurricanes (though not necessarily more overall). Cumulatively, the science of projections suggests that the region’s climate will be altered beyond recognition. This is to say, it will be outside the bounds of our lived experience to date. It will not just be unfamiliar at times, it may be unprecedented all the time.  The stocktaking is hardly complete from Irma and Maria. Yet for Barbuda and Dominica at least, the setback to their economies will be measured in years. The initial estimates for rebuilding are staggering. Perhaps even more heartbreaking is the loss of those things that are economically unquantifiable. The drastic reductions in living standards, especially for the most vulnerable, that will continue for months to come. The loss of irreplaceable culture and cultural assets, the mental anguish and loss of lives, the loss of biodiversity, and the destruction of “island life” as we know it. The small island of Barbuda, for the first time in 300 years, has no human inhabitants. They were all evacuated after the devastation wreaked by Irma and in anticipation of Jose and Maria. This seems to portend the challenge that climate change represents for the Caribbean region – a challenge that becomes more acute as the era of the unprecedented is ushered in faster than the region can prepare for its onset. Finally, the third word that comes to mind is “urgent”. Admirably, although the Caribbean islands are minuscule emitters of greenhouse gases, they have made bold commitments regarding future use. But in the end, the future viability of the region is premised on collective global action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It is for this reason that the Caribbean and other small island and developing states have argued for a limit to global warming of 1.5C. It is this message that must reach the global community when they see the images of Irma and Maria. For those in the Caribbean, the lessons are all too clear.  • Dr Michael Taylor is a physicist based at the University of the West Indies"
"Former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott has suggested climate change is “probably doing good” in a speech in London in which he likened policies to combat it to “primitive people once killing goats to appease the volcano gods” .  Abbott delivered the annual lecture to the London-based Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF), a climate sceptic thinktank on Monday evening. The Guardian and several other media outlets were blocked from attending the event but a copy of the speech was later circulated.  Abbott told the group the ostracisation of those who did not accept climate science was “the spirit of the Inquisition, the thought-police down the ages”. He also reprised his 2009 assertion that the “so-called settled science of climate change” was “absolute crap”.  Measures to deal with climate change, which Abbott said would damage the economy, were likened to “primitive people once killing goats to appease the volcano gods”. “At least so far,” he said, “it’s climate change policy that’s doing harm. Climate change itself is probably doing good; or at least, more good than harm.” “There’s the evidence that higher concentrations of carbon dioxide – which is a plant food after all – are actually greening the planet and helping to lift agricultural yields. In most countries, far more people die in cold snaps than in heatwaves, so a gradual lift in global temperatures, especially if it’s accompanied by more prosperity and more capacity to adapt to change, might even be beneficial.”  When he was prime minister, Abbott said he took the issue of climate change “very seriously”. But since he was deposed as prime minister by his Liberal party colleague and bête noire Malcolm Turnbull in 2015, Abbott has returned to many hardline views he had tempered as leader. He told the GWPF Australia needed “evidence-based policy rather than policy-based evidence” and took aim at a 2013 study that showed that 97% of scientists agree humans are driving climate change, “as if scientific truth is determined by votes rather than facts”. Climate change and energy policy has been a divisive issue in Australia for more than a decade, with Abbott consistently at the centre of the division. From the backbench, Abbott has pushed the Turnbull government to reject policies that would favour renewable energy. In his speech, Abbott blamed Turnbull’s failure to campaign on energy prices during 2016 for the narrowing of the government’s majority at that year’s election. “After a net gain of 25 seats at the previous two elections, when we had campaigned on power prices, we had a net loss of 14 when we didn’t. And subsequent events have made the politics of power once more the central battleground between and within the two main parties,” Abbott said. On Monday the federal energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, indicated the government did not intend to follow its chief scientist’s recommendation that it should implement a clean energy target. Abbott welcomed that news in London, calling it “belated”. “Even if reducing emissions really is necessary to save the planet, our effort, however Herculean, is barely better than futile; because Australia’s total annual emissions are exceeded by just the annual increase in China’s,” Abbott said. Recent research from the Australia Institute found the country was the only wealthy nation still breaking energy emissions records. The GWPF is chaired by Nigel Lawson, who served as Margaret Thatcher’s treasurer. Lawson has been an outspoken critic of climate science and recently incorrectly told the BBC the global temperature had slightly declined in the past decade. The BBC was heavily criticised for leaving his assertions unchallenged. John Hewson, who led the Liberal party from 1990 to 1994, said Abbott’s speech to Lawson’s group “sees him in like-minded, if disturbingly deluded, company”. “Tony Abbott has had a long history of playing short-term politics, for his own political benefit, with the existential threat posed by a rapidly changing climate,” Hewson said. “Abbott was effective in opposition – a man of nope rather than hope. His basic thrust is that if you can’t understand it, don’t believe it, or accept it. When it comes to climate, and the magnitude and urgency of the challenge, Abbott is prepared to deny the undeniable, and to ignore the risks and costs if left to future generations. History will undoubtedly judge Abbott and Howard and their small band of deniers harshly. When they could have acted on climate and emissions they failed as leaders, miserably.” Abbott’s speech – titled Daring to Doubt – contained echoes of his mentor and prime ministerial predecessor John Howard, who gave the same annual lecture to the GWPF four years ago. In 2013 Howard said climate “zealots” had turned the issue into a “substitute religion”. Abbott, who trained to be a Catholic priest, called climate change a “post-Christian theology” and said the decline of religion in society had left a hole in which other forms of “dogma” could take root.  A Lancet study in 2015 supports Abbott’s claim that more people die from cold weather than hot. But the World Health Organisation has found that by 2050, climate change will cause 250,000 extra people to die each year from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhoea and heat stress. Abbott went on to deny many of the central findings of the UN’s climate science body and claimed, without providing evidence, that climate records had been “adjusted” and data sets “slanted”. “Contrary to the breathless assertions that climate change is behind every weather event, in Australia, the floods are not bigger, the bushfires are not worse, the droughts are not deeper or longer, and the cyclones are not more severe than they were in the 1800s,” Abbott said. “Sometimes, they do more damage but that’s because there’s more to destroy, not because their intensity has increased. “More than 100 years of photography at Manly beach in my electorate does not suggest that sea levels have risen despite frequent reports from climate alarmists that this is imminent.” Scientists often refrain from linking single weather events to climate change, saying only that they fit with what they expect to see more of because of climate change. But as the Earth warms and scientist better understand climate change, weather extremes have been shown to have been made more likely due to greenhouse gas pollution. In Australia, the record hot winter just passed was made 60 times more likely by climate change. Researchers have also linked warming sea temperatures to the catastrophic rainfall and flooding that killed 35 people in Australia in 2011. Sea level rise is one of the least controversial aspects of climate science. It is progressing at 3.4mm per year globally, according to the Australian government’s Ozcoasts website. Perhaps not enough to appear in photographs against other variables, such as daily tides, but over time scientists agree this will cause problems with coastal housing and infrastructure. The Guardian asked repeatedly for an invitation to attend the event. Abbott’s spokesperson said the speech was “not considered a media event”. The Guardian understands the Times of London was invited to attend and excerpts of the speech were distributed to News Corp newspapers in Australia.

"A new study warning Australia’s major cities are likely to reach highs of 50C by 2040 – even if the world meets its target of limiting warming to 2C above pre-industrial levels – is yet more evidence that without immediate and urgent action we are facing a looming public health crisis during heatwaves and other extreme weather events.  The study follows recent unseasonable heat across New South Wales, with Sydney experiencing its hottest ever September day, as well as the doubling of record-breaking summer temperatures in Australia in the past 50 years. This new normal has hospital health professionals particularly bracing for the coming summer.  Public Australian emergency departments are tough places to both work and be a patient. They are hectic, often overwhelmed, not infrequently threatening environments that are emotionally demanding for everyone. And, with ever increasing demand and an ageing population, along with a politically-sensitive health budget, the emergency department is increasingly the public face of a stressed health system. Every day, sometime around 11am, the ambulances roll in. This is when we see the presentation rate suddenly increase, commonly bringing a new patient every three to four minutes, a rate that will continue until 10-11pm every evening. Generally during this 11 to 12 hour period we see two-thirds of our presentations. This is the time that the department heaves. During this period, on any given day, the resuscitation area will be full. A delirious elderly patient with septicaemia will be lying alongside someone with chest pain who may be next to a psychotic methamphetamine-intoxicated patient screaming abuse as they are restrained by security and clinical staff, while a full resuscitation of an out of hospital cardiac arrest or a major trauma takes place in a nearby bay.  Monitor alarms will be going off continuously, the sounds broken by an ambulance priority-one call coming through, while medical and nursing staff will be moving from one patient to the next as quickly as possible, trying to keep on top of the deteriorating patients around them. And soon enough ambulances will be banking up outside the front door as the department exceeds its capacity to deal with the influx, kept from being on the road responding to emergencies as they wait to offload their patients. While all this is going on, the inpatient units are being pushed to discharge as many patients, as early as possible in the day, to make capacity for the admissions that will come, both as emergency and elective surgical patients. All of this has to happen, has to work to an optimal level to deal with the demand of any usual day in our public health system. Now let us add to this day three of a heatwave (defined as three or more days of high maximum temperatures). With climate change causing a gradual increase in average temperatures, we know that heatwaves are more frequent and of increasing severity. What we also know from the heatwaves we have seen in Australia thus far is that we can expect a very significant impact on our public health system. Increases of up to 25% for ambulance emergency call outs; up to 60% increase in emergency department resuscitation cases, often in the elderly and vulnerable members of our society; an overall increase in presentations to our already overstretched emergency departments; and an increase in overall deaths ranging from 13% to 24%. In the 2014 Melbourne heatwave, that equated to 167 excess deaths. One hundred and sixty seven deaths. If that had been a fire, or explosion, or heaven forbid a terrorist attack, it would be a national disaster that would be in the public eye for days. Yet it will happen reliably with every major heatwave event, and we barely bat an eyelid. These issues are discussed in an article in the current edition of the Medical Journal of Australia, which I co-authored with former Australian of the Year, Professor Fiona Stanley, and public health physician, Dr Marion Carey. And it is not just these direct consequences that are significant. There is always a huge demand on public hospital beds, many hospitals running at or beyond a level of occupancy that allows for efficient systems. What this means is that even without additional burdens such as heatwaves, it is a constant struggle to create capacity for those who need admission. Events such as heatwaves only exacerbate this pressure, resulting in reduced access for all patients, not just those affected by heat-related illness. So, with the prospect of increasing extreme weather along with the so many other challenges of climate change we have some serious questions to address. Are we going to take the health of our population and our ecosystem seriously and do everything we can to mitigate the inevitable increase in ambient temperature? How do we minimise the completely unacceptable mortality rates that we are already seeing, and what do we do to invest in our health systems to cope with what will be an ever increasing burden? These are challenges that require immediate, mid and long-term solutions, challenges that we need to see taken seriously by the government of the day."
"Queensland underwent a dramatic surge in tree clearing – with the heaviest losses in Great Barrier Reef catchments – in the year leading up to the Palaszczuk government’s thwarted bid to restore protections. Figures released on Thursday showed a 33% rise in clearing to almost 400,000 hectares in 2015-16, meaning Queensland now has two-thirds the annual rate of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. The latest Statewide Landcover and Trees Study (Slats) report showed a 45% jump in clearing in reef catchments, where 40% of all clearing took place. The deputy premier, Jackie Trad, said the rise of 100,000 hectares to 395,000 hectares cleared was “incredibly alarming”. “We know that the current rates of land clearing in Queensland are unsustainable. Australia has become one of the deforestation hotspots in the world – the only advanced economy to be named in the 12 deforestation hotspots in the world.  “[It’s] because Queensland has returned to the bad old days of bulldozing hundreds of thousands of hectares of woody and remnant vegetations in order to make way particularly for pasture for cows,” she said. Rates of clearing surged when Campbell Newman promised to scrap restrictions, which his Liberal National party (LNP) government did in December 2013. Rates then reached a plateau of about 300,000 hectares for several years. The minority Labor government tried to reverse the legislation last year, but was blocked at the 11th hour in August 2016 when its former MP turned crossbencher Billy Gordon sided with the LNP. The Newman changes included wiping out protections for high conservation value regrowth, which made up about a third of clearing in 2015-16. The resurgence of clearing shown in the latest figures raises concerns about a fresh bout of “panic clearing” by rural landholders – primarily graziers – in anticipation of Labor’s changes going through. Labor has promised to push through protections if returned to office with a majority at the upcoming election, while the LNP and One Nation – which could hold the balance of power – have said they will scotch reforms. The environment minister, Steven Miles, said the latest report was “nothing short of devastating” because of the effects on wildlife, reef waters and coral, and Australia’s carbon emissions. “It’s even worse than my worst fears for this next round of land clearing data,” he said.  Miles said that “most concerningly” 35% of clearing was of remnant bushland, “138kha of old growth native forest, the most important habitat for native species”. “We know that each year in Queensland 900,000 mammals lose their lives due to this loss of habitat.” Miles said 40% of clearing was driving “more sediment into the Great Barrier Reef, literally suffocating our coral”. “That’s not to mention the 45m tonnes of additional greenhouse gas emissions caused by this clearing.” Deforestation in Queensland represents a hurdle not only to Australia’s priority goal of lifting water quality for the ailing reef but also its Paris climate commitments because it represents about 90% of the nation’s carbon emissions from land use. Recent clearing for suburban development in the state’s south-east has also been linked to escalating pressure on koala populations from habitat destruction.  “We need a parliament in Queensland that recognises this is an unsustainable problem that needs urgent redress,” Trad said. Tree protections in Queensland were the critical factor in Australia meeting its Kyoto commitments on emissions cuts before the LNP wound them back after years of disquiet in the state’s rural areas. Previous protections had brought clearing rates down from 500,000 hectares a year to 50,000. But Trad said they had subsequently “quadrupled” since the year before the Newman LNP government took office. Conservation groups said the renewed surge belied claims from the LNP and the farm lobby that opposition to deregulation amounted to scaremongering. Gemma Plesman, from the Wilderness Society Queensland, said the “shocking” figures showed a “hidden environmental crisis” that put Queensland “up there with the world’s worst offenders for forest destruction”. Queensland Conservation Council coordinator Tim Seelig said the state’s “tree clearing crisis just got a whole load worse”. He called it “a catastrophe for wildlife and a catastrophe for the reef”. Miles said the figures showed the state was “still suffering the devastating effects of decisions made by [LNP leader] Tim Nicholls and the LNP both when in government and since then in opposition, blocking our responsible legislation”. He said the federal government had stalled after initially launching investigations into allegations of illegal clearing in north Queensland, and the National party had responded “so violently”.  He stated: “The Turnbull government since then have failed to have any interest in assisting Queensland to protect our forests [or] to implement our long term sustainability plan for the Great Barrier Reef, which of course is incredibly disappointing.”  Miles said clearing statewide was the “single biggest threat” to koala populations and that a ban on developer donations, promised by Labor on the recommendation of the corruption watchdog, would help conservation efforts. According to deputy premier Trad, most land cleared statewide was for pastoral land, with a spike in “fodder harvesting” and “tree thinning”. Protections would remove landholders’ scope for “self-assessment” and apply the “rigour of science” to clearing applications, she said, and the surge in clearing ahead of Labor’s touted reforms last year showed it was “landholders doing the wrong thing”. Asked if a tree clearing ban was a “vote-winner” in rural Queensland, Trad replied: “This is the right thing to do, whether it’s in the bush or whether it’s in the southeast Queensland corner.”"
"Terrence Mckeen, 30, mechanic, Black Creek, Florida, with his mother, Gloria Mckeen, 68  The water surged to over 28ft, completely covering our one-storey house, the home that I grew up in. There’s no way to describe the pain I felt when we returned. My mom and I just burst into tears. Everything was gone.  Climate change played a big part in this. The only time it isn’t 100 degrees round here is winter time. Donald Trump is wrong to dismiss global warming, but there is nothing he could do that would stop me from voting for him again. He’s just trying to put our country back in order, and he cares about families. Look at how he’s helped the people in Texas already.  I’m most upset about losing my ceramic eagles. They were beautiful and given to me by members of my family.  We’ve never been able to afford flood insurance. The last floods came up 4ft into our house. That time, we were able to rebuild. I don’t think it will be possible this time. But we will never be homeless. My family is here for me, and so are my friends. People close to us have our backs.  Torrey Mosvold, 59, senior vice-president at Scandrill, an oil and gas land drilling company, Houston I built my house here in 2014, and it is elevated above most properties along the bayou. We saw others below us get flooded over the weekend, but thought we’d escape.  When the local authorities opened the dams on Monday, it started pouring in, first from the front door and then the back. It flooded over 2ft.  My wife has been unable to return to the house; it’s all too much for her. But we decided we are going to rebuild here. I don’t think it will happen again. This was a once-in-a-lifetime storm. Oil and gas is our livelihood here. I know we have to take care of our environment, but I also wonder whether our climate goes round in cycles over history, from cooling to heating. What we lived through wasn’t exacerbated by global warming.  I was pleased to see that Trump came and witnessed this for himself. I voted for him, because I like his experience in business and wanted a conservative on the supreme court. But leaving the Paris climate agreement was too hasty. Will I vote for him again? I don’t think so.  Jesse Sparks (right), 27, pastor, San Marco, Jacksonville, Florida, pictured with Torin Herndon  I believe it was the Bible fulfilling itself. We are told the end of days will involve fire, war and floods, and this could be the start.  I lost everything. The water got halfway up the walls in my ground-floor apartment. I fled upstairs to my neighbours and haven’t been able to return downstairs yet. I managed to rescue only my dog and some clothes.  My church was almost completely destroyed. Our bibles were damaged, the food we hand out to the homeless was ruined. We opened only four months ago and I have no insurance for the church or my apartment.  It hurts to see it all. I have never experienced losing everything, but I have ministered to people who have. It’s been eye-opening to be on the other side of it.  Larry Bates, 51, oil and gas CEO, Houston, pictured with wife Andrea Bates, homemaker, 50 We got 2ft of water inside the house. But it’s been incredible the amount of help we’ve had from volunteers in the community, the church, the school. We couldn’t have started to rebuild without them.  Yes, climate change happens, but I think the human impacts are small. Climate change has always been with us. Andrea Herrera, 19, joint owner Vino’s pizza, San Marco, Jacksonville, Florida There was 3ft of water inside my family’s new restaurant. It looked like a tornado had hit inside. The refrigerators were tossed around the floor, and the ovens ruined.  We sold our home in Miami, dropped everything, and moved to Jacksonville three months ago to open our business. I left college to help my parents, because they don’t speak English. We didn’t take out flood insurance because we weren’t told we were at risk.  As I looked at the damage inside, after Irma passed, I thought: “Oh god, what are we going to do now?”  Later on, I felt a deep sense of anger: I had to lose everything, because we are not taking care of our planet. I had never wanted to take action against climate change before it destroyed my family business. It bothers me that Donald Trump puts big business above the environment. I feel like he doesn’t care, and he knows that it won’t be his responsibility further down the line. But this is my future.  I was born in Cuba, but my mother and I are US citizens. My father lives here on a visa and recently applied for permanent residency. The business was part of his application. It symbolised our American dream. Now we have no idea whether we’ll be able to save it.  Levi John Thomas, 24, cook, Jacksonville, Florida, pictured with girlfriend Anna Topolski, 24 We tried to sleep through the hurricane, but you could hear it pounding the windows. We thought they’d smash. When it was over, our house was surrounded by water.  It’s such a surreal situation to be in. It sucks, seeing your friends going through this. Some of them have had everything destroyed.  Joe Eberle, 70, retired accountant, Houston, pictured with his wife Mary Eberle, 69, retired educator and librarian It happened gradually for us. The floods came into the house on Sunday evening, and then receded. But the rains persisted into Monday, and water started coming in through the weep holes in our brick walls. When they opened the floodgates, we got 2ft of water inside. We have lived in this area for 43 years and never experienced flooding. For over 100 years, we’ve had these storms – that’s just a fact of life living on the Gulf – but the rainfall this time was different: more than 40 inches in just a few days.  But I don’t believe in climate change. The climate is always changing, and there are other forces at play other than mankind and carbon emissions. We’re big supporters of Trump and like the way he’s handling the federal support for hurricane victims here. He’s a humanistic and thoughtful president. He’s got more done than Obama did in eight years. The fact he’s donating $1m of his own money to help shows how generous he is. Here in Texas, we have a can-do attitude you won’t find in other states. You don’t sit around and say, “Woe is me.” We’re independent thinkers. We’re the type of state that isn’t looking for government reliance.  We’re rebuilding our home right now, and our flood insurance should cover it all. Why would we walk away from such a desirable neighbourhood?  David Lim, 45, managing director at Exmar, an offshore oil and gas company, Houston As the water poured in, I tried to sweep it away. It might sound crazy, but it was all so chaotic, such a blur. I remembered my childhood in the Philippines: when the monsoons came, my grandparents and I would pick up brooms and sweep the rain out of the house. But this was different. The water kept coming. It had crept up to the powerpoints by the time I realised it was too dangerous and we needed to abandon our home.  It was 7am on Saturday. I’d been up all night, watching the weather on TV. You grab the essentials first: batteries, food, water and torches. But by this point, the water was so deep, so dark, I couldn’t see what I was trying to salvage.  I keep my photo albums in the garage, the only record of my family’s migration from Manila to Canada when I was five, and half of them were completely destroyed. Before we evacuated, I moved my mother’s books – old Filipino encyclopedias and housekeeping guides – to high shelves where I thought they’d stay dry, but when I returned to the house 48 hours later, they were destroyed as well.  The water rose to almost 5ft after the dams opened. When the flooding first began, I thought I was still in control. But by this point, as raw sewage flowed into the house from the reservoir, I just thought: “What’s the point?” My wife, two children [aged 12 and 9] and I are now living in a rented, unfurnished apartment in the city. We’ve leased it out for a year, because I know we won’t be returning home any time in the near future. We managed to rescue two beds and a sofa from upstairs. I bundled three bin liners of clothing into the car on my first visit back. Now, we’re focused on getting the kids ready for school, to restore some continuity to their lives.  Jonathan Lollar (right), 23, oil and gas refineries labourer, Deweyville, Texas, with friends (from left) Chase Phillips, Dustin Braquet and Darren Bland We had only just rebuilt. In March last year, flooding here destroyed my house and we had to bulldoze it to the ground.  We built on top of the rubble and elevated the new house over 7ft higher. We were promised that it would never happen again in our lifetime. But I was convinced we’d lose it all again after Harvey. This time, I just felt numb.  It crippled me last time. I lost everything, from my trucks to the cutlery in my drawers. I had no insurance and lost my job because I couldn’t drive to work. It was tough to provide for my wife and two-year-old, but my family always helped us.  We left the new house before the flooding got really bad this time. My wife bawled as she left. “I can’t believe this is happening again,” she said. I just hugged her and said we’d get through it. We slung together some groceries and some clothes for my son. I picked up my two rifles, and abandoned the home.  Later, I went out on a boat and helped other people evacuate. As I jumped out to rescue people, my wedding ring fell off in the flood. My father spent three days dragging a magnet around the floor until he found it.  When we returned to our home, the water had crept up to just below the bottom. It will cost us around $4,000 (£3,000) in damages, but the house was saved.  I put out a call on Facebook to ask for help with the rescues, and Darren, Justin and Chase turned up. The last time I saw Chase was three years ago in a fistfight we had. I was astounded to see him there, but I guess this was all about growing up.  I’ve managed to keep hold of my new job this time, but have been spending time helping my mother-in-law demolish her house. It’s the second time for her in two years.  Lois Hochhauser, 58, small business owner (selling leather hides), pictured with husband Greg Hochhauser, 57, Houston I grew up in Houston and hurricanes are a way of life here – Camille, Alicia, Allison, Ike, Katrina – but they didn’t hit us like Harvey. We realised we needed to get out after 7am, the morning of my birthday. I stuffed my cellphone and my driver’s licence into my bra, picked up our cat and left everything else behind. We waded towards Greg’s car, which he’d parked on higher ground. He carried our dog on his shoulders. My mouth was so dry that my lips stuck to my teeth. I couldn’t talk. I was terrified.  By the time we returned a few days later, the water had risen to 6ft. It felt oddly comforting; it was still, quiet. But, as it receded, it revealed a war zone. The leather furniture was covered in mould. I lost the DVD of my mother’s funeral last year. Our beautiful home of 15 years stank like a septic tank.  No matter what we do going forward, we’re going to have a much simpler life, with fewer material things. I’m scared of having to do this all again and I realise now how quickly it can all get swept away.  I grew up in a family of scientists and engineers and I hate that science has become politicised. I think the climate is changing, but I don’t really know if we’re causing a whole lot of global warming. The earth is a living, breathing thing. It changes. And we’re not ready to quit selling leather because our cows are farting.  It doesn’t bother us that Trump denies climate change. We voted for him. Politics shouldn’t be brought into this. Most people are decent at heart, and when something like this happens, we come together. • Commenting on this piece?

"It would be tempting to laugh at Tony Abbott’s feelings about how carbon dioxide is secretly good for humanity, and his insights into the goat sacrificing habits of primitives subduing volcano gods – except it isn’t that funny. The London outing is more strange and sad, and the strangeness and the sadness manifests itself on multiple fronts.  Let’s start with strange. The bloke who hobnobbed with the climate sceptics at Global Warming Policy Foundation is the same bloke who took a decision as prime minister to sign Australia up to the Paris international climate agreement. He’s also the same bloke who produced a set of initiatives in government which was badged as a policy to incentivise emissions reductions. That policy still exists and it’s called Direct Action. He’s also the same bloke who kept Australia’s renewable energy target, while abolishing the mechanism designed to give the market certainty to make future investments in baseload power generation. Abbott has a whole lot of feelings, and some loyal media megaphones to help him spread his singular insights, but these are basic facts he can’t escape. Abbott’s record in government points to him being a “warmist” (as Andrew Bolt is fond of characterising the modest band of weirdos who don’t think they know better than the world’s most eminent climate scientists). London’s hardcore climate sceptics, frankly, should have laughed him out of the room. Now let’s get to sad. Abbott’s climate frolic isn’t about a substantive issue. It’s about politics, because Australians haven’t had quite enough of politics, right? Abbott wants to cause a ruckus. He wants to make enough ruckus to constrain Malcolm Turnbull from producing a sensible energy policy. The lightbulb moment he’s trying to manufacture for colleagues is simple: the Abbott rationale is we can win the next election like I won the election in 2013 – by belting Labor on climate and energy policy. The country, the national interest, actually needs the major parties to come to terms and settle the climate wars which have generated the current problems we are all experiencing in the energy market, and settle them in sensible fashion. But politicians behind in the polls like to win elections. Put simply, Abbott’s pitch is an appeal to baser instincts – a pitch that prolonged polarisation serves the Coalition’s immediate interests. The former prime minister has also positioned himself in the public domain as a critical player in Turnbull’s ultimate settlement of energy policy, when the truth is all the heavy lifting on the new policy is happening completely outside Abbott’s orbit. The actual decision makers in the government are heads down bums up on the new investment framework, swerving around the many obstacles, trying to land something vaguely credible, which doesn’t blow up the Coalition. That’s the objective. Whether the government can produce something credible, given one of the core objectives has to be not blowing up the Coalition, is at this point seriously moot. Meanwhile, Abbott’s persistent wrecking tactics allow Labor to claim with a veneer of truth and credibility that the former prime minister is driving the government’s energy policy rather than Turnbull – elevating his status from fringe agitprop activist to centre-stage. In politics that sort of caper is called frontrunning, but I struggle for a word to adequately characterise that behaviour. Perhaps we can just keep it nice, and say cynical?"
"Last month, on these pages, I asked if you might get in touch with your questions and thoughts on population and climate change. You did – in some numbers. These generous contributions form the heart of the latest edition of We Need to Talk About …, our podcast featuring supporters’ voices, in which your concerns are addressed by a panel of Guardian journalists and experts. As a starting point, we used a Guardian article with an arresting headline: Want to fight climate change? Have fewer children. In the podcast, we hear from one of the academics who produced the research which this article refers to, but equally interesting were your responses to this issue, and the discussions they prompted in our studio.   That’s why we’ve decided to publish some of them here. While we aim to hear from lots of voices and include differing points of view on the podcast, a lack of time means we sometimes have to cut people short, or use one person to represent the views of several who have contacted us making similar points. Here, we can give members a bit more space to air their views. You can listen to the panel respond to them – our line-up is Damian Carrington, the Guardian’s environment editor; Lucy Lamble, the Guardian’s executive editor for global development, who often writes on and takes part in debates on global inequality; John Vidal, the multi-award winning former Guardian environment editor and Afua Hirsch, a writer and broadcaster for the Guardian and SkyNews among others, who has also worked in international development and the law.  But first gain a flavour of the concerns of your fellow readers below. Many of these questions appear in the podcast, while others influenced the direction in which we headed. The issue isn’t overpopulation – it’s poor resource allocation. We do not live in a world of lack, but of extreme waste and inefficiency. This is true of food, energy, land use and the financial system. The overpopulation argument is a way to once again deflect from real societal change that is needed, and instead focuses the discussion on families, usually poor families, having too many children. While it is likely that the Earth does have some sort of maximum carrying capacity, even that is not guaranteed with recent technological advancements such as vertical farming. The question is whether those technological advancements will be put to use to raise the standard of living for every human being on the planet, or are put towards continuing to line the pockets of the wealthiest individuals and their investors. To my mind, it is not the countries in Africa, or groups with a more traditional and much simpler way of life – such as Native people in North and South America, for instance – that have caused so many environmental problems, but the irrationality and consumerism of our western society. It is the fact that we consume without truly asking ourselves where all these goods come from, how they were produced, what the environmental impact is of producting all these mostly useless things. Unless we seriously address these questions, I cannot see any significant change or serious solution to climate change. I‘ve often noticed that some westerners, who have no agenda at all on any environmental question, are keen to invoke “overpopulation” as the main and only threat to survival on Earth. Is overpopulation just a convenient way for westerners to put the blame on Africans for the environmental threats we face? How can those with the largest carbon footprint be encouraged not to reproduce, when they are ones who make the greatest impact and have the greatest sense of entitlement? Pope Francis recently condemned climate change sceptics. He is passionate about protecting the planet and has called on everyone to care for creation, particularly as climate change disproportionately impacts the poor.  The Catholic church runs 25% of health and education systems worldwide and therefore, through its direct teaching and management, significantly reduces safe access to contraception for millions of women. No debate on controlling population growth and subsequent pollution can therefore exist without tackling this institutional barrier to action. Last year over 170 theologians issued a statement saying there was no reason for the Catholic church’s position against “artificial” contraception.  How does the panel feel the church can continue to do great work on this issue, yet continue to block safe access to contraception for some of the world’s poorest women? I am a gynaecologist working in Hong Kong, occasionally counselling women considering having another child. If someone is ambivalent about doing so, I add into the decision-making the idea that having more children impacts climate change. Since I was a teenager in the 1970s, I have believed it is a woman’s right to choose whether to continue a pregnancy. Working as a volunteer in an African country where abortion is illegal, I have seen women saved from death after trying to procure an abortion themselves. They were lucky – the hospital was nearby, there were good doctors, antibiotics, surgery, and blood transfusion. In African countries where abortion is often illegal, an unmet need for contraception is also common. I applied for a volunteer job in northern Uganda where women having five to six children is the norm; when asked, they say they would have preferred three or four .  Donald Trump’s global gag rule which removes US aid from any NGO providing contraceptive advice, is a huge problem. Not only because maternal mortality due to abortion deaths will rise in Africa, but also because the UNFPA [UN population fund] will stop training midwives, and the resulting reduction in maternal mortality will diminish. In addition, there will be greater unmet need for contraception.  Do you think our society can reach the point where choosing to have fewer children as an essential carbon-cutting strategy is as widely understood as conserving energy? As a parent I would take a bullet for either of my two children. I’m certain almost all parents would do just about anything to ensure their kids have a decent life. Knowing this, I cannot help but feel that if young couples around the world have good information they will do the right thing. If they understand the ramifications of their family-size decisions on the quality of life – chance of survival even – of their children, then they will make the most loving, compassionate decision possible: to conceive no more than one child. I joined Population Matters, an organisation that promotes smaller family size and reduced consumption, to find like-minded people and put my energies into a worthwhile organisation. I appreciate the impact we are having on the environment, and am mindful of that. However, I have found people around me such as family, friends and colleagues are largely not interested, or suggest they should have the freedom to do as they please. How do we start making a difference? Also we seem to have failed with high-profile individuals, royals and celebrities in particular. So what happens now? We have to reduce the population, hopefully not by severe climate change, war or disease. China’s one-child solution would not be accepted by most people. What do experts suggest? It seems money has the only power over most people. Should we pay people not to have children? How do we get politicians to talk seriously about the links between population and climate change? The last three elections in the UK have barely mentioned the environment. Is there an agreement between the political parties to avoid this discussion?  I like children, but have never felt that I would like to have my own.  I am very regularly treated as odd for this decision, and feel that if we don’t open up the discussion about not having children, people will never consider this decision thoroughly, whether for the environment or other reasons. In the past three years, I have made a number of lifestyle changes in order to reduce my carbon footprint – which has only further cemented my feeling that I don’t want children. I often feel like I need to keep having what can be sometimes difficult conversations with people about this choice, so as to build conversation momentum around the subject. Alternative lifestyles need to be promoted. I would like to focus on supporting and improving the lives of people already on the planet.  I have made the decision to be childfree, largely due to environmental reasons. As a childfree person, I am constantly surprised how this decision is commonly questioned by others as being a poor or “selfish” choice when the evidence suggests that it is anything but.  Given the evidence that having fewer children isthe greatest decision one can make to combat climate change, do the panel think that society can switch from having a pro-reproduction stance, where policies promote reproduction and society views having children as the “correct” choice, to a neutral stance, where having children is considered optional and policies are made to promote other means of having a fulfilled life? "
"Tony Abbott has “left the realm of the merely destructive and entered the realm of the loopy”, Labor says, after his provocative speech arguing climate change was “probably doing good”. The deputy Labor leader Tanya Plibersek said on Tuesday Abbott’s speech to a group of climate sceptics in London was “actually just weird stuff from the former prime minister” at a time when the government was trying to settle its energy policy.   While Abbott’s London outburst forced government colleagues into various acts of public diplomacy on Tuesday, one fellow conservative, the Sydney Liberal MP Craig Kelly, and chairman of the backbench committee on climate and energy, defended Abbott’s rationale. “The point that Tony makes is 100% correct, and the chief scientist has actually confirmed this, the chief scientist has said, no matter what we do here in Australia with our emissions, it’s not going to change the weather, it’s not going to change the temperature of the globe, it’s not going to prevent bad storms,” Kelly told Sky News. The government this week has continued to signal that it will not pursue the clean energy target modelled by the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, in his review of the national electricity market published mid-year. Abbott has opposed the Finkel recommendation from the outset, branding further subsidies for renewables “unconscionable”, and, alongside fellow government conservative George Christensen, has threatened to cross the floor in the event the government attempts to legislate it. With the government working to finalise its policy and present it during the final parliamentary sitting weeks before the summer break, the energy minister Josh Frydenberg used an energy summit on Monday to argue low emissions technologies may not need further subsidies once the current renewable energy target winds down after 2020. That signal has rattled industry players, who had assumed the government was working on a modified version of the Finkel recommendation. As industry alarm about the government’s policy direction intensified, the chief scientist publicly defended his mechanism as being important to provide investor certainty. While the clean energy target has broad ranging support from industry, the energy sector and state governments, the heavily contested internal dynamics of the Coalition renders the Finkel recommendation hard to deliver. The government’s new energy policy is expected to include an overhaul of the national electricity market rules to provide incentives to bring more dispatchable power in the market. While Finkel’s target has clearly hit an internal roadblock, the policy is expected to include mechanisms to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including the use of international permits, which the government first signalled when it launched a review of its Direct Action policy. Industry sources also expect the existing Emissions Reduction Fund, which is the Coalition’s voluntary scheme that gives incentives for farmers and landholders to reduce emissions, to be given renewed funding. A range of groups, from the business lobby to environmentalists, want the major parties to reach a bipartisan agreement on energy and climate policy and end a wretched decade of partisan argument. As the government is moving to finalise its policy, Labor has increased its public overtures that it is prepared to deal with the Coalition in the event it can produce a credible policy. But Labor has also grabbed Abbott’s public frolic to argue Malcolm Turnbull is not in charge of the Coalition’s policy formulation. Labor’s treasury spokesman, Chris Bowen, said on Tuesday Abbott’s intervention underscored the “catastrophic failure” of Turnbull “to stand up to the climate deniers in his party”. Bowen said Abbott was “an effective handbrake on the elected prime minister, stopping any sensible policy progress when it comes to climate change and energy”. He said Labor has not given the chief scientist the task of drafting a policy settlement for climate and energy, that request had come from the government. “Alan Finkel has delivered a very good report which says here’s a way forward,” Bowen said. “We’ve got this remarkable circumstance with the opposition of the day willing to be bipartisan but the government can’t reach an internal partisan position. “We can’t negotiate with a puff of smoke. “We need the government to have a position so that we can reach that policy certainty. We don’t have that because frankly Malcolm Turnbull is just not up to it.”"
"This is a story about how misinformation can take hold. It’s not always down to dishonesty. Sometimes it’s just a lack of time, a headline and the multiplying power of ideological certainty. Last week, China announced it was stopping or postponing work on 151 coal plants that were either under, or earmarked for, construction. Last month, India reported its national coal fleet on average ran at little more than 60% of its capacity – among other things, well below what is generally considered necessary for an individual generator to be financially viable. Neither of these stories gained much of a foothold in the Australia media. But one story on global coal did: that 621 plants were being built across the planet. The line was run in print, repeated on national radio and rippled out on social media among likeminded audiences. Some politicians and commentators claimed it showed it was strange, maybe even ridiculous, that MPs, financiers and energy companies said new coal power stations had no role to play in Australia. But the figure is wrong. Way off, in fact. According to the most recent data, there are 267 coal stations under construction. More than 40% of those are not actually new ones, but expansions of existing generators. A bit of background: the figure dates back to 19 June, when Nationals senator John “Wacka” Williams asked the parliamentary library to answer a few reasonable questions. How many coal plants are there in other countries? How many have been built recently or are being built? How many have closed? According to the parliamentary library analysis, he wanted the answers by 4pm the same day. Fast forward to September, and the Australian ran a page one story quoting the analysis under the headline “World building new coal plants faster than it shuts them”. The Oz (correctly) reported that the library found 621 coal-fired power units were being built. This was mis-repeated by several people who don’t accept that climate change is a present threat – including blogger and broadcaster Andrew Bolt and government backbench energy and environment committee chair Craig Kelly – as 621 plants being built. In reality, coal power stations are usually made up of several units. Victoria’s Hazelwood, which shut in March, had eight. But the distinction mattered little once Bolt had provided the shareable online headline: “New coal-fired power stations: World 621, Australia zero. Now understand?” While the stations/units confusion is relevant, it is not the main issue. The 621 is incorrect, however you cut it. By the time it appeared in the media, it was more than a year out of date. How do we know? The guy behind the data that was the initial source for the library analysis says so. The parliamentary library used as its source the Comstat Data Portal, a trade-focused African website not known for its energy expertise. As the library noted, the African portal copied its data from the Global Coal Plant Tracker, the widely respected database run by US-based anti-coal organisation CoalSwarm and used by the OECD, International Energy Agency and Bloomberg publications. But none of the players involved in spreading this story in Australia contacted CoalSwarm directly to check if the African database was accurate. It’s not. Ted Nace, the director of CoalSwarm, says there appeared to be numerous transcription errors. More significantly, the data on Comstat is out of date – from August last year. It did not reflect that new construction of coal plants plummeted in 2016 and 2017 following declines in construction in China and India. More coal-fired capacity is still being built than closed each year, though the gap has narrowed significantly. But, crucially, coal stations are not being used as much. The amount of electricity produced across the planet by burning coal has fallen each year since 2013. “A distinction needs to be kept in mind between capacity and electrical output,” Nace says. “Even though there are more power plants, the actual production of electricity from those plants – and likewise the amount of coal used worldwide – has fallen every year since 2013, with a small drop in 2014 and larger drops in 2015 and 2016.” The parliamentary assessment, and subsequent reporting, would have benefited from a closer glance at a report released in March by CoalSwarm, Greenpeace and the Sierra Club. Titled Boom and Bust 2017, it found an extraordinary 62% drop in new coal plant construction across the globe last year, and an 85% fall in new coal plant permits in China. Analysis of CoalSwarm’s database shows that in July, construction was taking place at 300 plants globally. Of those, 183 were new power stations and 117 extensions of existing plants. But that number is changing rapidly. As in so many things, the extraordinary story in coal comes from China. It still uses a stack of it, and is still building plenty of power stations. But according to a breakdown of the latest cancellation data announced last week by Simon Holmes à Court, senior adviser at the University of Melbourne’s energy transition hub, it stopped construction at 33 sites in the past three months alone. It means that since July, the number of new coal stations being built in China has fallen from 103 to just 74. There has also been a slight decrease in the number being expanded, down to 46. The reason? A glut in the Chinese electricity market. The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis found its coal fleet ran at only 47.5% capacity last year. India is the other big player, with 45 power stations under construction – 19 new plants and 26 being expanded. While debate continues to rage over whether the Australian government should subsidise Adani’s planned giant export coal mine in outback Queensland, existing Indian coal plants – including those owned by Adani – are struggling. Among countries comparable to Australia in terms of development, Japan – which signalled it would make a significant investment in coal after shutting down its nuclear fleet following the Fukushima disaster six years ago – has 14 construction projects, many of them small by Australian standards. Germany has been held up by lobby group the Minerals Council of Australia as an industrialised country investing in “high efficiency, low emissions”, or HELE, coal technology. It has one station under construction. Building work at what is known as Datteln 4 started a decade ago next month. After several delays, it is due to be commissioned next year. It is the only coal station being built in western Europe. Britain’s Conservative party has promised to phase out coal by 2025, and Justin Trudeau’s Canadian government by 2030. The two countries last week said they would work together to push other countries to join them. Despite Donald Trump’s grand promises about reviving the coal industry, there are no new stations under construction in the US. What does all this mean for Australia? In terms of the political debate, probably very little. Given the modern aversion to the persuasive power of evidence, misinformation will find a way. But don’t let yourself be kidded into thinking only local investors are leaving coal behind. • Support our independent journalism and critical reporting on energy and the environment by giving a one-off or monthly contribution"
"Accelerating rates of tree clearing in Queensland are wiping out any cuts to greenhouse gas emissions the federal government has made through its $2.55bn Direct Action fund, according to the latest data released by the Queensland government. The results also point again to apparent holes in the federal government’s greenhouse gas accounting, as its official figures maintain that land clearing in Queensland is reducing, and that changes in land use across the whole country are cutting emissions rather than adding to them.  About 40% of the clearing in the state identified in the latest figures occurred in catchments that drain water into the Great Barrier Reef, which will increase pollution affecting the struggling coral, sparking further calls for the environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, to use his powers under federal law to stop some of the clearing. On Thursday the Queensland government released figures showing 395,000 hectares of bush had been cleared in 2015-16, according to its statewide landcover and tree study (Slats). That was up a third compared with the previous year and almost 50% compared with two years earlier. The state environment minister, Steven Miles, said the clearing in one year in Queensland alone caused 45m tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions. The centrepiece of the federal government’s Direct Action policy on climate change is its $2.55bn Emissions Reduction Fund, under which it pays companies to pollute less. In the last auction of the ERF, the government paid an average of $11.82 for each tonne of carbon abated, meaning the emissions from Queensland’s land clearing cancelled out more than half a billion dollars of abatement paid for by the taxpayer – a fifth of the total fund in one year. “Deforestation has a major impact on climate change,” said Lyndon Schneiders, national director of the Wilderness Society. “Ending deforestation would be a fast, cheap and effective way to cut Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions.” Meanwhile, the federal government’s national greenhouse gas inventory, which is the country’s official source of climate change accounting, continues to find that across the whole country, changes in land use – which includes land clearing – amount to a carbon sink rather than a source. In the latest federal government figures, for the year to March 2017, changes in land use are counted as an abatement of 0.1% of Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions. The report on the figures says Queensland’s land sector emissions have been “reducing over time”. Changes in the way the federal government measures greenhouse gas emissions have led to revisions of historical reports, with significant amounts of emissions disappearing. Explanations given for the revisions do not fully explain the reduced emissions. The environment department said in a statement Queensland data was used to prepare the national figures and informed the national inventories. “Each year, we update land clearing estimates based on latest satellite data. Where applicable, we also revise estimates to reflect improvements in remote sensing and estimation methods,” a spokesperson said. The large amount of clearing occurring in the Great Barrier Reef catchments has led to renewed calls for Frydenberg to use his powers under the federal Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act to stop some of the clearing. Frydenberg has previously stated that clearing activities require approval under the act if they “have, will have or are likely to have a significant impact on a matter of national environmental significance under federal environment law”. He told the ABC in July the government had powers to enforce those laws and would continue to do so. But a WWF report from July found 99.2% of properties where land had been cleared that appeared to need approval under the act, had failed to gain it. The only time the federal government forced a property owner to gain approval, it led to fighting within the federal Coalition. “The amount of clearing in reef catchments should be ringing alarm bells with minister Frydenberg,” said Martin Taylor, a conservation scientist at WWF-Australia. “When the Queensland parliament rejected tougher laws the commonwealth was the last line of defence. Minister Frydenberg’s department has the power under the EPBC Act to rein this in. But the EPBC protections only work if they’re used and that’s not happening,” Taylor said. Frydenberg’s office did not respond to questions about the matter."
"The Turnbull government is poised to unveil a new energy investment framework that will impose obligations on the electricity sector to reduce emissions consistent with the Paris agreement. It will also create new reliability obligations to ensure there’s enough dispatchable power in the system. Cabinet, and the government’s backbench committee on environment and energy, considered the government’s new policy on Monday night before a party room debate slated for Tuesday morning.  Government sources have confirmed the Coalition will not adopt the clean energy target recommended by Australia’s chief scientist, Alan Finkel, in his review of the national electricity market. The vociferous internal critics of Finkel’s proposal, led by the former prime minister Tony Abbott, have made it clear for months they will not accept any policy that contains new subsidies for renewable energy. The existing renewable energy target peaks in 2020 and will run out to 2030. It is understood the new obligations for reliability and emissions reduction will be imposed as part of an overhaul of the national electricity market rules recommended by the Australian Energy Market Operator and the new Energy Security Board, established by the Council of Australian Governments to drive the recommendations of the Finkel review already endorsed by state and federal energy ministers. While key details of the policy are not yet clear, government sources claim the required emissions reductions in electricity will be consistent with the Paris framework, and the new policy approach will have a more positive impact on power prices than the clean energy target, which Finkel said would lower energy prices compared with business as usual. The government is also expected to keep the emissions reduction fund and it flagged the potential use of international permits to help meet Australia’s emissions targets at lowest cost in its review of the Direct Action policy, launched in March. The government’s efforts to resolve its energy policy comes as the new Guardian Essential poll finds a clear majority of voters support the now dumped clean energy target to help drive the transition to low emissions power sources. The new poll shows support for a clean energy target at 65%. It also suggests Coalition conservatives who have campaigned against the Finkel proposal are out of step with the views of their own supporters. While the total approval for the clean energy target is 65% in the new survey, 68% of Coalition voters in the sample of 1,845 voters said the government should implement a clean energy target. And while Coalition conservatives have railed for months against subsidies for renewable energy – Australians are on a different page. Australians are overwhelmingly supportive of incentives for low-emissions technologies, with 74% of the sample backing ongoing support for renewables, and 75% of Coalition supporters endorsing that view. A majority of voters, including a slim majority of Coalition voters, also support Labor’s policy goal to source 50% of electricity from renewable sources by 2030 – a policy regularly attacked by the Coalition. Labor’s policy was supported by 62% of the sample, and 52% of Coalition voters said they approved of it. At the beginning of a critical week for the government on energy, voters are inclined to see the government in Canberra underperforming on a key issue, although they are not as frustrated with the Coalition as they were in February. The Turnbull government is not doing enough to ensure affordable, reliable and clean energy for Australian households and businesses, according to 61% (down from 71% in February). Only 15% think it is doing enough, and 19% (up 5%) say they don’t know. More than half (56%) of Coalition voters think there has not been enough action, and 22% think it is doing enough. With Tony Abbott spending the past several months front running the government’s energy debate, and leading the opposition to the Finkel recommendation, 42% think the former prime minister should resign from parliament (down 1% from April), while 30% think he should stay in parliament in some capacity (down 2%). Liberal/National voters were more likely to think Tony Abbott should stay in parliament (38%) than Labor voters (27%) and Greens voters (17%). Labor is still in front in the new poll, leading the Coalition on the two-party preferred measure 52% to 48%, but that is an improvement on the government’s fortunes from a week ago, where Labor led 54% to 46%. The major parties traded blows over energy in parliament on Monday, when Labor asked a series of questions about why the prime minister had given early public endorsement to the clean energy target when the government now intended to dump it. Labor has signalled it is highly unlikely to support an energy policy which abandons the core Finkel recommendation but the shadow climate minister, Mark Butler said on Monday the opposition held out “some hope” that the government would produce something sensible. A major business group, the Business Council of Australia, urged the ALP to “stop, pause, and look at the detail” before forming a position on the government’s plan, because stakeholders needed bipartisanship for investment certainty. “The worst thing that could happen now is that we go into another round of never ever, pure politics or this won’t work or it’s not our scheme, so it’s not a good scheme,” said the BCA’s chief executive, Jennifer Westacott. Westacott said it was “hugely important” for the government to set a trajectory for emissions reduction, and a establish a clear trigger, so businesses understood how emissions would be treated, because “if you’re trying to do a major project you want to price risk.”"
"The Environmental Protection Agency kept three scientists from speaking at a Rhode Island event about a report that deals in part with climate change. The scientists were expected to discuss in Providence on Monday a report on the health of Narragansett Bay, New England’s largest estuary. The EPA did not explain exactly why the scientists were told not to.  “EPA supports the Narragansett Bay Estuary and just this month provided the program a $600,000 grant,” EPA spokeswoman Nancy Grantham said in a statement on Monday. “EPA scientists are attending, they simply are not presenting. It is not an EPA conference.” Thomas Borden, program director of the Narragansett Bay Estuary Program, which published the report, said Wayne Munns, director of the EPA’s Atlantic Ecology Division, called him on Friday afternoon to say two staffers who work out of its research lab in the town of Narragansett had been advised that they could not attend on Monday.  Munns did not give him an explanation, but Borden said he understood that the decision came from EPA headquarters in Washington. One of the staffers, Autumn Oczkowski, was scheduled to give the keynote speech at an afternoon workshop. Another, Rose Martin, was scheduled to speak on a panel. “We’ve been working with more than five researchers in that lab who have contributed substantial elements to our report,” Borden said. After Munns’ call, he said, he checked with a third researcher who consults for the EPA, Emily Shumchenia, and who was scheduled to participate in Monday’s event. “I advised her, you should check with your folks and see if you should attend,” Borden said. “She was advised by EPA region one that she should not attend.” The report finds that climate change is affecting air and water temperatures, precipitation, sea level and fish. Borden said scientists from a variety of agencies and institutions had been working for years on the 500-page technical document, the purpose of which is to examine the condition of the bay and the trends with data on 24 environmental indicators. Those include stressors such as population, and also climate change, such as warming temperatures, increased precipitation and increased sea level rise. “It’s a comprehensive scientific update of the status of the bay,” he said. “It’s not a policy document. It’s a scientific report. It doesn’t propose policy changes.” All four members of Rhode Island’s congressional delegation were scheduled to attend a news conference on the report on Monday morning. Democratic senator Jack Reed criticized the EPA move, which was first reported by the New York Times. “Muzzling EPA scientists won’t do anything to address climate change,” Reed said. “While the Trump administration tries to suppress the facts, the American people are seeing and feeling the real world impacts.  “We need to work on a bipartisan basis to reduce pollution and emissions, and this type of hostility toward science inhibits rather than furthers discussion and action.” The estuary program gets all its funding from the EPA. John King, a University of Rhode Island professor of oceanography who chairs the science advisory committee of the Narragansett Bay Estuary Program, told the Times: “It’s definitely a blatant example of the scientific censorship we all suspected was going to start being enforced at EPA.  “They don’t believe in climate change, so I think what they’re trying to do is stifle discussions of the impacts of climate change.” Scott Pruitt, the former Oklahoma attorney general made EPA administrator by Donald Trump, has questioned accepted climate change science.  Trump, who has among other actions has withdrawn the US from the Paris climate accord and scrapped Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan, famously said climate change was a “hoax” invented by China."
"According to a new study published by Yale scientists in Environmental Research Letters, Americans are willing to pay a carbon tax that would increase their household energy bills by $15 per month, or about 15%, on average. This result is consistent with a survey from last year that also found Americans are willing to pay an average of $15 to $20 per month to combat climate change. Another recent Yale survey found that overall, 78% of registered American voters support taxing and/or regulating carbon pollution, including 67% of Republicans and 60% of conservative Republicans.  This raises the question – with such broad support across the political spectrum, why doesn’t America have a carbon tax in place by now? Study co-author Anthony Leiserowitz noted the similarity to public support for many gun control policies: Policy elites sometimes have ideological stances quite different than their constituents, even of their own party (e.g., background checks on gun purchases in the US which is overwhelmingly favored by Democrats and Republicans).  Public support often doesn’t translate into policy. On the issue of gun control, Republican lawmakers are afraid that if they vote for even the most benign policies like requiring background checks for all gun purchases, the NRA will mobilize its supporters against them. In primary races with relatively low turnout, with partisans more likely to vote, Republican lawmakers fear that mobilizing even a relatively small minority of opposition voters could cost them their jobs. On the issue of climate change and carbon taxes, they have the same fear of the Koch network. In short, the wealthy and powerful have more influence over American policy than average voters.  The new Yale study also asked survey participants how they would like to use the revenue generated by a carbon tax. Supporting the development of solar and wind energy and funding infrastructure improvements were the two most popular choices (around 80% support), followed by assisting displaced coal workers (73% support) and paying down the national debt (67% support). Interestingly, the option of returning the revenue back to taxpayers was supported by fewer than half of Americans – both Republicans and Democrats. Basically, Americans support a carbon tax because they want action to address climate change, and they want to spend the revenue on clean energy for the same reason. Or they at least want to spend the money on something they consider important; for conservative Republicans, paying down the national debt was the top choice. However, we’ve seen that public opinion doesn’t dictate policy, and there are some important reasons why returning all of the carbon tax revenue to households (a.k.a. ‘revenue neutrality’) has widespread support, including among many prominent Republicans. Perhaps most importantly, Republican Party thought leaders and elder statesmen consider revenue neutrality critical to their support for a carbon tax. For one thing, many Republican policymakers have signed ‘the no tax pledge.’ During Obama’s presidency, Republicans weren’t even willing to accept large budget cuts in exchange for much smaller tax increases. Cutting taxes may become the only significant legislative accomplishment of the current two-year congressional session. If there’s one issue Republican policymakers can agree on, it’s cutting (or at least not increasing) taxes. But as Ronald Reagan’s Secretary of State George Shultz put it, “It’s not a tax if the government doesn’t keep the money.” Secondly, because poorer households spend a larger proportion of their income on energy bills, a carbon tax would be a regressive policy. However, because wealthier households use more energy and thus have larger net energy bills, returning all the revenue equally to households would be a progressive policy. Studies have found that most households would actually come out ahead, with rebate checks exceeding their increased energy costs, and particularly lower income households. Studies have also shown a revenue-neutral carbon tax policy would grow the economy, largely for this very reason – the rebate checks would give people more disposable income to spend. Third, returning the revenue to households would allow for a higher carbon pollution tax. If Americans are willing to pay an extra $15 per month to tackle climate change, that would translate to a very modest carbon tax. But if some or all of the revenue is returned to households, net energy costs will be offset by rebate checks, allowing for a higher carbon tax at the same cost to households. And the higher the tax, the more effective it will be at reducing American carbon pollution. There are major efforts underway to make a revenue-neutral carbon tax policy a reality in the USA. From the grassroots level, the volunteer organization Citizens’ Climate Lobby has been at work for ten years, and the group has grown exponentially. In its annual summary lobbying effort this year, the group sent 1,300 volunteers to lobby every member of congress to support a revenue-neutral carbon tax.  The policy is also supported by many prominent Republican Party elder statesmen, including cabinet members from the last three Republican administrations; two former Secretaries of State, two former Secretaries of Treasury, and two former chairmen of the President’s Council of Economic Advisors. Their group, called the Climate Leadership Council, has met with the White House to urge support for a revenue-neutral carbon tax. Although most Republican Party policymakers continue to oppose taxing carbon pollution, it’s inevitable that the USA will implement national climate policy sooner or later. A revenue-neutral carbon tax seems to represent the path of least resistance. The only question is how much longer the GOP will delay the inevitable."
"Synthetic meat and fish (Is ‘Frankenfish’ the start of a food revolution?, G2, 21 September) could have huge benefits – although there are cheaper and simpler ways to improve food supplies, including better livestock practices, conservation plus careful use, integrated methods, silviculture and using different animals fed more sensibly. These ideas, technology and cutting waste could massively reduce livestock’s impact, but nobody wants the bill while benefits could still be lost. Even dramatic reductions in human emissions may not stop the climate change trend. Those most at risk won’t benefit from technological advances, and the response to climate refugees approaching richer countries can be imagined. More food from less space doesn’t guarantee more room for wildlife; environmentalists often estimate western lifestyles for all would require at least three fully exploited planets. And it isn’t just burgers: biofuels, other cash crops, mineral extraction, suburban sprawl, dams and other developments could outweigh potential gains.  Underlying these concerns are free market idiocies. Resources are looted for short-term gain, having enough is an alien concept and “make more money, buy more stuff” rules. Maybe the world needs to chill in more ways than one.Iain ClimieWhitchurch, Hampshire  • The great thing about animals (including fish) is that they enclose a protected environment for their cells. Not only that, but they find and input their own raw materials and output their waste products. Compare that with cell culture, where a complex liquid has to be prepared and maintained which would be a five-star home for all manner of undesirable microorganisms. Sterility is tricky to maintain even at petri dish volumes, but must be a nightmare when scaled up to industrial levels. David RidgeLondon  • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters"
"With the Coalition still hamstrung by internal divide over a clean energy target, a new report shows Australia is in danger of not meeting its Paris agreement commitments unless it acts soon. A report by the Australia Institute’s climate and energy program examined the government’s own modelling of the nation’s greenhouse gas emission reduction targets and found Australia could either transition to a 66-75% renewable energy target by 2030 to meet its commitments, or push the responsibility on to other sectors, such as agriculture or manufacturing.   While focusing on the energy sector would be the easiest way for Australia to meet its Paris responsibilities, made under the Abbott government, the executive director of the Australia Institute, Ben Oquist, said the current debate could see the nation head down a more difficult path. In what he now says was an “aspirational” move, Abbott committed Australia to an emissions reduction target of 26-28% in 2015, shortly before he was replaced as prime minister. Last week, Abbott hinted he was also prevented from further lowering the nation’s renewable energy target by his party, which his then environment minister, Greg Hunt, disputed on Sunday, and announced he could not support any further investment in renewable energy, exercising members of the backbench to follow suit. Oquist said the analysis showed that, regardless of the politics, action was needed. “While political uncertainty continues to shroud energy policy, this new modelling analysis shows higher levels of renewables will be needed if Australia is to meet the Paris targets in an economically efficient manner,” he told Guardian Australia.  “Regardless, Australia’s 26-28% emissions targets will have to be lifted in the future if Australia is to meet its obligations to help avoid the 1.5-2 degrees of global warming agreed to in Paris .  “The reality is that the electricity sector will have to ‘go faster’ in reducing emissions than other sectors of the economy. “Outside the electricity arena abatement is more expensive and the technical and political complexities are greater.” The institute’s analysis showed the easiest path was to reform the energy sector, as it had “available and cost effective options” in the form of renewables to turn to, while other sectors, such as Australia’s leading export industries, agriculture and manufacturing, did not.  “The good news is that renewables are now driving down prices and more renewables in the future will lead to even lower costs,” Oquist said. “With a combination of a ‘smarter’ grid, storage and demand management, much higher levels of renewable penetration can be achieved with strong reliability and in a more cost-effective way than a coal-dominated system.” Abbott is urging the government to adopt his “reliable energy target” as he agitates for an abandonment of clean energy targets, claiming “green religion” had trumped “common sense” with energy policy over the last 15 years. Malcolm Turnbull is yet to act on the central recommendation of the Finkel review, a 28% emissions reduction target, with the Coalition internally divided on how best to move forward. An earlier analysis by the Australian Conservation Foundation showed the Finkel target did not go far enough to meeting Australia’s Paris commitment, with the goal to limit global warming to two degrees this century. The government has been locked in a battle with AGL over its plans to close the aging coal-fired Liddell power station in 2022, with Turnbull and the energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, urging the company to keep it open, or sell to someone who will, in order to keep its power in the grid. Turnbull has also floated the idea of using the Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund to build a new coal-fired power station in northern Queensland. But he has refused to submit to Abbott’s demands the Coalition move away from renewables, repeatedly saying they remain “part of the mix” and criticising those who want to “dumb down” the debate into renewables versus coal. But the issue promises to continue to dominate the agenda, as the Turnbull government attempts to finalise a new investment framework for energy, with a clean energy target being contemplated as part of that, although it has made clear it will not adopt the Finkel target. "
"Last week, Trump’s EPA administrator Scott Pruitt announced, “the war on coal is over.” If there ever was a war on coal, the coal industry has lost. According to a new report from the Union of Concerned Scientists, many old American coal power plants are being retired or converted to natural gas, and new coal power plants aren’t being built because they’ve become more expensive than natural gas, wind, and solar energy:  The share of US electricity coming from coal fell from 51 percent in 2008 to 31 percent in 2016—an unprecedented change. New UCS analysis finds that, of the coal units that remain, roughly one in four plans to retire or convert to natural gas; another 17 percent are uneconomic and could face retirement soon.  Natural gas has now surpassed coal to supply 32% of US electricity (up from 21% in 2008), and solar and wind are up to 10% (from 3% in 2008). This trend will continue. As old coal plants continue to retire and be replaced by cheaper renewables and natural gas, their share of the US electricity supply will continue to plummet, and coal will become a fossil fuel in every sense of the word. That’s why American companies continue to invest in cheap, clean renewable energy. As a result, our air and water are becoming cleaner, Americans are becoming healthier, and our carbon pollution is falling. Two more coal plants to close in Texas. Believe that makes 12 this year nationwide: https://t.co/8n1kUQUJSc The shift away from coal poses a challenge for regions in which the local economy depends on the fossil fuel, but the transition is inevitable. A wise economic policy would involve funding programs to help those regions adapt to the change (Hillary Clinton proposed one such plan during her presidential campaign). A recent study showed that Americans are willing to pay a carbon tax with some of the revenue going to assist displaced coal workers. The Trump administration has instead opted to try and slow coal’s inevitable decline. The Trump administration seems hell-bent on causing as much global warming as possible. First there was the historically irresponsible decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, joining war-torn Syria as the only world countries to reject the treaty. Then just a few weeks ago, Trump’s Energy Secretary Rick Perry announced a plan to effectively take coal out of the free market and instead subsidize it with taxpayer dollars to bail out the industry and keep uneconomical coal power plants open. The hypocrisy ran thick – as Perry called for propping up the coal industry with increased taxpayer subsidies, Pruitt called for an end to subsidies for renewable energy:  I would do away with these incentives that we give to wind and solar. I’d let them stand on their own and compete against coal and natural gas and other sources, and let utilities make real-time market decisions on those types of things as opposed to being propped up by tax incentives and other types of credits that occur Soon thereafter, Priutt announced that Trump’s EPA will repeal the Clean Power Plan. That policy represented America’s most significant effort to cut its carbon pollution, but had been mired in a legal battle over whether the plan exceeded EPA’s regulatory authority under the Clean Air Act. Rather than let the courts decide the case, which many experts felt the EPA would win, Pruitt stopped defending the case in court and ended the program.  The problem is that according to the US Supreme Court, the EPA is legally required to regulate dangerous carbon pollution. Pruitt’s EPA may propose a dramatically weakened plan that probably wouldn’t survive a court challenge, or he may just try to run out the clock on Trump’s term. As with the disastrous Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, they don’t have a replacement plan. In the meantime, states and environmental groups will take his Clean Power Plan repeal to court. I will sue to stop the Trump Admin’s irresponsible and illegal #CleanPowerPlan repeal, which threatens NYers public health & environment. pic.twitter.com/utm5Q0VWrF Pruitt’s Clean Power Plan repeal justification is largely based on bogus economics, which the Trump administration is using to reduce government estimates of the ‘social cost of carbon.’ This figure – which estimates how much a ton of carbon pollution costs society in terms of damages caused by climate change – is integral to many government policies. A majority of economists think the government’s estimate is too low, but Pruitt’s EPA manipulated the math by ignoring the costs of America’s carbon pollution to the rest of the world, and by using a high discount rate, which essentially says we care more about saving money now than preventing climate damages and suffering for future generations. However, because renewables and natural gas are now cheaper than coal, an analysis by the Rhodium Group found that the US will meet the Clean Power Plan target of cutting carbon pollution from electricity generation 32% below 2005 levels by 2030 despite its repeal.  That being said, with the Clean Power Plan in place, the US likely would have beat its targets. As this excellent tool created by Carbon Brief shows, many states like California and Idaho are ahead of the curve, but other states like Texas and West Virginia would have been forced to accelerate their transitions to clean energy, had the Clean Power Plan been enforced. The good news is that none of the Trump administration’s moves are permanent. The next president can rejoin the Paris climate agreement, have the EPA draft new rules to regulate power plant carbon pollution, and revise the social cost of carbon based on real science and math. As Citizens’ Climate Lobby Executive Director Mark Reynolds wrote: Those who cheer the EPA’s move should remember that President Obama initiated the Clean Power Plan in 2015 in the face of Congress’s inaction on climate change. Without effective legislation to combat climate change, a future president could just as easily go down the path of executive action and regulations again. The best answer here is for Congress to pass legislation putting the market to work on solving climate change. There’s been some movement in this direction. A group of Republican elder statesmen in the Climate Leadership Council called for a revenue-neutral carbon tax, which would grow the economy. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) recently called for a price on carbon pollution and is said to be working with Senator Whitehouse (D-RI) on climate legislation. The House Climate Solutions Caucus is now up to 30 Republican and 30 Democratic members and is trying to craft a bipartisan replacement for the Clean Power Plan. The Trump administration is taking every possible step to burn away our future, but fortunately the transition to a clean energy economy is unstoppable, and many of his party members are coming to grips with that reality."
"No one saw the Labour revolution coming. Not even Jeremy Corbyn. From nowhere new life was breathed into an old party. But with the Tories digging in for a long haul to the next election, next week in Brighton Labour has a choice: to stick or twist. What makes Corbyn special is that he has stuck with everything he ever believed in. But his strengths are also his weaknesses. We have to remember why social democracy lost its power. Yes, the idea of free markets chimed with a more individualistic age, but a lack of responsiveness and heavy doses of paternalism made state socialism unpopular.  Labour now needs to make four big changes if it is to own a very different political future. The first is cultural. The party and its supporters can and must fight many things. What it can’t fight is the spirit of our age. That spirit is networked and collaborative. Unlike the top-down social democratic settlement of the last century, 21st-century socialism will be participatory. The grassroots Momentum movement has demonstrated what is possible. If it’s to own this emerging future, then Labour must become democratic and pluralistic. This means tolerance of others inside the party and renouncing the first past the post electoral system once and for all. The complexity of the modern world demands an equally complex governance response. The idea that Labour alone can deal with the coming of the machine age, global finance and climate change makes no sense. And while “one more heave” might just get you into office, it leaves you as far from real power as ever. Pluralism is the only way to create the progressive alliances needed to overcome the regressive alliances that will inevitably and forcefully do everything to stifle Labour’s radical agenda. Whether the party will make the shift to support proportional representation is the litmus test, for this would show it trusts the people, treats them all equally and is willing to forgo a closed tribalism for the greater good. Next, Labour must fully embrace environmentalism. Climate change, as we now see daily, hits the poorest first and hardest, while a culture of turbo-consumption stretches the bonds of social solidarity to breaking point. If Labour’s goal is 77-inch televisions for the many, not the few, it will lack the vision for a good society and help destroy the planet. Instead, Labour should promote a shorter working week and a universal basic income. Finally, Labour must become part of a global movement for change. Yes, Corbyn is often brilliant on international solidarity with the poor and the persecuted – but we need a global network of ideas, parties, movements and eventually institutions that can regulate financial flows, deal with climate change and reverse global inequalities. Building global relationships, institutions and regulations will be tough, but is feasible in a networked society. In this digital culture things move fast and nowhere is this truer than in politics. Look at the surges of recent years to the Liberal Democrats, the Greens, the SNP, to Brexit and now to Labour. It’s a swarm-like culture, which can look on the surface like the deep solidarities and affinities of the past. Don’t be fooled. The swarm can and will keep shifting. Corbyn is hugely popular, but in the 21st century it’s all about the wave, not the surfer. The rally audience is the main event, not the speaker. Nietzsche remarked that “the error of most people is that they make one brave move and then don’t make another”. If the Corbyn revolution is not to be the supernova of an old politics, but a bright new lodestar for a new one, then the revolution must be continued. • Neal Lawson is chair of the pressure group Compass and spokesperson for the Progressive Alliance, and author of All Consuming"
"Politics is the only barrier to modernising Australia’s ageing electricity system, according to a synthesis report by the Climate Council. The council found there was agreement among a series of major independent reports that there were no technological or economic barriers to a clean, secure, affordable and reliable grid.  The Climate Council report coincides with international law firm Pinsent Masons’ release of research findings that 90% of energy utility companies around the world are actively seeking acquisitions or joint ventures with companies that implement smart energy technologies like batteries, vehicle-to-grid technology and smart meters, but policy uncertainty is limiting investment in Australia. Within a decade, more than one-third of Australia’s coal plants in the national electricity market will be more than 50 years old – after which the vast majority of coal plants fail to operate. Reports by the independent operator of the grid, Aemo, CSIRO and the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, found there were no technical barriers to modernising the grid, the Climate Council report found. “Combining low-cost wind and solar PV [photovoltaic] with other renewable energy technologies, such as solar thermal, hydro and biomass plants, can provide round-the-clock or on-demand power, as well as meeting technical requirements for grid stability,” said the report, authored by Andrew Stock, a Climate Council councillor who previously spent four decades in the energy industry. The report said combining those technologies with grid-scale batteries, pumped hydro and heat storage would would increase the reliability of the system, as well as add competition to the market. There was also a large degree of consensus among the surveyed reports that modernising the system in that way would increase reliability in the face of climate change and increased extreme weather. Relying on a large number of smaller distributed renewable generators, rather than a small number of massive fossil-fuel generators, meant single outages in the system caused by wild weather would be less disruptive. “Generating and storing power closer to where it is needed – for example, using solar and storage technologies – can reduce risks of grid failure for critical infrastructure,” the Climate Council report said. The surveyed reports also found renewable energy would push down energy prices for consumers. One CSIRO report this year concluded a zero-emissions grid by 2050 would save the average household $414 a year compared with a business-as-usual approach. “There’s no disputing it – fossil-fuel technology is obsolete, expensive and unreliable,” Stock said. “It’s time to look to the future with an energy system fit for the 21st century.”  The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and the minister for the environment and energy, Josh Frydenberg, have been unable to get a climate and energy policy through the party room, leaving the industry in limbo. This means businesses have been discouraged from investing in new electricity generation because the federal government can give them no confidence about future policy that would affect their investments. The Climate Council chief executive, Amanda McKenzie, said the lack of a bipartisan policy was the only barrier remaining.  “The nation’s leading energy experts, scientists and major authorities are all in agreement – Australia is ready to switch to a modern grid, powered by renewables and storage,” she said. “However, the only thing stopping this is political will.” The vast majority of large energy companies globally also appear keen to invest millions in smart-grid technologies that would enable the transition. Pinsent Masons surveyed 250 senior-level executives from 200 energy generation and distribution companies (and investors in those markets) with revenues over US$1bn across Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the Asia Pacific. The firm found 90% of the utility companies in the survey were planning a joint venture with, or an acquisition of, a smart-grid technology company. Australia was among the top five countries that the surveyed businesses were targeting for investment, but was being limited by lack of policy clarity. Uncertainty and lack of legislation were highlighted as the biggest investment blockers for 13% of utilities in the survey.  Nordic countries took the top place for attractiveness for investment, partly because energy policies there were clear. “The Nordics are not only ahead in the technology bit, but their policies are also the best,” said one investor quoted in the report. “They have gradually changed their energy consumption and have successfully achieved their transformation targets, which are just increasing year-on-year as their policies are in favour of consumers. Businesses are benefiting either way with growth and rising interests of new consumers.” A chief financial officer of an Australian utility was quoted as saying: “Countries without a cohesive energy policy are usually in turmoil when it comes to issues around energy distribution and management. For an investor looking to enter that market with smart energy solutions, it means a lot of uncertainty.”"
"Just for a moment, we are going to wind the clock back to 2009. Confronted by repeated requests from Kevin Rudd’s office to go hard against the then opposition leader Malcolm Turnbull over climate change, the then junior climate change minister Greg Combet asked a sensible question. Combet recalls in his memoir, The Fights of My Life, that he asked Rudd and the office why Labor would “shit on someone you are trying to do a deal with?”  Well versed in the art of the deal as a union official, Combet thought Labor needed to ease off on Turnbull until it had successfully legislated the carbon pollution reduction scheme. He feared that Rudd himself, and Rudd’s backroom “were confusing politics and policy outcomes, with the risk that Turnbull would be deposed and we would lose a chance to tackle climate change”. Combet was spot on.  Turnbull was deposed, and the government lost that critical opportunity. Combet tried to make good later on, with the second phase of Labor’s climate policy, but that was lost too, because of brutal political short-term-ism from Tony Abbott and his appalling “axe the tax” (that wasn’t a tax) offensive. Combet’s observations are worth lifting from the vault, because right now, a bunch of parliamentarians who know the country desperately needs an outcome on climate change and energy are preoccupied with, as Combet so colourfully puts it, shitting on each other, for different imperatives. Before we wade boldly into the muck, let’s first establish what happened this week. Turnbull got an energy and emissions reduction regulatory concept through the Coalition party room – and no one got assassinated. Abbott was apparently lulled by the victory he thought he’d chalked up with killing Alan Finkel’s clean energy target, and in the ensuing lull, the cabinet, and the bulk of the party room came over the top and signed off on a proposal that looks a lot like a regulated carbon price. By acclamation. That’s really quite something in Coalition terms. Turnbull emerged with a concept called the national energy guarantee. Calling it a policy is a massive stretch. It’s a prototype. The organising idea is energy retailers would face a reliability obligation, and an emissions reduction obligation. The concept is not stupid. I’m not as effusive as Bloomberg New Energy Finance, which says the national energy guarantee could well prove “ingenious”, but I’d agree the approach of imposing reliability and emissions reduction obligations on electricity retailers is “elegant”. There may still be plenty of devil in the detail, but the main flaw, glaringly obvious up front, is a lowball emissions reduction trajectory, which, on the face of it, won’t see Australia meet its Paris commitments, and certainly not at least cost. So the bottom line is Turnbull produced something this week that isn’t perfect, but can be worked with. But before we start pinning medals on anyone’s chests, and sending off herograms, we need to contemplate the muck. The developments of this week are only the start of a multi-stage process to deliver a practical policy outcome – a process involving several stakeholders. If this idea is ever going to see the light of day, Turnbull must first persuade the states, which have to implement it. Right now, several state leaders are furious about being dealt out of Canberra’s deliberations. If this seems a bit precious on the part of the premiers, bear in mind the states have just worked through the Finkel review; months of process and deliberation, and they thought they were getting an entirely different policy framework, not the one that just dropped out of the sky. Jay Weatherill in South Australia also went through a previous iteration when he tried to lead a (largely) cooperative conversation about an emissions trading scheme for electricity. The federal energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, looked interested in that idea for 24 hours before he dropped that one too. Further back, Weatherill had tried, with Mike Baird, to help Turnbull open up a debate on the GST early in his prime ministership, a bit of cooperative federalism that caused some tensions in the Labor fraternity. But Turnbull backed off that one as well. That potted history might help explain the explosion from Adelaide this week. While the premiers might calm down, we also need to be aware the new federal policy hasn’t landed in a vacuum. Queensland is about to go into an election. Weatherill in South Australia is shaping up for a brutal three-cornered contest early next year. Tasmania and Victoria follow in 2018. Having tried to be constructive through the Finkel process, then been provoked by Turnbull’s “ambush” (as Weatherill puts it), some premiers might now cut their losses, seeing benefit in having a cage fight with Canberra over the future of renewable energy. The states aren’t Turnbull’s only problem. While the prime minister has pushed his concept successfully through the party room, that milestone doesn’t end the internal conversation. I predict that some right wingers in the Coalition will continue to quibble and fight every step of this journey. Even if elements of the right and the restless suddenly find some generosity of spirit, there is a reasonably widespread view around the Coalition that climate and energy needs to be a point of significant political differentiation between the government and the opposition. There is a view Turnbull needs to muscle up to his political opponents, and seek out conflict. There’s just one small problem. These opponents are the same people the prime minister will need to turn his energy concept into law. The energy sector and big business groups have made it clear that the only settlement that will work is a bipartisan one – that major party agreement is the only way to give people confidence to make the investments they will need to make. So Turnbull is being yanked in several different directions. The cross-currents explain the mixed messages. We see a prime minister who says he wants to settle the decade-long climate wars, and a prime minister who says he has a “game changing” policy to allow him to achieve that. But the same prime minister also makes a point of excoriating the people he needs to deliver the outcome. People who need a deal generally don’t seek to execute one by calling their joint venture partners idiots and ideologues, but that’s what Turnbull does on a regular basis. As Combet pointed out in 2009, that sort of too-clever-by-half politicking can get you into trouble. It can sink the boat you really want to sail. Labor too has got to make some grown-up decisions. While some in the party are attracted to Turnbull’s concept provided there is scope to scale up the ambition on emissions reduction, the opposition in Canberra feels no great pressure to rush to a decision on a policy that is only a prototype, and which can be made or broken by the states. There is a view Turnbull needs to carry his own water with the premiers. While leaving its collective options open, Labor has been quick this week to poke the hornet’s nest of the Coalition’s internals by pointing out that the national energy guarantee looks a lot like a price on carbon. Partly, this goading is about Labor giving itself cover in the event it decides to support the policy. It’s a bit of virtue signalling to progressive voters that the concepts of the Neg are actually respectable, even though it looks like a sop to coal. But it’s also about needling. Turnbull is vulnerable if the party room senses a swifty has been pulled, and Labor knows it. So, some trolling. While it’s always naive to declare there should be no politics in politics, this issue has some special characteristics. Because the last decade has been such a monumental botch-up, we are running out of workable policy options. We are also running out of time to execute an orderly transition that reduces emissions and keeps the lights on. That’s the sum of the past stupidity. So politicians need to be a bit careful before relegating an idea that could be made to work. Last weekend, I asked whether Turnbull was a political leader who could deliver what Australia needed on climate and energy. This week, the prime minister assumed the posture of statesman, flanked by a trailing Jedi council of energy regulators – but styling, and an eight-page letter from the Energy Security Board, isn’t an outcome. So my question about Turnbull persists, unresolved, and this weekend, I can add another one.  Can all the key players in our political system be grown-ups, rise above frustrations, past botch-ups and petty intrigues, and come together to consider an issue on its merits, and ultimately act in the national interest?"
"Australian temperature records tumbled again in September this year, with the country experiencing the hottest day since records began, and New South Wales breaking that record twice within a few days. As always, particular weather events caused the records to be broken. But in a special climate statement, the Bureau of Meteorology said climate change also played a role, and earlier research has shown global warming has massively increased the chance of these records being broken.  On 22 September 2017 Australia experienced its hottest September day since records began more than a century ago, reaching an average maximum temperature across the continent of 33.47C – breaking the previous record set 19 years ago.  NSW reached a record September temperature of 35.81C on 23 September – almost 15C above the average September temperature and more than 1.6C above the record set in 2003. But in some locations, records tumbled multiple times in September. NSW recorded a September temperature above 40C for the first time in Wilcannia, setting a record measurement of 40.5C on 23 September. That record lasted just four days, with Wanaaring breaking it on 27 September, reaching 41.4C. Queensland also experienced its hottest day over the whole state on 27 September, reaching 42.5C in Birdsville, and Victoria recorded a new September temperature record, measuring 37.7C for the first time at Mildura. The average temperature for the month was not a record temperature, with that record being set by a highly unusual spring in 2013. Research conducted in 2014 by Sophie Lewis from the Australian National University found if greenhouse gases in the atmosphere were at pre-industrial levels, Australia would break that September record just once every 704 years. But current levels of greenhouse gases make that 16 times more likely. Lewis said that estimate was now considered conservative, with actual extreme weather being seen as almost impossible without the influence of greenhouse gases.  The Bureau of Meteorology said: “While all exceptional climate events have proximate causes in antecedent and concurrent weather conditions, long-term trends now also play a role.  “Studies undertaken by the bureau and other scientific institutions have shown that climate change has contributed to the severity and frequency of recent heat events, including spring warmth.”"
"After the election of Donald Trump, many of us in the climate and energy fields were rightfully fearful. What would happen to international agreements to cut greenhouse gases? What would happen to funding for climate research? What would happen to the green energy revolution? In most instances, Trump is worse than we could have imagined. But in one special area, Trump may not matter. That is in the growth of corporate purchasing of renewable energy. It turns out there are factors that even Trump cannot stop that make choosing renewable energy an easy decision for many companies.  New evidence about the unstoppable renewable energy wave recently came out in a report that was released by Apex Clean Energy and the GreenBiz Group. These groups surveyed corporations to determine their future plans on renewable energy installation and adoption. They wanted to know whether these plans had changed in the past few years and what motivated their decisions to implement renewable energy strategies. The outcome of this survey is available here for people who want to read the entire document. The groups surveyed 153 major corporations (both public and private), whose combined revenue was in excess of $250 million. Among these companies, 84% are “actively pursuing or considering purchasing renewable energy over the next 5-10 years.” Surprisingly, they found that 43% of the corporations intend to be more aggressive in their pursuit of renewable energy in the next two years. 87% of those actively pursuing renewable energy purchases stated that the election of Trump had no impact on their decision.  In fact, 11% were more inclined to purchase renewable energy. Most surprising to me was that of the 128 companies that are actively pursuing or considering purchase of renewable energy over the next two years, all but 1 responded that they were “positive about either continuing forward or becoming more aggressive in their attempts to pursue renewables.”  A really important part of the survey addressed what motivated the companies as they made decisions to pursue renewables. Also, the report identified the factors that make companies successful in their pursuit. In terms of motivation to actually purchase renewables, 65% of the corporations report that energy price was the leading criteria. So sure, companies want to do the right thing, they want to create a healthier planet to hand off to future generations; they want to improve their public image. But, the decision to implement clean energy has to be made when the economics are right. It turns out, these companies want a diversified energy portfolio (energy sources and geography). Bringing clean energy, especially wind and solar into their energy supply can be a hedge against rising and variable costs of fossil fuels. The majority of these companies (57%) have renewable energy targets, and having such targets and champions within the corporation makes it much easier to follow through on renewable energy purchases. The main motivations for creating these targets in the first place were to address climate and emission goals and to demonstrate corporate leadership in their industry.  What this tells me is that while a majority of companies have aspirations to engage with clean energy, and while those aspirations are driven by corporate responsibility, it is the economics that convert aspirations to actions.  The survey then reported on the types of renewable energy purchases. The most common was owned renewable energy on site. But the second most common was purchased renewable energy credits, followed by power purchase agreements, leased renewable energy infrastructure, green tariffs, and community solar. Steve Vavrik, Apex’s Chief Commercial Officer told me: Companies that are seeking to buy renewables aren’t just looking for the easiest way to cut costs. They are making a strategic investment to diversify their energy portfolio and secure long-term sustainability. For me, this is all a much-needed positive sign that all the work done over the past few decades to improve the quality and reliability of clean energy and to develop various options for individuals and corporations to purchase clean energy is paying dividends. I’ve always thought that when the economics point toward the use of clean energy, we will see an unstoppable trend. We may be seeing that now."
"Warming soils are releasing more carbon into the atmosphere than previously thought, suggesting a potentially disastrous feedback mechanism whereby increases in global temperatures will trigger massive new carbon releases in a cycle that may be impossible to break. The increased production of carbon comes from the microbes within soils, according to a report in the peer-review journal Science, published on Friday.   The 26-year study is one of the biggest of its kind, and is a groundbreaking addition to our scant knowledge of exactly how warming will affect natural systems. Potential feedback loops, or tipping points, have long been suspected to exist by scientists, and there is some evidence for them in the geological record. What appears to happen is that once warming reaches a certain point, these natural biological factors kick in and can lead to a runaway, and potentially unstoppable, increase in warming.  Other tipping points posited by scientists include the disappearance of ice in the Arctic, which creates areas of dark water that absorb more heat, and the release of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, from thawing permafrost. In the Science study, researchers examined plots of soil in the Harvard Forest in Massachusetts, a mixed hardwood forest in the US. They experimented by heating some of the plots with underground cables to 5C above normal levels, leaving others as a control.  The long-term study revealed that in the first 10 years there was a strong increase in the carbon released from the heated plots, then a period of about seven years when the carbon release abated. But after this second calmer period, which the scientists attribute to the adjustment of the soil microbes to the warmer conditions, the release of carbon resumed its upward path. In the last three years, the release of carbon has once again dropped back, which scientists attribute to another reorganisation of the microbes present. They suggest an increase in the number of microbes that can feast on the hard-to-digest organic matter, such as plant-based lignin, which gives clues to the possible cyclical nature of the process. From 1991, when the experiment began, the plots subjected to 5C warming lost about 17% of the carbon that had been stored in the top 60cm of the soil, where the greatest concentration of organic matter is to be found. Scientific understanding of the complexities of soil microbial activity is still limited, but the long-term nature of the study provides valuable insights into what might be happening, and is likely to happen in future, to vast swaths of forest soils across the world. While deforestation has been the focus of most research into forests’ effects on climate change, with a recent study suggesting tropical forests are turning into carbon sources rather than carbon stores as a result, the impact of warming soils has remained much of a mystery. Soils are one of the world’s biggest natural carbon sinks, along with trees and the oceans. Daniel Metcalfe, of Sweden’s Lund University, said: “If these findings hold more widely across major terrestrial ecosystems, then a much greater portion of the global soil carbon store could be vulnerable to decomposition and release of carbon dioxide under global warming than previously thought.” The study was carried out by scientists at the US Marine Biological Laboratory, led by Jerry Melillo, with contributions from the universities of Massachusetts and New Hampshire.  Melillo, who holds the position of distinguished scientist at the MBL, said: “Each year, mostly from fossil fuel burning, we are releasing about 10bn metric tons of carbon into the atmosphere. The world’s soils contain about 3,500bn tons of carbon. If a significant amount of that is added to the atmosphere, due to microbial activity, that will accelerate the global warming process. Once this self-reinforcing feedback begins, there is no easy way to turn it off. There is no switch to flip.” He added: “The future is warmer. How much warmer is the issue.” While emissions from fossil fuels can be cut back, the reactions of the natural world to a warming climate may be impossible to control. Some recent work has suggested that the warming of the globe may be progressing at a slightly slower rate than the upper range of previous studies estimated. However, feedback loops and tipping points have the potential to create sudden disruptions that are hard to take account of in standard climate modelling, and these could mean much greater changes and far higher rates of warming in the future. Separately, research from Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment, and other institutions, published in the Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution and Systematics, and Global Change Biology, called for more work on how soil could be used as a carbon store. When agricultural soils are well-managed, they can store more carbon than they emit, which would allow them to be used as potential carbon sinks.  But the scientists warn that “we still don’t have a strong understanding of the interactions among biological, chemical and physical processes regulating carbon in soils”. They say much more research is needed, particularly as there are dangers in soils in Siberia that are rapidly warning, and could release vast quantities of carbon. They also warn that there may be 25-30% less organic matter in some soils than previously estimated.  “Soil has changed under our feet,” said Jennifer Harden, a visiting scholar at Stanford. “We can’t use the soil maps made 80 years ago and expect to find the same answers.”"
"Petrol and diesels vehicles will be banned from Oxford city centre under plans to bring in what officials believe would be the world’s first zero-emissions zone. The proposals aim to slash air pollution in the historic university city, which has seen levels of the harmful pollutant nitrogen dioxide rise above legal limits in some areas.  Under the plans being put out for consultation on Monday, the ban would be introduced in phases, starting with preventing non-zero-emitting taxis, cars, light commercial vehicles and buses from using a small number of streets in 2020. As vehicle technology develops, the zero-emissions zone will extend to cover all non-electric vehicles, including HGVs, in the whole of the city centre by 2035, according to the joint proposals by Oxford city council and Oxfordshire county council. The introduction of the zero-emissions zone could see levels of nitrogen dioxide, much of which comes from traffic fumes, particularly diesel engines, fall by up to three-quarters by 2035, the councils said. Data released by the World Health Organisation last year showed that Oxford was one of 11 British cities to breach the safe limits set for toxic particles known as PM10s. It also breached the limit for PM2.5s. The city has already won £500,000 of government funding to install charging points for electric taxis, and £800,000 to install 100 electric vehicle charging points for residents, but officials say more will be needed to support the zero-emissions zone. Other schemes being considered to support the zone include reduced parking fees for electric vehicles, electric taxi-only ranks, and electric delivery vehicle-only loading areas. Councillor John Tanner of Oxford city council said: “Toxic and illegal air pollution in the city centre is damaging the health of Oxford’s residents. A step change is urgently needed; the zero emissions zone is that step change. “All of us who drive or use petrol or diesel vehicles through Oxford are contributing to the city’s toxic air. Everyone needs to do their bit, from national government and local authorities, to businesses and residents, to end this public health emergency.” Oxfordshire county council councillor Yvonne Constance said: “We want to hear from everyone who uses the city centre, including businesses, bus and taxi firms and local residents ... Pragmatism will be an important part of anything we plan, but we have set the ambition.” The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, called last month for the environment department to amend the Clean Air Act to allow for the creation of zero-emission zones. Other cities that have tried to introduce measures to tackle vehicle emissions include Madrid, whose city council ordered half of the city’s cars to be banned in 2016, and Oslo, where the authorities eventually backtracked on a plan to ban all private cars in the Norwegian capital."
"India is rice country: the cereal provides daily sustenance for more than 60% of the population. Half a century ago, it was home to more than 100,000 rice varieties, encompassing a stunning diversity in taste, nutrition, pest-resistance and, crucially in this age of climate change and natural disasters, adaptability to a range of conditions. Today, much of this biodiversity is irretrievably lost, forced out by the quest for high-yield hybrids and varieties encouraged by government agencies. Such “superior” varieties now cover more than 80% of India’s rice acreage.  The Koraput region in the state of Odisha in India’s east was historically among the world’s leading areas of rice diversification. In the 1950s, an official survey found farmers here growing more than 1,700 different rice varieties. Now, more than 1,400 farmers in the region are at the heart of a movement to safeguard what remains of this genetic wealth.  The effort is anchored by a small conservation team led by ecologist Dr Debal Deb. Almost 200 of the 1,200 varieties in Deb’s collection have been sourced from Koraput’s farmers, indicating that villagers have not abandoned their native seeds for modern varieties. Anxious that his collection not end up as the last repository of endangered local varieties, Deb asked some farmers to grow them and circulate their seeds to help safeguard them from extinction.   Several farmers outlined economic reasons for not abandoning indigenous heirloom varieties, which they refer to as “desi dhaan”, as opposed to modern hybrids, “sarkari dhaan”, quite literally, “government rice”. “With hybrids, we have to keep spending money on buying them,” one farmer said. “With desi, we store our seeds carefully and use them the following season.” Other farmers wanted to get off the pesticide treadmill to reduce costs and stem the visible ill-effects of chemicals on soil quality and biodiversity. “Hybrids demand ever-increasing pesticide applications and our costs go up in an unsustainable way,” said farmer Duryodhan Gheuria. Gheuria cultivated four desi varieties – Kolamali, Sonaseri, Tikkichuri, Kosikamon – “just like generations of my family”. After encountering Deb’s team, Gheuria began growing three more endangered heirlooms: Samudrabaali, Raji and Governmentchuri. Heirloom varieties, adapted over centuries to local ecologies, also proved hardier in the face of problems such as pests and drought, the farmers said. In contrast, modern varieties bred in faraway labs were designed for the neat routines of intensive agriculture. They were tailored for mechanised farming, intended to absorb large doses of chemical fertilisers and predictable supplies of water. But farmers reported that such varieties were unsuited for the variable conditions they cultivated in, from undulating land to increasingly unpredictable weather. The nephew and uncle farming team Laxminath and Sadan Gouda said that on flood-prone land along a riverbank like theirs, modern varieties fared poorly. “They barely grow, pests attack them … we face a world of trouble. But desi dhaan grow well, which is why we will never abandon them.”  Many farmers reported that some heirloom varieties were able to withstand cyclones better than the modern ones, while others could cope better in conditions of drought or low rainfall. Farmers had other reasons to prefer desi varieties. Their taller paddy stalks yielded valuable byproducts: fodder for cattle, mulch for the soil, and hay for thatching the roofs of their homes, unlike the short-statured modern varieties. And then there is the universal motivation of taste. Scented varieties like Kolaajeera and Kolakrushna has a sweet aroma, making cooking and eatingthe rice a pleasurable experience.  “With sarkaari rice, even if you have three vegetables accompanying it, it does not taste that good,” laughed farmer Gomati Raut. “Our desi rice, you can eat it by itself.”  Deb has said that having a huge number of rice varieties is not an end in itself. “Rice conservation is a handle to ask ourselves, how do we build sustainability in our societies?” he said. It is a question India must increasingly confront, with increasingly depleted water tables, infertile soils, greenhouse emissions and debt that pushes farmers to suicide. Meanwhile, hundreds of farmers in Koraput embody an alternative model of agricultural development. Drawing on centuries of knowledge and skills, these farmers sustain 200 rice varieties. In the process, they are reducing their dependence on external agencies, from the seed company and the pesticide seller to the government subsidy and bank loan. By reviving seeds, they are also reviving food, taste, ritual, nutrition, and sustainability – attributes often forgotten as a result of the obsession with yield. Attributes that make rice more than just a bundle of calories and starch."
"Governments of 11 European nations are providing subsidies totalling more than £80bn a year to fossil fuel industries, green campaigners have claimed. Transport fuels account for the lion’s share of the support to fossil fuels. Many of the 11 countries surveyed encourage drivers to use diesel as it produces less carbon per mile than petrol, despite the fuel’s effects on air pollution which is particularly harmful to children. For many years, governments had incentives to prioritise the use of diesel, as it helped them meet internationally-set carbon reduction targets.  A substantial amount of the claimed subsidies are for fuels such as gas, which is viewed by many as a transition away from more carbon-intensive fuels such as coal. Taxpayer support for electric vehicles, renewable electricity and other low-carbon efforts were not counted in the study by the Overseas Development Institute (ODI). In the UK, diesel fuel is taxed by volume at the same rate as petrol. This taxation can favour the dirtier fuel because diesel cars travel further than petrol vehicles on the same volume of fuel. Half of the support provided to fossil fuels was targeted at low-income households, the report acknowledged. Such measures by governments are intended to protect people on low incomes from fuel poverty. Nearly €5bn of the overall support was provided in this way by the UK government alone. Shelagh Whitley, head of climate and energy at the ODI, said: “The air pollution crisis in cities across Europe and the recent diesel emissions testing scandal have rightly led to increased pressure for governments to act [on air quality]. Yet our analysis shows European countries are providing enormous fossil fuel subsidies to the transport sector.” “This study shows how governments in Europe and the EU continue to subsidies and finance a reliance on oil, gas and coal, fuelling dangerous climate change and air pollution with taxpayers’ money.” The EU has provided only about £3bn a year in assistance to fossil fuels through its own budget. Most of that goes towards building infrastructure for gas, which produces far less carbon dioxide than coal, on which much of eastern Europe has been heavily reliant for more than a century. Wendel Trio, the director of Climate Action Network, said: “The €4bn spent by the EU on fossil fuels, most of which goes to gas infrastructure, locks Europe into fossil fuel dependency for the decades to come. This violates the Paris agreement’s requirement to make finances work for the climate. In addition, over £1.6bn a year is provided by EU member states to support coal-fired power, the dirtiest of all fossil fuels. It is unacceptable.” Much of the support for coal goes to communities dependent on mining and coal-fired power, which can be difficult to replace economically. The green campaigners recommended that the EU should phase out fossil fuel subsidies by 2020, as well as increasing the transparency of such government support. They asked that mechanisms to support a transition away from fossil fuels should not support fossil fuel production and consumption, and that the subsidies should be used to support workers and their communities to move away from dependency on fossil fuels. The countries included in the survey were the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden and the UK."
"Statements by Tony Abbott suggesting that climate change is “probably doing good” are different to his opinion while he was prime minister and it is up to him to explain why he has changed his view, Julie Bishop has said. Speaking from South Korea on the ABC’s 7:30 on Thursday, the foreign affairs minister rebuked Abbott by recounting his record of signing the Paris climate agreement and setting the renewable energy target.  Bishop’s comments follow a similar intervention from energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, stating that climate change is real and recalling that Abbott signed the Paris agreement. On Monday evening Abbott told a climate sceptic thinktank in London that policies to combat climate change were like “primitive people ... killing goats to appease the volcano gods”. He also reprised his 2009 assertion that the “so-called settled science of climate change” was “absolute crap”. Asked about Abbott’s comments, Bishop said he was “entitled to express his views, as any other member of parliament ... is entitled to do”. But she added: “The views he expressed recently are different to those he expressed as prime minister when he supported the Paris agreement, and in fact set a nationally determined targets and the renewable energy target was established under then Prime Minister Abbott,” she said. “So, it’s up to him to explain the differences between his opinion then and his opinion now.” Bishop said the Turnbull government was determined to deliver “affordable, reliable energy ... that will still meet our international obligations, which were, in fact, established under then Prime Minister Abbott”. Asked why Abbott was not expelled for “constant breaches of discipline”, Bishop noted that he was discussing an issue that was “controversial” in some sectors of the community. Bishop suggested the reason there was “a deal of interest in what he has to say” is that he had changed his mind from his view as prime minister. “I think the question that has to be asked of Tony Abbott is why does he have a different view now than when he was prime minister?” With the government backing off the clean energy target recommended by the chief scientist, it is unclear what mixture of climate policies it will propose to meet international obligations. Bishop said the Turnbull government’s energy policy “will be discussed by cabinet and by the party room and then of course announced to the Australian public”. The government could unveil its energy policy as soon as next week, when parliament resumes for the final spring session. The expected overhaul of the market rules in the government’s looming energy policy overhaul is expected to be accompanied by mechanisms to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including the use of international permits, which the government first signalled when it launched a review of its Direct Action policy. The energy sector also expects the existing Emissions Reduction Fund, which is the Coalition’s voluntary scheme that gives incentives for farmers and landholders to reduce emissions, will also have its funding topped up between now and the next election. Abbott’s speech was labelled “loopy” by Labor’s deputy leader, Tanya Plibersek, but defended in part by Liberal MP Craig Kelly, the chairman of the backbench committee on climate and energy."
"Summer’s washout failed to dampen the prospects for the red admiral, one of the UK’s most popular butterflies, whose numbers rose by 75% compared with last year, according to the annual Big Butterfly Count. Other butterfly species were less fortunate, however, with declines seen across the three common species of white butterflies. The green-veined white and both the large white and small white were down more than a third on last year, reflecting difficult weather conditions.  The red admiral is one of the best recognised butterflies in Britain thanks to its distinctive black, orange and white markings. More than 73,000 were counted in this year’s census carried out by the Butterfly Conservation charity between 14 July and 6 August. The large showing came on the back of a bumper year last year, and a mild winter and spring that helped some of the species stay in the UK – a new development in recent years, possibly assisted by a warming climate, for what used to be a summer visitor from southern Europe. The red admiral was not the most numerous butterfly in the count. The gatekeeper, also known as the hedge brown, with orange and brown wings and prominent black spots, was seen more than 93,000 times, up nearly a quarter on last year. This year’s wet summer, the 11th wettest on record (though temperatures were above average), spelled poor conditions for butterflies, which thrive in warmer and sunnier summers. Last year was also a bad year for butterflies and moths, so improvements this year are relative in many cases. It was a bumper year for the count itself as a record 60,000 people took part in the three-week census which is the world’s biggest survey of butterfly numbers. More than 550,000 butterflies were recorded, but the record number of surveyors hides a more concerning picture: each participant saw on average only about 11 butterflies, the lowest number per person since the count began in 2010. Richard Fox, head of recording at Butterfly Conservation, said: “It hasn’t been a vintage summer for butterflies, but there have been some real positives. The highlight has been the huge number of people that have got involved, spent time enjoying and counting our native butterflies and moths, and done something useful and important in the face of so much wildlife decline.” The other most numerous butterflies spotted by volunteers were the meadow brown, whose numbers were third highest, the peacock with nearly 30,000 examples, the common blue with nearly 20,000, and the speckled wood butterfly at more than 18,500. Despite the good news for the red admiral, butterflies in the UK are under threat, both from a changing climate, with the last 10 years showing a pattern of damper summers, and from human factors. Butterflies are losing their habitat as a result of intensive farming, pesticides, urbanisation and populations becoming cut off, and the added pressure of weather changes is having an impact on their breeding and food sources. Butterflies and moths are also valuable to farmers and gardeners as pollinators, though on a smaller scale than bees."
"Millions of draughty homes in England and Wales will be insulated and overhauled by 2035 to save families as much as £300 a year on their energy bills, under the government’s climate change plans. The long-delayed blueprint for how the UK will hit its binding target of cutting emissions by 57% by 2032 includes about 50 policies supporting everything from low-carbon power and energy savings to electric vehicles and keeping food waste out of landfill. Big winners in the 164-page Clean Growth Strategy include offshore windfarm developers, which will be guaranteed a further £550m of subsidies. Experts believe that could more than double the UK’s existing offshore wind capacity.  Energy efficiency for businesses and householders is at the heart of the plan, which the government was required to publish under the Climate Change Act. There is an aspiration that all houses will be brought up to the minimum of energy band C by 2035, but how that will be achieved is not spelled out. Existing schemes to improve insulation will be extended until 2028. New nuclear power stations are encouraged, but they will only go ahead if developers can do so at competitive prices. Solar power was given tentative support, while onshore windfarms won partial backing. The business secretary, Greg Clark, compared the changes under way in energy today to the big changes wrought by the UK’s first coal power station in 1882. “This government has put clean growth at the heart of its industrial strategy to increase productivity, boost people’s earning power and ensure Britain continues to lead the world in efforts to tackle climate change,” he said, launching the plan at the Olympic Park in east London.  Green campaigners, industry groups and businesses mostly welcomed the plan but said it needed more ambition and lacked detail in some areas. Robert Gross, the director of the Centre for Energy Policy and Technology at Imperial College London, said the politics of the strategy were key, and showed the greener wings of the Tory party had won out. “In 2015 the government started hacking and slashing at all manner of green policies. This has stopped, and that’s very welcome,” he said. Richard Black, the director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit thinktank, echoed that view. He said the strategy showed a “sea change” in “top-line thinking about the low carbon economy”, with Theresa May’s government seeing it as an opportunity rather than a cost as it was viewed under David Cameron. Claire Perry, the climate minister, said May’s foreword to the plan was important and showed how seriously the government was taking it. Asked if the strategy showed green-minded Tories were winning out after a slew of climate programmes were axed by the Conservatives in 2015, she said: “This isn’t about factions winning, it’s about getting on with capturing the opportunity [for business].” She told the Guardian: “This is doubling down on the green ambition, actually saying we see the economic benefit from doing this.” The minister said there would be a new “triple test” for whether the government backed clean technologies. They would have to maximise the amount emissions come down; show they can become cheaper in the future; and be an area in which the UK could lead the world. She said a proposed £1.3bn tidal lagoon at Swansea – which an independent government review backed in January but on which government has yet to signal its view – would have to pass that test. New policies included a green light for onshore windfarms on remote Scottish islands being allowed to compete for subsidies. The move was welcomed by Orkney and companies including SSE, which plans a windfarm on Shetland, jointly owned with the community. There is also £100m of funding for research on carbon capture and storage (CCS). However, that is a fraction of the £1bn government competition on the technology that was cut two years ago. The plan is also scant on any detail of how the UK will cut emissions from heating, talking instead of simply exploring the best options. Low-carbon alternatives to gas include electrification via heat pumps, or using greener gases such as hydrogen. Many of the ideas in the strategy have already been announced, such as phasing out petrol and diesel cars by 2040 and £246m to develop batteries for cars and energy systems. Despite the wide-ranging policies, the strategy concedes that the UK is still not on track to meet its legally binding carbon targets for the late 2020s and early 2030s. The government noted it had ‘flexibilities’ on meeting the targets under the Climate Change Act, but might not need to use them. The Committee on Climate Change, the UK’s statutory climate advisers, welcomed the strategy but warned ministers against using the law’s flexibilities in meeting its carbon targets. “This should not be the plan,” said Lord Deben, the group’s chairman. The authority will pass its verdict in January after analysing the plan. Campaign group ClientEarth said it was weighing its options, given the legal requirement for government to close the gap. Jonathan Church, a lawyer at the group, said: “The UK government is still in breach of the Climate Change Act. The UK is on course to miss its 2023-27 emissions reductions targets by 116MtCO2e – equivalent to more than the Philippines’ emissions in a whole year – and the clean growth strategy does not fix this.” The Green party said the strategy was a missed opportunity. Caroline Lucas, the party’s co-leader, said: “Government has blown this enormous opportunity to put Britain on track to meet its climate target.” Other observers, including the London School of Economics, said the broad thrust of the strategy was good, but it was too vague. The union Prospect said there were “still too many unanswered questions”."
"Imagine, for a moment, that climate change was not synonymous with doomsday scenarios, but rather presented an opportunity to radically transform society for the better. This is not an attempt to downplay the seriousness of the risks facing our climate. Rather, it is about reframing the choice we face, away from the prospect of bleak minimalism often associated with a low-carbon future. Consider the following realities: the World Health Organisation estimates 7 million deaths are attributed to air pollution every year; and rates of obesity and chronic diseases are rising in nearly all regions of the world. Burning fossil fuels, especially coal, accounted for 78% of the total increase in carbon dioxide between 1970 and 2010, with deforestation comprising the balance of emissions. Burning coal also releases pollutants such as fine particulates, eg PM2.5, which are deadly to human health.  So, the irony is that strategies focused on greenhouse gas mitigation could, more immediately, save an estimated 1 to 4 million lives annually by mid-century from improved air quality. And health benefits could far outweigh the cost of clean energy investments. For example, in the United States, monetised health benefits associated with improved air quality can offset between 26% and 1,050% of the cost of US low-carbon policies. This is not surprising, given the US Environmental Protection Agency estimates a US$30 return for every dollar invested in reducing air pollution through the Clean Air Act. Obesity and chronic diseases, such as diabetes and heart disease, are rapidly rising throughout the world, as western lifestyles with automobile-dependent transportation and meat-based diets are being adopted. Herein lies even more opportunities for public health. Major health co-benefits accrue from increased urban walking and cycling, so-called active travel. Active commuting in Shanghai, China, was associated with a reduction of colon cancer by 48% in men and 44% in women. American cities with the highest versus lowest levels of active transport had obesity and diabetes rates 20% and 23% lower respectively. Bicycling commuters in Copenhagen have a 39% reduction in mortality rate compared with non-cycling commuters. A world focused on ending our addiction to fossil fuels would also experience fewer heat-related deaths – a significant achievement given that experts estimated 70,000 deaths were caused by the European heatwave in 2003, and 15,000 deaths in the Russian heatwave in 2010. Heatwaves have caused more deaths in Australia over the past 100 years than any other natural event. A reliance on a carbon economy and other polluting industries has contributed to many of these problems, directly or indirectly, and they will only get worse as we experience longer-term changes to our climate. The experience of quitting carbon is not unlike that of quitting smoking: it is a necessary change that will make us healthier. Quitting presents challenges, but it would be foolish to only understand the process through that lens. The decision to quit smoking should not be something the individual does alone; it requires all kinds of support, as well as taking on an industry that profits from addiction to killer substances. But in the long run, we will all benefit from this kind of transformation. The same is true for quitting carbon. In this context, the 28% clean energy target by 2030 proposed by Australia’s chief scientist Alan Finkel does not look too radical, but rather not ambitious enough. The Turnbull government needs to stop playing politics with Australians’ health and take the necessary steps to quickly reduce combustion of fossil fuels. The government’s addiction to coal – including the oxymoron of “clean coal” – must be broken.  The cost of solar is now well below the retail power prices in Australian capital cities, after dropping 58% in the past five years. What entirely eludes me is why, in a sun-baked country that has a national health campaign of “Slip, Slap, Slop, Seek, Slide”, the Australian government is not taking full advantage of the overabundance of sunlight to expand its renewal energy portfolio and avoid pollution-related deaths as a bonus. The 21st century holds incredible promise for improving human health while simultaneously dealing with humanity’s most urgent problem: climate change. Subsequent improvements in air quality, along with walkable or bikeable communities to counter trends in obesity and chronic diseases will majorly boost the health of Australians – a result that will be hugely appreciated."
"I am still seeing butterflies almost daily, sunning themselves when they can and feasting on late-flowering ivy. Most are red admirals, a large, dark and powerful presence sailing through autumnal skies or feeding on rotten fruit in orchards. It has been a vintage red admiral year, with numbers up by 75% on 2016 in Butterfly Conservation’s Big Butterfly Count. But sadly it has not been a vintage butterfly summer.  With much of southern Britain enjoying a sunny May and June it once looked as if it might turn out to be the best season for a decade. But a wet July and August put a dampener on most species, which do emerge midsummer.  Heavy summer rains can wipe out whole generations. One butterfly recorder I spoke to reported seeing scores of speckled woods on his transect but, after a heavy rainfall, suddenly there were none. It was not a disaster like 2016, when a glorious late summer arrived too late for the butterflies; nor was it like the sodden summer of 2012. Not bad, is most butterfly lovers’ grudging verdict on 2017, and that may be as good as it gets. Our butterflies are well-adapted to the vicissitudes of the British summer but the long-term decline in two-thirds of our 59 native species shows they are less equipped to deal with rapid climatic changes or the dousing of farmland and gardens with pesticides. Milder winters in particular appear to be disastrous for many butterfly species, though not the red admiral. Half a century ago it appeared unable to survive British winters and most individuals made the reverse migration to the continent. Now it is not only a successful hibernator, but the most commonly spotted butterfly throughout the winter months. Keep a lookout for this Christmas-coloured insect if Christmas Day is sunny.  "
"Growing global momentum to protect the world’s oceans from overfishing could be undermined by Australia, warns renowned conservationist David Suzuki and more than 1,461 other scientists. Australia is currently considering the world’s biggest downgrading of a protected area with a reduction in the size of its network of marine reserves.  “If Australia does something progressive in 2012, and then walks back from that, what the hell are we going to expect [from] international cooperation?” said Suzuki, who described the move as “sickening”. In 2012 the Australian government created  what was then the world’s largest network of marine reserves. The move followed years of consultation, and despite limited protection for the most biodiverse coastal areas, it was welcomed by environmental groups. Since then, global momentum has been building for marine protection. In 2014 at the once-a-decade World Parks Congress in Sydney, conservation scientists called for fishing to be banned in 30% of each type of marine habitat globally – a call supported two years later by about 90 countries and hundreds of NGOs that are members of the International Union for Conservation of Nature.  In 2016, the US president Barack Obama created the world’s largest marine reserve by expanding an existing ocean reserve off Hawaii. That year he also established a large marine park in the Atlantic Ocean. Similarly, Chile, France, Kiribati, New Zealand, Russia and the UK have created large areas where fishing is banned. In contrast, the Australian government recently announced draft plans to reduce by 40% the amount of its marine parks that are “no-take” fishing or construction zones. According to WWF-Australia, that would represent the world’s largest downgrading of protected areas on record. More than 433,000 sq km would be downgraded to allow commercial fishing – more than half of that in the Coral Sea marine park, adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef, one of the few remaining large parts of the Pacific Ocean still in good health. Australian waters contain rich biodiversity ranging from the tropics to Antarctica. A statement signed by Suzuki and 1,461 scientists described these waters as a “global asset” and called on the government to increase protections.  “They support six of the seven known species of marine turtles and more than half of the world’s whale and dolphin species. Australia’s oceans are home to more than 20% of the world’s fish species and are a hot spot of marine endemism. By properly protecting them, Australia will be supporting the maintenance of our global ocean heritage,” the statement said.  “It’s absurd to think this is really Australia’s water,” Suzuki told the Guardian. “These oceans belong to the world – you just happen to be the caretakers in that particular area.” Jessica Meeuwig, director of the Centre for Marine Futures at the University of Western Australia, said Australia’s move set a dangerous international precedent. “Australia’s move to go backwards undermines that progress,” she said. “In Australia we will be supporting an international benchmark that says we’re happy to have paper parks [areas technically set aside but with minimal actual protections].” Paper parks have been a major concern in the conservation world.   Meeuwig said Australia’s precedent is particularly dangerous given the Trump administration is mulling cuts to protected areas on land and in the ocean. “Australia will pip Trump to the post,” she said.  The Trump administration is examining 27 protected areas for the rollback of protections, with a leaked memo revealing 10 – including the two marine parks established by Obama – earmarked to allow “traditional uses” such as mining, logging and hunting. She said Australia’s unwinding of protections would help normalise radical moves to unwind protection in the US, as well as set a poor example for other countries.  “Such a backwards step just gives other countries an excuse to do less. [Australia is] a developed economy with good governance. If we can’t get this right, all we’re doing is putting the responsibility to protect oceans to nations that have less and are dealing with bigger challenges. That’s not leadership.” Suzuki, who owns a house in Queensland’s Port Douglas and has spent a lot of time on the Great Barrier Reef, is angry about Australia’s rollback. “We’re an air-breathing land animal. We’ve trashed the terrestrial environment with vast clearcuts and monocultures of rubber trees and corn and wheat. We’ve used the land and air to spread potent pesticides and toxic compounds. We’ve really fucked up the land that is our ecosystem. And now we go into the oceans that cover 70% of the planet and we’ve trashed that,” he said.  Suzuki said after the devastating bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef in 2016, he visited it and wept. He said Australia needed to face up to the interconnected issues of climate change and ocean health, both of which it was failing to address. “I’m sorry Australia, wake up,” Suzuki said. “The oceans are a mess and a great deal of the mess is a reflection of climate change. Climate change is the overarching issue that is hammering the oceans as well as terrestrial areas. And it is absolutely disgusting that coal is still considered a great economic input to Australia. “When you’ve got something that [other countries] would die for – you’ve got sunlight up the ying yang, why isn’t Australia the world leader in this incredible form of energy? It makes me sick. You’ve got great research facilities. You’ve got great scientists. You’ve got everything going to be a world leader in the energy of the future and you’re not doing it. And it’s not surprising then that you are doing the same to the oceans. What is it going to take for Australia to wake up to the opportunities?”"

"A colony of about 40,000 Adélie penguins in Antarctica has suffered a “catastrophic breeding event” – all but two chicks have died of starvation this year. It is the second time in just four years that such devastation – not previously seen in more than 50 years of observation – has been wrought on the population. The finding has prompted urgent calls for the establishment of a marine protected area in East Antarctica, at next week’s meeting of 24 nations and the European Union at the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) in Hobart.  In the colony of about 18,000 breeding penguin pairs on Petrels Island, French scientists discovered just two surviving chicks at the start of the year. Thousands of starved chicks and unhatched eggs were found across the island in the region called Adélie Land (“Terre Adélie”). The colony had experienced a similar event in 2013, when no chicks survived. In a paper about that event, a group of researchers, led by Yan Ropert-Coudert from France’s National Centre for Scientific Research, said it had been caused by a record amount of summer sea ice and an “unprecedented rainy episode”. The unusual extent of sea ice meant the penguins had to travel an extra 100km to forage for food. And the rainy weather left the chicks, which have poor waterproofing, wet and unable to keep warm. This year’s event has also been attributed to an unusually large amount of sea ice. Overall, Antarctica has had a record low amount of summer sea ice, but the area around the colony has been an exception. Ropert-Coudert said the region had been severely affected by the break-up of the Mertz glacier tongue in 2010, when a piece of ice almost the size of Luxembourg – about 80 km long and 40km wide – broke off. That event, which occurred about 250km from Petrels Island, had a big impact on ocean currents and ice formation in the region. “The Mertz glacier impact on the region sets the scene in 2010 and when unusual meteorological events, driven by large climatic variations, hit in some years this leads to massive failures,” Ropert-Coudert told the Guardian. “In other words, there may still be years when the breeding will be OK, or even good for this colony, but the scene is set for massive impacts to hit on a more or less regular basis.” The link between climate change and the sea-ice extent around Antarctica is not very clear. Sea ice has been increasing in recent years, which could be attributed to a rise in the amount of freshwater in the ocean around the continent caused by climate change. However, over the long term, climate change is expected to cause the sea ice to shrink dramatically. “For the moment, sea ice is increasing and this is a problem for this species as it pushes the feeding place – the sea ice edge – farther away from their nesting place,” Ropert-Coudert said. “If it shrinks it would help but if it shrinks too much then the food chain they rely on may be impacted. Basically, as a creature of the sea ice they need an optimum sea-ice cover to thrive.” Elsewhere, human pressures including climate change have already been having a severe impact on the numbers of Adélie penguins. On the Antarctic Peninsula, which has been badly affected by climate change, populations have been decreasing, and some researchers suggest they may become extinct there. Ropert-Coudert said there were more anthropogenic threats on the horizon – fishing and possibly tourism – that the penguins needed protection from. He has called for a marine protected area (MPA) to be established there. “An MPA will not remedy these changes but it could prevent further impacts that direct anthropogenic pressures, such as tourism and proposed fisheries, could bring,” he said. Next week, 24 countries and the European Union will meet at the CCAMLR in Hobart to discuss the potential creation of more MPAs around Antarctica. At last year’s meeting, after years of failed negotiations, the members agreed to create the world’s largest MPA in the Ross Sea, and many expect the group to agree on East Antarctica next.  This has also been proposed by Australia and has been on the table at the CCAMLR for eight years. The head of polar programs at WWF, Rod Downie, said: “Adélie penguins are one of the hardiest and most amazing animals on our planet. This devastating event contrasts with the image that many people might have of penguins. It’s more like ‘Tarantino does Happy Feet’, with dead penguin chicks strewn across a beach in Adélie Land. “The risk of opening up this area to exploratory krill fisheries, which would compete with the Adélie penguins for food as they recover from two catastrophic breeding failures in four years, is unthinkable. So CCAMLR needs to act now by adopting a new Marine Protected Area for the waters off East Antarctica, to protect the home of the penguins.” Ropert-Coudert and his colleagues are in the process of completing a scientific paper on the breeding failure and plan to submit it to a journal in the coming weeks."
"The grownups have finally won and everyone in the UK, from those in cold homes to those on polluted streets and in flooded towns, will benefit. The most important aspect of the UK government’s new clean growth strategy is its unequivocal statement that tackling climate change and a prosperous economy are one and the same thing. This has been clear to many for some time, including Philip Hammond, if not his predecessor George Osborne. There is no long-term, high-carbon economic strategy because the impacts of unchecked climate change destroy economies, as Lord Nicholas Stern puts it.  But the Conservative party has long been swinging between the green dream and fossil-fuelled fantasies. David Cameron went from pledging the “greenest government ever” to dismissing the “green crap” in three years. Recent years have seen one green policy shredded after another, destroying confidence among the businesses we need to deliver a low-carbon economy. The new strategy published on Thursday signals a new, if belated, beginning. It is the beginning of the end of the fossil fuel age: it is highly notable that the government plan omits any mention of fracking, having previously been its cheerleader. The government had to produce this plan under its own climate laws to explain how it will get on track to meet the nation’s legally binding carbon targets in 2030 and beyond. But ministers have rightly made a virtue of the plan’s necessity. The proposals themselves are ambitious but lack concrete suggestions in many areas. However, ambition always precedes action and there are plenty of groups, not least the government’s official advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, who will hold ministers to account. If the government’s efforts to cut emissions from buildings have been slow, it is now taking seriously the need to address energy efficiency. Energy that isn’t used – negawatts – are by far the cheapest way to cut both emissions and energy bills. But as the vast failure of the green deal showed, efficiency is hard to make happen and it is here where firm plans are most urgently needed. Along with heating, transport also needs urgent action – emissions here have been rising. There is plenty in the new plan to harness the surging market for electric vehicles, though little of it is new. Ministers have also once again failed to explain how expanding aviation with Heathrow’s third runway fits with its climate change plan. Electric cars will need clean power and the UK’s electricity grid is already greening fast – coal power has fallen from 40% to 2% in the last five years. The new plan rightly builds on the UK’s success in dramatically driving down the cost of offshore wind power, yet it all but ignores an even cheaper source – onshore wind. It seems that even the conviction that the green economy is the UK’s future is not enough to face down the rural Tory-voting minority who continue to tilt at windmills. Solar power also seems destined to suffer the same fate. Despite looking these gift horses in the mouth, and ignoring tidal power, the plan promises yet more cash for those with their snouts in the nuclear trough. The hyper-expensive Hinkley Point farce has not dulled the appetite for more new nuclear power and it intends to plough by far the biggest sum of its innovation funding into the one energy technology where costs are always rising. But the biggest worry is the very limited support for carbon capture and storage, the technology that takes emissions from fossil fuels and buries them under the ground. CCS is seen as absolutely vital by the Committee on Climate Change, the National Audit Office and the UN’s climate science panel and the UK’s emptying North Sea fields are perfectly placed carbon reservoirs. But CCS gets only about a quarter of the investment of nuclear and just a tenth of the £1bn promised in the plan so abruptly canned by Osborne in 2015. Trees are natural carbon stores and the new plan pledges to “establish a new network of forests in England, including new woodland on farmland”, which offers a tantalising glimpse of the radical change to farm subsidies that may follow Brexit. But there is no mention of the reduction in meat consumption deemed essential in beating global warming by scientists. However, while many of the details are missing, the clean growth strategy marks an important and vital step forward for the UK. As the prime minister Theresa May says in the plan’s foreword: “Clean growth is not an option, but a duty we owe to the next generation. Success in this mission will improve our quality of life and increase our economic prosperity.” The strategy is now crystal clear – it is time to deliver."
"Cli-Fi refers to “climate fiction;” it is a term coined by journalist Dan Bloom. These are fictional books that somehow or someway bring real climate change science to the reader. What is really interesting is that Cli-Fi books often present real science in a credible way. They become fun teaching tools. There are some really well known authors such as Paolo Bacigalupi and Margaret Atwood among others. A list of other candidate Cli-Fi novels was provided by Sarah Holding in the Guardian.  What makes a Cli-Fi novel good? Well in my opinion, it has to have some real science in it. And it has to get the science right. Second, it has to be fun to read. When done correctly, Cli-Fi can connect people to their world; it can help us understand what future climate may be like, or what current climate effects are.  As I write this, we are getting a steady stream of stories out of Puerto Rico the island was devastated by Hurricane Maria. It is hard to imagine the devastation, what life is like without electricity, food, or water. What is life like on an island of 3 million people, each fending for themselves, just trying to survive. Another thing that is hard to imagine is the future. What will the world be like decades from now when Earth temperatures have continued to rise? What will agriculture be like? What will coastal communities be like? What will international relations and armed conflict be like? It is also hard to imagine what living a subsistence agriculture life is like, today. What happens to lives and communities when the rains change, or don’t come at all? What would that world look like?  Cli-Fi stories are vehicles that can help us imagine. The authors get us to think about these what ifs – these future Earths. Cli-Fi novels (and movies for that matter) can make experiences far more real than endless graphs or plots of temperature variations. And that, perhaps, is the most important contribution Cli-Fi can make to the discussion of climate change in our everyday lives. These authors get us to imagine what experiences are or would be like.  One recent example of Cli-Fi literature is South Pole Station by Ashley Shelby. In this book we follow an artist, Cooper Gosling, who is traveling to a research location on Antarctica to create paintings. Yes, an artist is sent to live with researchers and crew – with funding from the National Science Foundation. After arriving at the South Pole, Cooper has to become acquainted with the strange social system that exists there. Ashley writes the book in such a way that you actually feel you are huddled in the cold with her and her co-workers. Cooper doesn’t uplift her life to travel to the South Pole on a whim. It is an outcome of a family tragedy and a history that involves romanticized stories of adventure to this remote place. While Cooper is stationed at the pole, she hears news that a radical scientist is coming. This scientist claims that climate change is a hoax – and his presence further upsets the delicate social balance that exists at the research location.  You see the expected reaction of the regular scientists when this climate denier arrives to perform his research. There is backstabbing and sabotage where in the end we find Copper helping this climate-denying scientist carry out an experiment. The experiment goes awry and there are repercussions all the way back to the US mainland, and the halls of Congress. I liked this book because I don’t like fiction. That is, I find it really hard to get into fictional books because my mind always runs back to science, or my email, or papers to grade, or kids’ soccer practices to get to. I never feel like I have time to just read for fun. But this book was really engaging. It was the first fictional book in a decade that I didn’t want to put down.  It is funny with really quick-witted humor that made me laugh. At the same time, I was impressed by how I felt like I was there – working amongst the staff and scientists. I enjoyed how Ashely weaved in threads of real and accurate science. And this, perhaps, is what makes the Cli-Fi genre so important. We can unintentionally learn real science.  Ashley’s book is at the edge of this genre. It is not “dystopian” and it is not about a post-apocalyptic world resulting from climate change. It is topical and, though fiction, is as present-day as a news headline. This book is about what people, dedicated to facts, are really doing today. It doesn’t seem futuristic. It seems like we are at a point when a bunch of scientists and friends of facts could take over a research station and say, “Stop the madness!” Salman Rushdie recently said that in the present day the country is so filled with lies and fantasy and fiction surrounding the truth, that it might require the fiction writer to plainly lay out what is reality and what is not. I think Ashley’s book fits that notion. So, take a look at this new (newish?) form of literature. Particularly if you want a break from the usual genres. If you find something you like that I didn’t mention, please send it to me."
"The International Monetary Fund has warned the world’s richest nations to have a greater sense of urgency about climate change, a day after the former Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, delivered a bizarre speech to a London-based thinktank claiming climate change was “probably doing good”. The IMF’s latest World Economic Outlook (WEO), released overnight, has dedicated an entire chapter to the impact of weather shocks and climate change on global economic activity.  It warns coping with climate change will be one of the “fundamental challenges” of the 21st century and it calls on the global community to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions before they create “more irreversible damage”, saying richer countries must help low-income economies adapt to rapidly increasing temperatures. Directly contradicting one of Abbott’s arguments that Australia’s contribution to global emissions has been so small it is not worth restructuring its economy to change its energy use significantly, the IMF says nations with developed economies such as Australia – one of the highest per capita emitters in the world – have a responsibility to act.  “Advanced and emerging market economies have contributed the lion’s share to actual and projected climate change,” the report says. “Helping low-income developing countries cope with the consequences of climate change is both a humanitarian imperative and sound global economic policy that helps offset countries’ failure to fully internalise the costs of greenhouse gas emissions. “Since the turn of the 20th century, the Earth’s average surface temperature has increased significantly. Sizeable swings in global temperatures used to happen over long periods, such as fluctuations in and out of the Ice Ages. However, the speed at which the climate has changed over the past 30-40 years appears to be unprecedented in the past 20,000 years. “Climate change is a negative global externality of potentially catastrophic proportions and only collective action and multilateral cooperation can effectively address its causes and consequences.” Overall, the IMF is estimating global output growth will increase from 3.2% in 2016 to 3.6% in 2017 and 3.7% in 2018, after upgrading its growth forecast by 0.1 percentage points for 2017 and 2018. Maurice Obstfeld, the IMF’s economic counsellor, says the global cyclical upswing that began midway through 2016 is continuing to gather strength and is reaching more broadly than any upswing in a decade – roughly 75% of the world economy, measured by GDP at purchasing power parity, is sharing in the acceleration. But he has cautioned the recovery may not be sustainable because growth in nominal and real wages remains weak compared with past recoveries, including in Australia. “In particular, most advanced economies face medium-term growth rates significantly lower than in the decade before the global financial crisis of 2007–09,” he said. Abbott warned this week, in a speech that was being politely ignored by some of his colleagues on Tuesday, that climate change itself was “probably doing good; or at least, more good than harm,” and measures to deal with climate change would damage Australia’s economy. “In most countries, far more people die in cold snaps than in heatwaves, so a gradual lift in global temperatures, especially if it’s accompanied by more prosperity and more capacity to adapt to change, might even be beneficial,” he said. The IMF warns specifically in its report that rising global temperatures could wreak havoc in parts of the world, particularly in hotter climates where people were too poor to migrate. Obstfeld has called on the global community to exploit the current cyclical global upswing to pursue domestic and international reforms. “Priorities for mutually beneficial cooperation include strengthening the global trading system, further improving financial regulation, enhancing the global financial safety net, reducing international tax avoidance, fighting famine and infectious diseases, mitigating greenhouse gas emissions before they create more irreversible damage, and helping poorer countries, which are not themselves substantial emitters, adapt to climate change,” he said. “If the strength of the current upswing makes the moment ideal for domestic reforms, its breadth makes multilateral cooperation opportune. Policymakers should act while the window of opportunity is open.” "
"Ophelia formed so far to the east in the Atlantic it caused the United States Hurricane Centre to recast its maps so that they could track the storm. They had not thought it was feasible for hurricanes to head north so near the coast of Europe. As it was, the cold sea south of Ireland took the sting out of the 15th named storm of a busy Atlantic hurricane season. Even so the winds of up to 100 miles an hour were only just below hurricane strength when they hit the south coast of Ireland. And Ophelia may be the shape of things to come. To form, tropical storms need sea temperatures to be at least 26C; they usually grow in strength until they make landfall or head over cooler seas.  Climate change means 26C “tropical seas” are now extending further north. Research tracking these storms has shown this is allowing hurricanes to reach maximum power about 30 miles further north than 10 years ago. The ability of hurricanes to sustain themselves as they travel north in these warmer seas is expected to be a continuing trend, putting Europe potentially in the firing line for hurricanes. In the meantime, the main concern in Britain will be storms coming from the west. Brian, the second potentially damaging autumn storm, is out there somewhere in the Atlantic. These storms are named when the Met Office calculates they need to issue weather warnings. The depressions do not need warm seas to form, although climate change is giving them extra energy and they carry more rain. With the jet stream speeding up the outlook is currently turbulent. "
"Australia’s motoring lobby is launching a campaign for “real-world” vehicle emissions testing, arguing the current system needs an overhaul because it is misleading consumers and regulators. The Australian Automobile Association will on Monday release results from emissions and fuel consumption tests on 30 passenger and light commercial vehicles showing discrepancies between real world and official fuel consumption established in laboratory testing.  But the environment movement is preparing a campaign of its own, with the Australian Conservation Foundation urging its supporters to contact their state car clubs to demand groups like the RACV, NRMA, RACQ, RAA, RAC, RACT and AANT, support strong pollution standards for cars. Green groups say the latest testing push by the motoring lobby is a delaying tactic. The skirmish signposts the next big battle in energy policy, with the Turnbull government considering whether to introduce new vehicle pollution standards as part of measures to reduce emissions in sectors of the economy beyond the electricity sector. While the government unveiled its electricity strategy last week, it is still mulling its approach to the rest of the economy with a review of current climate policy, and the vehicles process, which is in gestation through a ministerial forum. Now that the government has determined that electricity should reduce its emissions by 26% on 2005 levels by 2030 as a pro-rata share to meet Australia’s commitments under the Paris target – the next challenge will be to set up emissions reductions measures for the rest of the economy, and do that at a time when emissions are rising in industrial energy, transport, industrial heat and agriculture. Emissions projections from the Department of Environment and Energy show transport emissions increased 52% between 1990 to 2015, and they are projected to rise a further 9% above the 2015 levels to 2030. Earlier this year, the government released a series of proposed targets for vehicles in discussion papers to seeking input from industry. Under the strongest target considered, new cars would have to cut their CO2 emissions by 45% below current levels by 2025 – from 192g of CO2 a kilometre to 105g. The AAA claims a “clear link” between more stringent vehicle standards and increasing fuel consumption discrepancy. The AAA’s report says as CO2 standards in Europe are becoming “more and more stringent” manufacturers are deploying technologies that are optimised for the laboratory drive cycle. The motoring body says current vehicle testing, which happens in laboratories, has led to consumers being given inaccurate information about fuel consumption and environmental performance in popular models. “Popular cars on the Australian market are using up to 59% more fuel than advertised and emitting more than seven times the legal limit of some noxious emissions,” said the AAA’s chief executive, Michael Bradley. Bradley said as emissions standards tightened, “the gap between laboratory results and real-world results is widening, meaning consumers and the environment are increasingly being ripped off.” The AAA says it wants a “real world” emissions test program for new cars, which would be modelled on the European standard, but modified slightly to take account of Australian conditions. It says more stringent emissions laws are meant to reduce pollution and drive down fuel use, but real world testing suggests “such benefits largely occur only in the laboratory.” However, the project manager of ClimateWorks Australia, Claire Painter said Australian motoring bodies were “misleading consumers” by seeking to delay the introduction of standards until there was a better national emissions testing regime. “The Australian Automobile Association continues to highlight discrepancies between on-road and in-lab performance of vehicles as a means of stymying attempts to improve the overall efficiency of Australian cars,” Painter said. “While it is important to improve emissions testing to provide greater clarity to consumers, it should not be used as a pretext for delaying the introduction of vehicle emissions standards which deliver real fuel savings to motorists.” ClimateWorks says if the government introduced the most stringent vehicle standard currently in contemplation, motorists would benefit from annual additional fuel savings of up to $519 for an average passenger vehicle driver or $666 for a light commercial vehicle driver. As part of efforts to counter the lobbying by the motoring sector, the chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation, Kelly O’Shanassy, has already written to the heads of the state motoring clubs asking whether the AAA’s position on climate pollution standards represent their own. “I reckon Australians will be shocked that the organisations they trust to get them out of a jam when their car breaks down now appear to be trying to undermine the implementation of the toughest climate pollution standards,” O’Shanassy said. “Of course we need rigorous testing of cars to make sure they are not polluting more than they should and the federal government is looking to introduce more accurate testing standards already being deployed in Europe,” she said. “But this isn’t an excuse to stall the introduction of strong pollution and carbon emissions standards, in fact it’s a reason to go ahead without delay.” A spokeswoman for the minister for urban infrastructure, Paul Fletcher, said the government would look at the AAA’s data through the ministerial forum on vehicle emissions “which will work systemically through a range of issues and offers an opportunity to assess the merits of real-world testing”. She said Australia currently operated within an international testing system, and introducing an Australia specific real-world emissions tests would increase costs for motorists."
"Global emissions of climate-warming carbon dioxide remained static in 2016, a welcome sign that the world is making at least some progress in the battle against global warming by halting the long-term rising trend. All of the world’s biggest emitting nations, except India, saw falling or static carbon emissions due to less coal burning and increasing renewable energy, according to data published on Thursday by the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (NEAA). However other mainly developing nations, including Indonesia, still have rising rates of CO2 emissions. Stalled global emissions still means huge amounts of CO2 are being added to the atmosphere every year – more than 35bn tonnes in 2016 – driving up global temperatures and increasing the risk of damaging, extreme weather. Furthermore, other heat-trapping greenhouse gases, mainly methane from cattle and leaks from oil and gas exploration, are still rising and went up by 1% in 2016. “These results are a welcome indication that we are nearing the peak in global annual emissions of greenhouse gases,” said climate economist Prof Lord Nicholas Stern at the London School of Economics and president of the British Academy. “To realise the goals of the Paris agreement and hold the increase in global average temperature to well below 2C, we must reach peak emissions as soon as possible and then achieve a rapid decline soon afterwards,” Stern said. “These results from the Dutch government show that there is a real opportunity to get on track.” Jos Olivier, the chief researcher for the NEAA report, sounded a note of caution: “There is no guarantee that CO2 emissions will from now on be flat or descending.” He said, for example, a rise in gas prices could see more coal burning resume in the US.  The flat CO2 emissions in 2016 follow similar near-standstills in 2014 and 2015. This lack of growth is unprecedented in a time when the global economy is growing. As the number of years of flat emissions grows, scientists are more confident a peak has been reached, rather than a temporary halt. In July 2016, senior economists said China’s huge coal burning had peaked, marking a historic turning point in efforts to tame climate change. Stern said many of the big emitting nations had achieved significant reductions in 2016: “However, all countries have to accelerate their emissions reductions if the Paris goals are to be met.” He said this could also drive development in poorer nations: “We can now see clearly that the transition to a low-carbon economy is at the heart of the story of poverty reduction and of the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals.” The new Dutch report shows CO2 emissions from China, the world’s biggest emitter, fell 0.3% in 2016. US CO2 emissions fell 2.0% and Russia’s by 2.1%, with the EU flat, although UK emissions tumbled by 6.4%, as coal burning plunged. Of the top five emitters, only India’s CO2 emissions rose, by 4.7%. Significant increases were also seen in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Turkey and Ukraine. However, over a quarter of the warming effect seen by the world comes from non-CO2 greenhouse gases, with methane by far the most significant. Cattle belch the gas and are responsible for 23% of global methane emissions, and this source rose by 0.4% in 2016. Scientists have warned that the growing global appetite for meat, especially beef, cannot continue if climate change is to be kept under 2C. Another quarter of methane emissions come from fossil fuel production and leaks in gas distribution pipes. Since 2000, emissions from coal and gas production have grown by more than 65%. Carbon emissions from forest destruction and other land use changes were not included in the main analysis as they are more difficult to estimate and vary strongly from year to year."
"A British-led expedition has discovered sizeable chunks of polystyrene lying on remote frozen ice floes in the middle of the Arctic Ocean. The depressing find, only 1,000 miles from the north pole, is the first made in an area that was previously inaccessible to scientists because of sea ice. It is one of the most northerly sightings of such detritus in the world’s oceans, which are increasingly polluted by plastics.  A team of scientists drawn from the UK, US, Norway and Hong Kong, headed by marine biologist Tim Gordon of Exeter University, said the discovery confirmed just how far plastic pollution has spread. It has prompted fears that plastic waste is flowing into the Arctic as the ice melts because of climate change. The thaw is simultaneously releasing plastic that has long been trapped in the ice. The scientists, who were on the explorer Pen Hadow’s Arctic Mission attempt to sail to the north pole, were surprised to discover the blocks of polystyrene many hundreds of miles from land in areas that were, until recently, covered by ice all year round. They found two large pieces on the edge of ice floes between 77° and 80° north, in the middle of the international waters of the central Arctic Ocean. “For the 25 years I have been exploring the Arctic I have never seen such large and very visible items of rubbish,” said Hadow, the only person to have trekked solo, without resupply, from Canada to the geographic north pole. “The blocks of polystyrene were just sitting on top of the ice.” “Finding pieces of rubbish like this is a worrying sign that melting ice may be allowing high levels of pollution to drift into these areas,” Gordon said. “This is potentially very dangerous for the Arctic’s wildlife.” The pioneering expedition – using two yachts – sailed further into the international waters of the Central Arctic Ocean than any previous navigation attempt without icebreakers. Rates of ice melt have increased dramatically due to climate change, with 40% of the central Arctic Ocean now navigable in summer. Estimates suggest that there are more than 5 trillion pieces of plastic floating on the surface of the world’s oceans. It has been claimed that there is now enough plastic to form a permanent layer in the fossil record. Dr Ceri Lewis, scientific adviser to the expedition based at the University of Exeter, has previously warned that people produce around 300 million tons of plastic a year, roughly the same weight as all the humans on the planet. Around half of all plastic produced is used once and then thrown away. A significant concern is that large plastic pieces can break down into “microplastics” – tiny particles that are accidentally consumed by filter-feeding animals. The particles remain in animals’ bodies and are passed up the food chain, threatening wildlife at all levels from zooplankton to apex predators such as polar bears. In an attempt to gauge the presence of microplastics in Arctic waters, the scientists intend to test samples of seawater they collected in nets with holes smaller than a millimetre across. “Many rivers that are often a source of plastic pollution lead into the Arctic Ocean, but plastic pollution has been literally trapped into the ice,” Lewis said. “Now the ice is melting we believe microplastics are being released into the Arctic. The Arctic is thought to be a hot spot of microplastics accumulation due to the number of rivers that empty into the Arctic basin, yet we have very little data to support this idea in the more northerly parts of the Arctic Ocean.” She added that the data the expedition was collecting was important because the Arctic supports many fisheries which could be affected by microplastics. Some projections indicate that the entire Arctic Ocean will be ice-free in summer by 2050. This will allow human exploitation of the newly opened waters and bring a range of fresh threats to Arctic wildlife. “The Arctic Ocean’s wildlife used to be protected by a layer of sea ice all year round,” Gordon said. “Now that is melting away, this environment will be exposed to commercial fishing, shipping and industry for the first time in history. We need to seriously consider how best to protect the Arctic’s animals from these new threats. By doing so, we will give them a fighting chance of adapting and responding to their rapidly changing habitat.” The team is also investigating the impact of human-made noise pollution on Arctic marine life and mammals, using underwater loudspeakers and microphones to understand how sound travels through the polar seas, and how this might be affected by ice loss. Arctic cod, beluga whales, ringed seals and walruses use a range of sounds to communicate in the underwater darkness. Narwhals hunt for fish a mile below the surface using biosonar, emitting 1,000 high-pitched clicks every second and listening to their reflected echoes – much the same way that bats do. “It is critical that we establish baseline natural recordings in this newly exposed oceanic environment,” said Professor Steve Simpson, an expert in bioacoustics and noise pollution at Exeter University. “These recordings will allow us to understand how human activities are changing the soundscape of the summer Arctic, and assess the success of future noise management in this unique acoustic world.” On-board wildlife biologist Heather Bauscher said increasing ice melt could have serious consequences for the whole Arctic ecosystem. “Quality research and the development of sound management strategies are necessary to protect the Arctic’s wildlife: this is crucial at a time of such dramatic change,” she said."
"To live on one of the Pacific atolls is to come face to face with climate change on a daily basis. Few people in the world had such personal experience as Tony de Brum of the realities of sea level rises and storm surges, of warmer seas, receding beaches and abandoned land. Fewer still have been able to turn that experience into international action to save the islands, and the rest of the planet with them. De Brum, who has died aged 72, acted as ambassador on climate change for the Marshall Islands, a sparsely populated group of more than 1,000 tiny islands spread out over nearly 30 coral atolls. In 2015, he was instrumental in securing the Paris agreement on climate change, by which the world’s governments collectively agreed, for the first time, to hold global warming to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, which scientists say is the limit of safety, and with an aspiration to ensure warming does not exceed 1.5C.  The 1.5C provision was crucial for the low-lying Pacific island states: scientists estimate that, at 2C of warming, the atolls would be overswept by sea level rises and frequent storm surges. Only a lower limit would give them a lifeline, but the challenge of cutting greenhouse gas emissions in line with such a goal is immense, and while small developing countries were keen, many big economies balked at it. In the tense final days of the negotiations, De Brum helped to lead a coalition of developing and developed countries to forge a compromise and carry the day, resulting in the historic accord. He was hailed as “a real hero, a giant of history, a custodian of our shared future” by the Marshall Islands’ president, Hilda Heine, and by the former UN climate chief, Christiana Figueres, as “an inspiring leader, a pillar of determination”. De Brum’s work on climate change, while it will form perhaps his most lasting global legacy, was only the third of the great causes he espoused in a five-decade career of public service, during which he served as foreign minister of the Marshall Islands for three separate terms, interspersed with periods as minister of finance, of health and the environment, and as assistant to the president. De Brum was born on Tuvalu, a former British colony 700 miles north of Fiji, as the war in the Pacific was nearing its final deadly stages. The family later moved to Likiep, in the Marshall Islands, at that time a trust territory of the US, which had wrested control from Japan. His father, Joe, became manager of Majuro airport; his mother, Cecilia, was a teacher. When hostilities ended, the US began 12 years of nuclear testing in the area, with close to 70 blasts by 1958. As a boy, De Brum witnessed one of the consequences from a fishing boat. He later recalled: “I was fishing with my grandfather. He was throwing the net and suddenly the silent bright flash, and then a force, the shockwave. Everything turned red: the ocean, the fish, the sky, and my grandfather’s net. And we were 200 miles away from ground zero.” This was the Bravo Shot, the largest of the US nuclear tests carried out on Bikini Atoll, more than a thousand times as powerful as the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima. The Marshall Islanders’ campaign for freedom from the US lasted through the 1970s, with independence coming in 1979. After studying at Chaminade University, then the University of Hawaii – he was one of the first Marshall Islanders to attend university, according to Heine – De Brum took part in the negotiations, and in the independent governments that followed. His experience of nuclear testing led to a lifelong crusade for nuclear disarmament, culminating in filing lawsuits against all nine nuclear-armed countries in the international court of justice in 2014. “Nuclear weapons are a senseless threat to essential survival. There are basic human and ethical norms, not to mention longstanding treaties, which compel those who possess them to pursue and achieve their elimination,” he said. The legal bid failed. Unassuming in manner, grey-haired and grey-suited, De Brum could have been indistinguishable from the hundreds of other functionaries milling through the halls of UN meetings. There was nothing grey about his personality, however: affable and friendly, he was always ready with a quip or a wink for journalists, and shared stories about his beloved islands, his childhood and his family. He was as happy to greet groups of schoolchildren, or students dressed as polar bears, as to mingle with world leaders. De Brum’s work at the two-week-long Paris talks was a masterclass in diplomacy. The debate over whether the 1.5C target should be included had the potential to wreck the talks – it had wrecked the previous attempt, eight years earlier in Copenhagen. By agreeing a compromise, he showed a pragmatism often absent from the negotiations, and helped lead his fellow small island states and least developed countries in joining with the EU and various others in the “coalition of high ambition”. Some dismissed the 1.5C aspirational target as unachievable, but De Brum’s faith was borne out by a new study, published soon after his death in Nature Geoscience, a prestigious peer-review journal. It concluded that keeping within 1.5C was possible, though it required effort. De Brum is survived by his wife, Rosalie (nee Maddison), whom he married in 1969, three children, 10 grandchildren and five great-grandchildren, and by his father. • Anton de Brum, politician, born 26 February 1945; died 22 August 2017"
"Emissions of the greenhouse gas methane from livestock are larger than previously thought, posing an additional challenge in the fight to curb global warming, scientists have said.  Revised calculations of methane produced per head of cattle show that global livestock emissions in 2011 were 11% higher than estimates based on data from the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC).   Periodic reports by the IPCC, drawing from thousands of scientists, help leaders take action on climate change, which has begun to wreak havoc on weather around the world. “In many regions, livestock numbers are changing, and breeding has resulted in larger animals with higher intakes of food,” said Julie Wolf, a researcher in the US Department of Agriculture and the lead author of a study in the journal Carbon Balance and Management.  “This, along with changes in livestock management, can lead to higher methane emissions,” she said. Earlier estimates, Wolf added in a statement, were based on “out-of-date data”.  After rising slowly from 2000 to 2006, the concentration of methane in the air has climbed 10 times more quickly in the last decade, according to earlier research.  Besides natural sources such as peatland, wetlands and termites, methane from human activity – approximately two-thirds of the total – is produced in two ways: the odourless and colourless gas leaks during the production and transport of coal, oil and especially natural gas; and, in roughly equal measure, from the flatulence of ruminants such as cattle and sheep, as well as the decay of organic waste, notably in landfills. Methane accounted for about 16% of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2015, according to the IPCC. Carbon dioxide – produced mainly by the burning of fossil fuels – accounts for more than three-quarters of planet-warming emissions.  “As our diets become more meat- and dairy-rich, so the hidden climate cost of our food tends to mount up,” said profDave Reay from the University of Edinburgh reacting to the study. “Cows belching less methane may not be as eye-catching as wind turbines and solar panels, but they are just as vital for addressing climate change.”  The new study boosts the “estimate of human-induced emissions of methane from all sources by about four %,” said prof Piers Forster from the University of Leeds , who was not involved in the research. Methane is far more potent than CO2 as a greenhouse gas, capturing more of the sun’s radiative force, but it persists for less time in the atmosphere. Taking that into account, scientists calculate that over a 100-year period the “global-warming potential” of the gas is 28 times greater than for carbon dioxide. The study noted that methane emissions from livestock have risen most sharply in the rapidly developing regions of Asia, Latin America and Africa. By contrast, the increase has slowed sharply in the US and Canada. In Europe, emissions of the gas have declined. A sharp rise in methane pollution could jeopardise the goal – enshrined in the 196-nation Paris climate pact – of capping global warming below 2C, a consortium of 81 scientists warned in December.  “Such a target will become increasingly difficult if reductions in methane emissions are not also addressed strongly and rapidly,” they wrote in an open letter. "
"The scorching temperatures across Europe’s Mediterranean nations this summer were made at least 10 times more likely by climate change, according to scientists.  Furthermore, without action to tackle global warming, such summer heatwaves with temperatures soaring over 40C will become normal by 2050.  The new analysis by the World Weather Attribution (WWA) group also analysed the particular “Lucifer” heatwave which struck south-east France, Italy and Croatia in early August and found it was made at least four times more likely by human-caused climate change.  The Lucifer heatwave saw temperatures fail to drop below 30C for three days and nights in the hottest spots, and was linked to a 15% surge in emergency hospital admissions in Italy. Prolonged heat is known to be very dangerous to health and a severe heatwave in Europe in 2003 was linked to 75,000 deaths by subsequent analysis.  “Summers keep getting hotter,” said Friederike Otto at the University of Oxford, UK, also part of WWA. “Heatwaves are far more intense than when my parents were growing up in the 1950s. If we do nothing to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, the kind of extreme heat we saw this past summer will be the norm when my young son is a grown man.” The fast-growing science of climate change attribution tackles the question of what impact global warming is having on extreme weather and the people it affects. No event can be said to be caused by climate change because random extremes occur naturally. But by comparing extremes with historical measurements and computer models of a climate unaltered by carbon emissions, researchers can show how global warming is already heavily loading the dice of dangerous weather. In June, WWA showed the extreme heatwave that saw deadly forest fires blazing in Portugal and Spain was made 10 times more likely by global warming. In Portugal, 64 people died. Previous work has demonstrated floods in England and France – even as far back as 2000 – were made more significantly likely by climate change. Research in Australia has shown the bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef was 175 times more likely due to greenhouse gas emissions, while the recent hot winter was made 60 times more likely.  Hurricanes are much more complex and time consuming to analyse than heatwaves and WWA is currently working on Hurricane Harvey. But scientists are clear that climate change is most likely to have made the giant storms that have ripped across the Caribbean and the US this year more destructive. This is because greater heat means more storm energy and rainfall, while rising sea level means storm surges reach further inland. The new research analysed this summer’s heat across Spain, southern France, Italy and the Balkans. It compared the measured temperatures with four different groups of climate models in which the heating effect of the last century of carbon emissions were omitted. This showed the high level of heat in June, July and August was at least 10 times more likely than it would have been in the early 1900s. The researchers did the same for the Lucifer heatwave, examining its three-day peak in early August. They found the intensity of such heatwaves has increased by 1C to 2C since 1950 and that overall climate change has quadrupled the change of them happening.  In June, the Guardian revealed that the UK government’s failure to update building regulations for homes, hospitals and schools could cause a tripling of heatwave deaths by 2040. “It is critical that cities work with scientists and public health experts to develop heat action plans because such extreme heat will become the norm in the middle of the century,” said Robert Vautard, a researcher at the Laboratory of Climate and Environmental Sciences in France. “Climate change is impacting communities right now and these plans save lives.”"

"Climate experts have warned the Scottish government its ambitious plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions lack credibility and risk stalling unless its strategies improve dramatically. The Committee on Climate Change (CCC) said the devolved government had so far led the UK in its efforts to cut emissions, reducing its actual CO2 emissions by 38% by 2015 compared with 35% at UK level. Scotland is now on the brink of meeting its 2020 target to cut emissions by 42% several years early.  Nicola Sturgeon’s government is consulting on plans to set a fresh target of cutting emissions by 90% by 2050 but faces heavy criticism from anti-poverty charities and the Scottish Green party, who have urged the first minister to take faster, tougher action. The CCC, the UK’s government-funded advisory committee, said the policies needed to hit that target were too weak and ill thought out, singling out proposals in a draft plan to heavily cut emissions by sharply increasing low carbon home heating to 80% by 2032. Those were “very unlikely to be feasible”, it warned.  The committee said ministers needed instead to put far greater emphasis on cutting the country’s rising transport emissions – an area largely neglected by the Scottish government until now.  So Sturgeon’s proposals to dramatically increase the use of electric and ultra low emission vehicles by helping phase out sales of new petrol and diesel-powers vans and cars by 2032, outlined in her new programme for government earlier this month, were a significant step forward, it added.  In an unusually critical progress report for the Scottish parliament, the CCC said: “Without firm new policies, reductions in Scottish emissions are unlikely to continue in the 2020s. The final version of Scotland’s plan should also build as fully as possible on the UK government’s clean growth plan, which will set out how UK emissions targets to 2032 will be met. “Greater ambition will be required to reduce emissions in the transport sector, as announced in the recent programme for government, with less reliance on rapid deployment of low-carbon heating. The plan as it stands lacks credibility in meeting the emissions targets to 2032 and fails to prepare properly for deeper decarbonisation in the longer term.”  Roseanna Cunningham, the Scottish environment secretary, said her government was now putting action on climate at the heart of its policymaking. Its final plan, due to be published in 2018, would reflect the committee’s advice.  “We acknowledge that there are areas where more needs to be done in order to continue meeting our ambitious targets and to prepare for even greater future ambition under our proposed climate change bill,” she said. Scotland’s emissions reduction had been driven largely by sharp increases in renewable electricity, funded by UK consumers, and deep cuts in coal-fired power, bolstered by forestry acting as a carbon sink.  Scotland’s last coal powered station, Longannet, closed down in 2016 and electrification of the country’s rail network is increasing, but the committee said Scottish ministers could no longer rely on renewable electricity investment to hit future targets. That switch to renewables was driven by Alex Salmond, Sturgeon’s predecessor as first minister, but the Scottish government has been accused of pursuing contradictory policies on climate. Salmond championed North Sea oil exports to fund Scottish independence, while investing billions on new road projects, and Sturgeon plans to phase out air passenger duty to boost aviation.  While the Scottish government has no direct say over vehicle emissions standards and little influence over manufacturers, committee officials said it could boost electric vehicle use by greatly increasing charging infrastructure and having tougher planning and parking policies.  The committee said the 2032 policy would lead to the complete phasing out of all petrol and diesel powered cars by 2050. Ministers are also introducing new low emission zones in Scotland’s four largest cities, to control pollution and inefficient vehicles. Patrick Harvie, the Scottish Greens’ co-convenor and parliamentary leader, accused Sturgeon of lacking ambition. He said that cutting emissions by 90% by 2050 represented a slowing down of action. If Scotland continued to cutting annual emissions at the present rate, it could reach zero net emissions by 2040.  “Other countries have already set net-zero targets before the year 2050, including Norway and Sweden”, Harvie said last Friday. “Scotland has a chance to continue showing leadership and adopt a net-zero target and I’m glad the first minister has at least committed to ‘proper consideration’ of consultation responses.”"
"The Doomsday Clock, used by the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists for the last 70 years to indicate the danger level of global nuclear annihilation, was recently moved to “two-and-a-half minutes to midnight”.  On an Aboriginal timeline, we might recall much older lore about uranium, which warns of a monster that must be left in the ground or it will destroy the earth with fire; or the blue tongue lizard Dreaming story warning about radioactive poison.   Indigenous reasoning does not tolerate isolated variables, so from an Aboriginal perspective you can’t ignore the interconnected issues. The threat of nuclear apocalypse is occurring during the greatest species extinction event in aeons. Rare earth metal refining – for the solar panels we all put our hopes in – produces tons of radioactive waste that can’t be safely stored. The disaster site at Fukushima continues to leak. Nuclear-armed developing nations in South Asia are running out of water. Developed nations globally are running out of topsoil. And the broader impacts of climate change are already being felt.  When people wonder what the post-apocalypse world will look like, just ask an Indigenous person, we survived and have been living in it. I'm very fond of saying that as Indigenous people ""Survival is our Superpower"". We have survived the apocalypse of colonization & genocide. I’ve been thinking a lot about the end of the world. It seems many Indigenous people have. The theme has become prolific in First Nations art, literature, film and television. Search online and you can find hundreds of tweets and blogs about it, with a common theme: a confidence that we’ll be the only ones to survive. In bookstores I found Indigenous speculative fiction novels like the dystopian futurist works of Sam Watson and Alexis Wright, and the adolescent fiction of Palyku writer Ambelin Kwaymullina, creator of the Tribe trilogy – Australia’s answer to the Hunger Games. The TV series Cleverman, produced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander artists, offered up a futuristic black superhero to make me feel like I would outlast the Doomsday Clock. Dr Duane Hamacher from Monash University has spent years studying ancient oral histories of geological events. “For over 65,000 years, the First Peoples of this continent have experienced major catastrophes,” he tells me. “These have included volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, meteorite impacts and rapid sea level rises. The people survived, and so did the stories.”  Hamacher attributes this survival to the immense complexity and adaptive capacity of First Nations cultures. But does this resilience in the face of natural disasters characterise Indigenous responses to colonisation as well? Last week I went to a Melbourne Fringe festival event: a First Nations response to the end of the world that took the form of an art party called Apocalypse in Blak.  Created by Nayuka Gorrie and the Koori Heritage Trust, the show explored cycles of adaptation beyond the Anthropocene era in dance and electronic sound pieces. It was interspersed with spoken word and free-for-all audience participation – with a bratty “whatever” mood throughout. “Colonisation was our apocalypse, and we are already living in a dystopian future, so we are ahead of the game,” Gorrie says. “Part of me is excited about what comes next as an opportunity to take my country back, a chance to assert sovereignty.”  Then she goes for the jugular with a cheeky byte that will likely see her inbox filled with hate mail: “Colonists are about to experience their own apocalypse, but whose land can they steal next to survive it?” Dr Larry Gross is chair of Native American Studies at the University of Redlands in California. An Anishinaabe man of the Minnesota Chippewa, Gross has published and spoken extensively on a theory he coined, called post-apocalyptic stress syndrome (Pass). He defines it as: “When a culture experiences such a massive shock that it never fully recovers.”  Gross has identified this syndrome in both Indigenous and settler communities. Recent examples include white manufacturing workers in the American mid-west, whose way of life came to an end with the collapse of their industry. Historically, he finds the same indicators of Pass in population data from Europe after the Black Death plagues in the 14th century.  “The Europe that came out of the Black Death was not the same as the Europe that went in,” Gross tells me. He draws parallels between this event, and the Indigenous experience of colonisation. “Both resulted in an intergenerational pandemic of post traumatic stress disorder, suicide and widespread substance abuse.” Gross sees potential apocalyptic crises today as opportunities for reconciliation, drawing from his study of historical Indigenous and European holocausts: “Since the Europeans went through an apocalypse and suffered the exact same symptoms as Indigenous people, this indicates that we are not as different as we might like to think.” Melbourne’s West Space Gallery is currently hosting Every Second Feels Like a Century, a collaboration between Indigenous and non-Indigenous curators Hannah Presley and Debbie Pryor. In a determined “race against destruction”, the exhibit litters a small gallery space with stylised doomsday prepper kits, crystallised fossil replicas of Coke bottles and Nikes, and traditional tools alongside urban foraging equipment.  Tasmanian Indigenous artist Nicholas Hovington presents a resurrective shrine of skin and bones – a grisly homage to a time when the bounty for shooting thylacines was the same as for shooting Tasmanian Aboriginal people. Star Dreaming and Turtle lore are flagged for a revival, to bring on a cataclysm described cryptically by Worimi artist Adam Ridgeway as “good hurt now, big debt one”. There are complex layers to this exhibit that are worth unpacking. Presley recounts the impact the stolen generation had on her family, and how it influenced her approach to the exhibit. “I thought about my own grandfather, whose mother rubbed him with charcoal to keep him with her,” she told me. “That moment he was stolen could be interpreted as an apocalypse for our family.” She incorporated the same colour of charcoal into the exhibition design. According to Gross, it takes at least a century for a population to adapt after post-apocalyptic stress syndrome. In the meantime there is an understandable need to express both mourning and bravado in response to world-changing events. You can see it as a therapeutic way of coming to grips with past trauma without drowning in victimhood and despair in the present. But while assertions of Indigenous peoples’ end-times advantage are often delivered with an empowering kind of smugness, it’s not always justified. In my case particularly, it’s been almost a year since I ate dugong or used a spear, and city living in that time has made my feet as soft as my rapidly-expanding buttocks. I doubt my capacity to hunt escaped pets for meat, or fight off mutants after the bomb drops. No matter what your tribe is, if you haven’t noticed the wattle flowering in this season or can’t remember what that indicates about the fish in the river, then you’re going to have a bad apocalypse. Many of our people might struggle with the lack of vegan options available in post-nuclear urban foraging, or with the disturbing realisation that being black, proud and fabulous doesn’t make you any better qualified to knock a zombie’s brains out with a boomerang.   Most of us, regardless of ethnicity, will probably be in the same boat when it comes to the end of the world. "
"Kiribati is one of the most isolated countries in the world. As you fly in to the main island of South Tarawa, located less than 100 kms from the equator, a precariously thin strip of sand and green materialises out of the ocean. On one side, a narrow reef offers some protection to the inhabitants and their land – at low tide, at least. On the other side, a shallow lagoon reaches kilometres out to sea. The 33 islands of Kiribati – pronounced “Kiribass” – are extremely shallow; the highest point on many of the islands such as South Tarawa is just a couple of metres above sea level. Looking out of the aeroplane window, there is no depth to the scene – sea dissolves seamlessly into sky, a paint palette of every blue Kiribati is estimated to have a population of just over 100,000, with more than half making their home on South Tarawa. There’s only one road on the island and everything travels along it: schoolchildren, hospital patients, food, water, workers, taxis, minibuses, private cars, and motor scooters. When I was last here four years ago the road was in a very poor state – a reflection of the country’s perilous economic position. Potholes and washaways were common, and the speed bumps were severe enough to rip out the front end of your car unless great care was taken.  Australia provided just under 30% of the A$77m (US$60.4m) cost of the Kiribati Road Rehabilitation Project. It was the largest economic infrastructure investment in the country since the second world war, and has made a substantial difference to the quality of life on South Tarawa. However, Kiribati is facing greater challenges which infrastructure alone cannot repair. Climate change is a huge concern. Rising ocean waters are threatening to shrink Kiribati’s land area, increase storm damage, destroy its crop-growing lands and ultimately displace its people long before the islands are submerged. Lack of fresh water is an immediate problem. Fresh water lies under the atolls and islands of Kiribati in what are known as a “water lenses”. Fresh water, which is less dense, floats on top of the denser salt water in a convex shape giving the sources their name. However, king tides and sea incursions are polluting the once-reliable sources and ruining the taro plant pits, known as babai pits, which depend on them. Claire Anterea, one of the co-ordinators of Kirican, the Kiribati Climate Action Network, says she fears the “extraordinary impact on our islands”.  Having yesterday witnessed the effects of sea incursions on vegetable growth on the island of Abaiang, she says: “It has just moved me into tears. Like, oh my God, this is very serious. [The sea] is two or three metres from the babai pit [where taro plants are grown]. “I feel hopeless in one way that our people are suffering, but I also have the hope within our people that they will try to find a way to adapt.” At the southern end of Abaiang in the village of Tebontebike, Maria Tekaie leans against an uprooted coconut tree that used to be 100 metres from the shore. The village had to be moved recently, as did the babai pits, due to the incursion of the sea. The 65-year-old expects to have to move again: “My children are worried and have started to talk about where else they can go. This is the only piece of land for us and they love it here,” she said.  “I just want the world to know, and my request to them is that we need help to protect our land because if we try to build something like a seawall the waves are stronger and we don’t know what option that we have. We just need help from you.” Eighty minutes north along the bumping and tortuous dirt road is the village of Tebunginako. It’s the most graphic example of sea inundation. Toroua Beree, 63, says: “I moved away from this village because they don’t have any more life on this piece of land. “I talk about life because before this land was full of banana, babai, coconut trees, so many coconut trees, so many trees we get food from, but now how can those trees continue to live when you don’t have fresh water to give them? This is community land and so everybody has a right to live on it but now it seems like the sea has taken that away.” John Kaboa, 28, and his wife, Tinaai, run the Tebero Te Rau bungalow resort on Abaiang. Their optimism is typical of the spirit and entrepreneurship that runs hand in hand with fear and despair. The accommodation sits on stilts over the water and the resort is powered with solar panels and a small, portable generator. Kaboa grows enough vegetables and fruit – such as cabbages, egg plants, papaya, pumpkin, watermelon, longbean, sweet pepper, taro, giant swamtaro and coconut tree – to supply his kitchen. He also buys local produce from farmers on the island in preference to buying imported products. And he has become involved in production of copra, the dried kernel of coconut which is used to extract oil for cooking, hair oils, shampoo, margarine and detergents.  Kaboa says he is hoping “to get enough money so that I can support my family to move to other countries if Kiribati will covered by the seawater. But I still really love my paradise country.” Elsewhere, I meet a Swiss man who is growing vegetables hydroponically in PVC pipes. Each pipe has been elevated on racks to keep the plants safely away from the crabs who are a constant menace to crops grown in the ground. In March 2016 Taneti Maamau became the new president of the Republic of Kiribati. The elections swept away 12 years of BTK (Boutokaan Te Koaua) party rule along with the outgoing president Anote Tong, who had spent many of those years on the world stage raising awareness of the problems his low-lying island nation was facing due to climate change.  The new government is more inward focussed. Its long-term project is Kiribati Vision 20 (KV20), which looks ahead 20 years. The plan is to plough revenue generated by fishing licences and tourism back into the Kiribati economy to reduce unemployment, raise education standards and reduce poverty. Kiribati earned A$197.8m in 2015 from the sale of fishing licences, up from A$29.5m in 2009.  The new government has also doubled the price of copra to A$2 per kilo. This made the average sack of copra worth about A$200 – a large sum on Kiribati. The idea of this initiative is to entice people to travel back to their outer island homes and take pressure off the heavily populated South Tarawa. It seems to have had an immediate effect.  But opposition MPs believe the doubling of the copra price will mean that people sacrifice their healthy subsistence lifestyle in favour of the more profitable copra production. They also worry that the government’s dedication to domestic progress will be futile given Kiribati’s future will ultimately be determined on the global stage. Tong, the former president, sits on the seawall that protects his house. His extended family live all around him.  His public speeches have tracked his emotions regarding the fortunes of the I-Kiribati people from frustration to anger to a sense of futility. He says he grieves for what is happening to his country.  “Climate change for most if not all of the countries in the Pacific is a survival issue,” he says. “If we do not address the climate change challenge, all of our efforts in trying to achieve economic survival, economic viability all will come to nought. “[Since leaving office] I’m at home, I’m seeing my grandchildren grow up, and the question that is always on my mind [is]: ‘What’s going to happen to my grandchildren in 20, 30, 40, 50 years time?’” I ask him: will the residents of Kiribati become climate refugees? “I think we have no excuse, we have more than enough time to deal with it,” he says. Following the Paris agreement on climate change – and despite the withdrawal of the US under Donald Trump – Tong feels there is now momentum for addressing the challenge. However, he notes that capping global temperature increases at “two degrees or 1.5 degrees does not mean a great deal for countries like Kiribati for whom the projected sea level rise will continue to be disastrous”.  Tong hopes Australia and New Zealand will support Kiribati’s cause at the United Nations’ framework convention on climate change in Germany next month. “If Australia and New Zealand are not there, it really puts into question the meaning of any relationship [we have] with Australia and New Zealand.” Unfortunately, in Australia climate change has been used as a political punchline. In 2015, the Australian immigration minister Peter Dutton made a joke about rising sea levels in Kiribati to the then prime minister Tony Abbott. After Abbott complained that the Pacific Islands Forum in Papua New Guinea ran later, Dutton said: “Time doesn’t mean anything when you’re, you know, about to have water lapping at your door.” During my conversation with Tong, I purposefully re-use those words and a brief flash of anger crosses over his normally peaceful face. He replies: “Well, actually, it does come into the door ... it’s not funny to the person being hurt.”  His sentiments are echoed by many of the residents of Kiribati, including Anterea. “I think you are too comfortable in your own country,” she says. “Just come to Kiribati and see with your own two eyes what we are suffering from.” This story has been corrected. Previously it stated that the highest point in Kiribati is just two metres above sea level; it now states that the highest point on many of the islands such as South Tarawa is just a couple of metres above sea level."
"Swedish scientists have found that flatulent shellfish are creating vast amounts of greenhouse gases, leading to a predictable slew of comments about farting cockles and clams. But beneath the schoolboy humour, there is a serious point. The two gases in question – methane and nitrous oxide – are potent agents of climate change, with a warming potential 28 and 265 times greater than carbon dioxide respectively. Scientists studying the Baltic Sea off the coast of Sweden have found that shellfish are producing one-tenth of all the greenhouses gases released there – the equivalent to the amount produced by 20,000 cattle. If the same situation is being replicated around the rest of the world’s seas and oceans, we have a serious problem.  Chief scientist Stafano Bonaglia, from Stockholm University, is certainly concerned: “It sounds funny, but small animals in the seafloor may act like cows in a stable, both groups being important contributors of methane due to the bacteria in their gut.” He also points out that shellfish were releasing these gases long before global warming became an issue, and believes that the recent emissions may have been exacerbated by the enrichment of coastal waters, due to the run-off from agricultural fertilisers. To put this into perspective, the average cow produces 120kg of methane every year – 1,000 times as much as even the most flatulent human. With almost 100m head of cattle in the US alone, that means that 12m tonnes of gas are being released annually, dwarfing the efforts of the shellfish. The major animal producers of methane are cud-chewing creatures known as ruminants, such as cattle and sheep – it’s the bacteria in their stomachs that causes the problem. However, kangaroos have a different digestive system, so produce a lot less methane – kangaroo steak, anyone? Other creatures that create huge amounts of methane include the world’s 2,000-plus species of termite. Each only produces a tiny amount – roughly half a microgram a day, so it would take 2m termites to produce a daily dose of one gram of methane. However, there are so many of them that their annual emissions may top 20m tonnes a year. The big difference between termites and cattle is, of course, that termites – and the gases they release – are part of the natural ecosystem. Cattle aren’t."
"Nick Robinson’s article asserting that Nigel Lawson should be corrected but not silenced by the BBC on climate change (Silencing the disagreeable won’t work. Put them on air, 28 September) suggests that he and his colleagues are still ignoring the potential harm caused by the broadcast of misinformation to their audiences. Lord Lawson has a track record of misleading the public about climate change. His lobby group, the Global Warming Policy Foundation, was found in 2014 to have breached Charity Commission rules by promoting climate change denial. In the same year, the BBC upheld a complaint after Lord Lawson made inaccurate and misleading claims about climate change on the Today programme on Radio 4. The BBC is now considering a complaint from me and others about further false claims by Lord Lawson on Today in August. In particular, the BBC needs to recognise that his erroneous assertion that extreme weather events are not increasing in frequency or intensity endangered listeners by creating the false impression that they need not respond to the rising risks of heatwaves and flooding from heavy rainfall in the UK. The BBC should properly weigh up the rights of marginal voices like Lord Lawson to mislead its audiences about the risks they face against the rights of its audiences to receive accurate information about those risks.Bob WardGrantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, LSE  • Nick Robinson writes a strong defence of the probing and investigative nature of a balanced media. He extols the virtues of the BBC, which indeed offers a reasonable cross-examination of ideas. But does political coverage really offer diversity? A quick search through the profiles of the BBC’s political team and their predecessors shows a long list of privately educated, white and male journalists. It is good to see gender diversity in the current political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, but it is not surprising to see that, like Nick Robinson whom she succeeded, she is also the beneficiary of an expensive private education. A journalist’s life experiences offer foundations for their querying minds. A balanced media should be representative of all parts of our society. A case for positive discrimination for future BBC appointees in terms of educational background, gender and race is strong. Richard BulmerSheffield • Nick Robinson lists a number of alternative media sites – the Canary, Wings Over Scotland etc – as opposed to mainstream media such as the BBC. I wonder where he would place the Daily Mail (“Enemies of the People”) or even more so the Daily Express (“Did EU regulation mean deadly cladding was used on Grenfell Tower?”)? They are clearly historically part of mainstream media but much of their reporting seems as “alternative” as anything the New European publishes. I think Nick makes a false distinction: the real problem is that across the board, mainstream and alternative, we have almost completely lost the idea of journalism as the first draft of history.Ian ChisholmDitchling, Sussex • Re Nick Robinson’s defence of media impartiality, I recall, when he was BBC political editor, a TV interview he had with David Cameron shortly after Cameron became PM. Cameron rolled out the Tory mantra that Gordon Brown’s Labour government had caused the global financial crisis. The camera panned to Robinson who merely nodded at this claim and made no attempt to question or dispute it. This falsity was repeated more recently by Andrew Marr in respect of his stated view that a Labour government couldn’t be trusted to manage the national economy. The context was an interview with Jeremy Corbyn on Marr’s Sunday morning show. Corbyn corrected Marr, pointing out that the global financial crisis was the direct consequence of irresponsible speculation of the US mortgage market by several US financial bodies, which collapsed as a result, and not the Labour government of the time. Marr, visibly irritated at being corrected in this way, responded with: “It doesn’t matter who caused the global financial crisis.” A remarkable response from someone claiming to be both a journalist and a historian.Dr Robert SmithHigh Littleton, Somerset • If there has been scepticism about BBC reporting here in Scotland, it’s as much to do with Nick Robinson’s infamous questioning of Alex Salmond in the run-up to the independence referendum as anything else. (Type “Alex Salmond Nick Robinson” in YouTube for evidence). If Robinson were ever to apologise for his own fake news we might take his views on the lack of trust in mainstream media more seriously.John WarburtonEdinburgh • Silencing the “disagreeable” alternative media sites identified by Nick Robinson is a strange example of the BBC’s description of its impartiality and neutrality. Mr Robinson names seven social media “attackers” of mainstream media consisting of one anti-right, four leftwing, one pro-remain, and one far-right source. All, admittedly, anti-establishment, resulting in a full-time score of a 5-1 win to the left and one draw (52-48). Balanced reporting seems to have a problem defining “disagreeable” with such a resounding win to the left.David John JonesSwansea  • Nick Robinson makes a stout defence of BBC News’s independence. The fact that he needs to do so speaks volumes, especially at a time when activists on the right and left think it’s acceptable to threaten reporters like Laura Kuenssberg, implicitly or otherwise. Although I’m often infuriated by it, I don’t think the BBC is biased. The problem seems to me to be a structural one. The BBC’s importance in explaining complex subjects is constrained by the time allocated to the main news at 6pm and 10pm. Difficult subjects get snippets without time to provide context. Political and business reporters show little understanding of economics so are unable to explain that, for example, the monthly figures they have just enthused over have a wider context that is less positive. Reporters seem reluctant to challenge politicians who are lying to us, and calling out their utterances for what they are. The population generally doesn’t stay up for Newsnight or tune in to Today. Where are we to get a proper explanation of serious subjects on the BBC? Thank goodness for Channel 4 but its audience reach isn’t great. As Robinson notes, alternative media sites are providing affirmative material for supporters of their individual causes. The responsibility on BBC News to inform and explain could not be more urgent. It has some serious thinking to do. Bob NicholsonFrodsham, Cheshire  • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters"
"George Monbiot’s fear of the few remaining British farmers (Goodbye – and good riddance – to livestock farming, 4 October) reached new levels when he wrote that the “rich mosaic of rainforest and other habitats that once covered our hills has been erased” and blamed us for the tectonic drift that moved Britain from the equator towards the Arctic, perhaps 300m years ago. In the rest of his article he mixed unrelated science from all over the globe with the peculiar claims of noted eccentrics, and suggested that we should plough unsuitable land to grow soya, which will not grow in this climate, to produce artificial meat in urban factories. He didn’t mention inconvenient features of the British ruminant livestock industry, such as the fact that most feed that animals get other than grass is made up of byproducts of the human food industry such as brewers’ grains, sugar beet and fruit-juice pulp, most of which would have to go to landfill if cows and sheep did not recycle it. Without the income from this form of recycling, the price of food in the shop would increase. We do need to moderate excessive meat consumption, and we do need to act on climate change, but this article sows confusion that will delay necessary change.Huw JonesSt Clears, Carmarthenshire • Livestock has long formed part of the warp and weft of our countryside, and the issue of its potent role in greenhouse gas emissions and other forms of pollution cannot be ducked. Compared to other sectors, farming has done poorly. Emissions have risen since 2010, despite the increasing urgency to act. That does not mean that we should get rid of all livestock. The issues are complex. Even the Food Climate Research Network, cited by George Monbiot, concludes that grazing livestock has a limited place in a sustainable food system. For us, this limited place means people in the UK should eat less but better-quality animal produce, whether dairy, eggs or meat. It also requires eating many more plants and challenging rising demand for animal-based proteins. The challenge for the farming sector is to make the shift to more sustainable and resilient systems, much less dependent on fossil fuels and set up to support a healthier population. We know this is possible because some farmers are doing this already, and very successfully too.Graeme WillisFood and farming campaigner, Campaign to Protect Rural England • On this occasion George Monbiot’s evangelical zeal obscures some fundamental practicalities. First, much grazing land is simply unsuitable for growing crops. For example, an organic farmer friend on Dartmoor tells me his land will successfully grow only grass. He farms organically and the manure allows insects to flourish, encouraging a high number and variety of farmland birds. Many arable farms, with their vast acres of monoculture, are often deserts where wildlife is concerned. Second, the implication that livestock farming is cruel is unfair and insulting. Like many farmers, my friend cares greatly about both the natural environment and the welfare of his animals. Third, would rewilding always be such a good idea? It would most likely produce impenetrable scrubland. We have a profound love of our farmed landscape, shaped in large measure by livestock grazing. Surely few of the 99% who are not vegans would consider veganism a price worth paying for its destruction. In any case, replacing meat with vegetables is a second-order priority beside the existential issues of population growth and global warming. And, yes, I am a meat-eater and the vast majority of people are firmly of the opinion that the tastiest dishes are those based on meat.David ThomasHereford • Our dependence on meat is mirrored by the Vikings who colonised Greenland during the Middle Ages. Although fish was readily available, they continued to raise cattle as this conferred social status. When the climate turned colder they perished. By contrast, the inhabitants of Tikopia, a small Pacific island, abandoned pig-rearing in the 17th century as they were rooting up vegetables and competing for food. This may be the only example of a society voluntarily abandoning meat consumption, and it allowed the Tikopians to maintain a population of 400 inhabitants per square mile without any recourse to modern agricultural technology. The question posed in my book The Gilgamesh Gene is whether humanity is behaving like the Vikings or the Tikopians.Dr Robin Russell-JonesStoke Poges, Buckinghamshire • This is another stimulating article, but I wonder why George Monbiot does not make the point that the essential reason for not eating animal products is that the breeding, rearing and killing of sentient and intelligent animals is cruel and brutal, and unnecessary for human beings to survive and thrive. Of course, the supplementary point that the evidence shows that it is also potentially damaging to the future wellbeing of humanity is also relevant, but it is not the essential reason for avoiding animal products.Roger GibbsLoughton, Essex • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters"
"Back in February, the conservative UK tabloid Mail on Sunday ran an error-riddled piece by David Rose attacking Noaa climate scientists, who had published data and a paper showing that there was never a global warming pause. The attack was based on an interview with former Noaa scientist John Bates, who subsequently admitted about his comments: I knew people would misuse this. But you can’t control other people.  The UK press regulator, the Independent Press Standards Organization (Ipso) has now upheld a complaint submitted by Bob Ward of the London School of Economics. Ipso ruled that the Mail piece “failed to take care over the accuracy of the article” and “had then failed to correct these significantly misleading statements,” and the Mail was required to publish the Ipso adjudication. Essentially, Bates had expressed displeasure in the way the data from a Noaa paper had been archived at the organization. Rose and the Mail blew this minor complaint into the sensationalist claim that “world leaders were duped into investing billions over manipulated global warming data.” It would be hard to find a better example of fake news than this one. The piece included a grossly misleading chart that Nasa Goddard Institute for Space Studies director Gavin Schmidt described as a “hilarious screw up”: Hilarious screw up by @DavidRoseUK and #FailOnSunday 1st picture is 'evidence' of misconduct, 2nd shows diff when baselines are correct. pic.twitter.com/R5VsqqlNHr In fact, the Noaa data and paper in question had already been independently verified by other researchers, and are in close agreement with global temperature data from other scientific groups: NEW | Factcheck: Mail on Sunday’s ‘astonishing evidence’ about global temperature rise | Guest post by @hausfath https://t.co/e7gGNGxIKc pic.twitter.com/BruRecUo34 And of course the paper itself had undergone rigorous peer-review prior to its publication in one of the world’s most highly-regarded scientific journals, Science. All signs pointed to the Noaa data and paper being based on sound science that had been reproduced and verified. But that didn’t fit the preferred denialist narrative of Rose and the Mail on Sunday, so they weaved a conspiracy theory that then reverberated through the right-wing media echo chamber. Rose’s story seemed to have all the climate denial components that biased conservative media outlets crave. A lone wolf scientist whistleblowing his former colleagues with accusations of data manipulation for political purposes? Despite the glaring errors in the story that were immediately called out by climate scientists and reputable science journalists, this narrative proved irresistible to the conservative media: Breitbart, Fox News, Drudge Report, Rush Limbaugh, The Daily Caller, The Washington Times, and more ran with Rose’s story. Meanwhile, legitimate news outlets like The Guardian, The Washington Post, Carbon Brief, E&E News, Ars Technica, Science Insider, RealClimate, and numerous other science blogs quickly debunked Rose’s falsehoods. The errors really aren’t surprising. Rose and the Mail have a long history of climate denial, including error-riddled stories on Arctic sea ice, Antarctic sea ice, human-caused global warming, even the very existence of global warming. And the Mail has such a long history of inaccuracies in general that Wikipedia editors consider it an unreliable source and banned its use. But Breitbart, Fox News, Rush Limbaugh, and other right-wing media outlets have no qualms with publishing inaccuracies from unreliable sources, as long as the story advances their climate denial agenda. Lamar Smith (R-TX), the chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, has been attacking the Noaa scientists since they published their ‘pausebuster’ paper in 2015. Rose’s piece was almost perfectly timed for one of Smith’s frequent anti-climate science congressional hearings just two days later, but alas, by then reputable journalists had already soundly debunked the story. Smith could only plead with attendees to believe that the story “may be more serious than you think.” As Ipso has verified, it wasn’t. That Smith still tried to exploit the story, that it reverberated throughout the right-wing media echo chamber, and that the Mail published it in the first place tells us a lot about the narrative this group wants to push. The motivation is right there in the Mail’s headline – “world leaders were duped into investing billions.” The scientific evidence is crystal clear that human-caused global warming is very dangerous. People who want to maintain the status quo that favors fossil fuel companies, who oppose climate policies that disrupt that status quo, need to somehow discredit that reality. They can’t argue the science, about which there’s a 97% expert consensus, so they instead attack the scientists themselves. They accuse these scientists – who have devoted their careers to bettering our understanding of the workings of Earth’s climate – of fraud, conspiracy, and manipulating data for nefarious purposes. Their goal is to manufacture doubt. Usually they get away with it. This time the Mail on Sunday’s “significantly misleading statements” were so bad that they were censured, though not before they had misinformed millions of people. However, the Ipso ruling tells us which media outlets are reliable sources on the subject of climate change. Those that blindly echoed David Rose’s misinformation are not; those that debunked the Mail on Sunday’s distortions are."
"Last week, Nature Geoscience published a study suggesting that we have a bigger remaining carbon budget than previously thought to keep global warming below the 1.5°C aggressive Paris climate target. Many scientists quickly commented that the paper’s conclusion was based on some questionable assumptions, and this single study shouldn’t be blindly accepted as gospel truth. Conservative media outlets did even worse than that. They took one part of the paper’s analysis out of context and grossly distorted its conclusions to advance their anti-climate agenda. The study used the UK Met Office and Hadley Centre’s HadCRUT4 global temperature data set to conclude that so far we’ve warmed 0.93°C from the mid-1800s to 2015, compared to the Paris target of 1.5°C above pre-industrial temperatures. Several climate scientists immediately noted a problem here – HadCRUT4 excludes the Arctic region, which is the fastest-warming part of the planet. Hence it’s one of the least globally-representative temperature datasets. According to more globally-complete data sets like Berkeley Earth, the warming we’ve seen is closer to 1.1°C.  Headline claim from carbon budget paper that warming is 0.9ºC from pre-I is unsupported. Using globally complete estimates ~1.2ºC (in 2015) pic.twitter.com/B4iImGzeDE Defining “pre-industrial temperatures” is another issue. Humans caused some global warming prior to the mid-1800s; as one recent study showed, as much as 0.2°C. A third problem discussed by climate scientists Stefan Rahmstorf at RealClimate involves the way the study authors defined the budget itself. They looked at how much carbon will be emitted at the time we reach 1.5°C warming, but because of what’s known as the ‘thermal inertia’ of the oceans, and because sunlight-reflecting pollutants will fall out of the atmosphere as we shift away from dirty coal power, the planet will keep warming after that time. If we take all these factors together, depending on how we decide to define “pre-industrial” in the Paris target, we may in fact already be committed to 1.5°C warming, and the headline conclusion that “the 1.5C warming limit is not yet a geophysical impossibility” may be incorrect. But ultimately that’s a relatively unimportant point. Even if limiting global warming to 1.5°C is still technically feasible, it will take immense global action to achieve it. If it’s infeasible, we still need immense global action to try and stay below 2°C, or 2.5°C, or to slow global warming as much as possible to avoid catastrophic consequences.  From a real-world policy perspective, we need all hands on deck whether the conclusions of this paper are right or wrong. Of course, many conservatives who want to maintain the status quo object to that reality. As we saw with the recent Ipso ruling, many right-wing media outlets will jump at any opportunity to misrepresent climate research in order to advance the climate denial agenda.  Unfortunately, Ben Webster of the London Times appears to have misunderstood co-author Myles Allen’s explanation of their study, and quoted him as saying: We haven’t seen that rapid acceleration in warming after 2000 that we see in the models. We haven’t seen that in the observations. Many climate scientists immediately pointed out this assertion is false. The UK Met Office noted, “The observations lie comfortably within the modelled range.” Claim of a substantial gap between model projections for global temperature & observations is not true (updated with 2017 estimate): pic.twitter.com/YHzzXtbhs9 The Daily Mail (reliable only for its unreliable climate reporting) subsequently claimed that the paper showed climate models had overestimated temperatures by ‘at least’ 0.3°C, and quoted Allen calling this “a big deal,” although the context of that quote was conveniently omitted. In a subsequent fact check at Carbon Brief, Zeke Hausfather detailed the many misunderstandings that led to this false conclusion. As fellow study co-author Piers Forster told Carbon Brief: I think some press reporting is misleading as our paper did not assess climate impacts or climate model performance. Rather, our paper confirms the need for much increased urgent action from around the world if society stands a chance of limiting warming to 1.5C. Myles Allen and study lead author Richard Millar took to The Guardian to criticize the conservative media outlets that had misrepresented their research. I spoke to Allen, who clarified that he was trying to explain that temperatures didn’t seem to be responding to carbon emissions as fast as the models used in the last IPCC report anticipated. Except the reasons for that have already been identified - the actual global energy imbalance hasn’t been as large as in the scenarios input into the climate models, and we have to compare apples-to-apples temperatures. As Allen and Millar wrote in The Guardian: the IPCC specifically assessed that temperatures in the 2020s would be 0.9-1.3C warmer than pre-industrial, the lower end of which is already looking conservative. Anyone who had troubled to read our paper would have found this “IPCC AR5 Ch11 projection” helpfully labelled on two of our figures, and clearly consistent with our new results. It appears that Ben Webster didn’t understand Allen’s explanation, and Allen was perhaps a bit careless with some of his words. As a result, Webster quoted Allen saying the models were running too hot. Conservative ‘journalists’ and opinion writers saw that seemingly juicy quote and without speaking to Allen or any other climate scientists, ran with it, completely distorting the actual findings of the paper in the process. It’s been clear for years that conservative media outlets thrive on any comments from climate scientists that can be construed as supporting climate denial myths (model reliability being among the most popular myths). It’s unfortunate that climate scientists have to be so careful about what they say, but that’s the reality we live in. Biased conservative media outlets aren’t interested in accurately reporting scientific findings; they’re interested in advancing the climate denial agenda of manufacturing doubt in order to erode public support for climate policies. And so the grossly misleading ‘alarmist scientists admit they were wrong’ story was echoed by Breitbart, the Daily Mail, the Sun, the Herald Sun, Fox News, the Daily Caller, and many more. The primary conclusion of the study was that if the international community acts extremely aggressively to cut carbon pollution, it might still be possible to meet the Paris 1.5°C target. That conclusion may or may not be true, but if we listen to the conservative media and continue on our current path, there’s no chance we’ll stay below 1.5 or 2°C. Even with the current international climate pledges we’re on a path toward 3°C or more global warming.  While it’s nice to know if the most hopeful targets are still a geophysical possibility, we need much more aggressive climate policies if they’re to become a practical and political possibility. And biased media outlets will always happily distort the science in order to obstruct those policies."
"We live in frightening times. From heads of state tweeting threats of nuclear annihilation, to whole regions rocked by climate chaos, to thousands of migrants drowning off the coasts of Europe, to openly racist parties gaining ground: it feels like there are a lot of reasons to be pessimistic about our collective future. To take one example, the Caribbean and southern United States are in the midst of an unprecedented hurricane season, pounded by storm after storm. Puerto Rico – hit by Irma, then Maria – is entirely without power and could be for months, its water and communication systems severely compromised. But just as during Hurricane Katrina, the cavalry is missing in action. Donald Trump is too busy trying to get black athletes fired for daring to shine a spotlight on racist violence. A real federal aid package for Puerto Rico has not yet been announced. And the vultures are circling: the business press reports that the only way for Puerto Rico to get the lights back on is to sell off its electricity utility.  This is a phenomenon I’ve called the Shock Doctrine: the exploitation of wrenching crises to smuggle through policies that devour the public sphere and further enrich a small elite. We’ve seen this dismal cycle repeat again and again: after the 2008 financial crash, and now in the UK with the Tories planning to exploit Brexit to push through disastrous pro-corporate trade deals without debate. Ours is an age when it is impossible to pry one crisis apart from all the others. They have all merged, reinforcing and deepening each other like one shambling, multi-headed beast. The current US president can be thought of in much the same way. ,It’s tough to adequately sum him up. You know that horrible thing currently clogging up the London sewers, the fatberg? Trump is the political equivalent of that. A merger of all that is noxious in the culture, economy and body politic, all kind of glommed together in a self-adhesive mass. And we’re finding it very hard to dislodge. But moments of crisis do not have to go the Shock Doctrine route: they do not need to become opportunities for the obscenely wealthy to grab still more. They can be moments when we find our best selves. We all witnessed this in the aftermath of the catastrophic fire at Grenfell Tower. When the people responsible were missing in action, the community came together, held one another in their care, organised donations and advocated for the living – and for the dead. And they are doing it still, more than 100 days after the fire – with, scandalously, only a handful of survivors rehoused. It’s not only at the grassroots level: there is a long and proud history of crises sparking progressive transformation on a societal scale. Think of the victories won by working people for social housing in the wake of the first world war, or for the NHS after the horrors of the second world war. This should remind us that moments of great crisis and peril do not need to knock us backwards: they can also catapult us forward. But these transformative victories are never won by simply resisting, or saying no to the latest outrage. To win in a moment of true crisis, we also need a bold and forward-looking yes: a plan for how to rebuild and respond to the underlying causes. And that plan needs to be convincing, credible and, most of all, captivating. We have to help a weary and wary public to imagine itself into that better world. In recent months the Labour party has showed us there’s another way. One that speaks the language of decency and fairness, that names the true forces most responsible for this mess, no matter how powerful. And one that is unafraid of some of the ideas we were told were gone for good, such as wealth redistribution, and nationalising essential public services. Thanks to Labour’s boldness, we now know that this isn’t just a moral strategy. It’s a winning strategy. It fires up the base, and it activates constituencies that long ago stopped voting altogether. The last election also showed us something else: that political parties don’t need to fear the creativity and independence of social movements – and social movements have a huge amount to gain from engaging with electoral politics. That’s a very big deal, because political parties tend to be a bit freakish about control, and real grassroots movements cherish their independence. But the relationship between Labour and Momentum shows it is possible to combine the best of both worlds and create a force both stronger and more nimble than anything that parties or movements can pull off on their own. What happened here in Britain is part of a global phenomenon. We saw it in Bernie Sanders’ historic campaign in the US primaries, powered by millennials who know that safe centrist politics offers them no kind of safe future. We see something similar with Spain’s still young Podemos party, which built in the power of mass movements from day one. These electoral campaigns caught fire with stunning speed. And they got close to taking power – closer than any other genuinely transformative political programme has in Europe or North America in my lifetime. But not close enough. So in this time between elections, we need to think about how to make absolutely sure that, next time, all of our movements go all the way. In all of our countries, we can and must do more to connect the dots between economic injustice, racial injustice and gender injustice. We need to draw out the connections between the gig economy – which treats human beings like a raw resource from which to extract wealth and then discard – and the dig economy, in which extractive companies treat the Earth in precisely the same careless way. And let’s show exactly how we can move from that gig and dig economy to a society based on principles of care – caring for the planet and for one another. A society where the work of our caregivers, and of our land and water protectors, is respected and valued. A world where no one and nowhere is thrown away – whether in firetrap housing estates, or on hurricane-ravaged islands. Battling climate change is a once-in-a-century chance to build a fairer and more democratic economy. We can and must design a system in which the polluters pay a very large share of the cost of transitioning away from fossil fuels. And in wealthy countries such as Britain and the US, we need migration policies and levels of international financing that reflect what we owe to the global south, given our historic role in destabilising the economies and ecologies of poorer nations for a great many years, and the vast wealth of empire extracted from these societies in bonded human flesh. The more ambitious, consistent and holistic that the Labour party can be in painting a picture of the world transformed, the more credible a Labour government will become. Around the world, winning is a moral imperative for the left. The stakes are too high, and time is too short, to settle for anything less. • Naomi Klein is the author of The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism.

"As the metaphorical canary in the global warming coalmine goes, the planet’s coral reefs are hard to beat.  Swathes of corals in all tropical basins have been hit by the longest mass bleaching event yet recorded that kicked off in 2014 and ended, at least officially, in June.   Fossil fuel burning is firmly linked to rising ocean temperatures that push the corals into a stress reaction – they expel the special algae that give them their colour and most of their nutrients. It’s not certain death, but it can take five to 10 years for even the fastest growing coral species to fully recover. On Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, one research group found the abnormally hot conditions that caused corals to bleach in 2016 were 175 times more likely under today’s climate than one that hadn’t been loaded with extra carbon dioxide.  In 2016 about 30% of all corals on the reef died. In 2017 James Cook University’s Prof Terry Hughes estimates another 19% died.  And all this as global warming reaches just 1C. What happens to coral reefs at 1.5C of warming – the target set by the United Nations Paris climate agreement? Or higher? It’s under this stark reality that a group of 18 mainly Australian scientists and reef managers, including those in government agencies, have waded in with a controversial proposal in an article in the science journal Nature Ecology and Evolution.  Existing conservation approaches, such as improving water quality around reefs and imposing restrictions or bans on fishing, are not working, the article says.  Instead, the scientists argue: “New and potentially riskier interventions must be implemented alongside conventional management efforts and strong action to curb global warming.”  Those interventions include “assisted evolution” – a suite of techniques that have been commonly used in commercial settings (think of selective breeding in plants and livestock as one example) but are now being considered as a way to develop coral species that have better tolerance of the heat extremes that reefs are increasingly facing.  Another idea is known as “assisted gene flow” – and involves essentially moving coral larvae or corals that can cope with higher temperatures into areas where current coral species are dying.  Much further down the track, the authors also suggest developments in synthetic biology where beneficial genes are either created or selected from the same species.  Across all these methods, the authors write there are multiple issues, some ethical and some practical, that need to be much better understood. But the time to start is now.  For example, physically moving coral species could see dangerous pathogens hitching a ride. Or, once in place, transplanted coral could simply die because of a lack of adaptation to local conditions. How do you select which species to “save” and which ones to discard? With those decisions, also come knock-on effects of the multiple marine species that rely on those coral habitats.  How would the public react to an “artificial reef” or the inevitable claims that scientists are playing God?  It could all get very messy and very costly. Several leading scientists I’ve spoken to say a key danger in advocating technological fixes is that it could be an excuse to ignore what everyone agrees is the main game – cutting greenhouse gas emissions as quickly as possibly. The lead author of the new article is Dr Ken Anthony, a principal research scientist at the Australian government’s Australian Institute of Marine Science. Anthony accepted that some in the science community could see the pursuit of unconventional methods as a tacit admission of defeat on the emissions front.  “But we need a philosophy where we don’t just give up,” he told me. “We do need two balls in play. We need to fix climate change and the more we can mitigate carbon, the better the chances that these things will work. It is not an either, or, situation. “But we agree it’s controversial to talk about this … We have to start looking at the reef in an objective way. How can we protect habitats that protect species?” James Cook University’s Prof Terry Hughes, a director of the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies and also the convenor of the national coral bleaching taskforce, is deeply skeptical about the viability of many of the proposed techniques. In particular, whether corals are developed in laboratories or are physically transferred from one location to another, the physical placement of corals on reef structures is “extremely expensive”.  He said: “I actually see this problem we are now facing – with back-to-back bleaching events on the Great Barrier Reef killing about half the corals – that this is more a governance problem. What’s broken is not so much the corals – they don’t need fixing – but the legal frameworks, the politics and the institutions.  “We need to find solutions, but I don’t think growing corals is part of that. I think it’s about changing people’s attitudes and behaviours and getting carbon dioxide emissions down by transitioning away from fossil fuels as quickly as possible. Without that, nothing else really works.” On this point, AIMS’s Anthony is in agreement. “The better outcome we get in terms of carbon mitigation, the better chance we stand with conventional and these new interventions,” he says. “I can’t imagine having success where you don’t have both. As I said, you have to have two balls in play and if you drop either of them, then it could be game over.” Dr Mark Eakin, coordinator of Coral Reef Watch at the US government’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, thought it was “responsible and necessary” to have open discussions about alternative strategies. “Corals and coral reefs are now at a critical juncture,” he told me by email. “Conventional conservation measures alone are no longer enough. We need to be looking at all of the tools in our toolboxes.”  But critically, Eakin added: “The biggest danger of moving in this direction is the potential that some will see this as being a way to engineer our way out of the problem — using it as an excuse to not act on the rising CO2 that is the ultimate cause of the problem.” Prof Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, a leading marine biologist and director of the University of Queensland’s global change institute, is a pioneer in coral bleaching research.  He told me there was a “movement sweeping the coral research community” in response to the massive and unprecedented bleaching at reefs around the world. “The pace of environmental change is outstripping the natural ability of corals to keep up, and people are now operating under the terms that everything should be on the table. That’s reasonable.”  But he said each time the media reported on new technological fixes, there was a ripple effect among politicians looking for a way out.  “A solution might look good on paper and yes, you can grow heat-resistant corals in a lab, but nobody wants to talk about the economics. Once you scale these things up, they can become very expensive.” One study looking at marine restoration projects found coral reefs were the most expensive to restore, with costs as high as $1.8m per hectare (the entire Great Barrier Reef covers about 35m hectares).  Hoegh-Guldberg offered up a “back of the envelope” calculation on costs. The Great Barrier Reef is 40,000 sq km. If you were to grow a coral in a lab and transplant it every five metres at $5 each time, then this gives a cost of about $40bn, “and that’s just for one single species,” he says. Scale this up globally, and he says you easily get to costs in the trillions of dollars.  “We are in a desperate situation and we need to try all sorts of things because you don’t know what might work,” he says.  “But on the other hand, you can get distracted from the main game. The only economic way to deal with this issue is to reduce emissions and take up renewable energies at a furious rate,” he says. “Clearly we have to think outside the box, but let’s not pretend the core issue is not reducing emissions. For coral reefs, it’s really the Paris agreement and 1.5C … or bust.”"
"EasyJet could be flying planes powered by batteries rather than petroleum to destinations including Paris and Amsterdam within a decade. The UK carrier has formed a partnership with US firm Wright Electric, which is developing a battery-propelled aircraft for flights under two hours.  EasyJet said the move would enable battery-powered aircraft to travel short-haul routes such as London to Paris and Amsterdam, and Edinburgh to Bristol. Wright Electric is aiming for an aircraft range of 335 miles, which would cover the journeys of about a fifth of passengers flown by easyJet. Carolyn McCall, easyJet’s chief executive, said the aerospace industry would follow the lead of the automotive industry in developing electric engines that would cut emissions and noise. “For the first time in my career I can envisage a future without jet fuel and we are excited to be part of it,” she said. “It is now more a matter of when, not if, a short-haul electric plane will fly.”  The airline said it was the next step in making the airline less harmful for the environment, after cutting carbon emissions per passenger kilometre by 31% between 2000 and 2016. Wright Electric claims that electric planes will be 50% quieter and 10% cheaper for airlines to buy and operate, with the cost saving potentially passed on to passengers. The US firm said its goal was for every short flight to be electric within 20 years. It has already built a two-seater prototype and is working towards a fully electric plane within a decade. The next step is to scale-up the technology to a 10-seater aircraft, and eventually to build a single aisle, short haul commercial plane, with the capacity to carry at least 120 passengers. Wright Electric was founded in 2016 by a team of aerospace engineers, powertrain experts, and battery chemists, with a background in organisations including Nasa, Boeing, and Cessna. Jeffrey Engler, chief executive and founder of Wright Electric, said the startup firm’s partnership with easyJet was “a powerful validation” of its work. “Their insights have been invaluable as we look to commercialise our electric aircraft for the large and growing short-haul flight markets,” he added. EasyJet’s chief commercial officer, Peter Duffy, said the partnership would help Wright Electric understand what was required to make the planes commercially successful, looking at factors such as maintenance and revenue management. “You’re seeing cities and countries starting to talk about banning diesel combustion engines. That would have been unthinkable just a short time ago,” Duffy said. “As technology moves on, attitudes shift, ambitions change and you see opportunities you didn’t see. This is genuinely exciting.” "
"Big as the blow was to Theresa May at the general election in June, worse has followed. Not only was the election an unnecessary fight for Mrs May to have picked, she has emerged a diminished figure. Her cabinet is united – but mainly in their desire to succeed her. On the day of Mrs May’s big speech at the Conservative party conference this week, everything that could go wrong, did. Then Grant Shapps, a former party chairman who once led a double life as a “multimillionaire” web guru, was unmasked as a parliamentary general aiming to topple Mrs May for her shortcomings. Despite boasting the backing of 30 MPs, none of Mr Shapps’ troops were prepared to follow their commanding officer over the top. Mrs May is hurt and the consensus is that she will stagger on. But the crisis in the Conservative party is here to stay: a toxic brew of personal ambition, ideological visions and electoral panic. This at a time when Britain’s productive forces are stagnating and the biggest foreign policy issue of our times – leaving the European Union – is met with the political posturing of a clown wearing the mask of a roaring lion. The Conservative party was once steeped in pragmatism, dominated by the wish to win elections and to be in power. There always were differences of opinion. These differences in dispositions have now curdled into doctrinal differences.  The Brexit vote has helped widen gulfs in the party, intensifying the cultural nationalism on the right of the party. This group, who since the days of John Major have put forward anti-EU arguments with a burning passion, repelled the electorate to such an extent that the Tories could not win a majority for more than two decades. The bad news for Mrs May is that they are back. The result is that the Tories lost their parliamentary advantage this year. Yet those who profess this anti-European nationalist creed are feted in the current Tory party. It was their speakers who drew the crowds and cheers at conference, not the cabinet’s. That Mrs May relies on the votes of the anti-gay, anti-abortion climate-change deniers of the evangelical Democratic Unionist party to carry her through will mean MPs on the cultural nationalist right will be emboldened. It speaks volumes about the mess the party is in that Jacob Rees-Mogg, the MP for the last century, who is against gay marriage and anti-abortion on the grounds of his faith, is such a star. Young people, having grown up in a culturally permissive era, are not aroused by the holy anger of the right. They are moved by issues such as climate change and education, where an egalitarian view of humankind prevails. Conservatives have in the past been able to accept social change and adapt to it. They have anticipated society’s needs and changed their policies to meet them. Now the party’s anti-Europeanism means they risk losing a section of voters for ever. The Conservatives have also long been deaf to issues affecting the under-40s. Not only are these voters seeing their wages squeezed, they are unable to save for homes and pensions while the prices race away. Mrs May will find it difficult to sell capitalism to those with no capital. The last election threw into sharp relief the cracks in the Tory party’s support. Its voters are dying off faster than it can win over new ones. That is why Mrs May has accepted that there is a cost-of-living crisis and lifted policies from Ed Miliband, a man once derided as Marxist. The Tory leadership seems to think it does not require new ideas. It is content to make do with old ones. Mrs May needed to bring her party’s thinking in line with an environment it does not like. Replacing the leader will only work if the party understands that it needs to change too."
"A team of scientists is planning an expedition to examine the marine ecosystem revealed when an enormous iceberg broke off the Larsen C ice shelf earlier this year. In July, the iceberg known as A68 broke off the shelf, leaving the area at its lowest recorded extent. Researchers are now hoping the event may lead to novel revelations from their investigations of the area opened up, which had been hidden under ice for up to 120,000 years.   Scientists from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) will embark on the research ship RRS James Clark Ross in February 2018 to take the first look at the newly exposed ecosystems under the ice – if the conditions work in their favour. “You can never predict the ice,” said mission leader Dr Katrin Linse. “There are still several hundred kilometres covered in sea ice which has to move and melt. Fortunately this often happens now during the Antarctic summer, so that is why we are hopeful for February.”  If everything works out, the scientists will have the chance to look at 5,800 sq km of sea floor that had been shielded for tens of thousands of years. Planning for such expeditions normally takes several years, but urgent funding schemes are available during such unpredictable natural events, like the volcanic activity over Iceland in 2010. It is not the first time that scientists have been given the chance to take a look at these hidden marine worlds. After a similar iceberg broke off from the Larsen B shelf in 2002, a team of scientists set out to Antarctica, although it took much longer to get there.  Prof Dr Julian Gutt, a marine ecologist at the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven, Germany, was the first to lead a vessel to the area. He said: “We went to the area five years after it broke off. We had to try and learn what lived under the ice shelf when it still existed, so were never absolutely sure if our interpretation was correct.” This presents a unique opportunity for the BAS team: “The Larsen C break-off is recent, so if the British scientists are successful – under the difficult conditions they are facing – they could really encounter a pristine situation,” says Gutt. The BAS team expect to find organisms resembling those in deep-sea environments because of the areas’ similar conditions: a lack of nutrients, sunlight and wind.  A short timespan between the breakoff and research is crucial, says Linse.  “What Julian Gutt’s team found there five years after were already pioneer species, which slowly colonise the area. When we go this February, organisms will not have had enough time to settle down and adapt to their new environment,” she said.  The final decision on whether the project goes ahead will be made at the end of the year."
"The world’s tropical forests are so degraded they have become a source rather than a sink of carbon emissions, according to a new study that highlights the urgent need to protect and restore the Amazon and similar regions. Researchers found that forest areas in South America, Africa and Asia – which have until recently played a key role in absorbing greenhouse gases – are now releasing 425 teragrams of carbon annually, which is more than all the traffic in the United States.  This is a far greater loss than previously thought and carries extra force because the data emerges from the most detailed examination of the topic ever undertaken. The authors say their findings – published in the journal Science on Thursday – should galvanise policymakers to take remedial action. “This shows that we can’t just sit back. The forest is not doing what we thought it was doing,” said Alessandro Baccini, who is one of the leader authors of the research team from Woods Hole Research Center and Boston University. “As always, trees are removing carbon from the atmosphere, but the volume of the forest is no longer enough to compensate for the losses. The region is not a sink any more.” The study went further than any of its predecessors in measuring the impact of disturbance and degradation – the thinning of tree density and the culling of biodiversity below an apparently protected canopy – usually as a result of selective logging, fire, drought and hunting. This can reduce biomass by up to 75%. But it is more difficult for satellites to monitor than deforestation (the total clearance of foliage) because, when viewed from above, the canopy appears uninterrupted despite the depletion underneath. To get more accurate data, scientists combined 12 years of satellite data with field studies. They found a net carbon loss on every continent. Latin America – home to the Amazon, the world’s biggest forest – accounted for nearly 60% of the emissions, while 24% came from Africa and 16% from Asia. Overall, more carbon was lost to degradation and disturbance than deforestation. The researchers stressed this was an opportunity as well as a concern because it was now possible to identify which areas are being affected and to restore forests before they disappeared completely. “Prior to this we knew degradation was a problem but we didn’t know where or how much,” said Wayne Walker, another of the lead authors. “It’s easier to address the problem when there is still some of the forest left standing.” The priority is to protect pristine forests with high carbon density. The most effective way of doing this, he said, was to support land rights for indigenous people. “Those living in the forest can make a difference,” Walker said. Unfortunately, many governments whose territories are home to tropical forests are moving in the opposite direction. In Brazil and Colombia, for example, deforestation has accelerated rapidly in the past year. “When I look at these numbers and the map of where the changes are occurring, it’s shocking,” said Baccini, who has a two-year-old son. “My child may not see many of the forests. At this rate of change, they will not be there.” But he said the numbers should be a driver for action. “We need to be positive. Let’s turn tropical forests back into a sink. We need to restore degraded areas” he said. “As far as technology for reducing carbon is concerned, this is low-hanging fruit. We know how to protect and sustain forests. It’s relatively cost effective”"
"The world’s oceans are at last receiving the attention they deserve, as the scale of plastic pollution is finally becoming clear, the Prince of Wales has said, hailing this growing awareness as the first step to saving the marine environment. Prince Charles said it had taken years for the enormity of the problem to emerge, but promised to make it a key priority of his campaigning, alongside rainforests.   But he also confessed to mounting despair over how little has been achieved in his four decades of environmental campaigning, fearing we are “no longer a rational civilisation” but are driven by economic ideology. He pointedly chose not to mention President Trump, who has denied climate change, but warned: “If the unprecedented ferocity of recent catastrophic hurricanes is not the supreme wake-up call that it needs to be, to address the vast and accumulating threat of climate change and ocean warming, then we – let alone the global insurance and financial sectors – can surely no longer consider ourselves part of a rational, sensible civilisation.” He blamed “some strange, ideological urge to test the world to destruction”. The prince, who has long been a campaigner on rainforests, told a marine conference that oceans were now a twin passion for him. “While we should be relieved that the health of the ocean is now understood, alongside rainforests, to be one of the essential prerequisites for our physical and economic survival, I wonder if the ocean’s fragility is yet truly grasped and how susceptible it is to the impacts of our economic activities … We must never mistake [the oceans] for a new frontier for endless economic exploitation.” At the Our Ocean conference, the EU also announced plans to devote more than €550m to protecting the health of oceans, with more than 30 initiatives including efforts to combat piracy and illegal fishing, a satellite monitoring system, and a new plastics strategy for the bloc. Federica Mogherini, the EU’s high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, said: “The sea is a global common. We all have a responsibility to preserve it as a treasure and avoid that it turns into a threat. The EU believes that a globalised world needs a more cooperative global governance. It is impossible to imagine global governance without a cooperative oceans governance.” Mogherini hoped that other countries would come forward with funding to bring the total to more than €1bn. Karmenu Vella, the Maltese EU environment commissioner, said: “The EU has been a driving force behind the truly global effort [to protect marine life]. We have EU commitments on ocean governance, illegal fishing and the Arctic.” One new EU initiative is to establish the first marine-protected area in the Adriatic. About 90% of fish stocks in the Mediterranean are currently over-exploited. Another initiative announced at the conference to reduce the impact of plastic pollution was the consumer goods group Procter and Gamble’s plan to produce a new Fairy Liquid bottle made entirely of recycled plastic, including some retrieved from the ocean. Sky announced it would remove all single-use plastic products from its operations and supply chains by 2020. The company will also invest £25m in a fund for startups and other businesses working on technology to solve the plastic problem. In the Pacific, the small island of Niue, with the help of National Geographic and the UN development programme, is creating a marine-protected area covering approximately 127,000 sq km, more than 40% of its sea area. The island, a self-governing community in free association with New Zealand, is one of the world’s biggest raised coral atolls. Chile is creating two new reserves, one around the Juan Fernández archipelago and another around Cape Horn, covering more than 1m sq km, bringing to 29% the amount of its seas surface area covered by reserves where fishing and extractive activities are banned."
"The International Monetary Fund has been on quite a journey from the days when it was seen as the provisional wing of the Washington consensus. These days the IMF is less likely to harp on about the joys of liberalised capital flows than it is to warn of the dangers of ever-greater inequality. The fund’s latest foray into the realms of progressive economics came last week when it used its half-yearly fiscal monitor – normally a dry-as-dust publication – to make the case for higher taxes on the super-rich.  Make no mistake, this is a significant moment. For almost 40 years, since the arrival of Margaret Thatcher in Downing Street and Ronald Reagan in the White House, the economic orthodoxy on taxation has been that higher taxes for the 1% are self-defeating. Soaking the rich, it was said, would punish initiative and lead to lower levels of innovation, investment, growth and, therefore, reduced revenue for the state. As the Conservative party conference showed, this line of argument is still popular. Minister after minister took to the stage to warn that Jeremy Corbyn’s tax plans would lead to a 1970s-style brain drain. The IMF agrees that a return to the income tax levels seen in Britain during the 1970s would have an impact on growth. But that was when the top rate was 83%, and Corbyn’s plans are far more modest. Indeed, it is a sign of how difficult it has become to have a grown-up debate about tax that Labour’s call for a 50% tax band on those earning more than £123,000 and 45% for those earning more than £80,000 should be seen as confiscatory. The IMF’s analysis does something to redress the balance, making two important points. First, it says that tax systems should have become more progressive in recent years in order to help offset growing inequality, but have actually become less so. Second, it finds no evidence for the argument that attempts to make the rich pay more tax would lead to lower growth. There is nothing especially surprising about either of the IMF’s conclusions: in fact, the real surprise is that it has taken so long for the penny to drop. Growth rates have not picked up as taxes have been cut for the top 1%. On the contrary, they are much weaker than they were in the immediate postwar decades, when the rich could expect to pay at least half their incomes – and often substantially more than half – to the taxman. If trickle-down theory worked, there would be a strong correlation between growth and countries with low marginal tax rates for the rich. There is no such correlation and, as the IMF rightly concludes, “there would appear to be scope for increasing the progressivity of income taxation without significantly hurting growth for countries wishing to enhance income redistribution”. With a nod to the work of the French economist Thomas Piketty, the fiscal monitor also says that countries should consider wealth taxes for the rich, to be levied on land and property. The IMF’s findings on tax provide ample and welcome political cover for Corbyn and John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, as they seek to convince voters that Labour’s tax plans are not just equitable but also economically workable. By contrast, the study challenges President Donald Trump to rethink tax plans that would give an average tax cut of more than $200,000 a year for someone earning more than $900,000. The response from the US administration was predictable: mind your own business. The IMF is not naive. It knows it is one thing to make the case for higher taxes on the rich but another altogether to get governments to implement them, because better-off individuals have more political clout. The argument that what is good for the super-rich is good for the rest of us has been demolished, but don’t expect the top 1% to give up without a fight. Looking at Theresa May’s energy price cap for the answer to reining in your electricity and gas bills? Then you were watching the wrong government announcement last week. The solution to making energy affordable lies not in the draft legislation for the cap, which is a short-term stopgap that will do nothing to make prices fairer in the long term, but in a climate change masterplan launched by ministers at the Olympic Park in London. While the clean growth strategy is short on detail for a 164-page tome, it should be praised for putting energy efficiency front and centre. The plan’s bright idea is an aspiration to bring all homes in England and Wales up to a minimum of energy band C, by fitting new boilers, insulation and more efficient appliances. The potential savings on bills are enormous. Someone in an E-rated home would save £650 a year if it was overhauled to a C-rating. What’s missing are the sort of bold measures to make the aspiration a reality. There are good reasons that people don’t both with insulation. “For some, energy efficiency measures’ upfront costs and hassle can be high. The payback period from lower energy bills can be longer than the time people expect to stay in their home,” the National Infrastructure Commission said this week. As the commission pointed out, the market hasn’t delivered: so government intervention is needed. Ministers’ last attempt to kickstart improvements was a disaster, and the number of homes being made more efficient has plunged as a result. More radical policies are required to convince householders that energy efficiency is worthwhile – and fortunately there is no shortage of ideas. Lower stamp duty for energy-efficient homes, discounts on council tax and allowing people to take out bigger mortgages on greener homes (an idea that government is exploring) have all been mooted. Such steps are a big ask because they would require the Treasury’s buy-in. But the imperative for upgrading Britain’s leaky, draughty housing stock has never been greater. The clean growth strategy admitted that the best way to cut the carbon emissions from heating our homes is not yet clear. That means the mundane but vital job of stopping our radiators’ warmth leaking out through our walls and lofts is more important than ever – not just for our wallets, but for the planet too. Classic descriptions of financial bubbles usually describe the final pre-pop stage as the moment when the general public is attracted by the whiff of easy money. In the 21st century, we should not be surprised that social media and celebrity are also part of the story. That is the context in which to view a tweet by football manager Harry Redknapp, which grabbed attention last week. “Proper excited about Mobile Cryptocurrency! I’m in, get involved!” he declared Redknapp might have read the cryptocurrency warning from the Financial Conduct Authority that any investor backing an initial coin offering should be ready to lose the whole investment. But it seems equally possible that the 750% surge in the past year in the value in bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, has provoked a mania that feeds off itself. Electroneum, the venture that excites Redknapp, reported that four Premier League footballers had got in touch within hours of Harry’s tweet. Oh dear."

"The US is set for a fresh battle over climate change after the Trump administration moved to tear up the country’s primary policy to lower emissions and stave off dangerous global warming.  On Tuesday, Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), signed an order to scrap the Clean Power Plan, a Barack Obama-era initiative to curb pollution from US power plants.  “The war against coal is over,” Pruitt declared. “We are committed to righting the wrongs of the Obama administration by cleaning the regulatory slate.” The move has provoked a furious reaction from states, businesses and environmental groups that warn that the world’s second-largest carbon polluter is risking its population’s health and the future livability of parts of the planet.  New York’s attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, said he would sue the Trump administration to prevent its “irresponsible and illegal efforts to turn the clock back on public health”. More than a dozen other states are likely to follow, backed by green groups. Xavier Becerra, California’s attorney general, said he would do “everything in my power to defend the Clean Power Plan”. Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, said the organization would fight Trump and Pruitt “in the courts, in the streets, and at the state and local level across America to protect the health of every community”. Several large companies have stated their support for the Clean Power Plan. In a joint statement, Apple, Amazon, Google and Microsoft said: “Climate change is one of our most significant global challenges and strong action is critical to meeting the serious threat posed by greenhouse gas emissions.  “We believe that strong clean energy and climate policies, like the Clean Power Plan, can make renewable energy supplies more robust and address the serious threat of climate change while also supporting American competitiveness, innovation, and job growth.” A spokeswoman for food manufacturer Mars said: “Mars has been outspoken about the need for business and government to step up and address critical global challenges, like climate change. We are disappointed by the decision.” The absence of any major national climate policy has placed greater onus on states, cities and businesses, such as those that formed the We Are Still In coalition after Trump announced his intention to withdraw from the Paris climate accord. Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York, tweeted: “The EPA can repeal the Clean Power Plan but not the laws of economics. This won’t revive coal or stop the US from reaching our Paris goal.” Courtroom battles may take several years to unspool, meaning the Trump administration may not be able to scrap the climate plan and craft some sort of watered-down replacement before 2020. The repeal proposal states the Clean Power Plan “exceeds the EPA’s statutory authority”, adding that the agency has not determined whether it will replace the plan with anything. Instead, it has opened a comment period for the public. Pruitt said the EPA will “assess whether further regulatory action is warranted”. Some conservative groups want the EPA to provide no replacement and reverse its 2009 “endangerment finding” that climate change poses a risk to human health. It is more likely the regulator will simply put forward an industry friendly alternative that requires coal-fired plants to improve some internal practices rather than switch to cleaner sources such as solar and wind.  “What is especially laudable about the Trump EPA analysis is that Scott Pruitt and his team are intent on restoring legality to the regulatory process,” said Myron Ebell, who headed the EPA transition team for Trump and directs environment policy at the conservative Competitive Enterprise Institute. “CEI has petitioned EPA to reopen and rescind the endangerment finding, so we would obviously prefer no rule. However, if the endangerment finding is not rescinded, then a legal inside-the-fenceline rule would be acceptable.” The Clean Power Plan was unveiled by Obama in 2015 but was immediately challenged by industry groups and 27 states, including Oklahoma when Pruitt was attorney general of the state. Last year, the supreme court froze the plan pending legal challenges.  “Legally the Trump administration is on very firm ground, but if they don’t issue a replacement rule they will face lawsuits,” said Jeff Holmstead, a senior EPA official under George W Bush and part of the legal team that attempted to halt the Clean Power Plan. “I think the business community doesn’t want this heavy-handed sort of regulation but they do want a replacement plan. They do want some sort of regulatory certainty.” The Obama administration set the Clean Power Plan a goal of reducing emissions from the energy sector 32% by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. Electricity generation accounts for nearly a third of US emissions. The country is more than halfway to that target, largely due to a shift from coal to cheap and abundant natural gas which has lower carbon output. Even with the repeal of the Clean Power Plan, emissions from energy generation may still come close to the original target. But the US will probably fall short of its international pledge to help avoid highly dangerous levels of global warming. The EPA previously estimated that the Clean Power Plan would prevent about 90,000 child asthma attacks and 3,600 premature deaths a year by 2030. These gains would largely be made in disadvantaged communities and among people of color who disproportionately live next to sources of toxic pollution. “Unfortunately our most vulnerable communities will face the brunt of this irresponsible decision, including disproportionate health impacts, while rich corporations that have control over the EPA will reap the profits,” said Mustafa Santiago Ali, a former senior official at the EPA’s office of environmental justice. Pruitt – who is currently under investigation over his use of taxpayer-funded flights – has said he would ideally “do away” with tax credits for wind and solar so they can “stand on their own and compete against coal and natural gas and other sources”. He made no mention of axing subsidies enjoyed for decades by oil, coal and gas producers. This month, researchers at Oil Change International estimated that the US provides around $20bn a year in subsidies to fossil fuels, through incentives, credits, low royalty rates and other measures. With the US pulling away from the effort to address climate change, other governments face a stiff challenge. Scientists have linked warming temperatures to increasingly ferocious hurricanes and wildfires. In recent months, parts of Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico have been battered by hurricanes. California’s Napa valley region is experiencing some of the worst fires in the state’s history."

"Whether it’s the destruction of rainforest shared by elephants and orangutans in Sumatra to produce palm oil; reports linking fast food giants to the burning of tropical forests in Brazil and Bolivia; or the hundreds of thousands of hectares of tree cover loss per year in West Africa – the world’s forests are being razed to sate global demand for produce such as palm oil, beef and cocoa. As of March 2017, 447 companies had made 760 commitments to curb forest destruction in supply chains linked to palm oil, soy, timber and pulp, and cattle – principal forest-risk commodities – according to NGO Forest Trends. But what does this mean? And why do deforestation scandals keep emerging?  According to Nasa’s Earth Observatory [pdf], if current rates of tropical deforestation continue, the world’s rainforests will vanish within 100 years, eliminating the majority of plant and animal species on the planet, as well as uprooting the communities who live there.  Around 70% of deforestation is linked to the production of agricultural commodities that end up in food products eaten around the world. And deforestation accounts for around 12% of global manmade greenhouse gas emissions. A recent study from Cornell University suggests deforestation contributes more significantly to climate change than previously realised. The UN’s sustainable development goals pledge to halt deforestation by 2020. A growing number of companies from McDonald’s to Unilever are also voluntarily committing to eliminate deforestation from their supply chains, both in their individual sustainability policies and through participation in larger initiatives.  These include the Consumer Goods Forum – a network of consumer goods manufacturers, retailers and others – which has a commitment to achieve zero net deforestation by 2020. And the New York Declaration on Forests [pdf], which emerged from the UN’s climate summit in 2014, and includes non-binding commitments to half the rate of deforestation by 2020 and end it by 2030.  One issue complicating these pledges is a lack of agreement about what a forest even is. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) offer guidance, but each country is free to define forests within these criteria. And while terms such as “deforestation free” and “zero net deforestation” are often used interchangeably, they are different. Zero net deforestation, for example, allows forest clearance provided an equivalent area is replanted elsewhere.  Anti-deforestation pledges are a positive step, but they have limitations, says Pablo Pacheco, principal scientist at the Centre for International Forestry Research. In the Indonesian palm oil sector corporate groups often do a good job of tracing supply from refineries to mills to plantations, says Pacheco, but face difficulties in tracing smaller, third party suppliers since they are often linked to the market through intermediaries. There is also the issue of some countries, for example China and India, being less engaged in the deforestation debate. China and Hong Kong together are among the largest importers of forest risk commodities globally, yet in 2016 they only scored two out of five on The Forest 500’s annual ranking of jurisdictions based on deforestation policies. A recent Oxfam report [pdf] on deforestation-free food concluded that despite company commitments, not enough is being done to translate these into policies and action.  The report also calls on companies to go beyond their own forest commitments to protect land rights and those who defend them. In Peru, six farmers were recently shot dead in a battle over land rights and palm oil and, in total, more than 145 land defenders have been killed so far this year – many linked to deforestation. There’s also a concern from some campaigners about a focus on company pledges. Sam Lawson, founding director of the NGO Earthsight, says voluntary commitments will only ever capture a certain proportion of the market – with “bad apples showing little regard for legality, let alone sustainability”. Attention on company commitments could also interfere with the time and funding dedicated to forest policy. “The effort spent pushing for corporate voluntary actions ... is distracting attention from some of the critical things, like getting the Indonesian government to cancel the corruptly issued licenses that cover vast areas of forest in that country,” he says. The UN has just launched the Good Growth Partnership, a four-year project led by the UNDP’s Green Commodities Programme aiming to transform the soy, beef and palm oil supply chains to meet SDG goals around poverty alleviation and tropical deforestation reduction.  The increased availability of technology is also helping companies to monitor and manage deforestation. The Global Forest Watch, for example, has developed a monitoring tool which gives near real time alerts on areas of suspected forest clearance. And there is growing hope for cross-sector partnerships, bolstered by the success of Brazil’s soy moratorium. The initiative between government, environmentalists and companies started in 2006 when soy buyers agreed not to purchase soy from deforested areas in the Amazon. The moratorium was extended indefinitely last year and, while it is not without critics, a recent study concludes the deforestation rate pre-moratorium was more than five times that post-moratorium."

"In March I went to see Henrik Poulsen, the boss of Dong Energy, in Copenhagen. Never heard of him or his company? You are not alone, but the chances are he is keeping your lights on. The largely unknown story of his company is worth telling because it is genuinely revolutionary. Dong stands for Danish oil and natural gas. It was, like Shell and BP, involved in fossil fuel exploration and production. But in less than a decade it has become an 85% offshore wind company, and is divesting its coal, oil and gas interests. By 2023, Dong Energy will be very close to zero carbon. That is a pretty staggering transformation in a very short space of time.  But it doesn’t end there. This isn’t just a hymn to the glory of an oil and gas company, it’s also a paean to the UK’s “greenest government ever”. Thanks to its support, the price of offshore wind energy has dropped by half in less than two years. By the 2020s, it will be as cheap or cheaper than any other form of power generation. It’s just become much cheaper than nuclear, even taking into account the additional costs associated with the wind’s intermittency. And in any case, this is less of an issue at sea where the winds are more constant. Talking to Poulsen made me realise that we were on the cusp of a quiet revolution. From being the most expensive form of renewable energy, offshore wind was fast becoming the cheapest form of large-scale, low-carbon generation bar none. As Poulsen said: “When you go 10 years into the future and you look back, I think we will look at these years, 2016, 2017, 2018, as the inflection point. I think we’ll look back and say wow … Something happened for wind and solar energy during those years that completely changed the dynamic.” But he also said that “without the UK government and what they have done for the past five or six years, we wouldn’t have been where we are today. I’m glad to see that it’s paying off because we’re creating a lot of jobs right now and building a local supply chain. So they’ll get their rewards, which they should.” There’s a pleasing symmetry in fighting climate change, a truly enormous problem that remains invisible to most people in the UK, with offshore wind, an equivalently huge and equally invisible solution. But I came away from that meeting thinking that this quiet revolution needed a bit of noise and visibility. Amid the gale of bad news that has blown through 2017, this was a good news story that needed shouting about from the rooftops. This month’s contracts for the next round of offshore wind farms to be built in the North Sea should have the champagne corks popping in No 10. They mean billions more in foreign investment coming into the UK. They will be playing a major role in regenerating regions in the north-east of the country. And they will create a thriving export market in contracts for offshore wind developments. But we at Greenpeace are not sure the government has noticed the full potential that their policies have created. To bring it to their attention, some of the world’s biggest players, including Vattenfall and General Electric, have come together alongside environmental organisations including WWF and the Marine Conservation Society. A campaign is being launched today at Westminster with the help of creative agency Mother, which is working pro bono. They explained to us that when you’re selling the future of energy generation at 50% off, all you really need to do is get this fact in front of your customers. MPs using Westminster tube station will find it hard to miss. The UK needs affordable and secure energy. We have to replace our obsolete power stations and meet growing demand from the electric vehicle revolution. Offshore wind, alongside a smart energy system including storage and interconnectors, should be the backbone of how the UK generates its power in future. Short term, as part of the transition, gas back up might be required (but only when needed, unless it’s green like biogas). Such a system could help us meet our climate change commitments and speed up the move to a low-carbon economy. It could provide jobs and regional regeneration as well as provide export markets. It could be the cheapest form of large-scale power available. It’s shown to be wildly popular in all opinion surveys. We urge the government to come clean on this issue and publicly admit that they got this right! • John Sauven is director of Greenpeace"
"A pair of German-American Earth observation satellites are due to be retired this November and put on trajectories that will see them burn up in Earth’s atmosphere in 2018. The two Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (Grace) satellites were launched on 17 March 2002 from Plesetsk Cosmodrome, in north-west Russia. They fly in formation, about 140 miles (220km) apart, and measure the gravitational field of the Earth.  The pull of gravity changes as water moves around the planet in seasonal patterns, and as ice deposits change thickness. With its monthly gravity map, Grace has revealed rapid ice loss from Greenland and Antarctica and mapped seasonal changes in water levels in the Yangtze river in China. On 4 September, one of Grace’s battery cells stopped working and its satellite ceased communication with ground controllers. The link was restored four days later, and the battery was found to be back to a workable voltage, but it was a clear sign that the twin spacecraft are ageing. Grace is now on its final data collecting run and in November both spacecraft will be sent onto different orbits and rendered inert. The separate orbits will ensure that they do not collide and create space debris. They will re-enter Earth’s atmosphere and burn up early in 2018, with only small fragments expected to make it to the ground. Nasa says these pose a very small risk to people, and are well within their safety requirements for re-entering spacecraft. The mission’s end comes just a few months before its replacement, Grace Follow On, is due to launch on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg air force base, California. "
"Tax breaks and free access to bus lanes should be used to help reverse Australia’s poor uptake of electric vehicles, a new report has said.  Australians remain deeply reluctant to buy electric cars, which accounted for just 0.1% of new car sales in 2015. Australia is increasingly falling behind other countries, particularly in Europe, where sales of electric cars represented 1.2% of new European Union car sales in the same year.  In Norway, electric vehicles made up 22.8% of new car sales, thanks largely to a suite of financial and policy incentives. Electric cars are allowed to use Norwegian bus and taxi lanes, pay no parking fees and are exempt from road tolls, VAT and registration charges.  Drivers in France are given a rebate for low-emitting cars and charged an extra fee for high-polluting vehicles. France’s scheme reduced average carbon emissions for a new car from 149 grams per kilometre in 2007, a year before the policy was introduced, to 114g in 2014. In the same year the average for a new car in Australia was 188g. The Australia Institute, in a report released on Friday, warned Australia risked becoming a “laggard” on electric cars by international standards. Australia offered “disappointingly few” incentives for buyers of electric cars, the report said, and lacked proper battery charging infrastructure.  Trials of electric vehicles in state government fleets were too small to produce meaningful results, the report said. Victoria used only 54 electric or hybrid cars between 2010 and 2014, in an overall fleet of 4.5m vehicles in the state. “Electric vehicles promise benefits to both consumers and governments,” the report said. “Nonetheless, the market for electric vehicles remains underdeveloped and progress has been slow. “Australia’s electric vehicle market is, by international standards, a laggard. This is in no small part due to a lack of public investment in establishing the conditions necessary for growth.” The Australia Institute said it had conducted its own survey showing majority support for policy incentives to encourage the uptake of electric vehicles. The report recommends exempting electric vehicles from the luxury car tax, which applies to more expensive types of electric cars, including the Tesla Model S. It also calls for tax breaks to build a “visible, densely distributed network” of charging stations, to ease consumer concerns about being left stranded with a flat battery. “The development of this network requires careful management,” the report said. “Left unregulated, there is a risk that competing technology standards cannibalise the EV market.” Australia should also allow a Norwegian-style scheme to allow electric cars access to bus lanes, although such a perk should be time-limited to avoid congestion as the uptake of electric vehicles grows, the report said.  The measure would also require number plates that identify cars as electric. It should only apply to all-electric vehicles, the report said, to reduce congestion in bus lanes.  The report also recommended adopting a carbon pricing scheme, similar to that operating in France, which made cleaner cars cheaper to buy. "
"The UK government could potentially consider providing subsidies for electric bicycles and electric cars as part of a concerted policy effort to get more people cycling, the roads minister, Jesse Norman, has said. With the UK facing health crises from pollution and inactive living, other plans could include using electric cargo bikes to deliver packages from internet retailers rather than vans, Norman told the Guardian.  Saying his ambition was to “make the transition to a world where a 12-year-old can cycle safely”, Norman said he could not promise extra funding for cycle routes, but said central government could start pushing councils to take more action. A review into cycling safety announced last month would be broad, possibly including whether cyclists should be forced to wear helmets and high-visibility clothing, Norman said. But he promised any conclusions would be led by evidence. People buying electric or hybrid cars can receive up to £4,500 off the purchase price through a government subsidy scheme. However, there is no equivalent policy for e-bikes, where a small electric motor provides a boost when the rider pedals. These are increasingly popular with novice or older cyclists or those facing a hilly or lengthy commute, but can often cost £1,500 or more. Norman said an e-bike subsidy could happen: “We’ve done some work on that already, and I haven’t looked at the outcomes yet, and they might not be ready yet. There’s a case in principle.” He said there was “tremendous opportunity” for more packages to be delivered by electric-assist cargo bikes: “If you think about what in terms of local deliveries, a lot of these Amazon deliveries are lighter things – you don’t need a Transit van to be doing that. “I think e-bikes and ebikes-plus are a really interesting potential way of handling that last mile or two of deliveries.” Norman, who was appointed in June, faced accusations of anti-cyclist bias last month over his response to the case of Charlie Alliston, who was jailed for killing a pedestrian, Kim Briggs, after hitting her on a bike without a front brake. After the trial Norman said he would examine a possible new offence of causing death by dangerous cycling, and announced the review of cycle safety. He also wrote a letter to cycling organisations warning them riders should abide by the Highway Code. Norman said critics had “missed a wider point” that the safety review would also cover the danger posed to cyclists by drivers, including those “using cars in ways that are intentional and punitive”. Asked if he had experienced dangerous driving while cycling, he replied: “I bike every day, so absolutely.” On possible laws for helmets and high-visibility clothing, Norman said the review would “ask very general questions and if the feedback is that we should consider that stuff, then we’ll look at it”. He added: “Obviously there will be some people who feel very strongly that there should be hi-vis, and there will be plenty of people who think very strongly the other way. It’ll be the same with helmets. The literature on risk is quite a well developed one, I don’t need to tell you.” About 1-2% of trips in the UK are made by bike, considerably fewer than in many other other European countries.  A report by MPs in 2013 called for a share of 10% by 2025, to be achieved by spending £20 per person annually on cycling provision, notably safe bike lanes. Norman said the current spend had risen from £2 a head in 2010 to £6 after the launch in April of a new cycling and walking strategy, but he did not know if this would increase further: “Six weeks before the Budget it would be a brave minister indeed who made any pronouncements.” He raised the idea of a more proactive approach from Westminster over cycling, saying he was “not ruling out” the idea of ministers pushing local councils to do better on the issue, or mandating national standards for bike lanes. With the advent of driverless vehicles and other moves away from traditional cars, governments needed to think about how road transport was being transformed, Norman said, saying cycling would be key to this. He said: “It’s not just, if I may say so, the actions of a government which is supportive of cycling, it’s also the actions of a government that understands that the whole nature of the way in which we use the roads, and the way we think about cities, is going to change dramatically over the next decade or two, and possibly earlier. We need to be fully abreast of that.” "

"The energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, has slapped down Tony Abbott and other conservative rebels, declaring that climate change is real and that was why Abbott agreed to join the Paris international climate agreement when he was prime minister. Asked about Abbott’s provocative speech to a group of climate-change sceptics in London questioning the science of climate change – an outing that has been characterised by Labor as “loopy” – Frydenberg brought up Abbott’s own record in the top job.  “Climate change is real,” the energy minister told reporters. “We take our advice from the scientific experts. We believe we need to reduce our emissions. That is why Tony Abbott signed up to the Paris agreement.” With the government backing off the clean energy target recommended by the chief scientist, which was opposed vociferously by Abbott and other government conservatives, voices are now marshalling against Australia’s participation in the Paris agreement. Conservative Eric Abetz on Wednesday backed Abbott’s speech in London questioning climate change and declared Australian pensioners need to be put before “some Paris aspirational climate deal”. Declaring himself an “agnostic” about the science of climate change, the Tasmanian Liberal senator said Abbott had made some “very valid points” in the speech to a group of climate-change sceptics. While noting the Paris climate agreement “was at all times aspirational and unenforceable”, Abetz queried why Australia had signed up. “Why we are supporting Paris in circumstances where the total Australian emissions are being, er, er, emitted in China and India by increasing their emissions each year?” Abetz told Sky News. “One really has to ask what is the benefit of exporting our coal to China and India so they can burn it and we can somehow claim environmental purity when it is costing us jobs and costing us wealth with no environmental dividend.” Frydenberg flatly dismissed those arguments.  “I point out that, at the time, Tony Abbott said that the agreement Australia struck at Paris was a definite commitment and that it was economically responsible and environmentally responsible. They were Tony Abbott’s words,” the energy minister said. “Now the Turnbull government is continuing the work of Coalition governments to reduce carbon emissions, but to do so in a way that doesn’t compromise the affordability and the reliability of our system.” Frydenberg said Australia’s commitment to the Paris treaty was rock solid.  “We have firm commitments we agreed to at Paris,” he said. “The government will meet and Australia will meet those commitments, just as we beat our first Kyoto target, just as we’re on track to beat our 2020 target. “We are doing it through a whole range of different mechanisms across the economy. We take climate change very seriously. We take our emissions reductions targets very seriously. That’s what the government has acted.” Industry is deeply alarmed that the government has backed off the clean energy target recommended by the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, because a number of groups saw that policy as a valid pathway to achieve bipartisan agreement on climate and energy policy. Industry groups are concerned the government’s energy policy is off the rails. The Business Council of Australia is demanding a seat at the table if the government intends to propose an alternative mechanism to the clean energy target to drive the transformation to low-emissions technology. The government could unveil its energy policy as soon as next week, when parliament resumes for the final spring session. Abetz on Wednesday declared Australia was exporting jobs and wealth in the “manic determination to go down the renewable energy path”. He said the government’s new energy policy needed to encourage the construction of new high-efficiency low-emissions coal power plants and, “further forward”, nuclear energy, to provide reliable base-load energy. The senator said low-cost energy had made Australia a first-world economy and Australia needed to retain that comparative advantage. Abetz also backed Abbott’s contention that when the world’s climate has been warmer, people fared better. He said the simple reality “in general terms” was when the world’s climate had been a little bit warmer, humanity had done better. Abetz said he would prefer neither a heatwave nor a cold snap, but he said people died more often in cold snaps than during heatwaves."
"While politics never sleeps, and the verbiage from Canberra never stops, there has been a strange sense of suspended animation about the last couple of weeks, apart from a mild frenzy on Friday, as rumours circulated of early elections, cancelled parliamentary sittings, and general plague and pestilence. The reason for Friday’s startle reflex is, of course, the return of the federal parliament for the blockbuster spring session next week.  The reasons for the period of suspended animation before the startle reflex are also obvious. All the controversial issues the government has been spinning its wheels on for months, or warily circling, will hit between now and Christmas. The high court will determine the fate of the various dual citizens, and then, the public, potentially at least, depending on the decision, will determine the fate of the Turnbull government’s one-seat majority in the lower house. The public will also chart a course on same-sex marriage. Assuming a yes vote, given that seems to be the general direction of the public opinion polls, the Liberal party will then have to indulge one more round of handwringing about religious freedom before the parliament has its say. Then there’s energy, which will finally land next week. It really is hard to overstate the contortions that have accompanied this debate, which started in its current iteration with the energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, floating and then killing an emissions trading scheme for electricity in the space of 24 hours, then rolling through to the creation of the Finkel review of the electricity market, then through the process of trying to land a clean energy target, which now seems to have been abandoned, at least in the form the chief scientist suggested it. Actually it started with wicked wind farms in South Australia, but there really is only so much torture I can inflict on you this weekend, so I’ll spare you that particular recap, which now feels about a century ago. Let’s look forward. On current indications, this is what will happen when the federal parliament resumes next week: the energy policy will go to cabinet, then to the Coalition party room, and if it doesn’t explode on impact in either of those places, pitching us into a whole new rodeo, it will then emerge for scrutiny by the world. Assuming success, that the policy clears the various internal hurdles, the government will then fire up its good news machine, and bombard us all with its general magnificence, but obviously we need to ignore all that, and keep a laser-like focus on the central issues. Next week, when we all get to making judgments about whether or not the government’s energy policy is reasonable (assuming the default unreasonableness that exists in the Coalition any time climate change is mentioned doesn’t consume it before take-off) – we need to look closely at the fundamentals. Australia’s energy sector is operating in an environment where there is no future investment certainty because there is continuing carbon risk. If carbon risk is a new concept for you, it just means the risk of a future government suddenly implementing serious policies aimed at reducing emissions to try to head off the worst climate-change scenario. That ongoing policy uncertainty has a price impact. Unless the new government investment framework explicitly addresses carbon risk, the price pressure in the system – the one we all feel through our nasty, nasty, power bills – will continue to be a problem. One way to deal with carbon risk would be to adopt the clean energy target proposed by the chief scientist Alan Finkel. A clean energy target is certainly not the only way to address carbon risk. In fact, many people (me included) would say there are much better ways of addressing carbon risk than a clean energy target. Unfortunately the Coalition has ruled most of the sensible alternative options out. The government may well come at the carbon problem, at the task of lowering emissions, by setting a reduction trajectory, giving more money to the existing Emissions Reduction Fund and adjusting the existing safeguard mechanism (two features of the existing Direct Action climate policy), and allowing the use of international permits. But if that’s the broad approach, depending how it’s structured, it could well be tokenistic. If the policy response is tokenistic – tokenistic enough, say, to subdue Tony Abbott, and the conservatives he speaks for in this wretched debate – it will not actually reduce carbon risk, which is what drives investment uncertainty, and pushes up energy prices. The government will have fixed a problem, but fixed it in the style of Christopher Pyne’s now infamous “fixing”, as in no fix at all – as in a fix that makes people in the real world, outside the strange retro hothouse of the Coalition party room, actually laugh out loud, out of nervous despair, rather than hilarity. To cut a long story short, the government will have produced a policy that clears the party room, but fails in the court of public opinion. Quite a risk that, given its electoral buffer, as we’ve noted, is a distance short of huge. There is one other reason to want Finkel’s clean energy target, and it’s this. The advantage of a clean energy target as a mechanism (as opposed to other means of lowering greenhouse gas emissions that may well be included in the government policy) is it had a prospect of securing a bipartisan consensus. The lack of bipartisan consensus is a big problem in climate and energy policy, not just a minor inconvenience. To understand this, you just have to stick with carbon risk, and push your mind through the various steps that would follow the government producing a policy that Labor can’t support. I know people inside the Coalition who equate public life with bar brawling see opportunity in having another zero sum bout with Labor – but standing on the fringes of the big stupid-off are a bunch of serious corporate interests who have to make decisions very quickly about new energy infrastructure, and a bunch of businesses that might well go to the wall if power prices keep rising. If Labor rejects the Coalition’s energy fix, then we have another brutally contested election, followed by a new government. Let’s stick with the current poll trend and speculate that the new government might be a Labor government. (You saw the might in that sentence, right?) Let’s say then that prime minister Shorten tries to navigate a climate and energy policy through a parliament where the Coalition is led by Peter Dutton, or let’s just pull a name out of a hat, Tony Abbott. In those circumstances, an outbreak of carbon peace seems unlikely, unless the Coalition has just suffered a major electoral bout, which results in someone in team centre-right twigging to the fact that governing for the nervous sensibilities of Andrew Bolt doesn’t really win you elections. But pushing on with our basic thought exercise, let’s assume in the next parliament that the Coalition again refuses to implement a climate policy that actually does anything. Then we are back with a Labor government, trying to get a policy through the parliament, with the Greens driving a hard bargain, which sounds a lot like Groundhog Day, and a Groundhog Day that doesn’t settle anything for the energy sector, because they just need to get off this damn roundabout. They need a policy that won’t be ripped up at the next election. They need this stupidity to stop. So does the country. In fact, we needed that at least a decade ago. So the question Malcolm Turnbull faces next week is much bigger than the bobble head preoccupations: who won or lost, who had the best line, who had the best tactics. Our prime minister needs to look the country in the eye and answer this, very simple, question: are you the political leader who can deliver what Australia needs?"
"They call it “pave, pipe, and pump”: the mentality that has dominated urban development for over a century. Along with the explosion of the motorcar in the early 20th century came paved surfaces. Rainwater – instead of being sucked up by plants, evaporating, or filtering through the ground back to rivers and lakes – was suddenly forced to slide over pavements and roads into drains, pipes and sewers.  Their maximum capacities are based on scenarios such as 10-year storms. And once they clog, the water – with nowhere else to go – simply rises. The reality of climate change and more frequent and intense downpours has exposed the hubris of this approach. As the recent floods from Bangladesh to Texas show, it’s not just the unprecedented magnitude of storms that can cause disaster: it’s urbanisation. The US National Weather Service said the “breadth and intensity” of the rainfall that came with Hurricane Harvey in late August was “catastrophic”, and “beyond anything experienced before” – the city was overwhelmed with devastating speed, as can happen in areas where much of the land is paved. A recent survey of global city authorities carried out by the environmental non-profit CDP found 103 cities were at serious risk of flooding. With climate change both a reality and threat, many architects and urbanists are pushing creative initiatives for cities that treat stormwater as a resource, rather than a hazard. One city already preparing for a climate future – or present - is Chicago, parts of which saw almost 20cm of rain in four days this July. It is projected to have 40% more winter precipitation by the end of this century. The city has poured significant investment into reimagining stormwater management over the last decade, including building more than 100 “Green Alleys” – permeable pavement that allows stormwater to filter through and drain into the ground – built since 2006. It’s very simple, but it’s very difficult for people to grasp, because we’ve not designed like that in a century The most advanced is the two-mile “sustainable streetscape” across Cermak Rd and Blue Island Ave in Pilsen, in Chicago’s Lower West Side. Once a crumbling asphalt strip inclined to flood, today it is “the greenest street in America”: a $15m showcase for cutting-edge ecological technologies such as photocatalytic cement to reduce smog and landscaped shallow troughs known as bioswales, which act as environmentally-friendly drainage, filtering and absorb polluted water.  On the Pilsen Sustainable Street, rainwater travels through the sidewalk to porous rock, where it is decontaminated by microbes. It then goes onto feed surrounding plants, or it filters through sand deep in the ground to make its way back to Lake Michigan. In this way, 80% of rainfall is diverted from the sewage system, and the road no longer floods, says Jay Womack, a senior landscape architect at Huff & Huff, which was commissioned to design the street. “We try to create porosity and permeability so that water can move in the ways that it moves in the hydrological cycle,” says Womack. “It’s very simple, but it’s very difficult for people to grasp, because we’ve not designed like that in a century.” Lessons from Chicago are being applied in China, where the government has commissioned the construction of 16 “Sponge Cities” to pilot solutions for the freshwater scarcity and flooding suffered in many cities as a result of rapid urbanisation. Chicago architectural firm UrbanLab was commissioned to design the masterplan for Yangming Archipelago in Hunan province: a new centre within the larger city of Changde, devised as a “new model for the future”. The area, a low-lying land river basin that experiences heavy rainfall, is regularly flooded. Instead of incorporating defences against water, UrbanLab put space for it to flow at the centre of its urban plan, putting major buildings on islands in an enormous central lake. Canal-lined streets that UrbanLab call “Eco-boulevards” connect the eight districts – the process is visualised in this video. UrbanLab says their vision combines a dense metropolis with a nature setting: “As a functional center, Yangming Archipelago will serve as an urban model, we expect it to lead the way to a new way of thinking about the city of the future.”  With 2.5 million residents of New York and New Jersey currently living within a designated flood zone, the Tri-State Region of the US is already vulnerable to flooding, and the outlook will only deteriorate with rising sea levels. A cross-discipline team was commissioned by the Regional Plan Association and the Rockefeller Foundation to devise a response to the pressure put on the region’s coastlines within 50 years and six feet of sea-level rise. The aerial map above shows flooding in New Mastic in 2050 and, on the right, in New Mastic in 2050 after the proposed future development. Development on high, dry ground would be densified while homes in wet areas would evolve into a new elevated neighbourhood, built along docks. They proposed freezing future development on flood plains in favour of focusing new housing in the neighbourhoods of Brooklyn, Queens, Long Island and New Jersey along “corridors” and transit spines inland on higher ground. The team reimagined The Bight, the notch in the region’s coast where ocean currents pile sand, as a new “landscape economic zone” that would blur the hard line between the city and the sea and create new spaces for habitation, conservation, work and play. “Rather than futilely trying to hold the line, the zone’s mantra is ‘receive, protect, adapt’,” said Segal and Drake. Per their vision, the coastline would be transformed into “the new urban frontier” with a vanishing barrier island at Sea Bright, NJ, by 2030; a retirement walkable community at Mastic Beach in NY by 2050; and New York City’s “new sunken central park” at Jamaica Bay by 2067. The stakes of failing to adapt to flood risk were made clear by Hurricane Sandy in 2012, which caused the deaths of 147 people and cost the US more than $50bn in damage. One of the worst-affected areas was Meadowlands in New Jersey, a low-lying wetland basin bisected by the Hackensack river. During the hurricane it was impossible to pump out water because of tidal flooding on the other side of the dike, and the area was devastated: houses filled with water, cars floated away, residents had to be rescued with boats, and critical infrastructure failed. Kristian Koreman, a co-founder of ZUS, a Rotterdam-based architectural practice, says development had failed to take into account the local ecology. “By neglecting the fact that they were building in a swamp, they forgot that it was a tidal area,” he says. “You can see that the water goes up and down every day, but with a real storm like Sandy, and a tidal flood plus heavy rain, water came from all sides and there was no way to escape that.” By neglecting the fact that they were building in a swamp, they forgot that it was a tidal area In response to Sandy, ZUS partnered with MIT’s Center for Advanced Urbanism and De Urbanisten to devise New Meadowlands: a masterplan for combining flood resilience with recreational amenities through marshes and a system of parallel raised banks called berms. (The aerial rendering is shown at the top of this article.)  Between the outer berm and the sea, the restored wetlands would soak up seawater and slow down tidal waves, preventing them from hitting the dikes at high speed. The stretch of berms would serve as a wildlife refuge, filling up with rainwater during periods of heavy rain before draining out. And on the insider of the inner berm, ditches and ponds would retain rainwater, preventing it from causing sewers to overflow.  The first pilot project will focus on the towns of Little Ferry, Moonachie and Carlstadt, with $150m in funding from the US Department Housing and Urban Development. Given the triple whammy of climate change, increasing urbanisation and budget constraints, infrastructure projects now have to serve multiple purposes: Koreman says the team were under pressure to deliver the most value per dollar possible. Their plan includes a huge recreation zone, as well as bike lanes and a rapid transit bus lane running across the top of the berms to better connect Meadowlands to New York. ZUS sees its design as “berms with benefits”. Koen Olthuis, the founder of Waterstudio, a Dutch architectural practice that builds exclusively floating and amphibious structures, believes the way to encourage flood resilience is to make sure it’s almost overshadowed by those other benefits.  Olthuis is trying to improve living standards in waterside slums by providing vital functions such as education, sanitation and power in floating shipping containers built on foundations made of thousands of waste plastic bottles. He calls the units “city apps” as they are easy to install and launch. Since they can be moved, they can be granted a temporary licence by city governments that normally prohibit development in illegal settlements; and because they float, they entice investors who would ordinarily shy from investing in a flood plain.  The first major project is in Korail, a slum on the waterside in Dhaka, Bangladesh, where five units will be arriving in October: a classroom, a sanitation unit, a kitchen and a battery pack connected to a floating solar field.  Olthuis says he works with nature, rather than treating it as a threat – which means letting water flow where it wants, and using floods as a catalyst for more flexible urban development. He talks of relieving crowding in cities by building amphibious architecture on flood plains, or augmenting a city with pop-up floating structures on waterways – concert halls, stadiums, even rescue and relief units during disasters.  “For us,” he says, “it’s the wetter, the better.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, or explore our archive"
"More than 40 Catholic institutions are to announce the largest ever faith-based divestment from fossil fuels, on the anniversary of the death of St Francis of Assisi. The sum involved has not been disclosed but the volume of divesting groups is four times higher than a previous church record, and adds to a global divestment movement, led by investors worth $5.5tn.  Christiana Figueres, the former UN climate chief who helped negotiate the Paris climate agreement, hailed Tuesday’s move as “a further sign we are on the way to achieving our collective mission”. She said: “I hope we will see more leaders like these 40 Catholic institutions commit, because while this decision makes smart financial sense, acting collectively to deliver a better future for everybody is also our moral imperative.” Church institutions joining the action include the Archdiocese of Cape Town, the Episcopal Conference of Belgium and the diocese of Assisi-Nocera Umbra-Gualdo Tadino, the spiritual home of the world’s Franciscan brothers. A spokesman for the €4.5bn German Church bank and Catholic relief organisation Caritas said that it was committing to divest from coal, tar sands and shale oil.  In a symbolically charged move, the Italian town of Assisi will also shed all oil, coal and gas holdings the day before a visit by the Italian prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, to mark St Francis’s feast day. Assisi’s mayor, Stefania Proietti – a former climate mitigation professor – told the Guardian: “When we pay attention to the environment, we pay attention to poor people, who are the first victims of climate change.  “When we invest in fossil fuels, we stray very far from social justice. But when we disinvest and invest in renewable and energy efficiency instead, we can mitigate climate change, create a sustainable new economic deal and, most importantly, help the poor.” The origins of the latest church action lie in last year’s climate encyclical by Pope Francis – himself named after St Francis of Assisi – although the project was advanced by the Global Catholic Climate Movement."
"As efforts to cut planet-warming emissions fall short, large-scale projects to suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere will be needed by the 2030s to hold the line against climate change, scientists have said.  Many new technologies that aim to capture and store carbon emissions, thereby delivering “negative emissions”, are costly, controversial and in the early phase of testing.   But “if you’re really concerned about coral reefs, biodiversity [and] food production in very poor regions, we’re going to have to deploy negative emission technology at scale,” said Bill Hare of Climate Analytics, a science and policy institute.  “I don’t think we can have confidence that anything else can do this,” the Berlin-based chief executive told a London climate change conference.  World leaders agreed in 2015 an aim of holding global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial times. Scientists believe this is key to protecting small island nations from sea level rises, shoring up food production and preventing extreme weather.  Carbon-sucking technologies may even be needed to hold the planet to a less ambitious two degrees of warming, said scientists at Chatham House, a British thinktank.  The world has already seen an average of about one degree of warming, they said.  “It’s something you don’t want to talk about very much but it’s an unaccountable truth: we will need geoengineering by the mid-2030s to have a chance at the [1.5C] goal,” Hare said, referring to efforts to cool the planet through engineering.  These ideas include planting carbon-absorbing forests across large areas, then harvesting the wood for energy and pumping the emissions produced underground – a process likely to feature in an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report next year.  Machines might also be developed to capture carbon dioxide directly from the air and pump it underground or otherwise neutralise it.  But efforts to store captured carbon underground are “showing no progress … and even backwards steps in some cases”, said Corinne Le Quéré, director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at the University of East Anglia.  Underground carbon storage has been promoted as part of a push by the United States and other countries to develop “clean coal” technology.  Similarly, planting more forests – a technology known as Beccs, or bioenergy with carbon capture and storage – raises questions about food security and land rights, scientists said.  Le Quéré said Beccs is “probably essential to take us to zero emissions” although “it’s really difficult to imagine we can use land at the levels required in the models”.  She called for experts to focus on proven approaches, such as improving energy efficiency, promoting cleaner transport, eating less meat and scaling up renewable energies.  Many experts fear that launching costly “negative emissions” technologies could reduce the pressure to act swiftly to cut emissions now."
"As soon as Donald Trump won the presidential election, people in the US and around the world knew it was terrible news for the environment. Not wanting to believe that he would try to follow through on our worst fears, we held out hope.  Those hopes for a sane US federal government were misplaced. But they are replaced by a new hope – an emerging climate leadership at the state level and a continuation of economic forces that favor clean/renewable energy over dirty fossil fuels. In fact, it appears that some states are relishing the national and international leadership roles that they have undertaken. Support for sensible climate and energy policies is now a topic to run on in elections.  This change has manifested itself in American politics. One such plan stems from my home state, but it exemplifies work in other regions. I live in the state of Minnesota where we are gearing up for a gubernatorial election, which is where this plan comes from.  My state is well known as somewhat progressive, both socially and economically. The progressive policies resulted in a very strong 2007 renewable energy standard, which helped to reduce carbon pollution and create 15,000 jobs.  As an aside, it is really painful for me to have to describe sane energy policies as “progressive.” The fact that conservatives in the US have largely attacked clean energy and the science of climate change is deeply disappointing, but it is a reality nonetheless.  Consequently, it is not surprising that one of the candidates for Governor, Rebecca Otto, has outlined what may become the trend among other states. She is not yet elected, but her clean energy proposal has many people talking.  The proposal presents a two-part focus on clean energy-based economic development and climate-change mitigation. Basically, in my state (and in many other states), the clean energy economy is a major contributor to the creation of new, high-paying jobs. Here wind and solar power are king. If you drive through the farm fields of southern Minnesota, you will see wind farms that stretch as far as the eye can see. With solar, there are some large-scale solar farms but the real excitement is the small-scale commercial and residential solar generation that is complementing the large-scale wind turbines. From an energy production standpoint, this makes sense. A diversified renewable energy portfolio is one that that includes large wind (which provides intermittent power) along with solar that also is intermittent but often generates power when the wind isn’t blowing (and vice versa). Also, the small-scale nature of solar makes it more reliable, less subject to local weather systems. So the proposed clean energy plan would leverage the fast-growing and high-wage industries in energy. It also brings to bear perhaps the best financing mechanism to spur clean energy growth (the so-called “fee and dividend”). The way fee and dividend works is a fee is charged to companies that produce greenhouse gas emissions. No longer would society be subsidizing the costs from carbon pollution.  The revenue from the fees would be returned to citizens so that it becomes a revenue-neutral tool. There is no net increase in cost or increase in income. What the fee and dividend method does, however, is reward people and companies for good choices. If you make choices that reduce your greenhouse gas contributions, you end up with extra money at the end of the year. On the other hand, if you make poor choices, you end up with less money. I think of this as a tax that advantages the smart over the, well, less smart. What is also exciting about the plan is that a portion of the fees would go to fund clean-energy technology and tax credits. For instance, residents would get funds to offset the costs of energy purchases. So when residents insulate their house, buy solar panels, or install high-efficiency heat pumps, part of that cost is covered. It will be interesting to see if similar plans emerge nationally. Most importantly, it will be interesting to see whether the climate change and energy topic becomes something that political candidates actively run on. In the past, this issue has been low on voter priorities lists. But, if proposing bold new plans can get votes, that may change – and quickly. I will also be watching how people on the right side of the political aisle view these plans. In truth, this plan has a lot that so-called libertarians or even fiscal conservatives would like. It creates a reward system that is revenue neutral. It penalizes bad choices and rewards good choices. It also reflects the fact that not charging the polluters means that the rest of us pay for the costs.  Whether it is more severe hurricanes, crop-killing droughts, intense storms and flooding, or sea-level rise, these impacts cost us. And it just isn’t right that the industries that have created the problem (and fought to have us neglect the problem) should be getting a free ride. I don’t know any conservatives who think that. I also don’t know any conservatives who want a dirty planet to hand our children. While conservatives often dislike solutions for handling climate change, “fee and dividend” is a concept that many support. In full disclosure, I have endorsed Rebecca Otto in her election contest, because of her nation-leading climate and energy plan. This article is not intended to be a further endorsement, but rather a reflection on how exciting new proposals to truly handle the climate/energy problem are being developed and used by candidates for office."

"For a brief and shining moment in 2012, Australia was at the global forefront of climate change action, as one of the first countries to implement a carbon pricing mechanism. It lasted only two years, and was repealed amid much fanfare by the Abbott government in July 2014.  During its time, Australian companies and industries exposed to the carbon pricing mechanism took a long hard look at the emissions liabilities embedded within their supply chains and worked to reduce them.  Barely three years later, Australia is in danger of being the kid that gets picked last for the soccer team. With China set to launch its national emissions trading scheme (ETS) before the end of the year, and several other Asia-Pacific nations either doing the same or already in the game, so-called ‘carbon clubs’ are forming and Australia isn’t invited. So what will it mean for Australian companies when our biggest trading partner – China – introduces their ETS? “Our energy-intensive exports sit directly in the supply chain of the world’s largest carbon market, where their customers are going to have a liability around the carbon price,” says Peter Castellas, chief executive of the Carbon Market Institute. “That will send a market signal of real significance.” Supply chain emissions – known as Scope 3 emissions under the Greenhouse Gas Protocol – refers to those generated outside the direct control of a business. These could be from the extraction and production of products purchased by the business, third-party transport and distribution, and the  end use of its products.  For many companies, these Scope 3 emissions are likely to be the largest part of their carbon emissions, compared to those generated by the company itself. For example, US company Kraft Foods found its Scope 3 emissions represented more than 90% of its total emissions (pdf). Supply chain emissions are already being targeted by many multinationals around the world; US retail giant Walmart recently asked its suppliers to help it achieve their goal of removing one gigatonne of carbon dioxide from its Scope 3 supply chain sources by 2030.  Chinese companies operating under an ETS may well undertake similar initiatives to reduce their carbon footprint, which could put Australian companies in that supply chain under pressure. The recent announcement has added a few more details to the scope of the scheme.  Chinese government adviser Zhang Xiliang from Tsinghua University told the AFR that it will begin with power generators and expand to encompass eight key sectors by 2020, including steel making and aluminium. The national scheme was first announced by Chinese president Xi Jinping in September 2015, during a visit by then-US president Barack Obama. At that time, China had been testing the waters since 2013 with pilot schemes in seven cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong and Shenzen. Incorporating power generation into the scheme is another step in China’s ongoing shift to a low carbon energy mix. It also raises further questions over the future of Australia’s coal exports to China, worth $4.2bn in 2015. “Anyone exporting coal to China needs to be worried; they should simply expect that China will not import coal,” says Prof Frank Jotzo, director of the Centre for Climate Economics and Policy at the Australian National University. However Tom Luckock, partner in law firm Norton Rose Fulbright’s Beijing office, says China has been moving away from coal-fired power long before the national ETS was announced. “China has and uses a number of tools to control emissions and it has done so very successfully for a number of years, and in many cases they will have a much larger impact than a carbon market,” Luckock says. “If you combine an ETS plus this very clear policy in terms of shutting down coal-fired power stations, plus you add in unofficial restrictions on new bank lending for coal fired power stations, plus you add renewables targets for power companies and local officials, together with tax incentives and high tariffs for renewables; all of this will have an impact back in Australia,” he says. Coal is a small part of the many goods and services that Australia exports to China. That export market, worth $93bn in 2016, includes metals and metal ores – iron, gold, aluminium and zinc, for example – as well as a huge range of other products, from wool and wheat to medicines and machinery parts.  Elisa de Wit, partner and head of climate change at Norton Rose Fulbright, says any Australian business that deals with China could be affected.  “Our sense though is that … perhaps there hasn’t been sufficient attention directed towards the impacts for that supply chain arrangement, and particularly for Australian business,” de Wit says.  The launch of China’s national carbon market could also harm the competitiveness of Australian products.  Jotzo suggests one effect of the scheme will be to encourage Chinese firms to invest in newer, more efficient production facilities, and pressure out the older, less efficient installations. This could be helped by incentives, like those built into the European Union ETS, which shield domestic industries from competitive disadvantage abroad because of the additional impositions of the carbon pricing mechanisms. “So once that all works its way through, China will have a more efficient heavy industrial sector as a result of this, and in the longer term will be able to better compete with international competitors,” he says.  China is not the only nation in the Asia-Pacific region to take steps towards emissions trading schemes. South Korea launched one in 2015, Japan has a cap-and-trade program for Tokyo, New Zealand launched an ETS in 2008, and Taiwan, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam are looking at reducing emissions through a pricing and trading schemes.  Australia’s lack of a carbon pricing mechanism could see it lag behind in the region, says Castellas, as countries that do have them begin to link their carbon trading markets.  “When you have Japan, [South] Korea and China having discussions around a north Asian carbon club; when you’ve got China and Korea having discussions around how do we treat emissions across borders and what’s the lowest cost to our economies to meet our emissions targets; when you have China and New Zealand having those conversations about establishing direct engagement because they both have a functioning carbon market with a price; those conversations and those emerging what’s being called ‘carbon clubs’ is something that Australia should be participating in,” he says.  Jotzo also warns Australia could be more subtly frozen out as a trading partner with China.  “Quite irrespective of the specific provisions for shielding Chinese industries and all the rest of it, China will then tend to say ‘well hang on …we’re doing the right thing for the global climate, why should we accept imports from countries like Australia or the US where industries are not under any similar obligation’, and that will be an argument in favour of trade restrictions of one form or another,” he says.  A Chinese national ETS is not all bad news. Despite our lack of a national carbon pricing mechanism, de Wit says Australia still has something to offer countries that implement them.  “We do see that there’s the potential opportunity for the learnings that have come out of our own offsets market, which has now been in operation for over six years, for some of that expertise to be exported as well into China,” she says.  It is also possible China might exhaust its domestic carbon offset credits, and Australia could find an opportunity in exporting those to China.  “It’s an interesting dynamic in terms of thinking about what happens under the Paris agreement, and once the emissions reduction opportunities have been completely extinguished, how you then look at offsetting and where those offsetting opportunities are actually going to come from,” de Wit says.  One thing is certain: there are more questions than answers about China’s ETS, and the details are eagerly awaited. A spokesperson for the department of foreign affairs and trade said it will be paying close attention to the effects of policy developments on Australian business. “Once the details of the scheme are made available, we will continue to engage closely with Australian exporters to ensure our advocacy with the Chinese authorities is targeted and appropriate.”"
