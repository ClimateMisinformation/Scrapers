"    The history of the fossil fuel industry can feel like it is told in complicated deals the public isn’t meant to understand. This is what is happening in Sweden. The government-owned energy company, Vattenfall, is demanding the sale of its coal mines and power plants based in Germany to a Czech company, EPH. The deal includes some of Germany’s largest coal mines – and three of the top 10 most polluting coal plants in Europe. They are going to a deeply unattractive buyer – EPH, a company hell-bent on burning as much coal as possible. In the next couple of weeks, Swedish prime minister, Stefan Löfven, is facing a stark choice. On one hand, he could approve the sale of the most climate-destroying assets in Europe, breaking his own election promises in the process. Or, he could promote a transition to keep coal in the ground – and support a liveable climate – in an unprecedented decision by a government to keep fossil fuels in the ground. Coal is the most polluting of all fossil fuels, and lignite or ‘brown coal’ is the most polluting type of coal and the greatest threat to EU climate goals. The deal has implications much wider than just European policy. If it goes ahead, it will give an excuse for countries like Australia and Japan to continue burning coal, multiplying the negative climate impact – and shredding Sweden’s ‘clean’ image in the process. By selling off these filthy coal assets, they will no longer be on Sweden’s books but the mines will be expanded and the brown coal will be burnt by someone else, imperilling humanity. If you applied this approach to slavery, a trading company would sell their slaves to a more brutal owner to clear their conscience while undermining abolition.  For the last four years, EPH has been buying up dirty coal mines and plants across Europe. It now has one billion tonnes of coal and 5GW of coal power plants. The company has proved to be faceless, brandless, shareholders-less, unaccountable – and already responsible for 6% of European power sector C02 emissions. EPH exploits the loopholes in the EU climate and energy package, which allows it to keep burning fossil fuels despite European agreements to limit emissions from coal power stations. Löfven’s sale would put four power plants in EPH’s hands as well as five open cast mines.  EPH says it will expand the mines – something, which all Swedish parties promised that they wouldn’t allow during the elections. The whole deal could add a billion tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. This is equivalent to 24 years of emissions from Sweden. Löfven is hoping the world isn’t paying attention to this deal. But we are. Just last month, 4,000 people shut down Vattenfall’s coal operations in Ende Gelände – the world’s largest ever act of civil disobedience against fossil-fuel burning. The Vattenfall sale brings to mind the fight to stop the Keystone XL pipeline – a point at which we draw a line in the sand and say no to fossil fuels. This only happened after an unprecedented wave of actions and President Obama saw the writing on the wall. Since then, he has been bold in standing up to the coal and tar sands industry. A large majority of Swedes oppose the sale of brown coal. The positive global impact of transitioning the brown coal regions away from a business that threatens human survival and towards new cleaner economies cannot be underestimated. Another future is possible. Will prime minister Löfven listen to public opinion and live up to the promises he has made? "
"The risk that houses in some areas of Australia are likely to become uninsurable, dilapidated and uninhabitable due to climate change is kept hidden from those building and buying property along Australia’s coasts and in bushfire zones, a Climate Institute report says. The report says there is untapped and unshared data held by regulators, state and local governments, insurers and banks on the level of risk, but that most homebuyers and developers are not told about the data and do not have access to it.  “Even when public authorities, financial institutions and other stakeholders possess information about current and future risk levels, they are sometimes unwilling, and sometimes unable, to share it with all affected parties,” the report released on Monday says. “Thus, foreseeable risks are allowed to perpetuate, and even to grow via new housing builds. The full scale of the risk may only be recognised either through disaster or damage, or when insurance premiums become unaffordable. Any of these events can in turn affect housing values.” The economic costs are high and could ultimately represent a real risk to the financial sector itself, the report says. While insurers, regulators and governments have started to recognise this risk, banks who approve the mortgages for at-risk properties have not yet begun working towards a solution.  For example, the report says, banks could integrate the impact of climate into their risk assessment processes, work with other stakeholders in the public, private and civil society sectors to research and develop ways to minimise climate impact risk to housing, and address losses that will occur in an equitable way. It also says that state, federal and local governments could do more to protect buyers, by including climate risk in planning, development and approval processes, mandating the disclosure of all available hazard mapping, and requiring that all dwellings be built or renovated as fit-for-purpose for the maximum projected impacts of climate change.  Extreme weather and climate change risks associated with a property should also be disclosed at the point of sale. “Even if these ‘uninsurable’ and ‘unadaptable’ properties are only a tiny minority of the total housing stock, the eventual devaluation could be financially devastating to individuals,” the report says.  “It could also be damaging to banks, other financial companies and public balance sheets at all levels of government. An author of the report and the manager of investment and governance at the Climate Institute, Kate Mackenzie, said the sector had to be proactive before houses became damaged, otherwise there could be a costly and messy battle over who bore responsibility.  For example, she said, councils could be liable for not providing flood data and for permitting a vulnerable development to go ahead, the developer for building it, the home owners for not realising the risk, the building code authority, the banks for financing the development and the mortgages, or the insurers. “There’s definitely a big need for governments to show leadership on this,” she said.  “There have been a few very good recommendations made in the past by public policy reviews which really haven’t been followed up at the federal level or at the state level or through Coag, which would provide a mechanism for a national adaptation strategy.” These included the reports from an Australian Treasury taskforce, the natural disaster insurance review, and two Productivity Commission inquiries, she said. Her report concludes: “A sense of exasperation is evident among those who have spent any length of time seeking to address the economic and policy challenges posed by extreme weather.” Some researchers are already taking the matter into their own hands and developing products to help buyers manage risk. Last month, the website Coastal Risk Australia was launched. It combines Google maps with detailed tide and elevation data, as well as future sea-level rise projections, to help people see whether their house or suburb is likely to be inundated."
"For his first major energy policy remarks, Donald Trump would quote, almost verbatim at times, from an op-ed published in the Grand Forks Herald earlier that morning. But Trump was not the author. The byline belonged to local congressman Kevin Cramer, the longtime champion of his state’s oil and gas industries. North Dakota has boomed and busted right along with the price of gas. Trump would start his speech by telling the state’s oil executives that they were standing at the “forefront of a new energy revolution” powered by Trumpian deregulation and protectionism.  As if it had been dredged from the Bakken Formation still dripping with crude, this was a speech both from and of North Dakota. Before the newly confirmed Republican nominee took to the stage in Bismarck, Cramer, a self-professed climate sceptic, had been invited up in front of the press and praised by Trump as a “talented person” bound for a role in his administration. “You’ve changed my life,” Cramer said. “I appreciate your comments on energy, and I’m looking forward to hearing the rest of it.” But of course, Cramer had heard it all before. This might have had some of the shale gas supremos shifting uncomfortably in their seats. Yes, the coal industry has sustained massive losses. For this, Trump blamed “stupid” regulations brought in by Obama: “Regulations that shut down hundreds of coal-fired power plants”. But the real coal killer has been shale gas.  The Carbon Tracker thinktank found last year the coal industry had entered into a “structural decline” and primarily blamed the huge decline in the price of shale gas along with increasingly competitive renewable energy. “Lots of studies show that environmental rules are far less important than other economic factors like wages, global commodity prices, and cost of materials,” said Professor Patrick Parenteau from the Vermont Law School. “The coal industry has killed more mining jobs, not to mention miners, through mechanization than environmental regs. Natural gas has closed more coal plants than Obama. And so on.” Trump took particular aim at Obama’s clean power plan, currently stalled in the supreme court. Recently released Energy Information Administration (EIA) projections for coal power show that the clean power plan is not the death knell for coal, as Trump says. The most carbon-intensive fuel made up 33% of electricity generation in 2015. With Obama’s clean power plan, that will slowly decline to 18% by 2040. If Trump has his way and the plan is scrapped, coal will continue to taper off to 26%. Rhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council Action Fund, said: “The solar industry alone employs more than four times as many people as the coal industry … Let’s talk about the jobs of tomorrow. That is what this election is about.” “You got to get rid of some of the regulations,” Trump said. “[Coalmines] have people that do nothing but deal with regulators. It’s gotten out of control.” Parenteau disagrees: “Overall, the data shows that on balance environmental regulations produce substantial net economic benefits for the nation.” An EPA spokeswoman said the past year had seen exceptional milestones reached in the transition toward clean energy.  “These market signals speak for themselves. The CPP isn’t driving these shifts; it was designed to underpin them. Even without the CPP in place yet, they’re happening anyway,” she said.  Federal surveying showed green states consistently outperforming brown states against a number of economic indicators, including good-paying jobs.  “The study is no longer being done in part because the conclusions never changed,” Parenteau said. “Most in the day-to-day of the energy industry will tell you that the concept of true “energy independence” (ie not importing any energy) isn’t really practical,” said Ethan Zindler, the US chief of Bloomberg New Energy Finance. The global nature of the energy market and the US’s significant levels of incoming and outgoing oil, gas and electricity make independence virtually impossible. Trump also promised to approve the Keystone XL pipeline – something he would be able to do if TransCanada enters a new application. Energy independence might be difficult once all that cheap tar sands oil starts flowing into Texas from Alberta. “The more practical goal is energy security, and that does contain an element ofbeing less reliant on imports, for sure,” Zindler said. Zindler points out that US oil imports have declined in the past seven years. “Whether that’s Obama’s doing or not is another story, but it’s not like we’ve become more reliant.” Trump also said he planned to use his oil-buying clout in the Gulf to further US foreign policy goals, namely defeating Isis. This would be unachievable with total US energy independence. This, as has been demonstrated in dozens of articles since Trump openly threatened the Paris agreement last week, is simply fantasy. Hundreds of countries created the Paris agreement, and it is not within the power of any single nation to “cancel” it. Further, if it is ratified this year, as expected, the US and all other nations will be locked into the agreement for four years. But the potential for a Trump White House to derail the climate process is another matter. The Paris agreement remains unfinished and imperfect, relying on all countries to increase their emissions cuts in the coming years. It also places the emphasis on national governments to chart their own course, expecting them to bow to international peer pressure – pangs of conscience to which Trump appears immune. Suh said that while Trump may have little power over the US’s formal relationship to the Paris deal, he might do enough damage simply through inaction at home. “He could delay a range of steps needed to meet the Paris commitments, including not imposing limits on methane leakage, not moving ahead with clean car standards, and not moving ahead with energy efficiency standards. Some of those things will be challenged in court. But even if they were in some legal limbo, he would effectively halt our progress … in what we all know is an incredibly urgent decade to make progress,” she said. In addition, Trump said he would end all US payments to the UN climate process. The flow of money from the rich world to poorer countries that bear less responsibility for climate change is arguably the most hotly contested aspect of climate negotiations. The US has so far paid $500m from a pledged $3bn to help developing countries cope with warming. The climate process depends on these pledges increasing dramatically over time. If the biggest single donor were to crimp the flow, at the very least it would seriously undermine US climate leadership. It’s true, 83,000 hawks, falcons and eagles are killed by US wind farms each year. But if Trump were truly worried about eagles, said a spokesman for the Audubon Society, he’d probably at least have mentioned global warming in his speech (he didn’t). “The number one threat to birds and people is climate change, which as you know is a result of our burning fossil fuels,” said the spokesman. Adding that coal, oil and gas production are directly responsible for more deaths than wind or solar. Not that wind farms are innocent. “We do encourage responsibly sited wind farms in order to reduce the threats wind power poses to eagles and other birds,” the spokesman said. Trump added that the problem with solar was that it was too expensive and that home systems took 30 years to pay themselves back.  “We see systems paying for themselves in less than a third of that time in a number of parts of the world,” Zindler said. “Perhaps he’s talking about a system installed in a very un-sunny part of the world located to adjacent to a coal plant producing super-cheap energy. Or perhaps he’s simply using data on the costs of solar that are badly outdated. Quite possible, given that we’ve seen equipment prices for solar drop 80% or more in the past several years.”"
"More than 30 environmental groups have signed a statement demanding that agreements allowing the logging of Australian native forests not be renewed. Australia’s 10 regional forestry agreements (RFAs) were signed between 1997 and 2001, each running for 20 years, with the first two expiring in 2017.  The agreements between state and federal governments mean proposals to log in designated native forests aren’t required to be approved through the usual federal process, under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (EPBC). The agreements were trumpeted as establishing the “conservation and sustainable management of Australia’s native forests” with the aim of providing “certainty for forest-based industries, forest-dependent communities and conservation”. But a damning 50-page report produced last week by the National Parks Association of NSW concluded the agreements failed in all their aims, with the logging of native forests they facilitated resulting in an increase in threatened species. The report’s lead author, ecologist Oisin Sweeney, examined scientific papers as well as the logging industry’s own data, and found the RFAs cost the states huge sums, didn’t decrease disputes over logging and worsened the environmental outcomes. The report also noted the agreements, which were designed in the 1990s, didn’t take climate change into account, and logging of native forests is a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. The federal government’s current policy is to extend the RFAs when they expire. The report concluded that “would constitute an irrational decision on environmental, economic and social grounds”. The statement, signed by more than 30 environment groups, was sent to the environment minister, Greg Hunt, Labor’s environment spokesperson, Mark Butler, and the Greens’ environment spokesperson, Janet Rice. “The groups endorsing this statement will not accept extension, rollover or renewal of regional forest agreements. Any future proposal to log public native forests should be subject to commonwealth environmental laws in the same way as for all other industries,” the statement said. Labor has not announced a policy on the expiring RFAs, and Butler did not respond to Guardian Australia’s request for comment. The Liberal party has said they would extend the RFA’s and also did not respond to a request for comment. The Greens have said they oppose the RFA’s extension or renewal. “The Greens stand with the Australian Forests and Climate Alliance in calling on the government to end this failed management scheme,” said Rice.  “Not even the mining industry has the sort of wildlife protection exemptions enjoyed by the native forest logging industry, so it is no wonder so many of our iconic birds and animals are on the brink of extinction because of habitat loss. “More than 85% of Australia’s wood products now come from plantation sources and there is no reason we can’t make the full transition out of native forest logging, to conserve these natural landscapes for their long-term environmental and economic values – carbon storage, water, wildlife, recreation and tourism.”  Lorraine Bower of the Australian Forests and Climate Alliance called for an end to logging in native forests. “By giving the logging industry unfettered access to public forests over the 20 years of the RFAs, other industries that could support jobs and growth, such as the carbon market and tourism, have been stymied,” she said. “The RFAs act as a loophole excluding logging from accountability to federal environmental laws that would apply to any other industry, enterprise or individual landowner.”  But the forestry industry said the agreements had delivered excellent environmental outcomes. Ross Hampton, the chief executive of the industry’s peak body, the Australian Forest Products Association, said the agreements went too far and had left too little of the forests available to be logged. “The available multiple-use forest has shrunk dramatically. Twenty years ago it was more than 13m hectares, now it is about 7.5m hectares nationally. And of course the timber communities only operate in a minute fraction of that on any year, harvesting about half of 1% and then assiduously resowing with the same species,” he said. Hampton said that left the communities that relied on logging native forests with too little. “With this discussion of RFAs, it is also timely to stand back and look again at our forests and ponder if we are getting the balance right. “Because we replant or resow some 60m trees a year, the forest industries of this country can put hand on heart and claim to be the ‘greenest’ industry we have. We are a big part of the solution to the globe’s chronic problems of climate change and rampant resource use.”  • This article was amended on 24 May 2016 to add a response from the industry body Australian Forest Products Association.

"The G7 nations have for the first time set a deadline for the ending most fossil fuel subsidies, saying government support for coal, oil and gas should end by 2025. The leaders of the UK, US, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the European Union encouraged all countries to join them in eliminating “inefficient fossil fuel subsidies” within a decade.   “Given the fact that energy production and use account for around two-thirds of global greenhouse gas emissions, we recognise the crucial role that the energy sector has to play in combatting climate change,” said the leaders’ declaration, issued at the end their summit in Japan. The pledge first entered into G7 (then known as G8) declarations in 2009 but has until now lacked a firm timeline. Shelagh Whitley, a research fellow at the Overseas Development Institute, called it an “historic day” but said 2020 was a more appropriate date if governments were serious about their commitments to the global climate deal agreed in Paris in December. Across the G7, subsidies are already falling, assisted by falling commodity prices. A notable exception is the UK, which increased subsidies by opening up new tax breaks for North Sea oil producers. Japan has been criticised for funding new coal projects, both at home and abroad. “We already see [some in] the G7 going in the wrong direction since Paris. Just because they are saying this [about fossil fuel subsidies], it’s not a fait accompli,” said Whitley. Canada also recently extended some subsidies for natural gas. The G7 joins the leaders of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the World Bank, who have previously called for an end to assistance for fossil fuel projects. The statement did not define precisely what the G7 consider to be a subsidy. The word “inefficient” in the G7 text indicates subsidies that distort energy markets. The OECD estimates that this type of support for fossil fuels within its member states is $160-200bn (£109-136bn) each year.  But when the cost of damage from pollution and climate change is factored in, the International Monetary Fund has estimated that support increases to a staggering $5.3tn a year, or $10m per minute. This is more than the total global spend on human health. The OECD approach to measuring subsidies is likely to be the yardstick applied by the G7. The US and China recently asked the OECD to oversee a peer review of each other’s subsidy programme. Whitley said another significant change from the G7 was the excision of a past phrase that focused on subsidies for the “consumption” of fuels. She said this meant the G7 could target subsidies for exploration as well, not just the end use."
"An upsurge in new wind, solar and hydro plants and capacity saw renewable energy smash global records last year, according to a report on new supply. Some 147 Gigawatts of renewable electricity came online in 2015 - the largest annual increase ever and as much as Africa’s entire power generating capacity.  Clean energy investment increased to $286bn (£198bn), with solar energy accounting for 56% of the total and wind power for 38%. Overall, more than twice as much money was spent on renewables than on coal and gas-fired power generation ($130bn in 2015), the REN21 global status report found. Christine Lins, REN21’s chief, said: “What is truly remarkable about these results is that they were achieved at a time when fossil fuel prices were at historic lows, and renewables remained at a significant disadvantage in terms of government subsidies. For every dollar spent boosting renewables, nearly four dollars were spent to maintain our dependence on fossil fuels.” For the first time, emerging economies outspent richer nations in the green energy race, with China accounting for a third of the global total. Jamaica, Honduras, Uruguay and Mauritania were among the highest investors, relative to their GDP. African and Latin American countries also set some of the world’s most ambitious targets for clean energy deployment last year, the report says. But the renewables revolution stuttered in many developed countries, with the significant exception of the US. In Europe, investment plummeted by 21% after the withdrawal of policy supports, such as clean energy subsidies and binding targets. Despite this, renewables still provide 44% of the EU’s electricity capacity, and 15% of its final energy consumption.  Jean-François Fauconnier of Climate Action Network Europe said the report should be a “wake up call” to the European commission, spurring increased 2030 renewable goals in a review later this year. “The EU is at risk of missing the ongoing energy revolution and lagging behind other leading economies for decades,” he said.  The UK saw a 25% rise in renewable energy investments last year, the paper finds. But figures for the first quarter of 2016 suggest this may not survive cuts to solar subsidies and a slowdown in onshore wind planning approvals. Industry reactions to the REN21 paper were buoyant, with the Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) hailing news that 173 countries now have renewable energy targets. Steve Sawyer, GWEC’s secretary general said: “A record 63.5 GW of wind power was installed worldwide in 2015, demonstrating the maturity of the sector; and showing how renewables are supplying competitive, reliable and clean energy to fuel economic growth and cut CO2 emissions.” Around the world, 8.1million people are now employed in the clean energy industry - excluding hydropower - 3.5 million of them in China. In the US, more people now work in the solar industry than in oil and gas extraction. While employment in the clean energy sector grew by 6% in 2015, jobs in the oil industry contracted by 18%, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency.  But the fast-maturing renewables sector still has to overcome storage limitations, and the world’s dependence on infrastructure systems geared towards fossil fuels.  Arthouros Zervos, the chair of REN21 said: “The renewables train is barreling down the tracks, but it is running on 20th-century infrastructure – a system based on outdated thinking where conventional baseload is generated by fossil fuels and nuclear power.”  A build-out of decentralised and community-based generation was urgently needed to accelerate the clean energy transition, he said.

"ExxonMobil will face a revolt from some of its biggest and most influential shareholders on Wednesday as they fight to force the world’s largest oil company to open up about the effect of climate change on its future profits. Investors managing more than $10tn (£6.9tn) of assets will vote in favour of a resolution calling on Exxon to “publish an annual assessment of long term portfolio impacts of public climate change policies” following the Paris Agreement to limit the global temperature rise to less than 2C (3.6F).  The resolution up for discussion at Exxon’s annual meeting in Dallas has been proposed by the New York state comptroller, a trustee of the New York State Common Retirement Fund, the third largest US pension fund, and the Church of England.  More than 30 of Exxon’s largest shareholders, including the pension funds of the governments of Norway, Canada and California, Legal & General Investment Management and Schroder’s, have said they will also vote in favour of the motion. Other supporters of the motion include the pension funds of local authority workers in Greater Manchester and Tyne & Wear. Edward Mason, head of responsible investment for the Church Commissioners for England, which manages £6.7bn ($9.8bn) of the Church’s of England’s assets, said he was delighted that so many big institutional investors had come out in favour of the motion. “The resolution is part of a much wider trend following the Paris Agreement for investors to ask companies to improve disclosure on how they are positioned for the risks and opportunities posed by climate change,” he said as he prepared to make the case for the motion at the AGM in Dallas’s Morton H Meyerson symphony center. The resolution is also supported by ISS and Glass Lewis, the world’s leading proxy advice services which advise institutional investors how to vote on such issues.  If passed, the resolution would call for Exxon to publish an annual assessment of how governments’ climate change policies could affect its business and profitability. The resolution states that the company “should analyze the impacts on ExxonMobil’s oil and gas reserves and resources under a scenario in which reduction in demand results from carbon restrictions and related rules or commitments adopted by governments consistent with the globally agreed upon 2 degree target”. Exxon has called on its investors to reject the resolution. The company had tried to block the resolution altogether, but the US Securities and Exchange Commission regulator ruled that it must include the resolution among Wednesday’s votes. Chevron faces a similar vote at its AGM, also on Wednesday. The company told investors it already does enough to inform them about the impacts of climate change policy on it business, and it believes all of its hydrocarbon reserves will still be required to drive prosperity around the world.  “ExxonMobil believes that producing our existing hydrocarbon resources is essential to meeting growing global energy demand,” the company said in its proxy statement to investors. “We enable consumers – especially those in the least-developed and most-vulnerable economies – to pursue higher living standards and greater economic opportunity.” More than 1,000 leading academics have written to Exxon and Chevron’s 20 biggest investors urging them to support the resolutions. Among the signatories are Lord Rees of the University of Cambridge, Professor Bob Eccles from the Harvard Business School and Dr Gernot Wagner of the Harvard University Center for the Environment. Exxon is currently under investigation by New York’s attorney general over claims that it lied to the public and shareholders about the risks of climate change. It follows reports that internal company documents from the 1980s and 90s show Exxon’s in-house scientists were warning company executives about the dangers of climate change, while Exxon was publicly claiming that climate science was not proven. At the time, an Exxon spokesman said: “We unequivocally reject the allegations that ExxonMobil has suppressed climate change research.” Exxon has banned the Guardian from reporting from inside its annual meeting. “We are denying your request because of the Guardian’s lack of objectivity on climate change reporting demonstrated by its partnership with anti-oil and gas activists and its campaign against companies that provide energy necessary for modern life, including newspapers,” a spokesman said. "
"Keep it in the ground, this newspaper has argued for ages on fossil fuels. Then keep out of our annual meeting, replies ExxonMobil. Or, to quote Exxon’s media relations manager, Alan Jeffers: “We are denying your request [to attend Wednesday’s meeting] because of the Guardian’s lack of objectivity on climate change reporting demonstrated by its partnership with anti-oil and gas activists and its campaign against companies that provide energy necessary for modern life, including newspapers.”  Corporate arrogance-cum-hypersensitivity on this scale is rare these days. One suspects Exxon’s board is still cross that it has lost its battle to prevent resolutions on climate change being put to the meeting. The New York State Retirement Fund – backed by investors from around the world – has been allowed by the US Securities & Exchange Commission to table a proposal that would oblige Exxon to publish an annual assessment of the effect on its business of governments’ policies to limit climate change. Oil industry rivals BP, Shell and Statoil have willingly supported and adopted similar proposals. Exxon, by contrast, seems determined to resist, just as it refuses to contemplate the possibility that some of its shareholders may sympathise with the Guardian’s reporting and wish to read a firsthand account of the meeting. Grow up."
"I note your recent correspondence on church roofs and solar panels (Letters, 19 May). Gloucester cathedral has recently been awarded a substantial grant for Project Pilgrim phase one: the heart of Gloucester from the Heritage Lottery Fund. Project Pilgrim is a £6m restoration and improvement project to help the cathedral to fulfil its role as a dynamic place of spiritual, community and heritage activity. A key part of the proposals fully supports the Church of England’s Shrinking the Footprint campaign as we will install approximately 200 solar panels on the cathedral’s nave roof. Gloucester will be the oldest cathedral to embrace this very modern technology, and we have been running a successful Sponsor Our Solar Panels campaign over the last six months to raise the £54,000 necessary to take this significant step to becoming a greener and more sustainable organisation. We are delighted to have raised £47,341 and are now looking for the last donations to take us to our target. Work will begin in the autumn and we should be able to generate around 25% of the main cathedral electricity from our new panels, including power for our air source heat system. Our remaining supply will continue to have a zero carbon footprint via green purchasing. The installation will also form the basis for the development of a green volunteers group. We have had overwhelming support for this move towards renewable energy from Gloucester diocese, partners and the local community.The Very Rev Stephen LakeDean of Gloucester • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com"
"Global warming will create hundreds of millions of climate change migrants by the end of the century if governments do not act, France’s environment minister has warned. Ségolène Royal told ministers from 170 countries at the UN environment assembly in Nairobi that climate change was linked to conflicts, which in turned caused migration.  “Climate change issues lead to conflict, and when we analyse wars and conflicts that have taken place over the last few years we see some are linked to an extent to climate change, drought is linked to food security crises,” she said. “The difficulty of having access to food resources leads to massive migration, south-south migration [migration within developing countries]. The African continent is particularly hit by this south-south migration. “If nothing is done to combat the negative impact of climate change, we will have hundreds of millions of climate change migrants by the end of the century.” Royal’s comments followed dramatic footage from the southern Mediterranean of a people smuggler’s boat capsizing with scores of migrants on board. The Italian navy rescued 550 migrants from the water.  The latest incident served to highlight the flow of people from Syria and North Africa into Europe. The International Organisation for Migration estimates that 39,000 people have been pulled from the sea since the beginning of the year. Royal is not the first high profile public figure to link conflict, migration and climate change. Ahead of the Paris climate summit last year, Prince Charles said that drought exacerbated by climate change had played a role in Syria’s civil war, a claim supported by some researchers. Royal also called on countries to start implementing last year’s historic Paris deal. “The Paris climate change conference was an important turning point, and today it is your responsibility to contribute towards implementing it,” she said. “Acting for the climate is acting at the roots of these [humanitarian] issues.” Uhuru Kenyatta, the Kenyan president, said that Kenya was already tackling emissions through a renewable energy push that includes wind, geothermal, hydro and, in the future, solar power. But he warned: “We have to be ready and willing to make selfless sacrifices today if we want to leave our children and grandchildren a viable and better world tomorrow.” In November, Royal will pass the baton of the international climate talks to Morocco, which is hosting the next big UN climate summit in Marrakech, following a fortnight of talks in Bonn which end on Thursday. Rachib Firadi, head of international cooperation in the Moroccan environment ministry, said that he wanted to speed up the ratification of the Paris deal, and that adaptation to climate change would be a big focus of the Marrakech summit. “We have to restore the balance between adaptation and mitigation. We need to take adaptation seriously. We also hope Marrakech [the next summit] will provide some money, some fast start financing, for adaptation for developing countries,” he said. Morocco faced a danger of internal migration because of rising temperatures in its deserts, he said, and its desert peoples should be treated as though they were at the same risk as those on small island states threatened by sea level rises. “There is a risk of displacement of those people in the desert,” he said. That internal movement of people would be on top of the existing migration from sub-Saharan countries, he said. “You can see migrants in all Morocco cities right now, and it has a social and economic impact. The government is trying to integrate them, but it’s not easy.” Morocco has ambitious wind and solar power plans, and in February switched on the first phase of what will be the world’s largest concentrated solar power when complete, capable of providing power for 1.1m people."
"A sky crisscrossed with contrails from high-flying aircraft is a familiar sight in Britain and North America. Depending on the weather conditions these can merge into a blanket of high cloud that at times can be dense enough to blot out the sun. Understanding exactly what this does to the climate is still work in progress, but it’s generally agreed that in these areas where the aircraft are constantly pouring out pollution the contrails make the nights warmer by acting as a blanket and the days cooler by reflecting sunlight back into space. Some studies suggest that over 30 years, these contrails will raise average surface temperature by as much as 1C, a serious magnification of global warming.  The length of the contrails and how long they survive depends how dry the atmosphere is when the exhaust gases from the aircraft are released. They can disappear in seconds, but the more moisture there is in the atmosphere the slower they are to disperse. Sometimes when the air is fairly turbulent the contrails appear to be turned on and off, because there are gaps. It is these intermittent contrails that have led to a conspiracy theory that they are in fact “chemtrails”. Depending on which internet site you read, they are part of a large-scale experiment to alter the climate, or worse, dose the population in chemicals to keep them docile.  Surveys show that up to 15% of the population think there is something in these claims. This is a small number, but a statistic that is alarming researchers who worry about how much public trust in governments has waned.      "
"There are two butterfly summers underway in Britain right now. If you have the good fortune to be a silver-studded blue or a large skipper in the West Country you are leaping out of your chrysalis and dancing in the sunshine. If you were unlucky enough to be an egg laid in eastern England you are still stuck in the pupal stage, perhaps so chilled and damp you will never take to the skies.  The split weather system over recent weeks means that there are, as yet, no discernible country-wide trends for butterflies this year. In general, climate change is encouraging an earlier emergence of adult butterflies, which is borne out in the west this season. The Lulworth skipper is now flying on the Dorset coast, two months before its typical flight time back in the 1980s. Similarly, my old guidebook from 1986 has the silver-studded blue’s typical flight season being in July. Over in East Anglia, my patch, there is no evidence of early emergences with many butterflies – including most swallowtails, which should be all over the Norfolk Broads by now – stuck in the pupal stage. Still, in the east we can at least witness butterflies’ ingenious responses to fickle weather. The swallowtail’s pupae can survive being submerged under water. These are almost impossible to find but in awful weather over the past few days I’ve still discovered brilliantly camouflaged orange tip caterpillars clinging to the slender seed pods of garlic mustard.  The best protected caterpillar I’ve seen is the red admiral, which bites and folds a nettle leaf to make itself a little tent, where it shelters from predators and rain, waiting for brighter times.

"Schools in Portland, Oregon, have voted to abandon textbooks that “express doubt about the severity of the climate crisis or its root in human activities”. The resolution follows a proposal by environmental groups put to the Portland public schools board, which argued that “it is time for school districts to redefine what it means to educate students for a future of certain climate change”. Stating that “there is overwhelming consensus in the scientific community that the climate crisis is created by human beings”, the proposal said that it was “essential that in their classes and other school activities students probe the causes and consequences of the climate crisis – as well as possible solutions – in developmentally appropriate ways”.  In testimony to the board reported by the Portland Tribune, Bill Bigelow, editor of Rethinking Schools magazine, criticised science textbooks’ use of words such as “might”, “may” and “could” when referring to climate change. He quoted the textbook Physical Science as saying that “carbon dioxide emissions from motor vehicles, power plants and other sources, may contribute to global warming”. “This is a section that could be written by the Exxon public relations department and it’s being taught in Portland schools,” said Bigelow, according to the Portland paper. “A lot of the text materials are kind of thick with the language of doubt, and obviously the science says otherwise. We don’t want kids in Portland learning material courtesy of the fossil fuel industry.” Writing in the Huffington Post, Bigelow also pointed to another text used for “almost all” Portland high school students, Holt McDougal’s Modern World History, which he said “includes a scant three paragraphs on climate change, the second of which begins: ‘Not all scientists agree with the theory of the greenhouse effect.’”  The proposal, wrote Bigelow, is the “product of a months-long effort by teachers, parents, students, and climate justice activists to press the Portland school district to make ‘climate literacy’ a priority”. The Tribune reported that a student at Portland’s Lincoln high school also testified to the board. She said that “it is unacceptable that we have textbooks in our schools that spread doubt about the human causes and urgency of the crisis”, because “climate education is not a niche or a specialisation, it is the minimum requirement for my generation to be successful in our changing world”. The board voted unanimously to pass the proposal, saying that the implementation plan should include a review of current textbooks “for accuracy around the severity of the climate crisis and the impact of human activities”. It added that Portland public schools will abandon the use of “any adopted text material that is found to express doubt about the severity of the climate crisis or its root in human activities”. In February, a survey of 1,500 science teachers in the US published in the journal Science found that 30% were teaching students that climate change was “likely due to natural causes” and not caused by human activities, despite the consensus of 97% of active climate scientists."

"With patches of lawn on fire in the front yards of his neighbourhood’s suburban homes and flames rising up the trees at the back, Jared Sabovitch frantically got into his car and began driving away from his home in Fort McMurray, Alberta, the Canadian city recently overtaken by wildfires. “Hasty exit,” he said as he drove, the phone in his hand recording a video he would later post to Instagram. “That might have been the last time I ever saw my house, right there.”  Sabovitch fled along with roughly 90,000 other residents, making this the largest evacuation on record in Canada. Red smoke and flames filled the sky behind him as he drove away. The wildfire has now burned more than half a million acres, and continues to spread. Most of Fort McMurray was spared destruction, but 2,400 homes fell to the fire, Sabovitch’s included. That a wildfire would roll through this northern, boreal forest-shrouded oil boomtown was not inevitable, but it was not surprising either. “When you look at satellite images of Fort McMurray from before and after the fire, you can see that because of the urbanisation that went on there, the city has encroached into the surrounding forestland,” says Heiko Balzter, director of the Centre for Landscape and Climate Research at the University of Leicester. Where there are forests, there are fires. In 1950, this same part of Canada was engulfed in a wildfire that burned for five months straight, putting nearly 4 million acres of forest up in smoke. “So this fire is not even huge by historic standards,” says Stephen J Pyne, a fire expert and professor at Arizona State University. “The reason it’s significant is that, unlike 1950, there’s a relatively modern community right in the middle of it.” There’s no definitive list of the world’s most fire-prone cities, mostly because of the many and often compounding factors that can increase the likelihood of fires. As well as the growing vulnerability caused by climate change and poor urban management, other factors range from the prevalence of dry vegetation and use of flammable building materials to widespread open-flame cooking and, all too frequently, arson. But there is one relatively straightforward indicator of fire risk that can be tracked and mapped. It’s what researchers and foresters call the wildland-urban interface: areas where naturally fire-prone wilderness areas such as forests and shrublands are close to, or even intermingled with, housing developments, neighbourhoods or even – as in the case of Fort McMurray – entire cities. The US Forest Service recently released a detailed report and map of the country’s wildland-urban interfaces, made by comparing satellite imagery with housing and population data from the US Census. In total, about one-third of its houses and population are in a wildland-urban interface zone, according to the report’s lead author, Sebastian Martinuzzi from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. “That’s a huge number,” he says, attributing much of it to exurban sprawl and the desire to live close to nature in locations such as the fringes of Los Angeles, the “front range” of Colorado, and exurban parts of Texas and Florida. Not all of these houses and people are at risk of a fire, Martinuzzi says, but many could be given the right conditions. For Fort McMurray, those conditions were created by the recent El Niño weather pattern, which caused much of Alberta to experience a drier-than-normal winter, then an earlier-than-normal fire season amid higher-than-normal temperatures. In Europe, the wildland-urban interface is also widespread, according to a new map created by a team led by Heiko Balzter. He says the abandonment of agricultural areas and the encroachment of shrublands are creating swathes of unmanaged land covered with abundant fuel for fires. Coupled with the growth of densely built suburban and tourist towns – notably in Lisbon and other parts of Portugal, Provence and southern France, coastal southern Spain and throughout Greece – the risk of destructive fires in these interface zones is high. “Those areas of the Mediterranean are predicted to receive less rainfall in the future and become hotter,” Balzter says. “So under climate change, leaving aside the whole issue of wildland-urban interface, this whole area is under higher risk from fire anyway.” Fire has also been identified as one of the key “resilience challenges” in the metropolitan district of Quito, Ecuador, where seismic activity, floods and wildfires occur regularly. In 2012 alone, around 2,600 forest fires were reported there. The interrelatedness of the wildland-urban edge and climate change is well-known in Australia, too, where extreme weather is common and its major cities are often closely surrounded by mostly rural lands. Australia has suffered a number of devastating wildfires that have impacted many developed parts of the country, including the metropolitan areas of Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra. The most recent of these major fires were the so-called “Black Saturday” bushfires of 2009, on the outskirts of Melbourne. Fuelled by a long drought and exceptionally high temperatures, the fires burned more than half a million acres, destroyed more than 2,000 homes, and killed 173 people on a single day. They were the worst bushfires in the country’s history, which is replete with destructive and deadly fires dating back more than 150 years. Being in a relatively sparsely populated country, Australia’s fires can seem somewhat less significant than the major urban fires humanity has endured in recent centuries. The Great Fire of London in 1666 devastated the city north of the Thames, destroying more than 13,000 easily combustible timber-and-pitch homes. The Great Chicago Fire of 1871 destroyed an estimated 70,000 buildings – more than half of a city where not only the homes but also many of the roads and sidewalks were built of wood. And in the aftermath of the 1906 earthquake, the city of San Francisco burned for four days straight, destroying most of the city’s wooden buildings and killing an estimated 3,000 people. A city built of mostly wooden structures is “basically a reconstituted forest”, says Pyne, “and so they burn exactly like a forest” – spreading quickly and easily. These days, of course, less flammable building materials are much more widely used, better fire codes have been developed to guide building practices, and urban planners have established rules for reducing the spread of fire and easing access for robustly-equipped firefighters. As a result, cities across the developed world experience wildfires only very rarely. “If you’re looking at modern cities of industrial society, it would take something like an earthquake or war to break down the system to the point where you have large urban fires,” says Pyne. Outside these modern, developed cities, however, the risk of large fires rises significantly. “What you’re dealing with here is two types of wildfire: there’s the ‘western’ fire, and there’s the ‘developing’ fire,” says Greg Bankoff, professor of history at the University of Hull and editor of Flammable Cities: Urban Conflagration and the Making of the Modern World. Fire happens differently in the cities of the developing world, where pressures from urban growth are packing more people into sections of cities that are unable or unprepared to handle them during emergency situations. Informal settlements and shanty towns only increase the risk of fire, due to high population densities, a high prevalence of open flames and improvised stoves, wood- and scrap-based construction materials and a tightly packed urban footprint that allows fire to spread quickly. Bankoff says the statistics on fires in informal settlements aren’t tracked well, but they’re regular and often at a scale that affects thousands of residents. A fire last month in Delhi gutted 400 huts, while more recent fires destroyed the shanties of around 70 families in Dhaka, and more than 60 families in a São Paulo favela. A major township fire in Cape Town last year burned nearly 1,000 shacks and displaced roughly 4,000 people. “I lost my entire savings,” a slum dweller in south Delhi told the Deccan Herald after a fire in 2014 destroyed his home and 4,000 others. “Nothing much is left, except some clothes and slippers. All our identity proofs are also gone.” Another fire the summer before burned 400 homes. Death by fire in the slums is a common occurrence. Any city with informal settlements is susceptible to large fires: “Cities in India, cities in Africa, you can take your pick really,” Bankoff says. “They’re all particularly fire prone.” Go beyond the informal settlements, however, and the risk of multi-building fires drops significantly. “It’s almost like there are two cities within a city,” says Bankoff.  When people can afford flame-resistant building materials, when codes and plans guide development with fire risk in mind, when resources have been dedicated to respond to fires before they can spread, the large urban fire, spreading and displacing hundreds or even thousands, is rare if not unheard of. “The solution is really hardening the structures, changing the building patterns, altering the zoning arrangements so that the area’s simply less susceptible to being hit with multiple fires like this,” says Pyne. “But that’s a hard sell. That’s a political decision that has to be made.” For the informal city to attain the same level of fire safety as the formal city, or for the exurban dwellers of the wildland-urban interface to be as safe as those in the central city, better policies and smarter land management is needed to control what gets built where, how it’s built, and when the line between city and wilderness should be drawn firm. Unless development happens in a way that better recognises and plans around the risk of fire, some cities will continue to burn – with devastating consequences.

"     One of the justifications for fracking is the use of natural gas as a bridging fuel between coal and a low-carbon future. However natural gas is mostly methane, which has strong global warming impacts in its own right. Natural gas therefore only provides climate benefits over coal if the leakage is no more than 2-3%. We cannot measure leaks from every pipe joint. One alternative is to measure the sum of lots of leaks from a distance. Flights over US shale gas fields reveal large methane sources, but these areas also have cattle farms that produce methane and the two sources need to be separated.  Shale gas also contains ethane, which does not come from farming. Looking at ethane and methane together, shale gas and oil extraction were found to be easily the dominant source giving leak rates of 0.18-2.8% even before the gas was distributed to users. Some active drilling areas were notable super-emitters. Ethane from shale gas and oil extraction is bringing its own problems. Ozone, synonymous with Los Angeles smog, is a normally a summer pollutant, but in Utah, high levels have been measured in winter for the first time. Here leaked ethane built up in cold, still air and interacted with low-angle sunlight. Ethane can remain in the air for around two months, making it a global pollutant. Ethane measured from the top of the Swiss Alps has been rising since the start of large scale US shale gas extraction in 2009, indicating an increase in the global methane leakage from natural gas.

"The forerunners of ExxonMobil patented technologies for electric cars and low emissions vehicles as early as 1963 – even as the oil industry lobby tried to squash government funding for such research, according to a trove of newly discovered records. Patent records reveal oil companies actively pursued research into technologies to cut carbon dioxide emissions that cause climate change from the 1960s – including early versions of the batteries now deployed to power electric cars such as the Tesla.  Scientists for the companies patented technologies to strip carbon dioxide out of exhaust pipes, and improve engine efficiency, as well as fuel cells. They also conducted research into countering the rise in carbon dioxide emissions – including manipulating the weather.  Esso, one of the precursors of ExxonMobil, obtained at least three fuel cell patents in the 1960s and another for a low-polluting vehicle in 1970, according to the records. Other oil companies such as Phillips and Shell also patented technologies for more efficient uses of fuel. However, the American Petroleum Institute, the main oil lobby, opposed government funding of research into electric cars and low emissions vehicles, telling Congress in 1967: “We take exception to the basic assumption that clean air can be achieved only by finding an alternative to the internal combustion engine.” And ExxonMobil funded a disinformation campaigned aimed at discrediting scientists and blocking government efforts to fight climate change for more than 50 years, before publicly disavowing climate denial in 2008. The patent records were among a new trove of documents published on Thursday by the Center for International Environmental Law, and deepen the legal and public relations challenge for Exxon.  “What we saw was an array of patent technologies that demonstrated that these companies had the technologies they needed and could have commercialised to help address the problem of C02 pollution,” said Carroll Muffett, president of the Ciel. “They then turned to Congress and said you don’t need to invest in electrical vehicle research because the research is ongoing and it’s robust.” The findings echo those in the documentary Who Killed the Electric Car?, which explored the deliberate destruction of GM’s first electric vehicles.  Alan Jeffers, an Exxon spokesman, insisted he could not comment directly on the documents as he was unable to access the Center for International Environmental law website on which they were published on Thursday morning. In an emailed statement, Jeffers said: “The Guardian gave us only a few hours to comment on documents from four decades ago.” Jeffers went on: “This further illustrates the Guardian’s well-established bias on climate change issues which has been demonstrated previously through its keep it in the ground campaign.” He said the company believed the risks of climate change were real, was researching lower emission technologies, and engaged in “constructive dialogue” with policy makers about energy and climate change. Researchers discovered more than 20 such patents filed by oil companies from as early as the 1940s for technologies that could help in the development of electric cars. However, Ron Dunlop, president of Sun Oil and API chairman, told a joint hearing of the commerce committee in 1967 that government funding of research into electric cars would be misplaced – because the oil companies were so advanced in their research of cleaner cars. “We in the petroleum industry are convinced that by the time a practical electric car can be mass produced and marketed, it will not enjoy any meaningful advantage from an air pollution standpoint,” he told Congress. “Emissions from internal-combustion engines will have long since been controlled.” Muffett said the findings were the result of three years of research and were not exhaustive.  “The question is what did they do to try to commercialise these technologies, knowing what they did about climate change,” he went on. The revelations, the second set of documents released by Muffett’s organisation, reinforce charges by campaigners that Exxon was well aware that the burning of fossil fuels was a main driver of climate change – despite its public posture of doubt. In addition to the technologies with potential for electric cars, Exxon and other oil companies were actively researching methods to cut emissions of carbon dioxide – the main greenhouse gas.  In another historic document that surfaced last month, a Canadian subsidiary of Exxon admitted the company had the technology to cut carbon emissions in half. However, the corporate memo dating from 1977 said it would be prohibitively expensive – doubling the cost of electricity generation, according to the documents obtained by Desmog blog. New York and 17 other attorneys general, including DC and the US Virgin Islands, are investigating whether the oil company lied to investors and the public about the threat of climate change. Campaigners plan to further turn up the heat on the company next week when Exxon holds its annual shareholder meeting in Dallas. Campaigners have argued for more than a decade that Exxon bankrolled a network of front groups and conservative think tanks aimed at discrediting well-established science – confusing the public and delaying governments efforts to cut the greenhouse gas emissions responsible for warming. Those efforts to put Exxon on the spot gathered pace after Inside Climate News and the Los Angeles Times reported that the company’s own scientists knew as early as the 1970s that greenhouse gases caused climate change. The attorney general of the US Virgin Islands has subpoenaed Exxon to turn over email, documents and statements over the last decades. Exxon has dismissed the investigations as politically motivated.  However, the company has reversed its opposition to fuel cell technology. Earlier this month, the company announced it had been conducting a joint research effort on fuel cell power plants with FuelCell. The initiative, which got underway in 2011, aims to route the carbon dioxide from fossil fuel burning power plants into fuel cells, producing low emissions electricity. The company has estimated it can cut 90% of carbon dioxide emissions.   “At ExxonMobil, we share the view that the risks of climate change are serious and warrant thoughtful action,” Rex Tillerson, Exxon’s chief executive, told the US Energy Association after receiving its annual award."
"Greg Hunt has conducted one of the strangest manoeuvres of his already rather gymnastic career, over the erasure of Australia from a United Nations report on climate change.  Guardian Australia had broken the story that all mentions of Australia and the Great Barrier Reef had been scrubbed from the report at the request of the environment department.   Hunt first denied knowing about it but then justified the move with reasons that went beyond those provided by the department.   In fact the full draft report, obtained exclusively by Guardian Australia, reveals many of the mentions of Australia were positive – but their removal turned what would have been a relatively good news story into an international scandal. The environment department admitted it had requested the removal of the references. The report would have affected tourism by causing “considerable confusion”, it said. Last year Unesco was on the verge of designating the Great Barrier Reef “in danger”. But, after intense lobbying from Australia, and an increased commitment to deal with water pollution, the UN body decided not to do so for the time being. The department implied that mentioning the reef in the latest report might make people think Unesco had changed its mind about the “in danger” listing.  Under Labor, the Great Barrier Reef was on-track to be listed as 'in danger'. It came off the 'watch list' under us. pic.twitter.com/p814Jti6fS However, the report listed dozens of sites around the world that are at risk due to climate change – most of which were not on the “in danger” list. And, moreover, everyone – even the Australian government – accepts that the greatest risk to the Great Barrier Reef is climate change. The department’s reasoning was a flawed interpretation of the situation. But the minister’s went further.  Within hours of Guardian Australia breaking the story, Hunt went on Network Ten’s The Project to defend his bureaucrats’ move.  Not only was Unesco’s report potentially “confusing”, he said, it contradicted Unesco’s statements about the reef when it decided not to list it as “in danger”. The missing section of the report on the reef was “at odds with what the highest body in the United Nations system had said”, Hunt claimed. He said his department simply highlighted to Unesco that this was the case and the UN body decided to “realign with the overarching view of its own global umpire”. Apparently the only way Unesco could do that was to delete every reference to Australia in the 108-page report, making it the only continent in the world not to feature (even Antarctica had a passing mention). Hunt is wrong, for several reasons. First, Unesco did not say it had made a mistake in the initial report and thus decided to “realign” with earlier statements. Rather, in a statement to Guardian Australia, a Unesco spokesman said: “At the request of the government of Australia, references to Australian sites were removed from the report.” It declined to comment further on the matter. (However the saga also raises serious questions about Unesco’s processes and the integrity of its reports.) Second, and most important, the deleted section on the reef was completely in line with everything Unesco had previously said about it. Despite last year’s decision not to list the reef as “in danger”, Unesco was far from positive about the health of the reef and clear about the fact that climate change was potentially a dire risk for its health. Unesco said right at the top of its decision that the overall outlook for the reef was “poor” and that climate change was a serious threat.  Nothing in Unesco’s decision or reasoning contradicted the censored sections of the recent report in the slightest. In fact – and this is what makes Hunt’s reasoning all the more bizarre – the new report was among the most positive of its kind. Unesco – as well as many other organisations – has regularly produced reports detailing the threat climate change poses to the reef. As long ago as 2007, a Unesco report on climate change and world heritage said: “The consequence of this [climate] change is a drastic shrinkage of appropriate habitats for coral reefs in the region.” Mass bleaching events would become an annual event before the end of the century, it said. But the new report, before being thoroughly scrubbed of all references to Australia, was littered with positive statements about the management of the reef. It singled Australia out as a rare example of a country that has carried out climate risk assessments for its world heritage sites. Deleted. It said the Great Barrier Reef was one of only two sites where managers had “attempted to comprehensively integrate both climate change and tourism into long-term sustainability planning”. Deleted. And: “In the case of the Great Barrier Reef, a ground-breaking climate change action strategy for tourism has been developed.” Deleted. And again: “A model example of a tourism and climate adaptation strategy was collaboratively developed for the Great Barrier Reef in 2009 by protected area managers, scientists and public and private tourism stakeholders.” Deleted. The section on the reef includes an entire subsection praising the government’s moves to reduce water pollution. It is a strange notion that Hunt could have thought this negatively contradicted earlier Unesco comments on the reef.  The department’s decision to suppress the report turned one of the most positive stories about the reef into an international scandal. And Hunt compounded the damage by endorsing it in such a bizarre fashion. "
"The Queensland Labor government will bankroll projects by coastal councils to mitigate the effects of rising sea levels, less than two years after its Liberal National predecessor banned mentions of climate change impacts from planning policy. The Palaszczuk government has set up a modest $12m fund, launching it in Redcliffe, north of Brisbane, which it said was “one of the communities on the frontline in the battle against the worst predicted effects” of rising sea levels.  Redcliffe is located within the Moreton Bay regional council, which former deputy premier Jeff Seeney ordered to remove all references to climate-driven sea level rises from its regional plan in November 2014. Seeney’s legally binding direction that the council “remove any assumption about a theoretical projected sea level rise from all and any provision of the scheme” prompted concerns from the Local Government Association of Queensland (LGAQ) about insurance and future liabilities. Steven Miles, the Queensland environment minister, said Seeney’s move caused “a legal and insurance nightmare” and the state’s new funding for mitigation returned “certainty for local governments”. “The science is clear that by 2100 we can expect a projected sea level rise of 0.8 metres, cyclone intensity may increase and possibly track further south more often,” Miles said. “That means accelerated coastal erosion, permanent inundation of low-lying areas and an increase in the areas impacted by storm surge and king tides.” Moreton Bay regional council mayor, Allan Sutherland, said the funding was welcome for a council that “with more than 150km of coastline … is committed to minimising, where possible, the community’s exposure to coastal hazards”. Sutherland last year signed a statutory declaration stating that Seeney, who claimed his move was to protect residents’ property development rights, told him in a meeting that climate change was a “semi-religious belief”.  Margaret de Wit, the president of the LGAQ, said the organisation was looking for “a value for money approach which gets affected councils working together to minimise the risks associated with coastal hazards”."
"An alliance of companies including Ikea, Nestle and Heathrow airport have called on the EU to pass new laws cutting truck emissions within two years, to meet promises made at the Paris climate conference. Heavy duty vehicles make up less than 5% of Europe’s road traffic but chug out a quarter of the sector’s carbon emissions – more than airplanes – and their fuel efficiency has hardly changed in two decades.  The EU’s climate commissioner Miguel Arias Cañete has said that fuel efficiency targets for vehicles after 2020 are “essential” and a commission paper in July is expected to signal that they will be brought forward. In a letter to the EU president Jean-Claude Juncker, seen by the Guardian, the clean corporate alliance says that CO2 test procedures and emissions monitoring alone will not kickstart the market for low carbon freight transport. “Meeting the EU’s 2030 climate targets as well as the more challenging targets agreed in Paris, will require major efforts in the transport and road freight sector,” the letter says. “We therefore call on you to propose post-2020 standards that reduce the CO2 emissions and fuel consumption of new trucks and trailers.” The missive, which is also signed by DHL, Philips, Kingfisher and Schenker urges the EU “to make a proposal to introduce [fuel economy] standards within the next two years.” Road transport accounts for around a fifth of Europe’s greenhouse gases and Europe is unlikely to meet its Paris pledge of a 40% cut in carbon emissions by 2030 without curbing them. CO2 pollution from heavy duty vehicles rose 36% between 1990 and 2010 due to increased freight traffic. No fall is expected before 2050, without new regulations.  Bart Vandewaetere, Nestle’s assistant vice president told the Guardian: “Increasing fuel efficiency of trucks will give the transport industry the required boost to further reduce overall CO2 emissions after 2020, when most of the other options have been fully exploited.” Nestle has pledged to cut its own fuel consumption and emissions by 10% above statutory commitments in the next four years, compared to 2014 levels.  The EU views mandatory CO2 per km targets as “the most apparent option” to curb greenhouse gas emissions from trucks but modern infrastructure, alternative fuels, taxes and road pricing could also play a part. The car industry has proposed several alternative measures to mandatory post-2020 targets, arguing that they are already being stretched to the limit by current standards.  Kasper Peters, a spokesman for the European automobile manufacturers association said: “Considering the complexity of the truck market with several thousand shapes and sizes, introducing legislation suitable for all variations is extremely challenging. There simply is no ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach for heavy duty vehicles.” The European commission is now in the process of finalising methodologies for measuring and regulating truck emissions, as has been done in the US, Japan and China.  Fuel efficiency for cars and vans has already improved dramatically as the EU has ratcheted up CO2 limits, which are set to hit 95 grams of CO2 per km in 2020. But the performance of brand-leading trucks such as Volvo’s FH460 and Scania R450LA trucks have only improved over past models by 0.4 litres per 100km of motorway driving, in the last 20 years. Two years ago, the EU adopted its first strategy to cut CO2 emissions from trucks, buses and coaches but the first obligations to measure and report their greenhouse gas performance will not take effect until 2017. William Todts, freight director of the Transport & Environment group, said: “More fuel efficient trucks will save hauliers money, boost the economy and protect the environment. It’s time for the Juncker commission to follow the example of the US, China and Japan and set ambitious truck fuel economy standards.”"

"An unprecedented level of coordination between climate activists and conservation groups is aiming to raise the profile of climate change in this year’s election. A coalition of groups has been organising tactics aimed at engaging both politicians and voters with climate change for the 2 July election.  The tactics involve a combination of stunts, forums and an attempt to use members to have 130,000 conversations with voters before the election. “I don’t think the climate movement has ever worked together this closely in the lead up to an election campaign before,” said Daniel Spencer a campaigner and media coordinator at the Australian Youth Climate Coalition (AYCC). “The level of coordination between environment groups is, I think, unprecedented,” confirmed Paul Sinclair, campaigns director at the Australian Conservation Foundation. Polling commissioned by the groups suggested their campaigns could have a significant impact on the election, with the majority of swinging voters saying they were likely to be influenced by parties’ policies on climate change. Behind the scenes, the groups’ tactics were being coordinated through a peak body, the Climate Action Network Australia (Cana), which liaises between the groups and coordinates their actions.  Members of Cana range from small community groups in suburbs and country towns, through to the largest non-government bodies such as WWF and Greenpeace. Through the network, groups were able to create coordinated campaigns, and make sure they did not overlap or leave large gaps between campaigns. “We’re conscious that we’re just more effective if we don’t double up and if we can look for gaps in what we’re doing,” said Blair Palese, chief executive of 350.org Australia. She said Cana has been central in making that possible. Claire O’Rourke, national director of Solar Citizens, said the movement was better organised this election because of the pressing need for action. “I think that need is well recognised across all sectors of the community – and industry actually.” She said the coordination often amounted to simple things, like avoiding having events on at the same time. But it was also about coordinating to amplify their message. “It’s also so that we’re aligned in what we’re calling for. And we’re also checking in on how we might respond to announcements,” said O’Rourke. Most of the groups contacted by Guardian Australia were focused on some combination of either seats held by members thought to be blocking action on climate change and seats held by political leaders who they might be able to influence. They were also mobilising their members to influence other voters, while some were also trying to increase votes for senate candidates who have committed to strong action on climate change. 350.org, for example, had a campaign of “unblocking the climate blockers”. The group was encouraging members in seats where the sitting member was a known climate sceptic or was trying to stop action on climate change, and either pressuring them or drawing attention to their positions on climate change. “Last week there were 40 events around the country, mostly in areas where the sitting member was a blocker or denier of climate change,” said 350.org’s Palese. “It’s the beginning of just trying to put climate change on the agenda and tell the candidates that there is a basis of support for climate change, and it’s being ignored.” One of those actions involved the hanging of a giant plunger above Tony Abbott’s electorate office, and a banner saying “unblock the climate blockers”. That tactic was being complemented by the work of Solar Citizens, which was also focusing on seats where the sitting member was seen to be blocking the transition renewable energy. But Solar Citizens was also focusing on seats where they had a lot of members, and ones where the sitting member was in a leadership position, in the hope they could influence them. “Solar owners are a very powerful voice because there’s 1.5m solar homes, but if you look at the top 25 marginal electorates, there are enough solar homes in every single one of those electorates that could decide the outcome,” said O’Rourke. They were planning community forums in Peter Dutton’s seat of Dickson and Malcolm Turnbull’s seat of Wentworth. “The prime minister is invited,” said O’Rourke. Meanwhile, many of the groups were combining forces, asking their members to door-knock their local area. Several groups were producing scorecards, which rated the candidates for their positions on climate change. The AYCC would be deploying a raft of similar tactics, said Spencer. In addition, they would hold forums in South Australia focussed on Senate voting, encouraging people to vote for candidates with strong policies on climate change. It wasn’t just the newer groups like 350.org, Solar Citizens and AYCC that were coordinating and using these strategies, but also the largest and oldest groups. The Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF), the oldest conservation group in Australia, was planning to mobilise its membership, producing a “voter pledge” and asking members to get others to sign it, making a commitment to vote for a candidate who would protect the environment. ACF would also be targeting particular seats, mostly those it had identified as likely to be most affected by climate change, Sinclair said. Several of the groups are planning a national day of action on 28 May co-ordinated through Cana, door-knocking in electorates around the country. By the end of the campaign, the groups have a target of door-knocking 30,000 houses and speaking on the phone with 100,000 more. And if the group’s own polling was anything to go by, this sort of coordinated campaign could have a big impact this election. A ReachTEL survey of 2,401 people across Australia on 9 May found more than 56% of voters thought the government needed to do more to address climate change. But among voters who said they might change their vote, that number was even higher at 65.6%. Similarly, 64% of voters – and 74.5% of those who might change their vote – said they were more likely to vote for a party that had a plan to secure 100% of Australia’s energy from renewable sources. And similar numbers were seen when respondents were asked about voting for a party that created stronger laws to protect species and places like the Great Barrier Reef. According to ACF’s Paul Sinclair, the coordination seen now was a sign that the movement had grown-up. But it was also a result of the urgency of action on climate change, the lack of action being taken at a national level, and, ironically, the government’s attack on the income stream of environmental groups. Under Tony Abbott, the Coalition began a move to strip environmental groups of their charitable status which allows them to receive tax-deductible donations. “The Abbott-Turnbull’s government’s decision to launch an attack on the rights of environmental organisations to advocate for the environment is something that has perhaps ironically enabled the movement to work very effectively together,” said Sinclair."
"“The biggest company you’ve never heard of” is a label regularly bandied around but is well-deserved by the global trading firm with a name more suited to a household cleaning product: Vitol. You will not hear its name at this week’s Opec meeting in Vienna or have heard it quoted on the subject of the significant rise in oil prices over the past four months, but a Saudi oil minister would know the name Vitol as they would Shell or BP.  Its faceless office-block HQ near Victoria station, London, which it shares with other corporate clients, certainly gives little clue that Vitol (pronounced Veetol) can record larger annual revenues than big corporate firms such as Apple or Volkswagen. It sales last year topped $270bn (£186.2bn). But a Damien Hirst spin painting in the private company’s foyer hints at the wealth-creating potential of the world’s largest energy trader, where staff at one subsidiary are said to have drawn average salaries of £750,000 each in one recent year. Its chief executive Ian Taylor might be a guest at Chequers, on the board of the Royal Opera House and keen to be counted in favour of the remain campaign, but otherwise he is a man who stays out of the limelight. The compact, clean-cut and animated Mancunian – estimated by the Sunday Times Rich List to be worth £175m – has broken cover to lobby openly against EU plans to tighten regulation of commodity trading. He argues: “There is a slight risk that we are being put in the same category as financial derivatives, which will probably mean restrictions on the amount that we can hedge, which will in turn stop us moving so much oil, which in turn will in put the price of energy up in Europe.” Despite past tax and sanctions scrapes, the 59-year-old is keen for Vitol to be seen as a social good rather than some kind of avaricious wheeler and dealer. “I have got nobody doing spec[ulation]. Everyone thinks we spend our lives taking massive punts. But that is just not what we do,” he said. “We are a physical distributor of energy from A to B in the right sizes in the right qualities. We spend a huge amount of time, rightly, on safety and product being on specification. We are very proud of the job we try and do.” Taylor insists that the paper trading by Vitol is only a hedge against the physical trades being undertaken. In fact, he says, the price of oil is neither here nor there for Vitol, which makes much of its profit from the margins between buying and selling. The business also involves some serious hardware, as well as trading screens in its 40 offices worldwide. At any one time, Vitol has 200 ships on charter or under ownership to move some of the almost 270m tonnes of crude and products handled in a year. Vitol also has five oil refineries, 2,700 petrol service stations and even a power plant on Humberside. Oil may be the main commodity bought and sold but there is also coal, iron ore and carbon. Taylor boasts that Vitol was once the biggest mover and shaker in the world of carbon credits until – in his words – the business based round the Emissions Trading Scheme in Europe was “killed” by politicians.  Now that business is banking on a trading scheme in California picking up speed amid wider hopes that the UN climate change deal will finally spur new moves to resuscitate a market collapsed by low prices. Low prices are also a problem in the crude arena. Taylor is surprisingly bearish, believing that crude that was running along at $100 a barrel prior to 2014 is set for up to a decade at $40-$60. What of the future of the hydrocarbons that sit at the centre of Vitol’s fortunes? Unsurprisingly, Taylor, who started his post-Oxbridge career with Shell in the late 1970s, does not buy into the “end of the oil era” narrative beloved by environmentalists. He said: “We still believe that on balance over the next 25 years that oil will be the major transportation fuel in the world and there will be growth – especially per capita, in places such as Africa and India.  “But we see the power sector moving to gas and renewables, the growth in electric cars. Yes, they are likely to come in but will they make sufficient dents in our business so that it is no longer viable? I think, hopefully not.” “But in some ways I am very encouraged we are seeing renewables and electric cars because it reduces the likelihood of a nasty spike in the price of oil, which is incredibly damaging to developing countries.  “You don’t want big spikes, so if oil demand starts to decline on a relative basis I am not sure that is a bad thing on a macro[economic] basis.” But it is hard to imagine Vitol itself moving too far from its core competences. The company reinforced its image as a buccaneering business by sending its tankers into Libya at the height of the civil war. It is also credited with helping Kurdistan reduce its ties with Iraq by providing vessels to carry crude exports originating in the landlocked region, at a time when others were frightened of repercussions from Baghdad. Taylor has experience of the Middle East, having lived as a child in Iran at one stage when his father worked for ICI, but not all his experiences have ended well. Vitol was among the 2,200 companies found guilty in the US of providing illicit payments to government officials under the UN oil-for-food programme. Taylor, who joined Vitol in 1985, insists no bribes were ever paid and that the case was politically motivated.  “The payments were surcharges demanded by the state oil company of Iraq [Somo] from all lifters, and were paid to the account of the national Iraqi oil company. They were neither bribes nor kickbacks.” Vitol has also had scrapes with HM Revenue and Customs over a employee benefit scheme for senior staff it set up but later dismantled. Taylor insists this is a thing of the past and that all 200 UK employees are taxed completely normally: “We are all comfortable paying UK tax.”"
"The US would still meet its obligations under the Paris accord on climate change if Donald Trump were elected president, a senior US administration official has told the Guardian. He said the path of the US towards a lower-carbon economy was already set, and was dependent on market forces that would not easily succumb to political tinkering. “Would [Trump’s policies] shift the emissions trajectory in the United States? That doesn’t look likely. Why not? Because he’s not going to raise the price of gas,” said the State Department official, in an exclusive interview with the Guardian. “Why would he do that? That’s completely anti what he believes.” Trump said this week that he would renege on the landmark Paris agreement on climate change if he were elected president this November. He told Reuters: “At a minimum I will be renegotiating those agreements, at a minimum. And at a maximum I may do something else.” The official was speaking before Trump made his latest remarks, but the presumed Republican nominee has repeatedly taken a sceptical stance on global warming and the current administration’s attempts to forge international cooperation on emissions. Even if Trump were to carry out his declared plans to unroll Barack Obama’s clean power plan, by which power stations must reduce their carbon output, that would not stop the US meeting its commitments to cut emissions under Paris, the administration official said. Scrapping the plan would be unlikely to change the economics of coal so much that it would become cheaper than lower-carbon gas, he said. “He might go back on the agreement in Paris but the net effect for the US is not likely to make much of a difference, if at all, in terms of our trajectory,” the official said. A massive increase in gas use, chiefly from shale sources, has brought down US emissions in the last decade as it has displaced coal use.  “The flip side [of a Trump presidency] is what would happen on renewables,” the official added, but he pointed out that the Republican party had – since the Paris agreement was signed – agreed to extend key incentives for renewable energy. “Do you really think that Trump is going to remove that? Why would he do that?” The official also noted that the Republican-controlled Congress would be unable to unpick the Paris agreement if a Democratic president were elected, because of its legal form. The text was carefully worded so that the president could agree to it without having to seek approval from Congress. As part of its “intended nationally determined contribution” to the Paris accord, the White House vowed to reduce emissions by 26% to 28% compared with 2005 levels by 2025. The contributions, made by nearly every signatory to the agreement, are not legally binding to the extent that the overall framework agreement is binding, which allowed President Obama to sign up to them. But the senior US official – a political appointee whose job will end when Barack Obama leaves the White House, whoever is elected to take over – warned that Trump could change the tenor of international negotiations on climate change, which were marked by an unusual degree of cooperation during the Paris talks last December. Global financial markets are currently gearing up to invest in a lower carbon economy, he said, but the effects of a Trump administration could prove chilling. “If the US administration moves from being an aggressive and supportive player [in tackling climate change] to being much less engaged, either disengaged or actively hostile – [the effects on the market] remain to be seen.” Internationally, a Trump presidency would be likely to create consternation among governments committed to tackling global warming. Laurent Fabius, the former French foreign minister who presided over the Paris talks last December, told an audience in London earlier this month that Trump’s election would derail the Paris agreement. “Think about the impact of the coming US presidential elections,” he urged. “If a climate change denier was to be elected, it would threaten dramatically global action against climate disruption.” Green campaigners in the US also slammed Trump for his remarks. Khalid Pitts, political director of the Sierra Club, said: “This is simply more proof that Trump’s antics would isolate the US around the world only negotiate away American leadership. We can only wonder how a climate science denier is supposed to renegotiate an international climate agreement.” Gene Karpinski, president of the League of Conservation Voters, said: “This is another example of Trump’s dangerous lack of judgement and the very real impacts it could have for all of us. Trump now not only denies the science of climate change, but also the politics and economics of it. America’s leadership in Paris has put the world on the path to a clean energy future that will create jobs and save lives. Fortunately, Trump’s rhetoric is not going to stop the Paris agreement, nor should it given the benefits of action and the costs of ignorance.”"
"A cap on pollution from farms close to the Great Barrier Reef has been proposed by advisers to the Queensland government. The Great Barrier Reef water science taskforce, which advises the Queensland government on how to meet pollution targets on the reef, said sugar cane, grazing and other sectors should be given pollution load limits for their industries in each catchment. It also called for incentives such as auctions for pollution reduction, greater monitoring and regulation, along with “significantly more investment” in the problem.  The Labor state government said it would adopt some of the recommendations immediately, and use the recommendations to guide $90m the government committed to spend on reef water quality before being elected. The report was hailed as a “game changer” by some conservationists, while others called for the costings behind it to be released immediately. Steven Miles, the Queensland environment minister, said: “There are a number of actions recommended by the taskforce that we can begin to implement immediately.”  Among them, the government would spend $33.5m on two projects to limit fertiliser and pesticide runoff from the northern wet tropics, and to limit sediment from the southern Burdekin region. They would also spend $20m to support changes in land management, which would limit pollution, and $11m on greater water quality monitoring, which could provide information to farmers. The majority of water pollution hitting the Great Barrier Reef comes from farms along the rivers that feed into the Queensland coast. Land clearing also increases the amount of sediment pollution.  Minimising water pollution would make coral and seagrass more resilient to the biggest problems the reef faces, as a result of climate change. At a press conference, Queensland’s chief scientist Geoff Garrett, who led the taskforce, reportedly said “we’re stuffed with a capital S” if water quality isn’t improved. 'We're stuffed with a capital S' if we don't manage run off on the reef says Qld Chief Scientist #greatbarrierreef pic.twitter.com/M8AzPmlk7q In a statement Garrett said: “While we acknowledge the efforts to date, it is abundantly clear that more widespread and rapid action is required.” “Achieving the water quality targets in the timescale proposed is likely to be well beyond the funds currently allocated by the Queensland and Australian governments.” The Queensland government had targets of reducing reducing nitrogen pollution by up to 80% and sediment by up to 50% by 2025. The cost of achieving that was the subject of another report, which has been completed but is undergoing review. Jon Brodie, a reef and water quality expert from James Cook University, said the recommendations on water quality were sensible. Imogen Zethoven, the Great Barrier Reef campaign director for the Australian Marine Conservation Society, said that report needed to be released immediately so voters could properly evaluate the commitments parties were making in the federal election campaign. “The public deserves to know what investment is needed to save the reef,” she said. WWF spokesman Sean Hoobin hailed the report as a “game changer”. “A catchment cap on pollution which reduces over time, is needed to ensure the reef gets the clean water it needs to restore its health,” Hoobin said. “A cap is best achieved through federal laws and we are calling for the major parties to announce they would legislate pollution limits to deliver clean water to the reef by 2025.”"
"Donald Trump will have a climate plan and it will be ugly. For now, the Republican frontrunner is pedaling the kind of denialism his party loves, having called global warming everything from a “hoax” to a “con job” to a Chinese plot. But an interview with his energy adviser late last week hinted that – before too long – Trump might endeavor to Make Atmospheric Carbon Levels Great Again. For those interested in a livable and more equal future, that’s not a good thing. “My advice would be, while I’m a skeptic as well”, Trump energy honcho Kevin Cramer told ClimateWire last week, “he is a product of political populism, and political populism believes that there needs [to be] some addressing of climate change”.  Cramer, a North Dakota congressman, is as unlikely an advocate for the planet as Trump. Representing the heart of America’s shale boom – and now bust – he doesn’t stray far from the Republican line on global warming. He also rakes in handsome checks from the oil and gas industry, returning the favor by backing offshore drilling and tens of billions of dollars of investments in coal mining.  Cramer has not had a climate epiphany. He probably just looked at the data. Nearly half of Republicans – and 72% of independents – say they would be less likely to vote for a candidate who thinks climate change is a hoax. A Monmouth University poll found that two-thirds of Americans want to see their government take action on emissions. Today’s populism, it seems, includes a concern for the planet. This is a big win for the climate movement. More Americans than ever see curbing emissions as an imperative. Politicians on both sides of the aisle, including Trump’s inner circle, are taking note. Known for eschewing both party lines and his own past views, Trump may well be the first Republican presidential hopeful in history to make a green leap for votes. Bipartisan support for climate action should be celebrated. Agreeing on the problem, though, is not the same as agreeing on a solution. Defining “climate action” can’t be left to either Trump, the Republicans or the reckless economic dogma that birthed this crisis in the first place. While stopping the bad, as Break Free protests have this May, the movement can place as much emphasis on building up the good: posing a concrete, scalable and egalitarian alternative to our fossil fueled economy.  The best argument for that alternative is looking to what Trump’s own climate action might entail. First up would be repealing Obama’s Clean Power Plan – the only policy that puts meeting our Paris agreement commitments remotely within reach. With it he’ll gut the only body that can cap greenhouse gasses nationwide, the Environmental Protection Agency. “We’re going to save on [the EPA] because they’re not doing it,” Trump explained at a convention in October, laying out his proposed cuts. “They are making it impossible for our country to compete”.  In its place will come the kind of carbon tax pushed by everyone from Cramer to former Republican congressman Bob Inglis to Bush economic adviser Greg Mankiw, where regulations – alongside corporate and income taxes – are slashed in exchange. Solar and wind may grow thanks to continued incentives, but so will coal, oil and natural gas, now freed of pesky regulations and with subsidies intact. Given Trump’s tact for negotiation, hopes for future international climate deals will sit dead in the water. His other ideas bode ill for a warming world, too. Rising temperatures are already displacing whole nations, and climate-fueled drought is widely cited as a factor in the Syrian war now sending millions of refugees into Europe. No matter how aggressive global emissions cuts prove, these numbers will grow – whether by climate, conflict or both. Trump’s draconian immigration proposals, then, are key to his climate agenda. Though it’s impossible to know what all Trump’s plan could entail, the upshot is clear: it won’t work. Estimates say that 80% of fossil fuels need to stay buried to prevent warming “incompatible with organized global community”, and a study released last month found seas could rise nine feet by 2050. There are no conservative solutions to this crisis. In 2016, our only options are radical.  Take the radical idea that clean, affordable power should be a basic right, generating wealth for communities rather than shareholders. Or that we can retrain fossil fuel workers for union jobs building public transit or protecting coastlines. Or that we welcome migrants, not criminalize them. America needs a climate plan as concerned with keeping carbon out of the atmosphere as it is with putting food on the table, responding earnestly to the economic pain Trump is whipping up into racial animus. These solutions already exist in pockets, whether in promising state-level policies or experiments with energy democracy in the places already worst hit by extraction’s toxic impacts. More holistic proposals have already taken off in Canada and the UK. All point to similar conclusions: that working families can win as fossil fuel executives lose. Capitalism has never been great, for the planet or most people. It’s time for an economy that is."
"An often-ignored factor when examining environmental issues and climate change is the powerful role played by women. In the developed world, although women still struggle to achieve parity in issues of pay and opportunity, we typically hold the most sway in household decisions. According to the Wall Street Journal, women control nearly three-quarters of consumer spending in the US and two-thirds in the UK, including “making the decision in the purchases of 94% of home furnishings … 92% of vacations … 91% of homes … 60% of automobiles”.  This massive buying power means that most of the time, women hold the reins when it comes to making large, environmentally friendly decisions like deciding to vacation close to home rather than taking another long-haul flight, buying a modestly sized dwelling rather than a McMansion, and choosing a compact hybrid car rather than a gas-guzzling SUV.   In the workplace, too, women are greener: studies show that businesses headed by women are more likely to make environmentally friendly decisions. Whether it’s buying local produce or organizing e-cycling on a corporate scale, women simply seem more concerned about our collective impact on the environment and more willing to make changes to mitigate this impact. But the difference between men and women in environmental issues doesn’t just come down to who controls the purse strings. Women are statistically more likely to believe the science about climate change in the first place and, what’s more, believe it will affect them personally. In a 2015 study examining attitudes about climate change, Pew surveyed 11 developed nations and asked people to rate their agreement with the statement: “Global climate change is a serious problem.” In the US, 83% of women stated this was a somewhat or very serious problem, compared to just 66% of men. In the UK, the gap was smaller but still significant: 81% of women vs 71% of men. It’s tempting to chalk women’s increased awareness and concern for environmental issues up to some innate caretaking instinct or womanly solidarity. Nature is almost always characterized as female, after all. In Mother Nature v the human race, the actions we take against her are almost always framed as male: raping, pillaging, conquering, plundering. Doesn’t it make sense that women would empathize?  It’s a nice thought, this global sisterhood, but I don’t think it’s quite as emotional as all that. I think it’s pure practicality. Even in 2016, in the most democratic nations, our equality stands precarious, subject to the whims of shifting political tides. It’s not hard to understand that in the event of a global climate crisis, women will be immediately rendered one of the most vulnerable populations.  At the 2014 UN Climate Summit, the Chilean president, Michelle Bachelet, noted that women and children are 14 times more vulnerable than men in a climate disaster such as floods or droughts, especially in developing nations. Women are more likely than men to die in natural disasters, we’re more likely to become caregivers for the sick or wounded, and we’re more likely become the victims in climate change-induced violent conflicts.  Put plainly, perhaps women care more about climate change because we have so much more to lose.  And while it may seem like women in the west have more power – making major household financial decisions while poor women in developing nations are already suffering the devastating effects of climate change – women the world over are united in waging a long and frustrating fight to gain access to one of the most immediate and effective ways to reduce our environmental impact: safe access to birth control, abortion and reproductive health services. We’ve discussed it before, and although overpopulation isn’t the only problem (how much each population consumes is almost equally important) it’s a big one. And unlike many issues related to climate change, it’s one which is incredibly simple to solve. David Attenborough states it plainly and often: “Wherever women are given political control of their bodies, where they have the vote, education, appropriate medical facilities and they can read and have rights and so on, the birth rate falls – there’s no exceptions to that.” This is an issue in the developing world, but we’d be remiss if we acted as though it was a non-issue in western democracies. The United States is the largest democracy in the world, yet only 18 states and the District of Columbia require that information about contraception be taught where sex education is provided. Unwanted pregnancies are the natural consequence of these oversights, and while abortion has been legal since 1973, individual states in the US have the ability to impose incredibly restrictive regulations on abortion providers, in some cases making it all but impossible to access a legal abortion.  Religion and morality are often given as reasons for denying women access to reproductive health services, but I think these justifications miss half the story. Sister Joan Chittister, a Catholic nun, says it perfectly when she states: “I do not believe that just because you’re opposed to abortion, that that makes you pro-life. In fact, I think in many cases, your morality is deeply lacking if all you want is a child born but not a child fed, not a child educated, not a child housed … That’s not pro-life. That’s pro-birth. We need a much broader conversation on what the morality of pro-life is.”It’s ridiculous to deny women information and access to birth control and then also deny them the right to terminate an unintended pregnancy. Cruel to restrict a woman’s access to abortion and then leave her to the task of raising a child alone, vulnerable, and without support. And it’s incredibly shortsighted to believe that we can tackle overpopulation without also enabling women the world over to become educated and empowered about their own bodies and reproductive health. We cannot simultaneously champion fighting climate change without also fighting for the rights of women. The two are inextricably linked; they stand hand in hand. It’s about time we all stood up with them. "
"Natalie Bennett is to step down as leader of the Greens this summer, after saying she believed she had established her party as a national force while acknowledging that she was not a “spin-trained, lifelong politician”. She will remain leader until the end of August when her second two-year term expires, but said she was making the announcement now to allow possible successors plenty of time to come forward.  The Green leader, who took over from the better known Caroline Lucas, came to national prominence during last year’s general election campaign, when she appeared in the televised party leaders’ debates alongside David Cameron and Ed Miliband.  However, she was forced to apologise to members after an excruciating radio interview in which she failed to explain Green party policies, which she put down to “brain fade” and suffering a cold.  Reflecting on her time as the head of the party, Bennett said: “There have been times when I got things right, and times when I got things wrong, but that’s because I’m not a smooth, spin-trained, lifelong politician,” she said. “It’s both my strength and my weakness that I answer the question.” She argued that sometimes, because the Greens’ policies are radical, they have received “a very extreme level of hostility”. The party ended up holding its single MP in Brighton and bringing its share of the vote up slightly to 3.8%, but despite growing its membership from 13,000 to 60,000 under her leadership the party ultimately failed to break through as Green members had hoped and Labour had feared. The Australian former Guardian journalist, who only joined the party in 2006, said she had always intended to serve for four years, and felt she had achieved much of what she hoped to do when she took up the post in 2012. “I started with a number of intentions: making the Green party a truly national party; growing the membership; growing the strength of our local parties; and getting us into national debates.” “In the Green party it’s not a greasy pole where people are scrambling for the top and clinging on by their fingertips: we work as a team,” she said. “I think of everybody in the Green party as a leader: we’re all trying to lead us to be a society where we live within our environmental limits, and where no one is left behind”. She said grassroots initiatives, such as the “transition towns” that are trying to move towards life without fossil fuels, are evidence that the public care about the environment, but real change has to come from the top.  “The reason I got involved in the Green party is that at the moment they’re having to work against the grain: they’re having to fight all the way, without support from the law, the framework, the funding that should be supporting them.” The party secured 1.1m votes at last year’s general election but Bennett failed in her own bid to win a parliamentary seat, standing in the Holborn and St Pancras constituency against Keir Starmer, the Labour candidate and former director of public prosecutions. The party also failed to take target seats such as Norwich South and Bristol West, and lost control of its only council, in Brighton.  The party did not make much headway in the May elections this year, apart from gaining MSPs in Scotland and coming third in the London mayoral elections, and also faces a challenge in how to compete with a more leftwing Labour party under Jeremy Corbyn. Caroline Lucas, the MP for Brighton Pavilion since 2010, remains the party’s only representative in the House of Commons. But Bennett stressed that the 123 of the party’s candidates saved their deposits nationwide, a sharp improvement on its historical performance. She said the party’s strong showing in areas such as Sheffield, Manchester and Liverpool, outside traditional strongholds such as Bristol and Brighton, shows that it has now become a political force across Britain. “We’ve very much grown up, and developed, and become a truly national party. We are now spread right across the country.” Bennett was a little-known figure on the nationwide political stage when she appeared in the TV debates, and she believes her presence, along with Plaid Cymru’s Leanne Wood and the SNP’s Nicola Sturgeon, helped to change the nature of the debate. “One of the things I’m proudest of is being able, in those national debates, to look David Cameron in the eye and challenge him about his position on Syrian refugees,” she said. She added: “It really is telling that I was the only one to talk about climate change in those two debates. It’s a real indictment of the other parties when you think about how pressing these issues are.” Her message was that “environmental problems are inextricably linked to the structure of the economy and society.” She said grassroots activists and members have helped support her, offering their spare bedrooms and their time and enthusiasm as she has travelled around the country. “I have a fraction of the resources of other party leaders,” she said. “Sometimes I have just handed my phone to someone and said, ‘media manage me for the day’.” Bennett has sometimes struggled to compete with the public profile of Lucas – herself a former Green leader – who is likely to be a strong contender to succeed her. The Scottish Green leader, Patrick Harvie, is also regarded as a powerful campaigner. Bennett said she hoped another contribution of the debates last year was to make young people realise that women, from different walks of life, can succeed in politics. “Young women, seeing us all in the debates, thought, ‘that could be me’,” she said. However, she added: “There are huge problems with the sheer narrowness of where our political class comes from.” Once Bennett has stepped down, she plans to spend more time travelling the country – her favourite part of her job as leader – and campaigning on issues she feels strongly about, including education, where she believes the government’s testing regime has turned schools into “exam factories”.  “It doesn’t mean I’m going away,” she said."
" Australia’s big four banks could act on their stated ambition to help achieve a 2C warming target simply by giving no new loans to coal projects, analysis by financial activists Market Forces reveals. Such a move – including a halt to refinancing existing loans – would virtually empty the banks’ loan book of the $8bn they are lending to coal in just five years. All four big banks have made statements supporting the 2C warming target. ANZ’s statement acknowledged worries that lending to fossil fuels was in conflict with the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Westpac went so far as to say it would take “concrete action to ensure our lending and investing activities support an economy that limits global warming to less than two degrees”. Analysts at Market Forces examined what the banks could do to put those sentiments into practice. The group has kept a database of loans to fossil fuel projects since 2008, which now contains 475 deals. Of those loans, 142 are to coal projects. If all the current loans to Australian coal companies were simply allowed to run their course, all but one would expire by 2021. The exception is a loan the group says Commonwealth Bank has given to one of the country’s largest coal power stations – Loy Yang B in Victoria – which runs until 2026. “Urgent action is not just necessary but possible, as financial flows can change very quickly,” said Julien Vincent, the chief executive of Market Forces. He said the group was calling on banks to remove coal from their loan books by 2021. “The first test for ANZ will be next month, as their loan to Hazelwood power station is due to expire,” he said. “If this deal gets renewed or extended it would be hard to take ANZ seriously on climate change.” Vincent said the expiry dates for about 10% of the loans in the database were unknown, so it was possible there was an outlier that would last beyond 2021. International loans were not included in the analysis but they amounted only to about 2.5% of the loan books. As commodity prices have plummeted and demand for coal – particularly Australian coal – has dropped, many of the projects the banks have on their books are not performing well. Both ANZ and Westpac have written down the value of their loan book. “The banks should be as keen as the community to get their exposure to coal down to zero as soon as possible,” Vincent said. “Not only do they have an imperative to prove they weren’t just green-washing when they committed to supporting the 2C global warming limit agreed in Paris but many coal deals are now turning sour, financially impacting the banks.”  Among the loans in Market Forces’ database are: The analysis does not include exposure to coal or other fossil fuels in the form of bonds or in their investment portfolios. Earlier in the year Market Forces showed that, despite the banks’ statements on climate change, their business was carrying on as usual. In 2015, the group estimated, banks had lent $5.5bn to fossil fuel projects – a figure that was roughly normal for the past eight years. Each of the banks responded to Guardian Australia by emphasising their increased lending to renewable energy, but didn’t comment on whether they would reduce lending to coal. Their full statements are reproduced below. An ANZ spokesman said: We acknowledge that climate change is a shared challenge for governments, business and the community, and we are taking action to support our customers’ transition to a low carbon economy.  In 2015 we achieved our long-term target ahead of schedule to increase our lending to lower-carbon gas and renewable power generation. Renewables and gas currently account for 80.4% of this business (project financed power generation).  We have committed to fund and facilitate $10 billion over the next five years to support low carbon activity, and we have new and strengthened rules on coal lending. A Westpac spokeswoman said: As a major financial institution Westpac recognises we have an important role to play in supporting the transition to a two-degree economy. Westpac regularly reviews its position and policies in relation to lending. When assessing projects, we proactively work with customers to understand and manage environment, social and governance risks. Since 2011, we have increased the proportion of renewable energy financing from 45% to 61% of our total electricity generation portfolio. A Commonwealth Bank spokesman said: Commonwealth Bank plays a crucial role in enabling economic and social development in Australia by supporting jobs, growth, innovation and opportunities for people and businesses. As a major financial institution we invest in nearly every sector in the economy and we believe we need to take a balanced, measured and responsible approach as we support the transition to a low-carbon economy. In November 2015, we announced our updated Group Environment Policy, which states that there is a clear need to minimise and mitigate the impacts of climate change, and that international efforts to limit global warming to two degrees Celsius will require a transition from traditional economic models, and the world’s current energy mix, to low carbon and renewable alternatives. A whole-of-institution response to aligning a business with the two degree Celsius target requires considerable research and policy development and fundamental changes to business as usual. We are taking an incremental and iterative approach and will evolve our policies and commitments as we develop better understanding of domestic and global policy settings and what they mean for the business. An NAB spokeswoman said: We believe NAB has a role to play in transitioning to a low carbon economy, which is why we have committed to investing $18 billion over the next 7 years to help with that transition in a considered and balanced manner. Over the last nine years we have arranged more than $2 billion worth of loans for renewable energy projects, which makes NAB the leading project finance arranger by market share to the Australian renewable energy sector. Our lending decisions, including decisions about renewal of existing finance, incorporate many considerations - including consideration of Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) risks associated with particular sectors - as part of our credit risk assessment and due diligence processes. As of 31 March 2016, the power generation sector comprised approximately 0.5 per cent of our total Group Exposure at Default (EAD). Of this, 43.5 per cent was from renewable energy."
"In January this year, I visited friends in Miami. One of the most urgent topics of conversation was about what they saw as the greatest problem faced by the city – rising water levels, and a long-standing reluctance on the part of government and business to take the necessary steps to control the extensive damage. From inundated homes, shops and roads, to fresh water pollution and sewage being forced upwards, the impacts are widespread. In a Christian Aid report (pdf) published last week, Miami ranked ninth in a list of cities most at risk from future coastal flooding as a result of sea level rises. Supported by data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, projections for the year 2017 suggest that Kolkata and Mumbai, both in India, are most exposed to coastal flooding. Bar Miami, the top ten cities are all in Asia.   As global water levels rise, as parts of Florida experience the heaviest rain since records began, as the flooding and salination of farmland in Bangladesh increases, the risk to coastal cities can be seen for what it is – a sign of the apparently inexorable effects of a high-carbon economy on a fragile environment. But what is also clear from the Christian Aid research is how ecological disaster intensifies inequality. In prosperous nations it is the poorest who are most at risk from environmental changes such as those Miami faces because they have the least means to cope with or move away from the problem. In developing countries, coastal cities and their surrounding regions have even less in the way of defence.  Business as usual – that familiar and illusory process – will simply deepen the gulf separating the economically secure from the insecure, at least in the short term. In the long run, to paraphrase Keynes, we are all insecure.  There are measures that can be, and are being, taken with the help of NGOs and other civil society groups to limit the damage. During last year’s flooding in Myanmar and Bangladesh, for example, Oxfam distributed water, hygiene kits and cash grants, and worked with other international NGOs to coordinate the humanitarian response.  But the underlying question is becoming more and more pressing: what is it about our prevailing global model of economic growth that apparently blinds us to the cost of the high-carbon system? A process of so-called growth that inexorably increases the distance between rich and poor in one way or another ought to look nonsensical to us.  Economic activity is still so often defined in terms of an unending upward spiral of consumption in a materially limited environment. Are we looking hard enough at the contradictions here? Are we asking what kind of economies are sustainable? The launch this week of the Centre for the Understanding of Sustainable Prosperity, headed by Professor Tim Jackson who wrote the groundbreaking 2011 report Prosperity Without Growth, looks to galvanise a more urgent discussion of these issues. It is not a demand for economic stagnation, nor a matter of having some sort of anti-business agenda – this is lazy criticism – but for the question to be clearly put: what does prosperity mean in a world of environmental limits? The old paradigm of economic development and prosperity assured us that infinitely expanding consumer choice increased and guaranteed our free agency. It is time to wake up to the fact that this paradigm makes us passive to processes outside our control and condemns us in the long term to a losing battle with the limited material world we share. If we want to be genuinely free agents, we need to turn this model on its head."
"The current dissonance between election campaign rhetoric and the facts of climate change is unfathomable, that is, until you dig a little deeper. This month, the world passed a disastrous tipping point from which there will be no return: the Cape Grim Air Quality Monitoring Station registered a count of 400 parts per million CO2 in the atmosphere. Climate scientists have acknowledged that there is basically no going back from this point. We are in a climate emergency.   At the same time, 93% of the Great Barrier Reef is experiencing devastating bleaching; the biggest ever anti-coal protest at Newcastle – the world’s largest coal port – stopped exports for a day, and yet at the federal election leaders’ debate not one question was asked on what the parties would do about global warming or fossil fuel subsidies, coal or coal seam gas. What is going on? A lack of interest or a debate with parameters and audience selection overseen by Rupert Murdoch’s Sky News and Daily Telegraph? It is not credible that a representative selection of voters would not have raised global warming or asylum seekers as issues at all. Especially when a poll released this week showed that an overwhelming majority of voters are in favour of more government action on climate change. But then we no longer live in a democracy. We have morphed into a plutocracy: government by the wealthy for the wealthy greased by political donations. You don’t need to be in parliament to secure your interests, you only need to buy or exert enough influence through cash or concentrated media ownership to make sure things don’t change regardless of whether the LNP or Labor is in government. Big corporations call these donations “diversifying their investment”, and when you look at the donation records of fossil fuel companies, they donate to both major parties, capturing them both within their destructive and pervasive web of influence. To make sense of this election and to understand why certain issues are buried and others promoted as open to debate, it is necessary to follow the money, and the electoral objectives of those who have it. Australia is a disproportionately resource-based economy dependent on subsidised digging up and shipping away. The vested interests who have made their fortunes out of coal, oil and gas will fight to keep it that way. This is despite crystal clear evidence that the demand for our coal, oil and gas on the global stage is declining.  Rather than work to transition our economy to a more diverse and clean one, they will instead fight to keep every grant, subsidy, tax break and overseas tax haven they currently enjoy. They will tear down every job, research project or grants scheme that supports a renewable energy future, such as they have done by gutting of the CSIRO, the renewable energy target and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena). They will keep every revolving door between their board rooms and parliament well oiled. They will stand their own candidates straight from the Institute of Public Affairs and they will place their own people in the tax office and in the big four accounting firms. In an era of partisanship, these vested interests are bipartisan in providing lucrative post-politics careers. Tony Abbott made this blatantly clear when he said recently he hoped the mining industry would demonstrate their gratitude to Ian Macfarlane in his years of retirement for his magnificent achievement in scrapping the mining tax.  APPEA, the voice of the oil and gas industry, has already appointed former Labor energy minister Martin Ferguson as chair of its advisory board. Interestingly, Ian Macfarlane introduced the generous frontier tax arrangements and royalty payments for oil exploration that Martin Ferguson extended such that BP will be able to claim 150% of drilling costs in the Great Australian Bight. That’s bipartisanship for you. The fossil fuel industry currently donates millions of dollars to both major parties, and in return secures billions in tax breaks and subsidies – not to mention preferential treatment when applying for mining and gas lease and oil drilling approvals and favourable decisions under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act.  If donations aren’t enough, then hostile advertising is held over prime ministers as a threat. This tactic worked for them in destroying the mining tax and the carbon price and they are banking on it working again in 2016. But how do they get away with it given the level of community concern about global warming? The concern that continues to grow in the wake of the terrifying fires, extreme droughts, and devastating storm surges people are living through. How did the fossil fuel industry get away with all their subsidies intact in this year’s budget when hospitals and schools are defunded? This includes keeping their lucrative fuel tax rebate, which is worth $2bn a year while single parents and community legal centres are done over. Why didn’t Labor raise the roof about this and why didn’t they reject utterly the LNP’s billion dollar Arena cut?  Because it is not just the Liberal party that is captured by dirty money. Labor, Liberals and National parties have proven that they are utterly captured by this pervasive and polluting industry, that is rapidly condemning our planet to burn. And they are getting away with it because politicians on both sides of the aisle – with the exception the Greens – are unwilling to stand up to the big miners.  There is an unspoken bipartisan agreement supported by the mainstream media that the continuation of the coal, gas and oil industries is a given and will not be debated. The approval of Adani’s Carmichael mega coal mine still stands. To win on the climate we have to take our democracy back from the corporates who have bought it. That means making the urgency of the climate emergency, the need to keep coal, gas and oil in the ground, political donations reform, fossil fuel subsidies and a national Icac, red hot issues in this election. We can make a choice to stay lukewarm and lose any possibility of keeping warming below dangerous levels or we can ask every candidate for a yes or no answer and not vote for anyone who props up the big polluters and lets dangerous climate change runaway on their watch. It’s the only way to start reforming a broken system."
"That quote from Shakespeare’s Hamlet comes to mind: “The lady doth protest too much, methinks.”  The lady in question is the Australian government, which some time in early January saw a draft of a report from a United Nations organisation.   The report, provisionally titled “Destinations at Risk: World Heritage and Tourism in a Changing Climate”, outlined how many world heritage sites around the world were being compromised by the impacts of climate change. One of the sites highlighted in the draft report was the Great Barrier Reef. The Australian government doth protest, and Unesco obliged.  As Guardian Australia revealed last week, all mentions of Australia, the Great Barrier Reef, the Northern Territory’s glorious Kakadu national park and Tasmania’s forests were then removed from the report. All this, as the reef’s worst recorded case of mass coral bleaching makes headlines around the world  So why the whitewash?  In a statement to Guardian Australia, the Department of the Environment made two arguments to justify the request for censorship and neither of them makes any sense.  Firstly, the government argued the title of the report “had the potential to cause considerable confusion”. The title Australia objected to was “Destinations at Risk: World Heritage and Tourism in a Changing Climate”. The report was finally published as World Heritage and Tourism in a Changing Climate. The department said the UN world heritage committee had only last year agreed not to place the reef on its list of sites “in danger”.  If the reef then appeared as a case study in a UN report about world heritage sites “at risk” this might confuse people, the department claimed. But the reality is that the reef is both “at risk” and “in danger” from the impacts of climate change – the government’s own science agencies have warned them of this multiple times, not to mention scientists at leading universities around the world.  The only confusing aspect is how a report about world heritage sites and climate change now omits one of the world’s most iconic natural wonders that has become a faded poster child for the impacts of global warming worldwide.  Australia’s second argument was that having the reef featured in the Unesco report was further “negative commentary” that “impacted on tourism”. As commentary on The Project pointed out, most people around the world don’t choose their holiday destinations by consulting Unesco reports. The report was a collaboration of two UN bodies – Unesco and the United Nations Environment Program – as well as the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), a not-for-profit science advocacy group. Adam Markham, of UCS and lead author of the report, told me he was “not in any of those conversations” about Australia requesting the reef be removed, and that Unesco had the final say. He said he was “disappointed” that a Great Barrier Reef case study pegged for the reports was taken out. As soon as the report was published, Markham updated the case study and published it on the UCS blog, where you can now read the guts of the section the Australian government didn’t want published. Guardian Australia also published the censored text. So why did Unesco agree to Australia’s demands? I asked Unesco this, and also whether a note would be added to the report pointing out that mentions of Australia had been taken out. A spokesperson told me only that the following sentence had now been added to the press release:  At the request of the government of Australia, references to Australian sites were removed from the Report (recent information about the state of conservation of the Great Barrier Reef is available on Unesco’s website here: http://whc.unesco.org/en/soc/3234). Unesco should not escape criticism here. The organisation’s willingness to censor one of its own reports in the interests of nothing more than a public relations exercise is troubling. You have to hope this instance is a one-off.  Adding a line to a press release that has already been sent out is, in my view, a poor response to a serious misstep.  In Unesco’s defence, both the spokesperson and Markham said the report was not supposed to be a comprehensive assessment of every world heritage site – of which there are more than 1,000. But leaving the Great Barrier Reef out of the report is like writing about the risks of oil drilling without mentioning the Deepwater Horizon, or perchance the tragedy of reviewing the works of Shakespeare without ever mentioning Hamlet.  “This above all: to thine own self be true.”"
"Last month was the hottest April on record globally – and the seventh month in a row to have broken global temperature records. The latest figures smashed the previous record for April by the largest margin ever recorded.  It makes three months in a row that the monthly record has been broken by the largest margin ever, and seven months in a row that are at least 1C above the 1951-80 mean for that month. When the string of record-smashing months started in February, scientists began talking about a “climate emergency”. Figures released by Nasa over the weekend show the global temperature of land and sea was 1.11C warmer in April than the average temperature for April during the period 1951-1980. It all but assures that 2016 will be the hottest year on record, and probably by the largest margin ever. With Apr update, 2016 still > 99% likely to be a new record (assuming historical ytd/ann patterns valid). pic.twitter.com/GTN9sPL2D7 The new record broke the previous one by 0.24C, which was set in 2010, at 0.87C above the baseline average for April. That record itself broke one set three years earlier at 0.75C above the baseline average for April. NASA April temperature is out. Warmest April on record. Beats the previous record by largest margin ever. #climate pic.twitter.com/7BissESrWJ The current blast of hot air around the globe is being spurred by a massive El Niño, which is a release of warm water across the Pacific Ocean. But it’s not the biggest El Niño on record and that spike in temperatures is occurring over a background of rapid global warming, pushing temperatures to all-time highs. “The interesting thing is the scale at which we’re breaking records,” said Andy Pitman, director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science at the University of New South Wales in Australia. “It’s clearly all heading in the wrong direction. “Climate scientists have been warning about this since at least the 1980s. And it’s been bloody obvious since the 2000s. So where’s the surprise?” said Pitman. Pitmans said the recent figures put the recent goal agreed in Paris of just 1.5C warming in doubt. “The 1.5C target, it’s wishful thinking. I don’t know if you’d get 1.5C if you stopped emissions today. There’s inertia in the system. It’s putting intense pressure on 2C,” he said. The record temperatures were wreaking havoc with ecosystems around the world. They’ve triggered the third recorded global coral bleaching, and in Australia 93% of the reefs have been affected by bleaching along the 2,300km Great Barrier Reef. In the northern parts of the reef, it’s expected the majority of coral is dead, and on some reefs over 90% of the coral is dying. A recent analysis showed the bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef was made 175 times more likely because of climate change, and the conditions that caused it would be average in fewer than 20 years. The April figures come as the symbolic milestone of CO2 concentrations of 400 parts per million (ppm) have been broken at the important Cape Grim measuring station in Tasmania, Australia. Reflecting on the CO2 concentrations, Pitman said: “The thing that’s causing that warming, is going up and up and up. So the cool ocean temperatures we will get with a La Niña are warmer than we’d ever seen more than a few decades ago … This is a full-scale punching of the reef system on an ongoing basis with some occasionally really nasty kicks and it isn’t going to recover.” Spiralling global temperatures from 1850-2016 (full animation) https://t.co/YETC5HkmTr pic.twitter.com/Ypci717AHq"
"  A draft UN report on climate change, which was scrubbed of all reference to Australia over fears it could deter visitors to the Great Barrier Reef, also outlined possible threats to the Tasmania wilderness and Kakadu.  The draft report contained a chapter on the Great Barrier Reef, which described climate change as “the biggest long-term threat to the [reef] today, and to its ecosystems services, biodiversity, heritage values and tourism economy”. It concluded that “without a comprehensive response more in keeping with the scale of the threat, the [reef]’s extraordinary biodiversity and natural beauty may lose its world heritage values”. But before it was scrubbed, the report had two other key sections on Australian world heritage sites, and the threats they face from climate change. One of those sections was on the Tasmanian wilderness. At the time the report was being reviewed by the Australian government, in early 2016, that wilderness was just starting to burn, in what unfolded to be a catastrophic bushfire in regions that had never burned before. Those fires were a result of increased lightning activity and drier conditions, which are consequences of climate change. At the time, the Tasmanian premier, Will Hodgman, criticised conservationists for their “hysterical response,” again worrying about the impact it would have on tourism. “It’s damn ordinary that you’ve got environmental activists almost gleefully capitalising on images, naturally caused, which could inflict significant damage on our brand, our reputation,” he said. “The threat is still ongoing, but Tasmania’s tourism industry, particularly in our magnificent world heritage area and the national parks, is well and true open,” he told Fairfax Media. But the censored section of the Unesco report on Tasmania is clear about the “dire” nature of the threat. It said: “A 2013 assessment of climate threats identified the same habitats as at high risk from greater fire frequency and drier conditions, with likely catastrophic implications for fauna. These dire predictions appeared to be playing out in January 2016, when tens of thousands of hectares of forest burned, sparked by lightning strikes that came in a month when temperatures were 2C above average and in the wake of the driest two-year period ever recorded for the region.” The deleted section on Kakadu national park contained similarly dire warnings. It described the important natural and cultural values of Kakadu, which has been inhabited by Aboriginal people for 50,000 years. “The thousands of rock art sites in the park are at risk from damage by more extreme rainfall events, while sea level rise is happening at twice the global average along the northern Australian coast,” the draft report said. It warned that fresh-water wetlands were at risk from sea level rise, as they are likely to be inundated with salt water.  “Climate change threatens Aboriginal traditional use by altering the ecosystems of the vast wetlands of Kakadu and raising temperatures to a level likely to lead to more intense fire regimes,” the report said. The final version of the report entitled “World heritage and tourism in a changing climate” was published last week by Unesco, United Nations environment programme and the Union of Concerned Scientists, with all references to Australia removed. The lead author of the report, Adam Markham, told Guardian Australia: “I was shocked when I read in the Guardian the reasons the Australian government gave for why they had pressured Unesco to drop the Australian sites.”"
"The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, has accused the Turnbull government of failing to understand that global warming is a bigger threat to Australia’s national security than terrorism. In an address due to be given at the Lowy Institute on Tuesday, he also criticises Australia’s bid to be on the UN human rights council, asking how the country can provide any leadership when “our own house is not in order”.  If Australia wanted to be a “confident and courageous country” it must start developing its own foreign policy, independent of the United States, his speech says. And Australia’s foreign aid should be increased to a minimum of 0.7% of gross national income by 2025, because the “best investment” in national security was to alleviate poverty in the region. Di Natale’s speech – who has been Greens leader for just over a year – says Australia is in the middle of “an unprecedented retreat” under the Turnbull government. Commitments on human rights, asylum seekers, foreign aid, global warming and clean energy investment have all gone backwards in recent years, he says. He says the Greens are the only party that understands the threat to national security from global warming, while also recognising that Australia can harness its vast reserves of renewable energy for great opportunity. Last week senior Labor figures accused the Greens of making a preference deal with the Liberals after the Victorian Liberal president, Michael Kroger, indicated his willingness to preference the Greens over Labor. Labor’s Anthony Albanese, who is being challenged in his Sydney seat of Grayndler by the Greens, accused them of agreeing to issue “open tickets” without any preference recommendations in numerous marginal seats, mostly in Victoria, in exchange for the Liberal party preferencing the Greens ahead of Labor in some inner-city seats in Melbourne and Sydney. Di Natale ignores the row in his Lowy Institute speech, saying only that he would work with “whoever is in government” to reap the potential that Australia’s energy exports and technology transfer programs held for the new economy. “We need a government that understands our collective economic future is clean and green, or it is no future at all,” he says. “There are great opportunities for an Australia that capitalises on this vision – as one of the sunniest and windiest countries in the world, Australia can lead the transition to a clean energy powered future. The Greens are calling for global diplomatic efforts towards an international agreement on how to respond to people displaced by global warming, he says. He suggests Australia should start issuing a special form of humanitarian visa for such people. “No matter what strategy is deployed, given the slow pace of global negotiations set against our rapidly changing weather systems, the Greens would like to see plans put in place for this process and planning to commence now – there is no time to waste,” he says."
"The government’s $2.55bn emissions reduction fund, which pays greenhouse gas emitters to pollute less, will inevitably pay for reductions that would have happened anyway, for the same reason that secondhand car markets are full of lemons, an economic analysis has concluded. The centrepiece of the government’s Direct Action climate policy is a reverse-auction, in which polluters bid for funding to pollute less.  But the government could not know for sure whether those reductions would have happened anyway, the economist Paul Burke from the Australian National University has argued in the journal Economic Papers. And any reduction scheme that was going to go ahead anyway would be able to outbid schemes that required funding to go ahead, he wrote. “They have a cost advantage that makes them well placed to win the auction,” Burke said. Similar criticism of Direct Action has been raised before, but had received little attention from economists, Burke said.  “Anyway projects”, as Burke called them, were likely win the reverse auction for the same reason that buyers of secondhand cars were likely to buy a lemon. In both cases, the buyer could not know whether the product was good quality, and the seller with a bad product could undercut the rest of the market. The government used dozens of methods to avoid paying for abatement that would have happened anyway, but it could not know what a company was planning to do, Burke said. In his discussions with local stakeholders, he said, some recipients of emissions reduction fund money described it as “cream” and “too good to be true”. Burke said it was entirely possible some projects would end up, perversely, funding emissions increases. An example of that could be farmers getting a payment not to clear one piece of land, and using that money to fund the clearing of land elsewhere. Examining some of the projects that were awarded payments in the first two rounds of the auction, Burke found farmers were often paid more than the value of their land simply not to clear parts of it. In some cases, he said, the incentive for the farmers to clear the land was low, and it would have been expensive, so might not have happened anyway.  Energy efficiency projects that upgraded lighting in supermarkets or reduced fuel use in vehicles fell into a similar category. “That’s the sort of activity that private companies are supposed to do,” Burke said. “Companies do do this sort of activity – it’s not uncommon for companies to replace their vehicles with newer or more fuel efficient ones,” he said. “Not all the projects are like this, but it’s a pity that some projects can get into the scheme when they are not delivering true additional abatements,” he said. He said a carbon price or an emissions trading scheme was more effective, partly because it didn’t require the government to know unknowable facts such as a company’s plans. “The previous policy of carbon pricing was a more effective approach than Direct Action,” he said. Labor has promised to implement a type of emissions trading scheme if elected in July. The environment minister, Greg Hunt, said he rejected the report “clearly, categorically, absolutely”. “The head of the emissions reduction assurance committee is from ANU – Professor Andrew Macintosh. He takes a very different view to one of his colleagues. And what we’ve seen is 143m tonnes of emissions reduction allocated by the independent Clean Energy Regulator. These are using overwhelmingly Labor’s methods, but for new projects.”"
"Whatever happened to normal weather? Earth has always experienced epic storms, debilitating drought, and biblical floods. But lately it seems the treadmill of disruptive weather has been set to fast-forward. God’s grandiose Symphony of the Seasons, the natural ebb and flow of the atmosphere, is playing out of tune, sounding more like a talent-free second grade orchestra, with shrill horns, violins screeching off-key, cymbal crashes coming in at the wrong time. Something has changed. My company, AerisWeather, tracks global weather for Fortune 500 companies trying to optimize supply chains, increase profitability, secure facilities, and ensure the safety of their employees and customers. It’s my 4th weather-technology company. Our team is constantly analyzing patterns, providing as much lead-time of impending weather extremes as possible. As a serial entrepreneur I respond to data, facts and evidence. If I spin the data and only see what I want to see, I go out of business. I lay off good people. I can’t afford to look away when data makes me uncomfortable.  I was initially skeptical of man-made climate change, but by the late 1990s I was witnessing the apparent symptoms of a warming climate. They were showing up on my weather map with greater frequency and ferocity. I didn’t set out to talk about climate volatility and weather disruption, but by the turn of the 21st century this warming seemed to be flavoring much of the weather I was tracking, turning up the volume of extremes, loading the dice for weather weirding. Multiple strands of data confirm Earth has a low-grade fever, a warming trend that transcends periodic heat released from El Niño. People ask “What’s a couple of degrees, Paul?” Well, when was the last time you were a couple of degrees warmer? Chances are you felt miserable. And there were visible, tangible symptoms: sweating, chills, headaches, nausea. Your physician popped a thermometer in your mouth and confirmed you had a fever. Chances are you didn’t make a fuss, argue with the doctor, or deny the diagnosis. Is it a fluke, or evidence of a broader trend? Can we connect the dots with a high degree of confidence? Both NASA and local farmers confirm a longer growing seasons, with more allergens, pests and invasive species. Rainfall rates are increasing; wet areas trending even wetter. My home state of Minnesota has witnessed four separate 1-in-1,000 year floods since 2004.  A warmer atmosphere is increasing water vapor levels overhead, juicing storms, fueling an increase in flash floods in the summer, and heavier winter snows along the East Coast of the USA. “All storms are 5 to 10 percent stronger in terms of heavy rainfall” explained Dr. Kevin Trenberth, at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. “It means what was a very rare event is now not quite so rare.” In recent decades, weather patterns have appeared to become more sluggish and erratic, worldwide. Rapid warming of the Arctic may be impacting the jet stream, the high-speed river of air that whisks weather systems around the planet. These high-altitude winds are powered by north-south temperature gradients, which are being altered by rapid warming of northern latitudes. Preliminary research suggests a drop in jet stream wind speeds, creating a “wavier” pattern where weather systems can become “stuck”. This translates into supernaturally-persistent blocking patterns, where weather stalls for extended periods of time.  When weather goes into a holding pattern consequences can be severe: record rains; deeper, drier droughts; a longer, more intense wildfire season; and longer periods of life-threatening heat. Worldwide, record highs have exceeded record cold by a significant margin. On July 31, 2015 the town of Bandar Mahshahr, Iran experienced a staggering heat index of 165°F. From relentless winter flooding in the UK to disruption of India’s monsoon to chronic fires in Indonesia to more midwinter rain and less snow from the Alps to the Rockies, the planet’s accelerating warming signal is now showing up in the weather. Pick up a newspaper or turn on the TV to see signs of climate volatility sparking more weather disruption. From the mega-blaze that swept across Fort McMurray, Alberta to repeated flooding of Houston, scorching heat in India, perpetual drought from California to Australia, and a record year for global hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones in 2015, the symptoms of a warming ecosystem are becoming harder to dismiss or deny. In my upcoming book I interview 11 veteran television meteorologists in the United States. All of them are witnessing symptoms of climate change in their hometowns. In a day and age of scammers, hackers, hucksters and special interests it’s good to be skeptical. You should be skeptical about everything. Some of the biggest skeptics on the planet are scientists. In fact, science is organized skepticism. Climate and weather are flip-sides of the same coin; everything is interconnected. Climate scientists tell us the climate is warming and meteorologists are tracking the symptoms: freakish weather showing up with unsettling regularity. Even if you don’t believe the climate scientists or your local meteorologist do yourself and your kids a favor. Believe your own eyes. It’s not your imagination. And it’s not your grandfather’s weather anymore. Paul Douglas is a Pennsylvania State University meteorologist and Founder of AerisWeather, based in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

"The amount of electricity generated from coal in the UK has fallen to zero several times in the past week, grid data shows. In what green energy supporters have described as a “historic turning point” for the UK’s power system, coal-fired electricity first fell to zero late on Monday night and for the early hours of Tuesday morning, according to data from BM Reports. On Thursday, there was no electricity from coal for more than 12 and a half hours, more than half the day, with it making no contribution to the UK’s power supplies late at night when demand was low and for a period in the day, the data shows. It is thought to be the first time the UK has been without electricity from coal since the world’s first centralised public coal-fired generator opened at Holborn Viaduct in London, in 1882, according to the Carbon Brief website which reports on climate science and energy policy. UK #coal generation hit zero again overnight. Now 4x this week, having previously never happened since 1882. pic.twitter.com/8k63yfm9Uj The record lows in coal power generation come as the UK enters the summer months, which sees lower demand for electricity, and with more than half of the country’s coal capacity out of action, for example for planned maintenance. But there have also been a series of recent closures of coal-fired power plants as they become less economic, while plants such as Drax in North Yorkshire have partially switched to burning “biomass”.  The government has said it wants to see coal phased out by 2025, as it is the most polluting way of generating electricity. There has also been an increase in the amount of renewables on the system, with a record 27% of the UK’s power coming from sources such as wind power in the last quarter of 2015. Estimates of the power now being generated from solar panels, from household arrays to large scale farms, also show it is regularly outstripping coal during the day, reaching 6.8 gigawatts (GW) at a midday peak this week compared to a high of 3GW output from coal. Solar is limited to generating power during the day, but analysis from Carbon Brief found that over the course of a week, the clean technology produced more power last week than coal. Juliet Davenport, chief executive of renewable electricity supplier Good Energy said: “This week marks an historic turning point for energy in the UK. “Coal formed the backbone of the industrial revolution and was the fuel that powered Britain into the 21st century. But it’s time to begin to say farewell. “Our energy is becoming cleaner and greener, with wind, solar and other renewables generating more of our electricity than ever before. We are celebrating this news as it shows that our future can be fossil fuel-free.”"
"Shell, Europe’s largest oil company, has established a separate division, New Energies, to invest in renewable and low-carbon power. The move emerged days after experts at Chatham House warned international oil companies they must transform their business or face a “short, brutal” end within 10 years.  Shell’s new division brings together its existing hydrogen, biofuels and electrical activities but will also be used as a base for a new drive into wind power, according to an internal announcement to company staff. With $1.7bn of capital investment currently attached to it and annual capital expenditure of $200m, New Energies will be run alongside the Integrated Gas division under executive board member Maarten Wetselaar.  Insiders said the group chief executive, Ben van Beurden, wants to ensure Shell is at the forefront of oil company innovation. “He does not want to get out so far in front where he dilutes investor returns but he does want to make sure Shell is at the leading edge of transition [to lower-carbon economies].” The Anglo-Dutch group may already be trailing Total of France, which already has its own New Energies division and boasts of being the world’s second-ranked solar energy operator through its affiliate SunPower, bought for £800m in 2011. Shell has made no formal announcement so far about New Energies but the new business is expected to be revealed at a public strategy briefing in London on 7 June.  Company insiders claimed Shell wants to play down the importance of New Energies for fear it will be written off as a “greenwash” exercise by environmentalists, but said the company believes the new business could become very big – although not for a decade or more. It is unlikely Greenpeace and others will be impressed by New Energies, given that the division’s annual spending level is less than 1% of the total $30bn Shell pumps into oil and gas. Van Beurden has not yet signalled a slowdown in the high-cost oil and gas investment that has made Shell a target of anti-fossil fuel campaigners, who believe such investments will only result in so-called stranded assets – carbon made unburnable by international commitments to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Shell has pulled back from high-risk Arctic drilling but is still engaged in deepwater projects and in the high-CO2 Canadian tar sands – although it is trying to cut emissions by developing a carbon, capture and storage facility. The Shell boss told investors at a company meeting in London last week he did expect oil and gas demand to continue strongly but the company also took its responsibilities to tackle global warming seriously.  “The big challenge, both for society and for a company like Shell is how to provide much more energy, while at the same time significantly reducing carbon dioxide emissions,” he said. The following day Shell announced it was bidding in a partnership to build two windfarms off the Dutch coast that will be big enough to power 825,000 households.  Shell already holds interests in nine other wind projects in North America and Europe, although spending on wind, solar and hydrogen projects was suspended by former chief executive Jeroen van der Veer in 2009. A substantial solar operation had been largely sold off three years before that. Rival BP also promised to go “beyond petroleum” and established an Alternative Energy business with its own London headquarters and chief executive, only to gradually wind it down. Paul Stevens, a fellow at the Chatham House thinktank, said in a research paper that the oil majors were no longer fit for purpose – hit by low crude prices, tightening climate change regulations and wrongheaded strategies. In the report, Stevens argued the only way forward for the companies lay in diversifying into green energy, drastically reducing their operations or consolidating through mega-mergers. “The prognosis for the IOCs [international oil companies] was already grim before governments became serious about climate change and the oil price collapsed … their old business model is dying,” said Stevens, a visiting professor at University College London."
"Five years of free registration for new electric cars, $151m for charging stations and $50m for fleet transitions are needed to drive the transition from petrol to electric vehicles, the Greens have said. A sharp increase in the luxury car tax on petrol-driven vehicles would pay for the plans, the party said in an announcement on Wednesday.  The transport sector accounts for more than 17% of Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions and the Greens believe that the increased use of electric vehicles could help reduce that figure. Launching the policy in Strathfield in Sydney, the Greens leader, senator Richard Di Natale, said: “Electric vehicles are rapidly coming down in price. With solar panels on our roof, charging our batteries for our home and car, free daily transport is at our fingertips.” A centrepiece of the Greens’ policy was that the federal government cover the costs of state vehicle registration fees for new fully electric cars for the first five years. The Greens said that would help make electric vehicles more competitive. They also proposed establishing a $151m fund to provide grants to local and state governments, as well as private car park operators, to install electric car chargers. The program would subsidise the cost of a roadside charging station up to a cap of $45,000, which they say would drive the installation of about 3,500 stations across the country. In addition, they would establish a $50m fund to cover the gap between the cost of petrol cars and electric vehicles for government and NGO fleets. With a gap of about $15,000, they said that would cover the gap for nearly 3,500 new electric cars. “You would be able to literally plug in your car to the power station at your local train station, sporting oval, swimming pool, library or while you are doing the groceries,” Di Natale said. To cover the cost of the policies, the Greens would lift the luxury car tax from 33% to 50% for fossil-fuel powered cars worth over $100,000. They say that would both raise $280m over the forward estimates to help cover the rest of the policy, as well as increase the price-competitiveness of electric luxury cars. “The old dirty power sources like diesel and coal are on their way out and we need to support industries like electric vehicles to move toward a more innovative future,” Di Natale said. The Greens also called on the Council of Australian Governments to develop a plan to assist the adoption of electric vehicles, and for the government to set a near-term target for their uptake across the country.

"Rex Tillerson, the boss of oil giant ExxonMobil, said cutting oil production was “not acceptable for humanity” as he fought off shareholders’ and activists’ attempts to force the company to fully acknowledge the impact of climate change on the environment and Exxon’s future profits. During a long and fractious annual meeting in Dallas on Wednesday, Tillerson, who serves as Exxon’s chairman and chief executive, beat back several proposals to force the company to take more action on climate change.  However, dissident shareholders won a vote that could make it easier for them to propose board candidates concerned about climate change and remove incumbent directors. Tillerson said Exxon had invested $7bn in green technology, but the science and technology had not yet achieved the breakthroughs needed to compete with fossil fuels. “Until we have those, just saying ‘turn the taps off’ is not acceptable to humanity,” he said. “The world is going to have to continue using fossil fuels, whether they like it or not.” Tillerson’s presentation at the meeting showed that Exxon believes oil and gas will still provide about 60% of the world’s energy demands by 2040, even if countries adopt climate change proposals agreed in Paris last year. His comments came after investors urged Exxon, the world’s largest oil company, with a market value of $374bn (£254bn), to reduce carbon extraction or at least warn investors about how global governmental action against climate change could affect the viability of its fossil fuel assets. More than 38% of Exxon’s investors rebelled against the company by voting for a proposal that would have required the company to publish an annual study of how its profits may be affected by public climate change policies, following the Paris climate agreement, to limit the global temperature rise to less than 2C (3.6F).  A similar vote at Chevron’s annual shareholder meeting, also held on Wednesday, showed 41% support from Chevron investors that cast ballots.  Edward Mason, head of responsible investment for the Church of England, who proposed the resolution, said he was delighted at the “very significant shareholder revolt on climate change”.  “Considering the scale of this vote, we urge Exxon to sit down urgently with its investors to agree the reporting it will provide on the risk that climate change policy poses to its business. Following the Paris agreement, the time for climate risk reporting has well and truly arrived and the investor call for it is clear. It will not go away.” Mason, who helps manage £6.7bn of assets for the Church Commissioners for England, said it wasn’t just the environment that was at risk, but also the billions of dollars invested in Exxon, if it does not adapt quickly to a changing world. “The financial risks of not acting are very real,” he said.  Exxon had tried to block the resolution from being heard at its meeting, but the US Securities and Exchange Commission regulator ruled that it must include the resolution among Wednesday’s votes.  “Given the significant resources Exxon spent fighting this proposal, such a strong vote is a real rebuke to company management,” said Andrew Logan, director of oil and gas for Ceres, a coalition of sustainable investment groups. “Investors have sent a clear message that meaningful 2 degree stress testing is the new normal, and companies like Exxon and Chevron can no longer act as if nothing has changed.” Tillerson, who was paid $23.4m last year, also suffered an investor backlash over his current position as both chairman and CEO. Some 38.8% of investors voted for a resolution asking that the company appoint an independent chairman when Tillerson stands down. He is due to retire before his 65th birthday, in March 2017.  Natasha Lamb, director of equity research and shareholder engagement for Arjuna Capital, who proposed one of the motions, said: “While the business plan of extracting as much carbon as possible was a winner last century, it will destroy value this century, and already has.” The Guardian was banned from reporting from inside the meeting, and instead listened to proceedings via webcast. “We are denying your request because of the Guardian’s lack of objectivity on climate change reporting, demonstrated by its partnership with anti-oil and gas activists and its campaign against companies that provide energy necessary for modern life, including newspapers,” a spokesman said."

"Malcolm Turnbull conceded bipartisanship on climate change was desirable and committed to meet higher targets if set by the global community in the second leaders’ debate of the Australian election campaign. But the prime minister failed to outline how Australia would reach the 2030 emission reduction targets agreed to in Paris. Bill Shorten, the Labor leader, baited Turnbull, asking: “Whatever happened to the old Malcolm Turnbull on climate change?” “You were so impressive when you were leading on climate change,” Shorten said. “Now you’re just implementing Tony Abbott’s policies.”  Turnbull, who lost the Liberal leadership to Tony Abbott in 2009 over his commitment to climate change policy, said the Coalition completely supported the science of global warming.  “Bipartisanship is always desirable on issues – long-term issues – like this,” Turnbull said. “My view is, as somebody who is committed to action on climate change and who has paid a high price for my commitment to that issue, for my commitment to global action in the past – my commitment is to ensure that Australia meets the target we agreed to in Paris. And when the global community agrees to higher targets, as I have no doubt it will, that we will meet them, too.” Shorten attacked Turnbull’s support for Abbott policy of Direct Action which created the existing emissions reduction fund – a policy he originally described as bullshit. No clear winner emerged out of the second debate, held at the National Press Club in Canberra before a panel of press gallery journalists. The issues raised included asylum seekers, tax policy, trust, superannuation policy and whether the new government would emerge with a mandate, particularly in the senate. Turnbull began the debate with a pitch on the rise of the middle class in Asia, which he said represented both “opportunity and uncertainty”. “Within a few years, half of the world’s middle class will be living to our north in east Asia,” Turnbull said. “We have seen the pace of change in technology as great businesses and great industries are overtaken by newcomers. These are times of enormous opportunity and uncertainty. “We measure the economy in numbers and percentages and growth figures. But where it counts is with every single Australian’s life and their opportunities.” Turnbull invoked Indigenous innovation as an example of both reconciliation and an opportunity for “jobs and growth”. Shorten used his introduction to outline his health and education policies – considered strengths for Labor – while comparing the government’s corporate tax cuts to the policies of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. “These economic theories have been tested before by Thatcher and Reagan but it’s a very risky expensive gamble to take with Australian taxpayer money for little economic benefit,” Shorten said. “Labor has the best plans to ensure real jobs, genuine growth and fairness.”  The first question addressed the issue of apparent voter disappointment that Turnbull has been inhibited by his party since becoming prime minister. “Will they see a different Malcolm Turnbull if you win your own mandate to the one that they see now?”  Turnbull failed to address the question, instead using climate change as an example of how his views had not changed. Shorten honed in on voter disappointment in Turnbull and linked the prime minister back to his predecessor Tony Abbott. “When Mr Turnbull got elected eight or 10 months ago, I thought my job would be harder but I thought the politics would go to a better place in this country,” Shorten said.  “I thought we would see a more elevated debate about ideas but on each issue I see this government shrinking in to an Abbott-style government of three-word slogans and scare campaigns.” Both men were asked how they could be trusted when Turnbull deposed Abbott and Shorten was involved in moving against the former Labor prime minister Kevin Rudd and then supported Rudd against Julia Gillard.  Shorten said Labor had learned from the 43rd parliament. “Labor’s learnt its lesson about that difficult period and I’m fortunate to lead a very united team,” Shorten said. Both men invoked the influence of their parents, Shorten his mother and Turnbull his father. The prime minister delivered a very personal pitch for voter trust. “I had a great education, I was brought up by a single dad who didn’t have much money,” Turnbull said. “And he struggled to send me to school, and I had some really charismatic teachers that transformed my life. I would not be where I am today without them. “I am a well-known quantity in Australian public life. I did not come into this role as apolitical activist. Did not come in here as a political staffer. I came into this role as an adult. At 50. After a lifetime of working, building businesses.” Asked if Labor had a ceiling on how much tax should be collected as a proportion of the economy, Shorten would not reveal total costings but promised to reveal forecasts before the election. “I undertake before this election campaign is over we will provide all of our forecasts once we have released all of our policies – which we haven’t yet,” Shorten said.  Turnbull was asked how company tax cuts would improve jobs rather than be passed on the shareholders. “The companies up to $10m in turnover employ 5 million Australians and they will all benefit from that support because they will see more investment in their business. This is why other countries have reduced their company tax rate,” Turnbull said. Four weeks into a double dissolution election on the Australian Building and Construction Commission following a combative Snate, neither leader would promise to respect the other’s mandate in the next parliament.  And Turnbull again promised never to bring any asylum seekers on Nauru and Manus to Australia. “I can rule out any of the detainees coming to Australia,” Turnbull said. “Labor taught all of us a very, very harsh lesson. They proved what happens if you abandon secure borders. Thousands of arrivals, deaths at sea, the people smugglers back in business.” Shorten again promised Labor have an identical policy on people smuggling.  “Whoever forms the government after 2 July, there will be no change in policy about our determination to defeat the people smugglers, the criminal syndicates who play and prey upon people, taxi them out to sea and in too many tragic cases drown,” he said. But he said he would instruct his immigration minister to talk immediately to the UN about resettling asylum seekers in offshore detention on Nauru and Manus."
"In the face of an overwhelming amount of data suggesting that climate change poses an immediate and catastrophic threat to our very existence, we remain largely inert. The stakes truly could not get any higher, yet many of us steadfastedly refuse to change our behaviour.  What’s it going to take?  It’s a question being asked more and more. Slowly, we’re gathering the data to begin answering it.  First, we’ve learned a lot about what doesn’t work, and why. In his book, What We Think About When We Try Not To Think About Global Warming, psychologist Per Espen Stoknes explains that focusing on scare tactics doesn’t serve to motivate. Quite the opposite, in fact.  In an interview with Yale Environment 360, Stoknes says, “What we know from psychological studies is that if you overuse fear-inducing imagery, what you get is fear and guilt in people, and this makes people more passive, which counteracts engagement.” This link between engagement and efficacy is underscored by the results of virtual reality experiments carried out by Stanford University, where individuals are immersed in virtual reality nature settings and then asked to carry out tasks like cutting down trees. The effects of these experiments have proven to create both striking and long-lasting positive changes in the participants’ behavior relating to environmental issues.  An article explaining the experience sums it up quite neatly: “humans’ willingness to shift behavior is directly correlated to our sense of control.”  It makes sense. If we feel afraid and innefectual, there is little motivation to act. What good would it do? The task seems too great; the chance of success, too slim.  Surprisingly, although increasing our sense of control works to increase eco-friendly behaviour, focusing purely on the effects of individual action (like I tend to in this column, ahem) often proves quite ineffective in motivating people to act.  To put it bluntly, a recent study found that “thinking about climate change from a personal perspective produced little to no change in behavior”. What did work? When researchers framed climate change within the framework of collective responsibility. Respondents consistently demonstrated a greater dedication to environmental issues (measured by the amount they were willing to donate to fight climate change) when considering collective causes of and solutions to climate change, instead of their own individual actions.  Similarly, a separate series of studies conducted over a two-year period indicated that asking participants to consider what kind of legacy they hoped to leave behind caused an increase in what the researchers call “helping behaviour”, especially regarding environmental causes. In essence, being asked to consciously think about the way they would be remembered by future generations caused people to act in more environmentally-friendly ways.  What these peeks into our psychological landscapes reveal is that we like to have an effect on the world around us. We like to have control, make our mark, and be remembered in a positive light. We like to work together, rather than feeling like fate of the world rests solely on our imperfect shoulders.  Perhaps most importantly – especially for those embedded within the often-depressing world of the environmental movement – there needs to be a light at the end of the tunnel. It’s not enough to count the species lost to extinction or measure the melting ice caps; there must be stories that go beyond the damage we’ve already done. We need stories about how to repair this earth, regenerate lost landscapes and reclaim dead ecosystems. Indeed, in his interview, Stoknes argues that rather than wallowing in morose pessimism, we need to be doing a far better job of spinning the story.  Environmentalism needs to be identified as more than just a good deed and called what it is – an incredible opportunity. There will always be small segments of the population who will be eco-friendly even when its expensive, inconvenient or unpopular, but for the rest, we need a far better sales pitch.  “We need to flip the barriers over so they become successful strategies,” says Stoknes. “Rather than doom, we need to emphasize the opportunities that the crisis affords us. Climate change is an opportunity for economic development – an entire energy system has to be redesigned from the wastefulness of the previous century to a much smarter mode of doing things. It’s a great opportunity to improve global collaboration and knowledge sharing and to create a more just society.” So, what’s it going to take? Now we know. An expanded focus and a shifting story: identifying opportunities, not just consequences. Cultivating stories of resilience, rather than catastrophy. Championing collective responsibility, rather than lone do-gooders against the world.  And hope. Above all, it’s going to take a hell of a lot of hope."
"Last week there were several sunny days in succession, arousing hopes that a teasingly hesitant spring might finally be arriving. A few birds showed up. One neat little bird that perched for a full minute in my maple tree was identified by a bird-wise friend as a coal tit. Provocatively, I suggested that, in view of the current hostility to anyone still evincing tolerance of fossil fuels, it might be better to call it a renewables tit. The bird flew off and my expert friend went home, leaving me trembling at the daring of my own heresy. One of my most easily angered critics has been posting tweets, railing against my “climate blindness”. Already hard to please by my work in general, he says that the occasional remarks in which I flaunt my “science denial” have tested his patience “to the limit”. I am left to guess what he might do if his patience is tested beyond the limit. If he shows up at my door in a tank, I could try engaging him in a discussion of the renewables tit I just saw in my garden. Or I could try calling the police.  The latter option might still be possible in Britain, where it is not yet against the law to be frivolous about the oncoming disaster detectable by everyone except those suffering from climate blindness. In the US, on the other hand, climate blindness has been considered by the attorney general, Loretta Lynch, as a reason for handing names to the FBI. Lynch, President Obama’s personal appointment, is a woman of integrity, so it can only be genuine fear of universal climate death that prompts her to contemplate calling in the G-men against those suspected of science denial. While figuring out the rules of engagement – are dithering old men suffering from climate blindness to be mown down for failing to raise their hands above their heads? – she might consider that she is perhaps copying a tainted example. John Mitchell, who was attorney general under President Nixon, preceded Lynch in the belief that it was only logical to send the Justice Department in pursuit of citizens who declined to echo their president’s opinions. When the facts came out, Nixon escaped by helicopter, but Mitchell went to jail. We can hardly expect Lynch to place herself under arrest, so for as long as Obama is president, she will probably go on with her plans for silencing dissent. The thought would depress me if I were not so elated from watching a TV nature show in which a baby elephant was stalked by a pride of seven full-size lions but it toddled safely back to the herd, no doubt to be told to quit wandering off."

"What a waste. An hour of prime time television and both leaders answered almost none of the questions. Mostly they took turns to deliver their talking points while staring, with a well practised conviction, at the camera.  Regardless of what they were asked, both Malcolm Turnbull and Bill Shorten kept returning to the same lines, the ones we’ve been hearing for three weeks now and some new ones that sounded as though they’d been rehearsed for days.  The format – no interruptions by the questioners or the other prime ministerial candidate – meant that despite the best efforts of the panel, even those voters not lured back to the more dramatic Sunday night offerings on the commercial television stations would have finished the hour-long debate not much the wiser. Neither leader really won the encounter, because it wasn’t really a contest, but rather an opportunity to deliver speaking notes in stereo.  Both seemed nervous at the outset, Turnbull bouncing on his feet, Shorten mangling his words sometimes, but it was the subject matter that was the real problem, not their manner or their method. Laura Tingle, from the Australian Financial Review, tried to force Malcolm Turnbull to explain and quantify the benefits of his $48bn in tax cuts – the centrepiece of his entire election campaign – in the face of modelling showing a portion of the benefits would flow to companies overseas. Turnbull danced straight back to points he had already made in his opening – his personal experience as a successful businessman who came to politics late in life, the fact that other countries have reduced company tax and a few vignettes about Chris Bowen advocating lower company tax in his book Hearts and Minds. You’ll notice none of that actually addresses the exact economic benefits of the company tax cuts he is proposing as the central reason people should vote for him. Tingle tried to get Shorten to say whether Labor had an upper limit in mind for spending as a proportion of the economy, but that didn’t get far either. After a long attack on Turnbull’s tax cut plan (the calculation that it would benefit the largest banks in Australia by $7.4bn over the next 10 years got a mention multiple times), the Labor leader got around to saying he was determined to put “downward pressure” on spending as a proportion of GDP, whatever that might mean. Andrew Probyn, from the West Australian, tried to steer around the “stop the boats” rhetoric to get some idea what each leader would do about the humanitarian problem of 1,600 refugees and asylum seekers languishing on Manus Island and Nauru. Not much doing there either.  Each gave a lengthy “tough on people smugglers” dissertation, before Turnbull eventually got around to saying, “we are committed to ensuring that they are treated humanely and have the opportunity to return from whence they came, to the countries they came from, or be resettled in other countries”, but without saying which other countries, or when, or how. Shorten said he would send his immigration minister to “sit down with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, to work through how we can have regional resettlement which stops people being kept in indefinite detention” – which doesn’t really answer the where, how or when questions either. The angry spark in that exchange had nothing to do with how the asylum seekers might be given some hope, but with Shorten’s jab that Turnbull should be ashamed for giving people smugglers hope by suggesting Labor wasn’t just as hardline as the coalition. A final question trying to nail down the government’s deliberately unclear policy on climate change elicited a declaration from the prime minister that he was “committed to action on climate change and who has paid a high price for my commitment to that issue”, before he completely avoided the question on how that commitment translates into an actual policy and segued into a discussion on international targets. And neither leader was prepared to answer a question from the Herald Sun’s Ellen Whinnett about why they should be trusted by the electorate. Both Turnbull and Shorten are putting big ideas to the voters this election. And they can each make their stump speech case with true conviction. Goodness knows, they’ve done it enough times.  But they would probably be trusted more, and be more authentically convincing, if they engaged in real debate where their ideas were properly tested.  • Join Lenore Taylor and Katharine Murphy in Sydney and Melbourne as they host our Guardian Live election special event featuring a panel of prominent political guests"
"At Wednesday’s ExxonMobil shareholders meeting, CEO Rex Tillerson will have to answer tough questions about the company’s role in causing climate change, including one from my family.  Attorneys general from several states are investigating when the company knew about the risks of burning fossil fuels – and whether Exxon misrepresented that information to investors and the public. At the same time, shareholders are demanding more transparency on the risks climate change poses to the company. As the daughter of one of the Exxon scientists who first told senior management about greenhouse gases in the 1970s, I find it ironic that the reason for these investigations is the company’s failure to follow the same hard-numbers approach that made Exxon so successful in the first place. My father, James F Black, PhD, started working for Standard Oil (part of which later became Esso and then Exxon) during the second world war. He had a distinguished career over 40 years, garnering dozens of patents through his wide-ranging research. In 1977, he briefed some of Exxon’s top executives about the risks of burning fossil fuels. A year later, in recapping his presentation in an internal company memo, he wrote: “Present thinking holds that man has a time window of five to ten years before the need for hard decisions regarding changes in energy strategies might become critical.” By the end of that 10-year window, however, company executives had started ignoring science, cancelling research projects and investing in “spin”. They poured millions of dollars into advocacy groups and public relations campaigns designed to cast doubt on the scientific realities of climate change. As Exxon entered this period, my father would lament: “A company is in trouble when it falls into the hands of the accountants.” Indeed, ignoring data in favor of “spinning” scientific results can cause irreparable harm. Look at the nightmare of lead poisoning in Flint, Michigan. Or consider how tobacco companies distorted their own scientific research on the dangers of secondhand smoke. In all these examples, the people and institutions who withheld or misrepresented critical information caused real harm to public health. And in Exxon’s case, the dangerous dismissal of science continues to this day.  For instance, Exxon is a key member of the American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec), which misinforms state legislators about climate science. The organization also works to block climate policies, including a revenue-neutral carbon tax – a policy Exxon claims to support. And at last year’s shareholders meeting, Rex Tillerson said climate models still weren’t good enough to take seriously. “What if everything we do, it turns out our models are lousy, and we don’t get the effects we predict?” he told shareholders. But scientists are trained to take a sober look at the weight of the evidence, not declare results they don’t like to be “lousy”. The value of true scientific inquiry is that it is free from bias and accepts results with dispassion.  When my father first briefed Exxon’s executives about climate change, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere stood at 330 parts per million. Now it is 20% higher and Nasa scientists are telling us the first few months of 2016 are so warm we’re almost certain to set another global heat record this year. What would the world be like today if Exxon executives had listened to my father? If Exxon had led the industry in confronting climate change instead of funding public relations campaigns to disprove its existence? Perhaps sea levels would not be rising as quickly. Perhaps the fires burning across Alberta would not be as destructive. Perhaps we would already be transitioning to cleaner fuels and energy sources. We’ll never really know what would have happened if Exxon had listened to my father. But at today’s shareholders meeting, Rex Tillerson can still do the right thing. My daughter Anna is in Dallas today to attend the Exxon shareholder’s meeting on our behalf. She shares her grandfather’s passion for science and just received a degree in chemistry. While she’s there, she will deliver a petition on behalf of thousands of members of ClimateTruth.org urging Exxon to finally cut its ties with the American Legislative Exchange Council, something many other oil and energy companies have already done. I hope Rex Tillerson listens to her. I hope he goes further, too. The company should end all donations (both public and anonymous) to organizations that undermine the public’s understanding of science. And instead of confusing the public on climate change, Tillerson should channel the company’s incredible resources – including its scientists and lobbying muscle – to solving it.  Exxon’s engineering and research capacities could help create a future in which the planet is protected, public welfare is not compromised and the price of its shares will remain high. That’s what my father wanted. As his daughter and a shareholder, it’s what I want, too."

"Donald Trump pledged to cancel the Paris climate agreement, endorsed drilling off the Atlantic coast and said he would allow the Keystone XL pipeline to be built in return for “a big piece of the profits” for the American people.  At an oil and natural gas conference in North Dakota on Thursday, just minutes after he had celebrated hitting the 1,237 delegate mark needed to formally clinch the party’s nomination, Trump gave a speech on energy policy that was largely shaped by advice from Kevin Cramer, a US representative from the state. In a press conference before the event, Trump praised the advice of oil tycoon Harold Hamm. Hamm and Cramer then introduced him onstage. Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club environmentalist group, was taken aback by Trump’s address.  “I have never heard more contradiction in one hour than I heard in the speech,” he told the Guardian.  “There are pools of oil industry waste water that are deeper than Trump’s grasp of energy.”  Trump gave the speech – which Brune also called “a jumbled collection of oil industry talking points that are devoid from reality in the market place” – in a packed arena that generated an atmosphere more like that of a campaign rally than a staid industry conference.  As he hit a number of familiar talking points, a crowd filled with his supporters raised chants of “build the wall”. There are pools of oil industry waste water that are deeper than Trump’s grasp of energy He did not directly address manmade climate change, which he has in the past called a hoax invented by the Chinese, but he took veiled shots at those who are concerned about global warming.  In addition to his pledge to pull out of the Paris climate deal, Trump promised to only work with “environmentalists whose only agenda is protecting nature” and to “focus on real environmental challenges, not the phony ones”.  He contrasted this approach with that of Hillary Clinton, whose plan to combat climate change he called “a poverty expansion agenda”. Trump also attacked renewable energy sources, claiming that solar energy was too expensive and attacking wind turbines for “killing eagles”. Without outlining any policy specifics, Trump argued for a focus on clean water and clean air. In January, asked by the Guardian about the Flint water contamination crisis, he said: “A thing like that shouldn’t happen but, again, I don’t want to comment on that.” On Thursday, Trump also made a unique argument about the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, which would pump shale oil from Canada into the US. Republicans have long supported the pipeline, which was opposed by environmentalists and cancelled by the Obama administration. In exchange for his approval of the pipeline, Trump said, the US would need a “significant piece” of its profits.  Shortly after that statement, though, Trump said: “The government should not pick winners and losers.” Trump also seemed unsure whether high oil prices were good or bad. Although at one point in his speech he took credit for oil hitting $50 a barrel, he later enthused about the need for cheap energy. The crowd in Bismarck did not seem confused, though. Cheering wildly, they gave Trump a spontaneous standing ovation.  “I will give you everything,” he promised them, adding: “I am the only one who will deliver.” They seemed to believe it."
"A terrifying incident rocked the Argentine Matienzo base on the Antarctic Peninsula in 1995. The base was built on an island surrounded by a thick shelf of ice called Larsen A. Ten soldiers manning the base noticed strange pools of melted water appearing on the ice surface, followed by gurgling noises as water drained through cracks in the ice, whilst far below came deep rumbling sounds. Shortly after, a monstrous collapse shook the base as the whole of Larsen A suffered a colossal implosion and shattered into a melange of icebergs. That was followed by the collapse of more ice shelves along the Peninsula. Because ice shelves float on the sea their melting didn’t add to rising sea levels. The ice shelves did, however, act as a brake on glaciers, and when they vanished the glaciers were free to slide into the sea and melt, incrementally adding to the threat of rising sea levels.   Rising global temperatures remain a concern – just last year, the Antarctic Peninsula set a new record temperature of 17C for Antarctica and prolonged warming and subsequent ice shelf collapses have wide ranging global implications. A far greater worry is the giant West Antarctic ice sheet. The ice sheet is buttressed by fringes of floating sea ice, which, if a similar collapse were to take place, could be enough to set off a chain reaction leading to a vast ice-sheet recession over just a few decades. If it melted completely scientists think that it could add as much as three metres to global sea levels, and that would spell catastrophe for low lying coasts around the world.  "
"The longest global coral bleaching event in history is now devastating reefs in the crystal clear waters of the Maldives, with images released exclusively to the Guardian powerfully illustrating the extent of the damage there. Photographed by the XL Catlin Seaview Survey, the images captured the event in May as it moved beyond the now devastated Great Barrier Reef and into waters further west. “The bleaching we just witnessed in the Maldives was truly haunting,” said Richard Vevers, founder of the Ocean Agency. “It’s rare to see reefs bleach quite so spectacularly. These were healthy reefs in crystal clear water at the height of an intense bleaching event. The flesh of the corals had turned clear and we were seeing the skeletons of the animals glowing white for as far as the eye could see – it was a beautiful, yet deeply disturbing sight.” The Maldives is series of coral atolls, built from the remains of coral. The livelihoods of people there depend on the reefs through tourism, fisheries and as a wave-break that helps prevent inundation on low-lying islands. The photographs were part of an ongoing project, in partnership with Google, the University of Queensland and the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency to capture the global bleaching event as it moves around the world. “We’ve been following this third global bleaching event since the start nearly two years ago and just when you think you’ve seen the saddest sight you’ll ever see, you see something even worse,” Vevers said. The event started in mid 2014 in the Pacific Ocean around Hawaii, which then got hit again in 2015. In early 2016 it spread to the Great Barrier Reef where 93% of its nearly 3,000 reefs were hit by bleaching. Western Australia’s reefs in the Indian Ocean have also experienced severe bleaching. When Noaa declared the event was a global bleaching event in October 2015, Mark Eakin, Noaa’s Coral Reef Watch coordinator, said it could last well into 2016. That prediction appears to be proving correct. “The current global bleaching event is already lasted longer than any previous bleaching event and is likely to last until at least the end of the year,” he said. The bleaching event started with an El Niño that appeared to be developing in Pacific Ocean, in 2014, warming the waters there, but which failed to eventuate. It was then combined with a large patch of unusually warm water, nicknamed “the blob”, that lurked around the Pacific, as well as an extreme El Niño that eventually did develop in 2015. Extreme El Niños, which spread warm water across the Pacific and warm the globe, were not seen before 1982 and have occurred three times since. Extreme El Niños are expected to increase in frequency as a result of climate change. Those El Niños were also occurring in an ocean where the surface has already warmed by 1C, putting corals near their thermal limits. When coral sits in water that is too warm for too long, it gets stressed and expels the algae that provides it with about 90% of its energy. If it stays stressed for more than a couple of weeks it starts to starve, become diseased, and dies. A new study has found the conditions that led to the devastating bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef were made 175 times more likely by climate change, and on the current trajectory, would become the average conditions by the 2030s."
"Five hardline conservative senators, including former presidential candidate Ted Cruz, have demanded the US justice department stop all investigations into whether oil and gas companies lied to the public and shareholders about climate change. “We write today to demand that the Department of Justice (DoJ) immediately cease its ongoing use of law enforcement resources to stifle private debate on one of the most controversial public issues of our time,” the senators wrote in a letter dated 25 May.   The letter intends to forestall a federal investigation like those begun by states around the US. In New York last year, the state attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, began an investigation into whether Exxon Mobil lied to its investors about the dangers of climate change, and subpoenaed the oil giant for records.  The justice department did not immediately confirm that it has any such investigations in progress or under consideration. In March, the US attorney general, Loretta Lynch, said the question was discussed and information “referred it to the FBI to consider whether or not it meets the criteria for what we could take action on”. Also on Wednesday, Exxon’s CEO, Rex Tillerson, defied shareholders and activists who have called on the company to acknowledge climate change and change its behaviors. “Until we have [breakthroughs in green technology], just saying ‘turn the taps off’ is not acceptable to humanity,” he said. “The world is going to have to continue using fossil fuels, whether they like it or not.” Some investors have tried to force change within the company, and the Rockefeller family, descended from Standard Oil tycoon John D Rockefeller, divested fully from Exxon earlier this year. Exxon funded efforts that cast doubt on climate science for years, research shows, and tried to censor a series of lectures to Congress in 2001, according to former officials of the US Global Change Research Program. But the company’s own scientists warned of climate change and records from the 1960s suggest the environment was on the oil company’s agenda: it was interested in patents to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in cars. The company was not mentioned by name in the senators’ letter. Parallel investigations have either been announced or reported in more than a dozen other states, including California, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Virginia. The senators’ letter took note of these investigations, and called them “disturbing confirmation that government officials are threatening to wield the sword of law enforcement to silence debate on climate change”.  The investigations amount to an assault on free speech, the senators argued. “Initiating criminal prosecution for a private entity’s opinions on climate change is a blatant violation of the first amendment,” they wrote, “and an abuse of power that rises to the level of prosecutorial misconduct.” At a March press conference, Schneiderman acknowledged this argument, but said that certain actions – for instance covering up information from shareholders – were not protected free speech. “The first amendment, ladies and gentlemen,” he said, “does not give you the right to commit fraud.” The senators asked for a response within two weeks to confirm that the department ends all investigations “arising from any private individual or entity’s views on climate change”, and assurance that no one will be persecuted “simply for disagreeing with the prevailing climate change orthodoxy”.  The senators voiced their opposition to the overwhelming evidence of climate change only two weeks after April was confirmed as the hottest on record, and only a month after researchers found alarming signs in cloud analysis and ice levels that suggest the effects of warming are happening faster than predicted. Forty-one percent of Americans, a record high, now believe that global warming will be a “serious threat” in their lifetime, polling shows. Some of the senators have embraced this “outsider” position. Jeff Sessions enthusiastically endorsed Donald Trump for president, Mike Lee has called for the Senate to defund the Paris climate agreement, and David Vitter has called the evidence “outlandish”, although his state of Louisiana includes an island that has lost 98% of its land.  Cruz has proven a staunch opponent of anyone who warns about global warming, and has called a jazz vocalist to testify opposite a meteorologist and former navy admiral. The oil and gas industry gave more to the Texas senator’s campaign than to any other candidate’s in the Republican primary election. The letter is one of Cruz’s first prominent actions since his reluctant return to the Senate. "
"Right now, thousands of people are taking direct action as part of a global wave of protests against the biggest fossil fuel infrastructure projects across the world. We kicked off earlier this month by shutting down the UK’s largest opencast coal mine in south Wales. Last Sunday, around 1,000 people closed the world’s largest coal-exporting port in Newcastle, Australia and other bold actions are happening at power stations, oil refineries, pipelines and mines everywhere from the Philippines, Brazil and the US, to Nigeria, Germany and India.  This is just the start of the promised escalation after the Paris agreement, and the largest ever act of civil disobedience in the history of the environmental movement. World governments may have agreed to keep warming to 1.5C, but it’s up to us to keep fossil fuels in the ground. With so many governments still dependent on a fossil fuel economy, they can’t be relied upon to make the radical change required in the time we need to make it. In the 21 years it took them to agree a (non-binding, inadequate) climate agreement, emissions soared. It’s now up to us to now hold them to account, turn words into action and challenge the power and legitimacy of the fossil fuel industry with mass disobedience. It is unjust that corporations and governments can commit crimes against the planet and society without retribution, while those fighting to prevent such crimes are punished, murdered and incarcerated. But the number of people willing to challenge this is growing. And if we really want climate justice, ;protest in the pursuit of this must be normalised; we must support rather than denounce those willing to put themselves on the line, since we all benefit from their actions. Not everyone is in a position to take civil disobedience, but we can all get behind it. Many of the changes that need to be made to tackle climate change would also improve the quality of life for the majority of people on the planet – from allowing people in Beijing to go outside without wearing pollution masks, to creating good jobs for millions. Mining companies argue that their operations provide vital jobs for local people. But the fossil fuel industry cannot offer secure jobs when it is crumbling (despite the trillions it receives in public subsidies while support for renewables is being pulled). With massive divestment, falling prices, a global climate deal, growing global resistance and increasing scientific evidence about their effects, the demise of the industry is inevitable. These jobs are not only insecure, but often dangerous. My only memories of my coal miner grandad are of him lying in bed coughing and in pain with a back injury caused at work. The effects of his job continued long after the mine closed and he was made redundant: the respiratory illness that killed him and his brothers was caused by inhaling toxic air from the mine – the same toxic air that communities unfortunate enough to live near a site of fossil fuel extraction or burning have to breathe. Corporate fossil fuel extraction also leads to local communities dependent on a finite resource, and at the mercy of a corporation whose primary interests are profit. When the oil runs dry or the coal runs out, the company makes its exit, leaving behind all of the pollution and none of the wealth. The area my family lived in, once a thriving community when coal was plentiful, is now a place of high unemployment, social decay and few opportunities. Renewables can offer not only secure, long-term jobs that are safer and less dependent on specific sites of extraction, but also the opportunity for democratic ownership of energy and sustainable communities. The choice between clean, safe, democratic and sustainable energy/jobs or dirty, dangerous and undemocratic energy/jobs is a no-brainer. We have the technology right now to make the transition to a zero-carbon Britain – the barriers are not technological but political. To overcome those political barriers, we need to reclaim our power – both in terms of who has power over our lives, and how we power our lives. And as 2017 is said to be the year when the door to reach two degrees closes forever, now is the time to do it. This year must be the year of mass climate disobedience."

"The US insurance industry, the country’s second largest institutional investor in oil, gas and coal with $459bn in fossil fuel investments, needs to divest or face serious threats to its financial stability, according to a report released Tuesday. The report, funded by Ceres, a Boston-based sustainability advocacy group, analyzes investment data from the country’s 40 largest insurance companies, including Prudential, AIG, Metlife, State Farm and Allstate. The report doesn’t quantify the potential financial losses but points out the economic challenges that have bedeviled the fossil fuel industry, such as low oil prices and the bankruptcy filings of 69 North American oil and gas producers since the beginning of 2015.   Cynthia McHale, the report’s lead author, says the public is largely unaware of the extent of fossil fuel investments by their insurance companies. Poor investment strategies could negatively affect the financial health of insurance firms and their ability to pay out claims to policyholders. “Their policyholders may not feel comfortable with the fact that their insurance company is investing in oil and gas or coal,” McHale said. “Maybe we have more risk here than was previously understood, which in turn affects the capital that these insurance companies need to carry.” The report comes at a time when the insurance industry is facing increasing political pressure to figure out how to address investment risks presented by climate change. Last month, about 175 governments gathered at the United Nations to sign the Paris climate agreement, which aims to limit changes to global average temperatures to under 2C from pre-industrial revolution and minimize the environmental and social devastation that could come with a warmer world, such as increasing droughts and mass extinction of species. Part of the global fight to rein in rising temperatures will require using less fossil fuels to power everyday lives. A study published in Nature last year calculated that globally, 82% of coal, 49% of gas and 33% of oil reserves would need to remain unused to keep temperatures from increasing by 2C. In April, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon challenged the insurance industry to “decarbonize” its portfolios and invest more heavily in green energy by 2020. On 25 January, 2016, California’s Dave Jones became the first state insurance commissioner to ask insurance companies operating in the state to voluntarily divest from thermal coal investments. At the same time, Jones announced upcoming changes to reporting requirements from insurance companies with new requirements for detailed disclosures of annual carbon-based investments, including oil, gas and coal. The first reporting deadline is 1 July and the disclosures will be made public, Jones said. Advocacy groups are also taking insurance companies to task. Earlier this month, activist group Market Forces waged a campaign in Sydney, Australia to call attention to insurance group QBE’s investments in coal, by applying the tagline “Made possible by QBE” – used by the company in its 2012 annual report – to pictures of coal mines and environmental disasters. Ceres’s latest report comes a day before Chevron and ExxonMobil hold their annual meetings, where company executives will face questions about how they plan to manage risks posed by climate change. Some insurance companies are changing their investment strategies. In November, Germany’s Allianz insurance company, one of the world’s largest investors, announced that it would decrease investments in coal and increase investments in wind power. Proponents of divestments say the industry, which is all about managing risks by insuring against catastrophes and other unforeseen incidents, should understand more than any other the perils of investing in fossil fuels. But Victor B Flatt, director of the University of North Carolina School of Law’s Center for Climate, Energy, Environment and Economics, noted that insurers aren’t necessary recognizing that climate change poses financial risks to both their business and investments. “The people who make the decisions about actuarial risks – tornadoes, hurricanes – those people are more aware of climate impacts than the people who are handling the asset investment,” Flatt said. “There’s the side that writes policies and considers risks and I would say that they’re ahead of most American businesses in recognizing that climate change is a risk to [them] having to pay out for more than what they bargained for.” Insurance companies who responded to requests for comment maintain that they are managing their investments carefully, but none addressed the long term risks of putting money in fossil fuels. State Farm said by email that it does not “discuss our investment strategies in a public forum”. In an emailed statement, Allstate said: “As a core part of our investment management and risk/return evaluation process, we continually evaluate prevailing and potential future market conditions, regulations and investment creditworthiness, among other factors, and adjust our portfolio accordingly.” John Hancock, one of the largest investors in oil and gas, highlighted its recent investments in renewables in this statement: “To date this year, we have invested about $1bn in utilities and oil and gas and $360m in renewables.” McHale concedes that insurance companies won’t likely change their investment strategies quickly given their size and conservative culture. “It’s a little bit like slowing and turning the Titanic, I think,” McHale said. “You need to start now by getting your arms around where you are exposed.”"
"The global community is badly prepared for a rapid increase in climate change-related natural disasters that by 2050 will put 1.3 billion people at risk, according to the World Bank. Urging better planning of cities before it was too late, a report published on Monday from a Bank-run body that focuses on disaster mitigation, said assets worth $158tn – double the total annual output of the global economy – would be in jeopardy by 2050 without preventative action.  The Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery said total damages from disasters had ballooned in recent decades but warned that worse could be in store as a result of a combination of global warming, an expanding population and the vulnerability of people crammed into slums in low-lying, fast-growing cities that are already overcrowded. “With climate change and rising numbers of people in urban areas rapidly driving up future risks, there’s a real danger the world is woefully unprepared for what lies ahead,” said John Roome, the World Bank Group’s senior director for climate change.  “Unless we change our approach to future planning for cities and coastal areas that takes into account potential disasters, we run the real risk of locking in decisions that will lead to drastic increases in future losses.” The facility’s report cited case studies showing that densely populated coastal cities are sinking at a time when sea levels are rising. It added that the annual cost of natural disasters in 136 coastal cities could increase from $6bn in 2010 to $1tn in 2070. The report said that the number of deaths and the monetary losses from natural disasters varied from year to year, but the upward trend was pronounced. Total annual damage – averaged over a 10-year period – had risen tenfold from 1976–1985 to 2005–2014, from $14bn to more than $140bn. The average number of people affected each year had risen over the same period from around 60 million people to more than 170 million. Although developed countries have been responsible for the bulk of historic global emissions, poorer countries are more vulnerable to the impact of climate change and they demanded financial help from the west as part of last December’s breakthrough global deal to reduce emissions. Oxfam this week called on rich countries to make good on the pledges made at the Paris conference to provide the funding to help developing countries adapt to the effects of global warming.  “Climate change is a brutal reality confronting millions of the world’s most vulnerable people. Their need for financial support to adapt to climate extremes is urgent and rising,” Oxfam said in its Unfinished Business report. “International support for adaptation falls well short of what is needed. Latest estimates indicate that only 16% of international climate finance is currently dedicated to adaptation – a mere $4bn–$6bn per year of which is public finance.”  According to the the facility, disaster risk is affected by three factors. It said these were: hazard – the frequency of potentially dangerous naturally occurring events, such as earthquakes or tropical cyclones; exposure – the size of the population and the economic assets located in hazard-prone areas; and vulnerability – the susceptibility of the exposed elements to the natural hazard. It added that hazard was increasing due to climate change; exposure was going up because more people were living in hazardous areas and that vulnerability was on the rise because of badly designed and poorly planned housing. The World Bank-run body said the population was expected to rise by at least 40% in 14 of the 20 most populated cities in the world between 2015 and 2030, with some cities growing by 10 million people in that period. “Many of the largest cities are located in deltas and are highly prone to floods and other hazards, and as these cities grow, an ever greater number of people and more assets are at risk of disaster.” Francis Ghesquiere, head of the secretariat at the The Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery, said: “By promoting policies that reduce risk and avoiding actions to drive up risk, we can positively influence the risk environment of the future. The drivers of future risk are within the control of decision makers today. They must seize the moment.”"
"As we saw in the recent legal ruling against Peabody coal, arguments and myths that are based in denial of the reality of human-caused global warming rarely withstand scientific scrutiny. In a new study published in Global Environmental Change, a team led by Stephen Lewandowsky tested the accuracy of some popular myths and contrarian talking points sampled from climate denial blogs and other media outlets. The scientists searched the blogs for key words related to Arctic sea ice, glaciers, sea level rise, and temperature to identify the most popular arguments. Not surprisingly, they found some common myths:  nearly two-thirds of all mentions of temperature on the three top contrarian blogs included a claim of “cooling”; and likewise more than a quarter of all mentions of arctic ice alluded to its “recovery”, and so on. Using their search results, the authors put together language that was representative of the most common arguments made on the climate denial blogs about these subjects. To ensure that their example arguments accurately depicted contrarian claims and rhetorical techniques, they also consulted climate experts, who confirmed their representativeness. Interestingly, the climate experts identified many of the same mistakes that my colleagues and I found in our 2015 study attempting to replicate climate contrarian research (cherry picking data, for example). The authors then used the same data and arguments as the contrarian blogs, but changed the climate variables to something related to economics, and presented them to economists and statisticians: For example, the [glaciers] scenario pairs the claim that “our country’s rural population is growing, not shrinking” with a figure that showed the change in population for numerous individual villages, akin to a figure depicting the mass balance of individual glaciers. In addition, an alternative statement was constructed for each scenario that summarized the mainstream scientific interpretation of the climate data, again translated into economic or demographic terms (e.g., “almost all of the rural regions of the country are losing population”). The tests involved common contrarian myths that: In every case, the economists and statisticians found that the mainstream statements were more correct than the contrarian statements, which in most cases they found to be incorrect or misleading, and hence unsuitable for policy advice. In a similar previous study, Lewandowsky found that economists thought the notion of a “pause” in global surface warming was “misleading and ill-informed” when the temperature data were instead labeled as agricultural output. This was a particularly important test, because the pause myth has become the basis of most arguments against taking action to curb global warming, despite the fact that any temporary slowdown in global surface warming is now over. In short, economists and statisticians find climate contrarians’ interpretations of data and associated arguments to be misleading and wrong. As the paper concludes: public statements by contrarians fail to meet expert approval. Their uncritical inclusion in media discourse therefore does the public a disservice and confirms that media ‘‘balance’’ can be a form of bias or even self-censorship if contrarian views override scientific opinions. Unfortunately, social science research has found that misinformation and myths are quite effective at reducing public support for climate policies, and media sources are often guilty of false balance in climate reporting, exposing their audiences to these myths in order to give equal time to “the other side.” As this study shows, on the subject of climate change, the favored arguments of “the other side” tend to be inaccurate, misleading, and misinform people who are exposed to them. By repeating these scientifically and statistically unfounded denial arguments, the media are essentially making us stupider about climate change. This false balance has severe consequences, undermining public support to solve the urgent global problem of climate change."

"A golf-and-hotel complex on the west coast of Ireland has applied to construct extensive dune erosion defences to mitigate the effects of erosion “due to sea level rise and increased Atlantic storminess”. An investigation by the US news website Politico found that the environmental impact statement included with the application specifically uses climate change to justify the defence scheme. “If the predictions of an increase in sea level rise as a result of global warming prove correct … it is likely that there will be a corresponding increase in coastal erosion rates,” it says. Why is this interesting? Because the resort in question is the Trump International Golf Links and Hotel. The golf course, for as long as it remains above water, is owned by a US presidential candidate, who has dismissed global warming as a “total hoax”. He’s also called it “bullshit” and a con, and although he now claims it was a joke he once tweeted that global warming was invented by the Chinese to make US manufacturing less competitive.  The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. In September, Trump said Barack Obama’s climate strategy was trying “to solve a problem that I don’t think in any major fashion exists”. But the disappearing golf course is no hoax. Shortly before Trump concluded the deal to buy it, in 2014, a storm carried off eight metres of beach. On a visit last week Trump’s son Eric told the Irish Times: “You have a couple more storms and, quite frankly, that course doesn’t exist.” To suggest that Trump is willing to put his business interests ahead of his beliefs would be to imply he has beliefs in the first place. Does he secretly accept global warming, or is he just pretending it exists to get this sea wall built? The latter scenario would imply he at least read the environmental impact statement – which is, I can attest, really long and boring – submitted to Clare county council on his behalf. Anyway, it has been shown over and over that Trump’s core supporters aren’t troubled by questions about his integrity or his consistency. They like him like this. So far, one person has filed a submission objecting to Trump’s planning application, but on the grounds that the erosion management works would have a negative impact on a special conservation area, and not because global warming is bullshit. There’s still time. I sympathise with the Radio 4 Today presenter Justin Webb, who described in the Radio Times having to defend himself to his daughter for earning more than the prime minister. I don’t sympathise because I earn more than the PM, but because I too have faced the withering accusation Webb’s daughter levelled at him: “But you don’t do anything,” she said. In his defence Webb maintained that his job required him to get up extremely early. “But you just read things out,” she said. “Literally, Daddy, you just read for a living.” I wish I could plausibly claim to my children that I rose at dawn to read aloud, but they’re usually out of the house before I wake up. As a freelance writer, I accept that my job doesn’t look like much to the untrained observer. To my children it just looks like a man who is sitting in front of a computer but not using it. And I accept that on some days when they arrive home earlier than I expect, it might look more like a man eating custard creams in front of Bargain Hunt. With all my children in the middle of exams, I am making a temporary effort to seem more administratively engaged when they’re around as a sort of show of support. But their exam schedules mean they come and go at weird hours, and all the looking busy is starting to get me down. I can’t carry on working like this, not even for the prime minister’s money."
"Round numbers can trigger all sorts of weird and sometimes irrational responses.  For example, in about 19 years time when I turn 40 there’ll be some sort of celebration at which I’m told I have reached a milestone. The number can also trigger denial in those afflicted (I honestly wouldn’t know*).   This month the world reached one of its own milestones.  Levels of carbon dioxide in the southern hemisphere’s background atmosphere reached 400 parts per million, according to a measuring station at Cape Grim in Tasmania. At 9news, the 400ppm was described as a “tipping point”. One bulletin from climate campaign group 350.org said the 400ppm figure was a “red line of pollution that, now breached, locks in more tragic climate impacts”. Well, it’s neither a “tipping point” or a “red line” but the inexorable rise of these numbers over decades is just as fundamental. Nothing in particular happens to the Earth’s climate at 400ppm as opposed to, say, 399 or 401, but given the human condition for celebrating milestones (even ones we really don’t like) the attention it got was understandable and warranted. When the planet’s other major long-term carbon dioxide monitoring site in Hawaii was approaching 400ppm in 2013, Nature magazine described the “milestone” as “worrisome”.  The Mauna Loa site has been recording CO2 levels in the atmosphere for 56 years and just had its largest ever annual jump ­— a rise of 3.05 ppm. Because most greenhouse gas emissions come from the northern hemisphere, it takes about a year for the gases to mix enough to then show up in the southern hemisphere readings. A few days ago, the Antarctic’s observation point for CO2 concentrations – Casey Station – also recorded 400ppm. These data points sound a little anodyne – inconsequential almost – until you start to put them into context. Because these measurements – regardless of when you decide to check in on them – are a reminder of how our penchant for burning fossil fuels and chopping down forests is fundamentally reshaping the planet’s future every single day. So when was the last time the planet had CO2 levels like this, and what sort of a world was it? Dr David Etheridge, a principal research scientist at Australia’s CSIRO, told me: “We know [levels of CO2 in the atmosphere] from the air extracted directly from ice cores and we can go back to about 800,000 years ago. It is inconceivable that there would be any lasting concentration of CO2 much above about 300 parts per million in that record.” He says analysis of sea sediments can push our estimates of historic CO2 levels back even further – to about two million years. Those records also show today’s levels of CO2 are higher. “That’s a pretty solid record,” he says. “But climate change is about the rate of change. This is all coming at us very quickly and the increases are faster than anything we have seen in history. That’s a big issue.” Etheridge says it is vital that monitoring of atmospheric CO2 continues because those measurements are plugged into computer models of the climate system.  The measurements, he says, help scientists understand how the oceans and the land are reacting to the pulse of carbon dioxide we’re responsible for since the start of the industrial revolution. Another point to make, is that the reason that CO2 levels keep rising in the atmosphere is because once it’s there, it stays there for a long time (think of it this way: if your dad drove your mum to the hospital the day you were born, the CO2 released from the tailpipe helped push CO2 levels to where they are today, whether you’re aged 21, 40 or 100). Those CO2 levels are pushing global temperatures beyond any point that human civilisation has ever experienced before. It is not just the levels of CO2, but the speed at which we’ve managed to get them there.  Professor Michael Mann of Penn State University in the US says there is no evidence in the ancient climate record “for the rapidity of the current human-caused release of CO2”. A 2009 study in the journal Science found the last time in Earth’s history when CO2 levels in the atmosphere were this high for a sustained period was between 15 and 20 million years ago. Then, according to the study, temperatures were between 3C and 6C warmer than today. Ice sheets, the study said, had melted to the point where sea levels rose between 25 and 40 metres. “And therein lies the rub,” says Mann. “Once you melt an ice sheet, it takes many, many thousands of years to rebuild it.” The time to start burning an awful lot less coal, oil and gas wasn’t last week. The “tipping point” or the “red line” wasn’t crossed at 400 ppm. This legacy of inaction rests across decades. There’s no denying that. *Or maybe I would, says this child of the 70s."
"The wildfire in northern Alberta continues to rage out of control, growing to more than 423,000 hectares as officials said it would be at least another two weeks before the tens of thousands of evacuated Fort McMurray residents would be allowed to return to the city. Relief – in the form of cooler weather and slight precipitation – may be on the way for fire crews, Rachel Notley, the Alberta premier, said on Wednesday. “So of course we’re all crossing our fingers that that happens.”   While the fire had expanded by 68,000 hectares in the past day, making it more than six times the size of Toronto, much of the fire’s growth has been confined to remote forested areas.  Earlier this week, shifting winds forced the evacuation of 8,000 non-essential staff from more than a dozen camps and sites north of Fort McMurray. Hours later, the fire consumed an oil sands camp belonging to Horizon North Logistics, and authorities warned the fire was fast approaching the Syncrude and Suncor Energy facilities in the area. On Wednesday the government said firefighters had been able to hold off the fire from the oil sands facilities. “We were very successful in some of the areas there to the north, so the fire hasn’t encroached as far as we had first feared,” said Chad Morrison, Alberta’s manager of wildfire prevention. “It was very unfortunate that we lost one lodge and that’s obviously due to the extreme fire behaviour.” In early May, the fire transformed from one that was largely in control to a raging wildfire that breached the city of Fort McMurray. Amid heavy smoke and flames that licked city streets, more than 88,000 residents were ordered evacuated. The Alberta premier said that residents would be able to return to the city beginning 1 June, in a phased re-entry plan that would see residents in the least-damaged areas be allowed in first. By 4 June, residents of neighbourhoods like Beacon Hill, where the fire destroyed an estimated 70% of homes, will be allowed to return. The dates are tentative, stressed Notley, and contingent on the fire’s behaviour in the coming weeks. “This is our best guess,” she said. “If conditions change as they did just this week, the voluntary re-entry may begin later than 1 June.” She pointed to the continued issue of air quality in the city, normally measured on a scale of 1 to 10. On Wednesday morning it stood at a staggering 51. By mid-afternoon it had fallen to 11. Residents would be advised to boil drinking water in the city until the end of June and were told they would have to bring their own supplies, such as medication and non-perishable food, when they return to the city.  “Remember, many hazards remain in Fort McMurray,” said Notley. “We need to address all of them before it is safe for residents to begin to return, and we are doing this.”  For hundreds of residents, a return to the community won’t mean a return to their homes. The fire destroyed 1,921 structures, the government said in revised numbers released on Wednesday. The destroyed areas will be fenced off, but residents will be toured through those areas when they return. Approximately 90% of the city remains intact after the fire.  The timeline for re-entry was welcomed by Brian Jean, a member of the Alberta legislature whose home was destroyed by the fire. “I know that every morning that I’ve been receiving messages from my family, my friends and my neighbours. They’re tired, stressed and waiting to hear this news,” he said as he fought back tears. “We will rebuild our city and it will be better than ever.”  Speaking in Ottawa on Wednesday, Don Forgeron, the chief executive of the Insurance Bureau of Canada said the fire will likely be the costliest natural disaster in Canadian history, estimating that the cost to insurers would land somewhere between C$3 billion and C$9 billion. The world, he said, was now in a new era in which disasters such as fires and floods were happening more often. He pointed to a recent report by Canada’s parliamentary budget officer predicting that disasters linked to climate change could cost the government an average of C$902m a year over the next five years. “Climate change ... has moved from future threat to present danger,” Forgeron said. "
"The devastating rise in Alaska’s wildfires is making global warming even worse than scientists expected, US government researchers said on Wednesday. The sharp spike in Alaska’s wildfires, where more than 5 million acres burned last year, are destroying a main buffer against climate change: the carbon-rich boreal forests, tundra and permafrost that have served as an enormous carbon sink.  Northern wildfires must now be recognised as a significant driver of climate change – and not just a side-effect, according to the report from the US Geological Survey.  “This is one of the surprises that we haven’t talked about much,” said Virginia Burkett, chief climate scientist at the USGS. “It has tremendous implications for the carbon that is locked up in Alaska soils and vegetation.” A record wildfire year – such as 2015 which was the worst in Alaska for a decade – had a measurable effect on the release of carbon dioxide and methane, which are the main drivers of climate change. “Our scientists found that the balance of carbon storage versus release in Alaska was strongly linked with wildfires,” Burkett said. “In years where there was high wildfire activity the net carbon balance declined dramatically, and then it would rebuild in the absence of fire.” Alaska is a far bigger storehouse for carbon than the lower 48 states, according to the USGS.  The state’s boreal forests, peat-rich tundra, and permafrost hold about 53% of US carbon. Alaska accounts for about 18% of US land mass. Alaska currently absorbs about 3.7m tonnes of carbon a year, the USGS assessment found. But that vast storehouse of carbon has been breached by warming temperatures, thawing permafrost – and wildfire.  The USGS warned last year that Alaska could lose about a quarter of its permafrost by 2100, accelerating climate change.  In an average year, Alaska wildfires devour twice the area burned by wildfires in all of the lower 48 – and emit more greenhouse gases than all of those other wildfires combined, the USGS said.  Such fires across the northern US and Canada – which last month forced the evacuation of 80,000 from the Alberta tar sands town of Fort McMurray – were projected to increase over the coming decades as the climate continues to warm.  When it comes to wildfires, there is a triple effect on warming. Carbon stored in trees as well as the upper layers of soil is released back into the atmosphere during a fire. The burn also exposes the carbon-rich permafrost beneath, making it thaw more easily. The northern US and Canada have already experienced a sharp rise in wildfires over the last few decades, with more to come. Researchers predict a fourfold increase in northern wildfires because of warming and changes in rainfall, extending even to areas above the treeline. The Arctic smashed through earlier heat records over this last winter – with temperatures at the North Pole hovering above zero degrees Celsius at the end of last year. There were also shortages of snow, with organisers of the legendary Iditarod resorting to importing truckloads of white stuff for the start of the dog sled race. The hotter and drier conditions were a recipe for more wildfires – with lightning strikes igniting more easily in drier soils and vegetation, and higher temperatures spreading the flames.  If average July temperatures top 13.4C (56.1F), there could be a big jump in wildfires in tundra regions such as Alaska’s North Slope and the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta that were once too damp and cold to burn, the researchers found."
"I am a novelist. I look around at the world and I make up stories about people, families, lovers and friends. More often than not, the stories take place in Bangladesh, where I was born. When I close my eyes and think of home, it’s the peaty smell of the monsoon, the harsh light of the equatorial sun, the clashing sounds of the capital city, Dhaka, that come to mind. But, more often than not, people do not ask me about the peaty smell of the monsoon. The questions are about other things, the bigger things, such as religion, politics, the unaccounted bodies of the dead, the history that makes the present. I do not resent these questions – I understand why people ask them; after all, the headlines tell a particular story, and sometimes, we look for an interlocutor – someone to bridge the gap between here and there.  But I would like to declare a moratorium on such topics, and in preparation, I have listed here all the questions I no longer wish to answer about Bangladesh. Not because they are uninteresting to me, but because I am making space for all the other questions, the questions about falling in love, about the taste of water in the air, about the blue-black feathers and crimson eyes of the koel bird. Next time, ask me about those. Here are the top questions I no longer want to answer about Bangladesh: When I was a child growing up outside Bangladesh (my father was a UN diplomat, so we moved every few years), I would always dread the question: “Where are you from?” because as soon as I replied, a doleful, sorry expression would come over whoever I was talking to. “Are there a lot of floods?” people would ask. Children, rather more blunt, would say: “Is everyone poor?” In graduate school, after I attended a guest lecture by a famous feminist, I was invited to have lunch with the lecturer, a woman I had long admired, and whose books I had devoured as a teenager. When I told her I was from Bangladesh, she said, “Good for you!”, as if I had crawled out of the gutter just moments before our meeting. But I am nostalgic for those responses now. Today, when the name of my country comes up, people don’t immediately think of poverty – they think of fundamentalism, and the innocent victims of hate crimes. I can’t blame them: in the last three years, targeted, ideologically driven killings have occurred on a terrifyingly regular basis. It began with the murder of atheist bloggers in 2013, and has now spread to include foreign nationals, publishers, a university professor whose only crime was that he loved music, and, last month, the LGBT activists Xulhaz Mannan and Tonoy Majumder. The government’s response has been shameful, a combination of denial, victim-blaming and a complete lack of commitment to catching the killers. A man has just been arrested for Mannan’s death, and we are hoping this signals a change of attitude on the part of the authorities. I can answer this question in two ways. Yes, there are murderers in Bangladesh who produce hitlists of the progressive, secular, music-loving professors and activists and journalists in the country. One by one, they are picking them off. International terror organisations such as Islamic State and al-Qaida have taken responsibility for these crimes, although the government insists they have been carried out by vengeful members of the opposition. But I can also point to the strong tradition of diversity and inclusion in Bangladesh. I can describe last month’s celebration of Pohela Boishakh, Bengali new year, which was carried out with great fanfare and not a religious symbol in sight. I can continue to insist that the majority of Bangladeshis have no desire to murder bloggers or university professors or LGBT activists, as if that point needed to be made. I can insist that the story of Bangladesh is not the story of a secular country that has turned to radicalism: it is the story of a country that has, against all odds, survived, even flourished. Where there used to be famine, there is now a rice crop that manages to feed 180 million people. Where once there were devastating statistics on everything from education to public health, there is economic growth, and NGOs such as Grameen Bank and Brac, whose programmes on health, non-formal primary education and microcredit have been replicated all over the world. There is no denying it: the murderous fringe groups exist. The apathetic government also exists. The secular tradition, which reveres the poet Rabindranath Tagore and has people painting murals on the pavement and celebrating the diversity of our culture in poetry and song, also exists. But it is impossible to write about religion, impossible to openly discuss a wide range of issues – not just because social media makes our opinions visible to a wide audience, but because there is a lack of moral outrage against these crimes, a tacit, understated belief that somehow, somewhere, the atheist blogger and the gay man and the music-loving professor deserved it. And that is the scariest thing of all. Ah, the knotty question of Where We Came From. Perhaps you have heard of the Concert for Bangladesh, when Ravi Shankar played for an audience of thousands in Madison Square Gardens, New York. It was 1971, and the Bangladesh war of independence had been raging for six months. Before that, Bangladesh was part of Pakistan – it was called East Pakistan, though the two wings of the country were divided by 1,000 miles of India and the citizens of the two wings spoke different languages and had vastly different concepts of what citizenship in a Muslim-majority country meant. The Bengali nationalist movement was brutally suppressed by West Pakistan, beginning with the cancellation of national elections, and ending with the mass murder of Bengali civilians in March 1971. The nine-month war that followed ended with the independence of Bangladesh. Estimates of the number of war-related deaths (a contested figure) are as high as three million, but declassified documents from the Pakistan government give clear evidence of a campaign of genocide ordered from the top down. If you want to know more about the war, read Salil Tripathi’s brilliant The Colonel Who Would Not Repent, which tells, in both sweeping and intimate terms, the story of those nine months, and the brutal legacy they left behind. As for me, I can only tell you about my grandmother, Musleha Islam, widowed at 29, and mother of revolutionaries. During the war, my grandmother hid a cache of arms in her garden. She wasn’t particularly nationalistic – in fact, she hadn’t even been born in Dhaka and the majority of her family were in West Pakistan, and they considered her a gaddar, a traitor – but her oldest son, my uncle Wasif, joined the Mukti Bahini, the revolutionary forces, after the outbreak of war. Wasif brought the guns to her house, and she agreed to let him dig a hole in the garden. Months later, the army tortured a friend of Wasif’s into confessing, and a truck full of soldiers appeared on my grandmother’s doorstep. The story of how she persuaded them not to take away her children is one that is told and retold in the family. To me, this story is everything: a migrant, a widow, a single mother, an accidental revolutionary who held her own before the might of an army. People always want to know how women fare in Muslim-majority countries. Are we allowed to vote? Do we own property, have jobs, drive cars? The answer to all those questions is yes. We go to school, we get PhDs, we run businesses. Two women – Sheikh Hasina Wajed and Khaleda Zia – have been our democratically elected heads of state since 1991. Girls and boys have now achieved parity in primary school admissions. After decades of investment in public health, we have made great strides in reducing maternal mortality and increasing access to village-level health programmes – in fact, the World Economic Forum rates Bangladesh higher than its bigger, wealthier neighbours when it comes to the gender gap. Microfinance, pioneered by Bangladesh’s Nobel laureate, Professor Muhammad Yunus, has allowed women to become the heads of millions of households. And yet, we still have a long way to go. I would be lying if I said the sting of patriarchy is entirely numbed by progress. Are we equal in the eyes of the law? Well, yes and no. When it comes to citizenship, yes. But there is a line in the constitution that states that in family matters, religious law trumps civil law. Thus, when it comes to divorce, inheritance and child custody, the law overwhelmingly favours men. This basic differentiation filters through the rest of society, like poison in the water. It means that violence against women is ubiquitous, hidden and largely unpunished. It means there has never been a prosecution for marital rape in Bangladesh. It means that police officers who witness sexual assault often look the other way. It means the everyday, casual sexual harassment on the street and in the workplace goes unnoticed and unchallenged. After living through a revolution that was as much about social transformation as national independence, my mother is a feminist, and so are all her friends. She taught me that feminism is not a choice, but a responsibility for women like me – those of us who are born into privilege in a country where privilege is determined by the accident of your birth. There is a feminist interest in everything I do, everything I write, every position I take. I consider this a part of my national inheritance as much as anything else. I once went to a remote part of Bangladesh to meet people who lived on chars, or river islands. These islands, created by the sediment left behind when a river changes course, are temporary, insecure places to live. At any moment, a char can flood, or, worse, disappear altogether. But because this land is unclaimed – its very temporary nature means it belongs to no one – the very poorest people live on it. The people of this particular char had been given grants to raise their homes into higher ground, so that, in the event of flooding, they would be protected. I walked between these artificial hills and thought that this is how country would look like someday – submerged in water, with small islands of people clinging to their homes while everything else is washed away. Professor Atiq Rahman of the Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies has said that the country will face the displacement of more than 20 million people by 2050. Already, the sea level rise means that land is being eaten away by the sea, and that the freshwater supply is being contaminated by salt, affecting everything from agriculture to women’s health. Bangladesh has appealed to the international community for reparations – as one of the lowest per capita carbon nations in the world, yet one of the most vulnerable, we have a good case. But in order to have the proverbial leg to stand on, we must also oppose environmentally unsound energy programmes, such as the current proposal to build 25 new coal-fired power plants by 2022. Although a developing Bangladesh has growing energy needs, we must find a way to achieve this without committing the sins of those whom we blame for our predicament. Otherwise, there is no higher ground, literal or metaphoric. Bangladeshis love this question, because it implies that the worst thing that could happen to our country is that it might resemble the one we fought so hard to separate from. There’s a bit of schadenfreude there, but the deeper meaning is rather worse. It means that there are only two models for a country made up of Muslim citizens: that we go the way of suicide bombers, or that we behave, somehow taming the fundamentalist beast within us. The truth is that there is no binary here. We have the bodies of men who have been killed because of their beliefs – that is a matter of grave concern, of outrage. But their deaths should be read in the context of other deaths, ones that don’t perhaps make the international news. The suppression of opposition – whether ideological or political – has become habitual in Bangladesh. The government jails leaders of the opposition and sues newspaper editors for defamation and sedition. The army occupies large tracts of southern Bangladesh, turning indigenous lands into a militarised zones. Religious minorities are driven from their ancestral homes, their daughters and wives intimidated by rape. On Saturday, as I counted the days since Xulhaz and Tonoy’s deaths, a 75-year-old monk was hacked to death in a Buddhist temple. And so it goes. Ask me about the koel. Ask me why the lychee season is only two weeks long. Ask me about my parents, riding their rickshaw to New Market on the eve of the country’s birth, he recently returned from the army, she having survived army occupation and the arrest of her brother. Ask me about the particular history in those particular bodies, and I can reply with confidence, even joy, even if the news is bittersweet. Do not ask me to speak for an entire country, a history as complicated as the riverine lines on my grandmother’s hands. There are historians and journalists for that. Ask them to draw the conclusions. I can only tell you stories.  Tahmima Anam’s The Bones of Grace is published this month by Canongate. "

"Donald Trump has consistently expressed his conspiratorial and misinformed beliefs that global warming is a hoax. Ice storm rolls from Texas to Tennessee - I'm in Los Angeles and it's freezing. Global warming is a total, and very expensive, hoax!  Trump is also the presumptive Republican Party nominee for president in 2016, and were he elected, would be the leader of the country with the second-highest net carbon pollution in the world. These are frightening thoughts. However, as reported by Politico, Trump acknowledges the reality and threats posed by human-caused global warming when it comes to protecting his own assets, and in keeping with his affinity for building walls: The New York billionaire is applying for permission to erect a coastal protection works to prevent erosion at his seaside golf resort, Trump International Golf Links & Hotel Ireland, in County Clare. A permit application for the wall, filed by Trump International Golf Links Ireland and reviewed by POLITICO, explicitly cites global warming and its consequences — increased erosion due to rising sea levels and extreme weather this century — as a chief justification for building the structure. The permit was filed by an Irish environmental consulting company, so it’s possible that Trump himself denies these scientific realities. However, the consultants are indisputably correct about the threat that global warming and sea level rise pose to this golf course, and to the many other coastal properties owned by Donald Trump. Trump’s public comments on climate change may reflect a political calculation that the old, white, conservative, American men who comprise his voter base also form the predominant segment of the climate denial movement. Or perhaps Trump is indeed in denial about the science himself, but those who protect his assets, such as this Irish environmental consulting firm, are not. Trump also has the wealth necessary to blunt some of the impacts of climate change, for example by building sea walls, whereas poorer countries, which will bear the brunt of the consequences of climate denial, do not possess these resources. These poorer countries also contribute the least to the problem, whereas Trump opposes “so-called green energy” technologies like solar and wind power that are critical for wealthy countries to reduce their much higher carbon pollution.  In fact, Trump has fought to prevent the construction of wind farms along the coasts of Scotland and Ireland. Yet despite his misinformed objections that wind energy is too costly, Trump has invested in one of the world’s largest generators of wind power. The next president of the United States will be tasked with ensuring the country meets its pledge to cut carbon pollution, made during the recent international climate negotiations in Paris. Trump has claimed that at a minimum he will renegotiate the agreement, which would be a disaster if true. However, a clause in the agreement forces signatory nations to wait at least four years before withdrawing, and a renegotiation simply will not happen. Trump’s threats may simply be bluster, since he’s running as the candidate who will make good deals for America, and the Paris climate accords are a “deal” (as Joe Romm put it, “a ridiculously good deal for the United States”) that he can exploit for political gain. Or perhaps Donald Trump believes everything that comes out of his mouth. Social psychologist David Dunning posits that Trump and his supporters may suffer from the Dunning-Kruger effect: To sum it up, the knowledge and intelligence that are required to be good at a task are often the same qualities needed to recognize that one is not good at that task—and if one lacks such knowledge and intelligence, one remains ignorant that one is not good at that task. Indeed, when it comes to climate change, social science research has shown that American conservatives who express the highest confidence in their opinions about climate science and risks are the most wrong. They’re confident in their denial precisely because they don’t know enough to realize how uninformed they are about climate science. This is the Dunning-Kruger effect. As Dunning wrote for Politico: This syndrome may well be the key to the Trump voter—and perhaps even to the man himself. Trump has served up numerous illustrative examples of the effect as he continues his confident audition to be leader of the free world even as he seems to lack crucial information about the job ... some voters, especially those facing significant distress in their life, might like some of what they hear from Trump, but they do not know enough to hold him accountable for the serious gaffes he makes. They fail to recognize those gaffes as missteps. Americans’ relative lack of knowledge about global warming appears to be helping Trump make misinformed, conspiratorial comments about climate change without repercussions in the polls. Trump is now the de facto leader of one of America’s two dominant political parties. The other is Hillary Clinton, who understands the threats posed by human-caused global warming and has a detailed plan to address them. She hired John Podesta, a strong advocate for climate action, as her campaign chairman. 350.org co-founder Bill McKibben will also help write the Democratic Party’s platform. In November, Americans will face a stark contrast between their choices for the nation’s next president. One option is Donald Trump, who at best is confident in his complete ignorance about climate change, and at worst is selling out the welfare of future generations for personal gain while protecting his own assets. The other option is Hillary Clinton, who for whatever her flaws, acknowledges the reality and threats posed by climate change and has a plan to tackle them. One of these candidates will soon lead one of the world’s most powerful and largest-polluting countries, just as we’re running out of time to avoid the worst consequences of climate change. This is a choice Americans have to get right."
"One of the US’s largest unions voted to use political pressure to fight climate change on Tuesday, citing events such as Hurricane Sandy, the California drought and the water situation in Flint, Michigan, as examples of how the phenomenon disproportionately affects its members.   Members of the two-million-strong Service Employees International Union (SEIU) voted to add environmental justice to the list of the union’s priorities and to use its powerful voice at the state and federal level to put climate change on the political agenda in 2016. The SEIU previously succeeded in making the fight for a $15 minimum wage a national issue and was able to get it on the legislative agenda in a handful of US states and cities. Its campaign led to major victories for the minimum wage movement in states including California and New York. The union now hopes to do the same for climate change – a subject that has been largely absent so far from the 2016 presidential campaign. The proposal could prove controversial with some in the labor movement, considering that more than 100,000 energy-related jobs have been lost in the last year and a half. According to the SEIU, climate change disproportionately affects low-income and minority communities, where many of its members live. As such, the union is committing its resources to “broadening environmental justice”. The SEIU international president, Mary Kay Henry, said: “SEIU members live and work in some of the most polluted zip codes in America and are part of communities that are most impacted by climate change. We know first-hand that our fights for economic, racial and immigrant justice are inextricably linked to the fight for environmental justice. “Our members adopted a platform today to take on the fight for environmental justice and to stand in solidarity with the rest of the labor movement to demand clean air and water, healthy and safe communities and a just transition for all workers affected by a transition to a clean energy economy.”  Barbara Carr, 34, who works as a home healthcare worker in Flint, Michigan, said she voted in favor of the SEIU environmental commitment because of what she has “been through with my city and our water system”. “We should never have to worry about having clean water,” said the mother of three. Carr has lived in Flint all her life and has been working in healthcare since 2001. It is her hope that the SEIU will help expand water education outreach and help ensure that what has happened in Flint will not happen in other US cities. Martha Valladares, 67, also hopes that her community will become better informed about air and water pollution and the need to fight climate change. One of her daughters was diagnosed with asthma at three years old and even now, while working as a nurse, she has asthma and has to “carry her own breathing machine”. Valladares says air pollution is to blame for her daughter’s condition.   The SEIU’s commitment to environmental justice drew praise from the environmental movement as well as the White House. “We applaud SEIU’s commitment to cleaner air and water for our communities, their resolve to tackle the impacts of climate change especially amongst the most vulnerable, and their work to see that workers benefit from our transition to a clean energy economy,” said Brian Deese, senior adviser to the president.  Michael Leon Guererro, national coordinator at the Climate Justice Alliance, described the SEIU as “a critical partner in building a diverse and powerful climate movement”. The Sierra Club, America’s largest environmental group, welcomed the push, praising the SEIU as a “cutting edge, progressive union that is showing the way for the union movement”. Dean Hubbard, director of the labor and economic program at the Sierra Club, said there was a “crying need for visionary leadership” in unions to embrace a clean energy economy. The SEIU vote took place about a week after the union and environmental wings of the Democratic party’s base reportedly clashed over the input of wealthy environmentalist Tom Steyer. Earlier this month, it was reported that the AFL-CIO, the largest federation of labor unions in the US, was joining forces with three other public employee unions to form a Super Pac to campaign against Donald Trump in battleground states. The SEIU considered joining the Super Pac, but opted out, according to Politico. Steyer’s participation in this effort to elect Democrats raised concerns that jobs related to fossil fuel projects would be sacrificed in favor of fighting climate change. “We are not climate science deniers and have merely sought to ensure that the employment prospects of our members are not negatively impacted in any economic and energy transition,” presidents of seven building trade unions said in a letter to the AFL-CIO’s president, Richard Trumka. The unions, which represent workers such as engineers, roofers, plumbers and plasterers, said they would not participate in the Super Pac and requested that the AFL-CIO terminate ties with Steyer.   On Monday, dressed in the union’s signature purple color, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton took the stage at the SEIU convention and praised the members for leading on a number of issues, including environmental justice.  “I am proud that SEIU members across the country are standing up for criminal justice reform and calling for environmental and economic justice for every community. I will be by your side every step of the way,” she promised.    "
"For years Greg Hunt has been suggesting different things to different people about his climate policy. This week he was almost caught out. Most people who understand how it works – environmentalists, business leaders, analysts – know the Coalition’s Direct Action policy cannot meet Australia’s promised long-term greenhouse gas reductions exactly as it stands. For years Hunt has reassured them – don’t worry, the framework is there.  The so-called safeguards mechanism within the policy (which sets emissions “baselines”, or limits, for big polluters) can be tightened so it becomes a type of emissions trading scheme. The baselines can be gradually reduced and then companies that can’t meet them forced to buy pollution permits. But Hunt is keeping quiet about that, playing a long game, waiting for the cabinet, and his party, to catch up with the scientific and economic realities of climate change, biding his time until a scheduled “review” next year.  To his party the minister has been reassuring in a different way, keeping up the attack on Labor’s “carbon tax”, insisting that any kind of emissions trading is dead and buried forever. The fact that there is a potential trading scheme embedded inside his own legislation has been glaringly obvious for years. I wrote about it in 2014, and, after Malcolm Turnbull became prime minister last year, a couple of times. I wrote about it again in May after Hunt released modelling saying his existing policy could meet his long-term targets, even though the author of the modelling told me it would almost certainly require either large funding top-ups to the emissions reduction fund (estimated by others to be at least $6bn) or – you guessed it – a strengthening of the safeguards mechanism so it turns into a baseline emissions trading scheme, and again after last week’s National Press Club debate after I (unsuccessfully) sought an answer from Hunt on whether the safeguards policy needed to be strengthened to achieve the government’s 2030 target. In fact, in Paris last December the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, spoke openly about the “role a carbon market might play [in Australia] after 2020”, and Lewis Tyndall, co-founder of GreenCollar – a firm that has been a big winner from Hunt’s Direct Action auctions, told an event: “Greg Hunt has described the safeguards mechanism as a baseline and credit system.” And then last Monday, the Australian editor-at-large Alan Kohler wrote a column on the same subject, pointing out that the safeguards mechanism could quite quickly become a type of ETS and asserting that: “What hasn’t been announced or included in the Coalition’s legislation yet is that the caps will start to be reduced from next year.” Without making any assumptions or assertions about another journalist’s sources, some of the column sounded familiar to those close to the minister and his advisers, and it certainly claimed to contain “inside” information. Kohler pointed out that a type of emissions trading scheme had “been part of the Coalition’s climate policy since well before Greg Hunt went from shadow minister to minister for the environment in 2013. He made it a condition of his appointment by Tony Abbott that the science of climate change would be accepted and the emissions reduction target would not change.” And he went further, asserting that “when Malcolm Turnbull became leader and prime minister last year, amazingly, he did not fully understand his party’s climate policy, and in particular the inclusion of a cap and trade ETS, because Hunt had never discussed it in cabinet. Apparently, he was pleasantly surprised, but decided to maintain radio silence, as part of his broader efforts to keep the conservatives onside.” Unsurprisingly, the “conservatives” in both the Liberal and National parties were extremely displeased by these claims, or the fact that the allegedly “secret” ETS embedded in their policy started getting wider airplay – in a question on the ABC’s Q&A, for example, and in stories in the Australian Financial Review.  Hunt wrote a carefully parsed letter to the Australian and distributed a chart rebutting some of the claims made. It was a case study in obfuscation. He insisted the safeguards mechanism “is not a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme” (at the moment – with the baselines set at “historic highs” and with companies able to ask for them to be set even higher if needs be, this is true, because it will be almost impossible for any company to exceed its baseline or be forced to buy pollution permits, which of course also means the policy achieves almost nothing). Hunt said the fact that the government has “budgeted to raise not a single dollar of revenue” proved it was not planning a carbon tax. And that is also true, but it does not prove the government is not planning a baseline and credit scheme, because under such a scheme businesses buy credits from other businesses or companies that create credits under the emissions reduction fund. The “trade” does not involve the government. And he said that it was “incorrect” to say each firm’s baselines would decline from 2017, when he is planning to review the policy. Which is also true. That’s the whole point of this conversation.  For his policy to work, Hunt, as minister, has to decide to reduce them, and turn his policy into the trading scheme everyone has always believed he intended. If he doesn’t do this as part of a range of measures, no modelling or analysis has found he can meet his long-term targets. So is he planning an ETS, or isn’t he? Will his policy work, or won’t it? Some observers who have been going along with Hunt’s two-tracked messaging for years seem to be losing patience. “This has declined into a squabble over semantics,” said John Connor, chief executive of the Climate Institute. “The safeguard mechanism framework starting on 1 July clearly says companies that exceed their baselines can buy offsets from another company. That is a trade in emissions.” Connor said what mattered was not ruling out scaleable policies to meet either the government’s “inadequate” 2030 target, or the tougher 2030 targets Australia needed. “As we have said many times before, that definitely requires much tighter baselines – a much stronger safeguards mechanism, or, alternatively, at least another $6bn to buy the emissions reductions through the emissions reduction fund.” Many other experts make a similar point.  Tony Wood, energy program director at the Grattan Institute, has studied Hunt’s rebuttals closely. “He has the machinery in place. He’s just not pre-empting what a re-elected Coalition government would do with it. He has very carefully not ruled out reducing the baselines, and in my view it would be very difficult for the Coalition to meet its target if he does not end up doing that,” Wood says.  This week the debate finally focused on the great unanswered question of the Coalition’s policy. The question that determines whether or not it can deliver even Australia’s modest commitments to reducing greenhouse gases and combating global warming. But despite all the attention, and all his carefully worded responses, Hunt has still not answered and nor has Turnbull.  Hunt has given the conservatives in his party the impression that he ruled out reducing the baselines and setting up his own ETS, and there are many in both the Liberal and National parties who insist any type of ETS will happen over their political corpses. But Hunt is pointing out to others that his carefully chosen words actually left the question open. The Coalition is deferring until after the election its internal reckoning between entrenched climate change sceptics and those pushing for something like a workable climate policy, the final answer as to whether Turnbull will indeed continue to lead a party not committed to acting on climate change. But in an election campaign during which the Cape Grim air quality monitoring station registered a count of 400 parts per million CO2 in the atmosphere and 93% of the Great Barrier Reef is experiencing coral bleaching, the electorate has a right to know now. • Join Lenore Taylor and Katharine Murphy in Sydney and Melbourne as they host our Guardian Live election special event featuring a panel of prominent political guests"

"New evidence that poorer countries will suffer the worst effects of climate change has shown that the number of hot days in tropical developing countries is likely to increase markedly as global warming takes hold. It has long been expected that poor people would bear the brunt of climate change, largely because so many more of the world’s poorest live in tropical latitudes whereas, wealthier people tend to live in more temperate regions.  This is inverse to the generally accepted responsibility for climate change, which falls mainly on rich countries that benefited early on from industry, and thus have historically high emissions, compared with poorer countries that have only begun catching up in the past few decades. It was only in 2014 that China’s per capita emissions caught up with those of people in the EU, even after years of above-average economic growth in China. Those living in the poorest countries also have the most to lose, as so many depend on agriculture, which is likely to be badly affected by temperature rises and an increase in droughts, heatwaves and potential changes to rainfall that may lead to recurrent patterns of floods, droughts and higher intensity storms. The study, led by the University of East Anglia, is the first to examine the link between cumulative carbon dioxide emissions and more frequent hot days. Manoj Joshi of the UEA School of Environmental Sciences said: “Many of the poorest people in the world live in tropical latitudes, while many of the world’s wealthiest people live in mid-latitude climates. We know that low-latitude regions have much less variability in day-to-day temperatures when compared with the mid-latitudes, which means the signal of climate change emerges quite quickly, and because of this the frequency of extreme hot days increases rapidly too.” The findings also call into question the commitments made at the landmark Paris conference on climate change last December, at which nations agreed to limit global temperature rises to no more than 2C, a threshold which scientists regard as the limit of safety, beyond which the ravages of climate change are likely to become catastrophic and irreversible. However a 2C rise on average globally could still leave tens or hundreds of millions of people vulnerable to dramatic rises in their regional temperatures, which could make their current way of living impossible to maintain. Governments are meeting this week in Bonn, the first meeting since the Paris agreement was signed. "
"East of Lake Tahoe, an organic farmer and his son are putting the finishing touches on what is perhaps a counterintuitive approach to water conservation in a dry climate: a 32,000-sq ft greenhouse that will grow tomatoes, peppers and fish in the heart of the Nevada desert. Mark O’Farrell, the owner of Hungry Mother Organics in Minden, Nevada, plans to have his desert fish farm operational by August, when he’ll begin to produce an estimated 36,000 to 50,000 tilapia per year. O’Farrell is one of a growing group of aquaculturists in the American Southwest turning a harsh, dry climate to their advantage by growing fresh food in areas where it has traditionally been difficult to farm. Although fish require copious amounts of water, the same water can be used multiple times to irrigate crops and in some cases, even improve soil quality with the addition of nitrogen and potassium from fish waste. In O’Farrell’s case, he’s combining aquaculture with hydroponics in an operation that allows him to grow plants directly above his fish tanks. After tinkering with a series of fish tanks and worm digesters to extract the fish waste solids and make them available to fertilize his young plants, O’Farrell realized his setup was saving him $12,000 a year and cutting his water use by 80%. Kevin Fitzsimmons, a professor at the University of Arizona, has been leading a similar push across Arizona to draw conventional farmers into aquaculture, either to raise fish on their own or to partner with fish farmers and share water. The number of farms producing fish in Arizona nearly doubled between 2005 and 2013, according to the 2013 Census of Aquaculture. “My hope is that people recognize that integrating aquaculture and agriculture would really encourage everybody to use water twice and be super efficient with it,” says Fitzsimmons. Desert Springs Tilapia, a Dateland, Arizona-based operation managed by one of Fitzsimmons’s former students, uses water once for raising tilapia and again to grow alfalfa, Bermuda grass, hay, barley, oats and olive trees. “A drier climate is going to make irrigated farming that much more difficult,” Fitzsimmons said. For O’Farrell, the move to fish farming came after years of trying other approaches. “I’ve tried everything you can to grow crops [in Nevada] and you can’t do it profitably,” he says. It would seem that finding more efficient uses of water in the Southwest could not come at a better time. The number of dry, hot days in the region is believed to be increasing in frequency. A recent study in Geophysical Research Letters found the Southwest, including parts of California, has entered a “drier climate state”, and is not just experiencing isolated, temporary periods of drought. Fitzsimmons says the silver lining is a forced shift towards practices such as aquaculture that address two significant regional and national problems at the same time: limited water and an intense domestic dependence on imported fish. Although data collection on US fish production is often sparse and out of date, Monterey Bay Aquarium’s Seafood Watch estimated in 2012 that 95% of tilapia consumed in the US is imported. The National Marine Fisheries Service says the US is the largest global importer of fish, half of which is raised through aquaculture practices in other countries. In 2015 alone, the US imported approximately 500m lbs of tilapia from China, Indonesia, and Central and South America, according to data from the United States Department of Agriculture.  Until recently, growing tilapia in the Southwest has largely been a business for Arizona, southern California and parts of Texas. In fact, the New Mexico Department of Fish and Game only began issuing permits for would-be aquaculturists in October of last year. Most aquaculturists do not raise other livestock. Fitzsimmons initially tried to encourage traditional ranchers to set up fish farms, but has found it easier to get people interested in aquaculture to team up with and lease land from traditional farmers and share water pumping costs. “We kind of hoped that we could get farmers who had cows, horses, goats, sheep, whatever, to think of fish as another livestock. It’s more complicated than keeping horses or cows,” Fitzsimmons says. One thriving aquaculture operation is Sterling Caviar, which has been growing sturgeon and selling caviar since 1993 around Sacramento, California. The company maintains 30 to 40 employees and produces 10-12 tons of caviar and 300 tons of meat each year, according to managing director Shaoching Bishop. The company’s deputy general manager, Bobby Renschler, is also a fish biologist, who says the company’s four farm sites recirculate their water as many as six times. Sterling’s largest farm is in Elverta. It discharges 3.7m gallons of water each day, flowing first to artificial wetlands at the Natomas Basin Conservancy, and then into an irrigation canal, where the water flows mostly to local rice farmers. In the case of Sterling, the water released has been filtered of all fish waste and the company simply disposes of it. Sterling’s other sites release water to cattle farms, wetlands and other agricultural land. Israeli company Microdel, which recently built its AquaTech Fisheries in Israel’s Negev Desert, is currently in negotiations to secure $65m for a similar project in Nevada. It hopes to begin construction in the first quarter of 2017, according to Microdel CEO Gabi Wolkinson. Randy Lovell, state aquaculture coordinator at the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, says he would like aquaculture in the US to go one step further – to the coast. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), marine aquaculture around the US is currently limited to around 11 types of seafood including oysters, clams, salmon and cod. NOAA is currently offering grants and other funding programs to encourage the expansion of marine aquaculture. “I would submit that there’s a whole other realm of food production that we have not fully supported in the US that has tremendous potential,” Lovell says."
"Buildings currently being constructed at an increasing rate in developing countries are locking the world into high greenhouse gas emissions for decades to come, the world’s leading authority on energy has warned.  Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, told the Guardian that the world’s number one priority in tackling climate change must be to ensure those buildings meet higher standards of efficiency and safety.  “This would be the single most important step I want governments to take, and they can take it tomorrow,” he said. Politicians could enact higher standards in regulations immediately, though ensuring they are always enforced might take a little longer and involve cooperation between different authorities. “There are many economic benefits to mandating standards, and this can be done by governments very easily,” said Birol. “They would have positive effects on growth, improve the conditions of the population [including their safety] and to do it they just need to make different government departments work together.” In the developing world, and even some richer countries, building standards are often lax and frequently ignored. This has led to tragedies such as the collapse of the Rana Plaza factories in Bangladesh in 2013, which killed more than 1,100 people and injured thousands more. Just weeks ago, more than 50 people died as an illegal apartment building in Nairobi fell down. If higher standards were enforced, not only would people benefit from greater reassurances against such needless disasters, but the buildings would use less energy and this giant source of carbon emissions would be vastly reduced, according to the IEA. Better windows, more efficient air conditioning systems, thicker walls and higher quality of materials and design would all result in efficiency savings, and make life healthier and more pleasant for the buildings’ occupants. Birol also highlighted the need to reduce emissions from transport around the world, calling for far greater investments in electric vehicles and public transport, particularly in developing countries. “Although there has been progress in electric cars, we are not there yet,” he said. About a million electric vehicles are now in use, showing strong growth in the past few years, but still not enough to make a real dent in transport emissions. “This is still lagging behind the Paris targets.” In Paris last December, world governments forged a historic agreement to hold global warming to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, by mid-century. This will require steep emissions cuts, which were not specified in the accord, but most governments have put in place national targets running to 2025 or 2030 that will require most of the reductions experts say are needed to meet the Paris target. Birol called on governments to provide greater incentives for key emissions-reducing technologies, such as electric vehicles, greater energy efficiency, and renewable power. He added that technology for carbon capture and storage (CCS) was running well behind where it needed to be in terms of implementation, if the Paris targets are to be met. The technology, though technically proven and discussed for over a decade as a potential way to reduce emissions on the scale needed to avoid dangerous levels of climate change, is still in its infancy in terms of commercial implementation. Last year, the UK government controversially pulled the plug on two of the world’s most promising CCS schemes. The Treasury said the £1bn price tag for a competition to prove the technology was too high, and there are now no current plans to practise CCS in the UK, a move that scientists have said risks leaving the UK running behind in the green technology economy. The IEA report on the technologies needed to implement the Paris accord, entitled Energy Technology Perspectives: Towards Sustainable Urban Energy Systems, is published on the organisation’s website on Wednesday.

"ExxonMobil moved to squash a well-established congressional lecture series on climate science just nine days after the presidential inauguration of George W Bush, a former oil executive, the Guardian has learned. Exxon’s intervention on the briefings, revealed here for the first time, adds to evidence the oil company was acutely aware of the state of climate science and its implications for government policy and the energy industry – despite Exxon’s public protestations for decades about the uncertainties of global warming science.  Indeed, the company moved swiftly during the earliest days of the Bush administration to block public debate on global warming and delay domestic and international regulations to cut greenhouse gas emissions, according to former officials of the US Global Change Research Program, or USGCRP.  The Bush White House is now notorious for censoring climate scientists and blocking international action on climate change by pulling the US out of the Kyoto agreement. The oil company is under investigation by 17 attorney generals for misleading the public about climate change, and is facing a shareholder revolt at its annual general meeting on Wednesday by investors pressing Exxon for greater disclosure about the effect of climate change on its profits. In early 2001, however, after Al Gore lost the White House to George Bush, Exxon officials apparently saw a chance to influence the incoming administration, according to former officials of the research program. The government agency was set up in 1990 and charged with producing definitive reports to Congress every four years on the effects of climate change on the US. In the mid-1990s, as part of its legal mandate, USGCRP began organizing monthly seminars on climate science for elected officials and staffers in Congress. On 29 January 2001, nine days after Bush’s inauguration, Arthur Randol, a former senior environmental advisor at Exxon, telephoned Nicky Sundt, then communications director for the research program, to inquire about the future of the lecture series. A few days earlier, Sundt had emailed a survey to congressional staffers seeking suggestions for the next lecture series. Exxon had not been on his distribution list, and Sundt said he was surprised to receive a call from Randol. “I thought it was very unusual, if not inappropriate, for a fossil fuel lobbyist to be calling me directly days after the administration was sworn in only directly to instruct me on how we would be communicating to the Congress on climate change,” Sundt told the Guardian. “This is ExxonMobil reaching into the federal government science apparatus and seeking to influence the communication of science.” Sundt, who now directs the WWF-US climate science programme (although he said he was not speaking on behalf of the organisation), said he made notes of the phone call. The briefings had then been running for a number of years and were well regarded by Republican as well as Democratic staffers, according to Bryan Hannegan, a Senate staffer and scientist who went on to work for the Bush administration and is now at the National Renewable Energy Lab. But the Exxon lobbyist saw it differently. “I very specifically remember him suggesting that the seminars were what he called ‘agenda-driven’, and he indicated that with the new administration and the Congress that – if the seminars continue – he hoped to see a different balance of viewpoints,” Sundt said. That was Sundt’s only encounter with Randol. He told his USGCRP colleagues about the telephone call but did not speak out publicly until now.  In retrospect, Sundt said the telephone call was the first sign of the energy industry’s efforts to squash the agency’s reporting about climate change, and the broader debate about global warming, during the George W Bush era.  Bush went on to pull the US out of the Kyoto climate change agreement, and White House officials were later found to have played down scientists’ warnings about the dangers of climate change.  Randol, who left Exxon in 2003 after 25 years with the oil company, was known to have played a key role in such efforts – even before Sundt came foward. On 6 February 2001, not long after his phone call to Sundt, Randol wrote a memo urging the Bush administration to demand the removal of Bob Watson, a well-regarded climate scientist, as head of the UN’s climate science panel, the intergovernmental panel on climate change.  Randol describes Watson as “hand-picked by Al Gore”. “Restructure the US attendance at upcoming IPCC meetings to assure that none of the Clinton/Gore proponents are involved in any decisional activities,” the memo reads. In the same memo, Randol also recommended sacking three US climate officials.  The Exxon lobbyist was extraordinarily successful. At the IPCC, Watson was replaced by Rajendra Pachauri, an Indian engineer who stepped down from the science panel last year after being accused of sexual harassment.  Following Randol’s recommendations,  a number of climate sceptics were appointed to the administration, including Harlan Watson, a then Republican congressional staffer, who went on to lead the US climate negotiating team.  Meanwhile, Randol sought to put Exxon’s stamp on the blockbuster US climate reports. On 22 March 2002, Randol forwarded a company memo to the White House council of environmental quality suggesting an overhaul of the USGRCP’s national climate assessments.  The memo, which extolled Exxon’s qualifications in climate science, recommended the agency focus more on “gaps and uncertainties” in climate science. Exxon and Randol did not respond to requests for comment.  However, Mike MacCracken, a former chief scientist at the USGRCP, said Sundt’s account of the phone call fits in with his recollections of Exxon’s efforts to influence government climate science research. “I don’t recall the call directly but they were objecting to all sorts of things as the new administration came in,” he said. “I guess the Republicans were sort of pushing from Congress. They were taking over and they had their views.”"
"Canada’s former prime minister, Stephen Harper, has made his first public remarks since his defeat in last fall’s federal election, prompting both praise and disdain as Canadians weighed in on the polarising legacy of nearly a decade in power. Speaking at a Conservative policy convention on Thursday, Harper thanked the party faithful. “While the election last fall did not yield the results we hoped for, the fact remains that our party has achieved remarkable success over the past decade,” he told delegates.  The federal election in October saw the Conservatives plunge from 159 to 99 seats, handing a stunning majority to Justin Trudeau’s Liberals and propelling them from third-party status to government. Harper announced his resignation as party leader in a press release soon after. On Thursday, Harper described what he called a “proud record” of cutting taxes, ushering in a tough-on-crime agenda and retooling party funding. “And it was thanks to you that we were able to stand up as a country and take principled positions in a dangerous world,” he told delegates.  He urged the party to move forward, highlighting its unity as members prepare to elect a new leader next year. “The past is no place to linger,” Harper said. “The best is yet to come.”  His remarks were met with a standing ovation from the more than 2,000 people who had gathered in Vancouver for the Conservative convention. Delegates feted Harper’s leadership with a video tribute, encouraging supporters to join in with the hashtag #ThankYouStephenHarper. Some used it to genuinely express their gratitude. But the strategy soon went off the rails, as many others chimed in from across Canada with their own views of Harper’s legacy. “#ThankYouStephenHarper for muzzling scientists, shuttering projects, suppressing data, and making us a laughing stock in the sci community,” tweeted one. “For denying an inquiry for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women in spite of glaring statistics,” wrote another.  The hashtag trended for hours as Canadians considered the lasting effects of their former government. “#Thankyoustephenharper for holding Canada back 10 years on climate change,” tweeted one.  Another said:  Others pointed to what they saw as the enduring outcome of Harper’s time in office.  “#ThankYouStephenHarper for inspiring me for the first time in my life to volunteer for a political campaign, P.S. it wasn’t yours,” added another.  Some wondered if the Conservatives had fully grasped the message underlying the Liberals’ resounding victory in the federal election. “Laughing so hard that the Conservative Party of Canada LEGITIMATELY thought #ThankYouStephenHarper was a good idea. Are you kidding me?” Discussion of Harper’s legacy comes amid reports that the former prime minister intends to resign as a member of parliament by autumn. Sources say Harper is contemplating several offers from US companies as well corporate boards. The former prime minister is also reportedly considering launching a foreign policy institute dedicated to the issues he championed during his time in office, such as advocacy for Israel and Ukraine. In December, the former prime minister registered a corporation, listing himself and two former staffers as directors of Harper & Associates Consulting Inc."
"In 1972 the law was passed that allowed the UK to join what was then called the European Economic Community (EEC). Despite Europe’s current crises, it’s unchanging, fundamental challenge was expressed that year by Sicco Mansholt, then president of the European commission, probably better than by any of the current voices in the referendum campaign, whether for or against UK remaining in.  “Will the EEC become a powerful agent for improving living standards and opportunity in solidarity with less fortunate countries?” asked Mansholt, “Or will it remain a select inward-looking club of some of the world’s richest nations? Will it continue to produce ‘bigger, faster and more’ for ‘some’ to the detriment of the global environment and the welfare of the ‘rest’?” Leap forward 20 years to the Rio Earth summit where Europe lobbied hard, and Germany and France floated the idea of a World Environment Organisation to counterbalance the World Trade Organisation, and commission president, Jacques Delors, said Europe would lose credibility if: “These agreements signed in Rio remain a dead letter and do not give birth to ambitious policies that respond to the scale of the challenge that faces us.” In the near half century since Mansholt framed Europe’s challenge, rather than working to resolve such tensions, however, two contradictory dynamics have taken hold.  Named after the cities where they were set, they became known as the Lisbon and Gothenburg agendas. The Lisbon agenda, following a summit in 2000, focused on Europe’s growth and competitiveness, meant to deliver jobs and social cohesion. Gothenburg came a year later when it was clear that the explicit environmental objectives written into the Maastricht treaty underpinning Europe were marginalised by Lisbon’s expansive economic focus, and likely to suffer. Gothenburg’s strategy pushed environmental priorities again and called on the economic, social, and environmental effects of all policies to be jointly assessed and coordinated. Since then, Lisbon’s objectives were undermined by the sheer economic inflexibility of having a single interest rate across an already very unequal European single currency zone. Yet these still take priority, for example in negotiations for the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the United States, over Europe’s more progressive environmental ambitions, threatening to leave them as Delors’ ‘dead letters.’  Such lifeless letters are incapable of matching the speed and scale of the Paris climate accord that wishes to halt overall warming by at least 2C, and move to the lower figure of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Arguments in favour of old-style economic expansion dominate the campaign to remain in Europe, sidelining and selling short the progressive case to build the architecture of international cooperation to address the crises of climate change, inequality and the unaccountable powers of finance. There remains considerable denial about the tension between a neo-liberal growth agenda, and the kind of economy that can effectively support a social and environmental Europe. Just as there remains some tenacious and occasionally flippant denial about climate change itself. When the free London newspaper Metro reported potentially record high temperatures for a day in May, instead of registering even feint concern about what it might indicate as part of a long-term trend, it encouraged readers to celebrate the good news by treating yourself “to a long lunch break.” In fact, new figures from Nasa were about to show that, globally, the preceding month, April, was the seventh month in a row to break temperature records, and the third month in a row in which the records had been broken by margins that were themselves records as well. In the midst of this, reflect on whether, imperfect and contradictory as Europe’s machinery is, it would be easier or harder to coordinate climate action without common institutions and the negotiation of joint, principled action? The history of the often recalcitrant roles played by the United States, Canada and Australia, let alone other major petro-states, suggests not. With some irony, the campaign for the UK to remain in the EU has ignored more obvious popular appeals, such as to Britain’s annual and permanent ‘solar migrants’ enjoying either holidays, retirement or long-term relocation to warmer parts of Europe – taking with them, unquestioningly, health insurance and a wide range of benefits guaranteed by EU membership. It’s often not just about the weather either, but cashing in the difference in value between typical UK house values, pensions and savings for a higher standard of living in lower income European states – a sort of reverse economic migration – again, unquestioned, and another irony. The urgently-needed rapid transition from ‘bigger, faster, more’ for a few, to an economy of ‘better, not bigger’ for the many, and on a timescale to avoid irreversible climatic upheaval, will take us all into largely unchartered territory. In this new place for civilisation, the ability to cooperate and coordinate will mean the difference between looking forward with hope to the future, or being trapped in an endless battle against the impact and consequences of irreversible climate change. Our societies also have an extensive, historical back catalogue of making rapid transitions happen, pushed at different times by everything from conflict to technological opportunity, politics, environmental change and economic collapse. But, we don’t need to feel that all we can do is react to changes happening out of our control.  A new, evolving initiative, involving a wide range of people and organisations is beginning to explore what can be learned from moments of rapid transition. From them, adapting lessons for today, we may identify the special circumstances and social, economic and political chemistry in which rapid, low carbon, economically successful and socially progressive transition becomes possible. The EU began as a positive experiment – even if one in conflict with itself – to both rebuild nations and prevent the catastrophe of future conflict. I’d like to think that we can still change it and put it to good use without playing out the old joke: Question: How many revolutionaries does it take to change a light bulb? Answer: You don’t change it, you smash it!"
"After officially sweltering through the warmest autumn on record, Australians can expect a return to normal chilly weather this winter. The mean temperature between March and the end of May hit a fresh high of 23.86C, with records set in Queensland, NSW, Victoria and the Northern Territory.  Thermometers hovered 1.86C above average, the biggest climb above an average seasonal temperature since spring 2014. Some of the hottest temperatures were recorded during the prolonged heatwave in March, with Mardie in Western Australia’s north hitting 47C, the Bureau of Meteorology said. Karl Braganza, the bureau’s manager of climate monitoring, said a strong El Niño combined with global warming to push thermometers to their highest levels for autumn since records began in 1910. “Everywhere except the southwestern corner of the continent was exceptionally warm,” he told AAP on Wednesday. “What we saw was a prolonged summer period in March and that continued into the start of May.” March notched up its hottest days on record, with daytime temperatures in April hitting new highs before May ended the season with temperature gauges sitting above average. Sea surface temperatures were also above average for much of autumn, with water temperatures in the Coral Sea (including the Great Barrier Reef) and the Tasman Sea the highest on record for extended periods since late summer 2016. This was typical of the El Niño pattern which also brings dry conditions across the continent.  But scientists believe El Nino was now over in the Pacific region and the bureau forecast a normal winter. “The odds are for average to below average temperatures in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Canberra,” Braganza said, adding that there were moderate odds for good rain in inland NSW, most of Queensland, Victoria and South Australia this winter. Autumn rainfall averages were closer to normal, but varied significantly across the country. It was also the wettest May since 1983 in some areas, with four times the average rainfall recorded in the Northern Territory, Cape York, Pilbara, Kimberley and central South Australia. South Australia, Tasmania and Western Australia enjoyed above-average rain while NSW, Queensland, Victoria and the Northern Territory were drier than normal. Looking towards spring and summer, cooler and wetter conditions are tipped for the tail end of 2016 as a La Nina weather system develops."

"If Malcolm Turnbull wins the election, Nick Xenophon could help him introduce emissions trading, stop some of his company tax cuts, frustrate his attempts to cut Gonski schools funding and stall some of his sweeping changes to superannuation. If Bill Shorten wins, Xenophon could force big changes to Labor’s centrepiece policy on negative gearing. And those nation-shaping or agenda-cruelling possibilities are what Guardian Australia has learned from just a few snatched conversations with the hyper-busy senator.  At this year’s election, the amiable lawyer who began his political career as an anti-pokies crusader and now leads an eponymous party is likely to become the head of a significant new political force. And, unlike the Palmer United party, which shot to prominence after the last election, possibly one with a chance at surviving the pressures of office.  So it seems fitting to ask: what would he do with his power?  In 17 years in state and federal politics Xenophon has exhibited an extraordinary talent for attracting publicity (think wearing pyjamas to the all-night Senate sitting, buying the parliament a 750-piece set of Australian-made crockery – he once even made a calendar, each month celebrating one of his previous years’ media stunts).  Right at the start of the campaign he got on to the national news services by claiming the South Australian minister Christopher Pyne was cheating with the “premature erection” of signage). But despite constant media attention, Xenophon’s views on critical issues can still be elusive.  He likes to stick to his core campaigns – anti “predatory” gambling, pro political accountability in the form of a national corruption watchdog and whistleblower laws, backing policies to help maintain manufacturing jobs, buying Australian. Stray far from these and his answers can veer into generalised talk about “fair and commonsense solutions”. He is masterful at deflecting questions with self-deprecating humour, at skipping from one chosen issue to another. But now his new party, the Nick Xenophon Team or NXT, is running for the Senate in every state and in 18 lower house seats. It appears certain to win three Senate seats in South Australia, possibly four, and could conceivably win the last seat in one of a number of other states. That means under most scenarios it appears set to play a crucial role in the Senate after the July election, potentially holding crucial votes on all government legislation. The Senate maths works like this: if Turnbull is returned he could be reliant on either the Greens or the three or more senators from NXT to pass legislation. Alternatively, he could require either the Greens or the NXT plus a few other assorted minor-party senators likely to be re-elected, perhaps Jacqui Lambie or Glenn Lazarus or even Pauline Hanson. That second scenario is almost certainly what a Labor government would face.  Any way, the South Australian lawyer and his party will be in a powerful balance of power position. NXT has, on its website, detailed “policy positions”. But given the power he and his “team” are about to wield, it seems time to pin some of these down.  That requires pinning Xenophon down, which is always quite a challenge. He’s endlessly available for a quick comment, a media “grab”, a television interview on the issue of the moment, a quick chat and a joke in the corridor, but a relentless schedule of parliament, NXT commitments, parliamentary committees and constituent work means he’s also always in a rush, late for the next date, dealing with the issue of the moment. He even talks quickly. It’s hard to find time for a longer conversation.  Finally we sit down in his Canberra office just before parliament rises while he makes himself a very late lunch (brie on crumpets) after a day in a Senate committee, and then follow-up on the phone. As the conversation progresses it becomes apparent Xenophon’s views on the various proposed solutions could cause headaches, whoever wins the election. On company tax cuts, Xenophon says he does not agree with Turnbull’s budget plan to extend them beyond companies with turnover higher than $10m. “Up to $10m is something that, instinctively, I think we ought to consider,” he says. “But I’ve seen no compelling economic case to go beyond that.” Since neither Labor nor the Greens support the idea of extending the cuts beyond $2m turnover, that will make big business nervous. On cuts to superannuation tax concessions at the top end, now likely to be advocated by both major parties, Xenophon is broadly on-side. “The super system should be about funding a comfortable retirement, not a tax haven.” But he says he’s reserving his position on the government’s plan to cap non-concessional contributions at $500,000. On Labor’s negative gearing proposal, Xenophon is opposed. “My father was a modest property developer, I think we need to look at this very cautiously ... you might be able to tweak the negative gearing system to encourage investment in affordable rental accommodation, but I think the Labor policy goes too far and risks causing some sharp shocks to the market. Anything you do needs to be gradual and cautious.” On the government’s proposed cuts to the final two years of the Gonski schools funding plan (the government offered $1.2bn in the budget), Xenophon says we should spend the money. “We might need to spend it better, but we should spend it … I haven’t seen evidence that we can achieve the outcomes Gonski wanted with so much less spending.” Given that the Gonski spending, at current levels, is enshrined in legislation, that could pose a problem for a government intent upon a reduction. “No, I would never support that [removing the funding from the legislation] although I am sure the government could take money away in other ways, I am sure they could get try to get around it.” On climate policy, Xenophon and Turnbull have history, and it may be about to repeat. In 2009, when Turnbull, as opposition leader, was trying to navigate a path between his own party’s climate scepticism and the Rudd government’s carbon pollution reduction scheme, the Coalition and Xenophon commissioned research from Xenophon’s friend and climate modeller Danny Price, from Frontier Economics, who recommended a so-called “emissions-intensity” scheme – a variant on Labor’s cap and trade scheme.  But in negotiations Turnbull and his acting climate spokesman, Ian Macfarlane, were persuaded against it by the then minister Penny Wong and then head of the climate change department, Martin Parkinson – now Turnbull’s department secretary.  But the potential to implement that kind of scheme is built in to the Coalition’s Direct Action policy through the so-called safeguards mechanism, and most in the business community believe it will have to be activated after the government’s review next year if Australia is to have any hope of meeting its internationally pledged targets. And Labor has now proposed a similar scheme for the electricity industry. Xenophon says he hasn’t changed his position. “The safeguards mechanism should be changed to force business to reduce their emissions and I expect there will be discussion about that post-election ... I think it is inevitable Australia will need an emissions trading scheme because that is clearly the most effective way, and economically efficient way, to reduce emissions and there are elements in the safeguards mechanism where you can morph that into an ETS. I support the position I took with Malcolm Turnbull in 2009 when we launched together the Frontier scheme.” And then there’s the question of how the NXT would exercise its powers, how it would take decisions, whether it would bind members to vote according to a party line and whether it would trade its votes on one issue for a shift in government policy on another. On that last issue, Xenophon points to his maiden speech in the Senate in 2008, when he said “I also do not believe in horse trading. Horse trading implies a willingness to vote for something you do not believe in in order to get something else you want. When people do try to horse trade they can end up with a donkey or, worse still, end up making an ass of themselves.” But that definition has still left him the wriggle room to strike some very big deals over the years, for example the bringing forward of $1bn in funding for the Murray Darling to secure his vote for the Rudd government’s $42bn second stimulus package in 2009. He insists there is no contradiction. “I saw that as entirely consistent with the second stimulus package, you couldn’t have a credible stimulus package unless you dealt with the drought and the impact of the drought on rural communities,” he says. Xenophon is also making the Coalition MPs in South Australia very nervous, where polling shows that as well as hooking three or four Senate seats, NXT is attracting more than 15% of the lower house vote in Pyne’s seat of Sturt, or the Liberal MP Matt Williams in his seat of Hindmarsh or the former minister Jamie Briggs in Mayo.  That’s unlikely to be enough to see them poll ahead of Labor and win the seat on Labor preferences (the psephologist Kevin Bonham has tried to unpick the available data on NXT in this post), although Xenophon supporters remain hopeful about Mayo. But it is certainly enough for their preferences to be crucial for the result. In the first week of the campaign Xenophon was forced to deny he would do preference deals. “There won’t be any deals. I just want to deal with this directly,” he said, after suggestions he had done a deal with Labor. The polling numbers are sufficiently arresting for the Coalition to be working hard to paint the NXT as another cobbled together fledgling party likely to fall apart or “go rogue” under the pressures of office, just like the PUP did. He says he is certain the party’s selection processes mean there will be a “consistency of purpose” between his possible fellow NXT senators or MPs and that the party will run a “consensus” decision-making process in office and a Coalition-style leniency if a senator feels unable to vote with the party once in a while.  “You’d be voting for some individuals who may or may not go and do what Nick Xenophon wants them to do,” Turnbull told the hometown newspaper, the Adelaide Advertiser. “He’s always been a loner and, as Clive Palmer found, you can get people elected into the Senate on your ticket, then they might decide to do their own thing.” Labor makes similar points. Briggs labelled Xenophon Australia’s version of Donald Trump, and leaked emails show Pyne begging a prominent South Australian radio announcer to convince Xenophon not to run a candidate against him. The Coalition is backing its attacks by highlighting the views of some of Xenophon’s candidates. Damien Carey, a Chinese medicine and ­acupuncture practitioner running for NXT in the South Australian seat of Kingston, was targeted as an anti-vaxxer (he says he accepts the need for vaccination but believes parents who refuse vaccinations for their children should not be attacked or vilified) and also for his belief that genital acupuncture can cure infertility. (Xenophon says scientific trials would be needed before his party could support the idea.) Rebekha Sharkie, his candidate in Mayo, was attacked for speaking to the anti-foreign-investment Farmers and Landowners Action Group, a fringe group that has links to Pauline Hanson, climate sceptic Lord Monckton and international far-right conspiracy theorists. (She says people should read her speech.) The thing that really gets under the major parties’ skin is Xenophon’s skill – after 17 years in state and federal parliament – of portraying himself as an “anti-politician”.  Xenophon does have a long track record of tenacious representation of the disenfranchised, the voiceless, the apparently lost causes. He flew to Jakarta twice, at his own expense, to plead for the lives of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. He entered politics fuelled by anger at the human disasters poker machines can cause. He’s more centrist than popular international anti-politicians, but his advocacy of South Australian manufacturing taps the same vein of discontent among voters who feel economic change has left them behind. But he’s also a smart operator adept at forming allegiances and getting attention for his message. The Labor senator Sam Dastyari has called him possibly the best retail politician in the nation, and Dastyari is himself an expert in the field. And expanding his retail operations has required some compromises on principles. The man who once said, “If you give someone $1,000, you support them. If you give them $100,000, you own them,” has accepted a $115,000 donation from Ian Melrose, proprietor of Optical Superstore. I ask him how the anti-politician thing can be true. He retreats behind a self-deprecating gag, “Am I allowed to say it’s because of self-loathing,” he jokes. I steer him back to the question, and his answer is hesitant, part serious (he has a different core purpose) and part on message (he doesn’t make use of his entitlement to business class flying). “I felt like an outsider when elected and I feel like an outsider now, I am always happy to walk past business class where most of my colleagues sit, one of the joys of flying economy class is that you are very unlikely to sit next to a politician, I don’t know ... I still enjoy doing constituency work and trying to solve constituent problems, I want to do more of that and hopefully if I am joined by others I can do more.” Pyne has said that the weakness in Xenophon’s “anti-politician” message is that it is a “message of complaint” upon which he can never deliver because he cannot be in government. But the real reason Pyne, and the government, are so worried about Xenophon’s looming political expansion is that it might just deliver him just enough political power that he can. • Join Lenore Taylor and Katharine Murphy in Sydney and Melbourne as they host our Guardian Live election special event featuring a panel of prominent political guests"
"The Sacred Heart of Jesus village, in the Philippines’ Nueva Ecija province, is home to 17 families who live in colourful houses, each one edged by plants potted in bottles and plastic bags. A woman pokes her head out of a lime green house. “This is Gawad Kalinga,” she says. “Welcome.” Gawad Kalinga (GK) – meaning “to give care” in Tagalog, the most common Filipino language – is a social movement that emerged from a Catholic youth camp in Manila’s slums more than 20 years ago. Galvanised by the destruction caused by typhoon Haiyan, which killed more than 6,300 people in 2013, the movement has become a household name.  This year, from April to June, tens of thousands of volunteers are taking part in the Bayani (heroes) challenge, a countrywide project to develop GK communities through building houses, planting trees and repairing schools. It attracts students alongside army and business volunteers. In Sacred Heart village, volunteers and residents are building a further 28 homes. People pass bricks to a plot where others are digging foundations. Another group cuts and bends steel rods for the walls. The village is being expanded to house farmers dealing with the effects of El Niño, which has induced a drought – record-breaking temperatures have soared above 50C – and flooding. Seven months ago, say residents, the water in the village was chest high following a typhoon. Farmers resowed their crops, only to see them destroyed by another typhoon in December. The rice fields “looked more like an ocean”, says Tito (uncle) Juanito. “If the water is too high, you can’t plant the rice. If there is a drought, you can’t water the rice. I have been a farmer since I was 18. It’s the only thing we can do.” Juanito, who was elected village leader when, after a private land donation, the community was built seven years ago, was responsible for the evacuation and clean-up. “The water came in through the windows,” he recalls. “We were very sad and very hungry. But even though there are a lot of disasters, we always want to get back up on our feet.” Most of GK’s beneficiaries are survivors of natural disasters – unsurprisingly, in a country where 130 million people were affected by such hardships between 1995 and 2015 (pdf). Communities start from a land donation, a request from a local authority or an approach from a homeless community. GK worked with Catholic missionary organisation Couples for Christ until 2009, but is now an independent NGO. More than 2,500 GK communities have sprung up across the Philippines, funded by individual donors, grants and corporations. At the heart of GK’s model is a definition of poverty centred not on economics, but on a mental state. Its aim, its website states, is to eradicate a survival mode mentality, where it’s “every man for himself”. Communities instead try to foster a spirit of bayanihan, a tradition of helping out your neighbour. Every individual who joins a GK village must attend a course that emphasises security, participation, religious freedom, peace, tourism, productivity and the environment. Residents must sign a contract that gives them free use of the property but forbids its rental, sale or mortgage. GK wants to end poverty for 5 million families by 2024. To date, 250,000 families have been housed by the organisation. Despite significant economic growth, the Philippines ranks 115th in the UN human development index and a quarter of the population live below the poverty line. The man behind GK is Tony Meloto, who hopes to grow a rural economy less reliant on imports. The project is still keen to open its doors to the west, however. “If the Philippines is to achieve the Filipino dream,” says Meloto, “I have to get global branding and popularity to attract the 11 million Filipinos abroad, but at the same time, other countries now see Asia as the market – the Philippines is the second fastest rising economy in the world.” Air France-KLM and Hyundai have sponsored GK villages, with signs above their entrances to mark the point. Volunteers, students and entrepreneurs come here – from French universities in particular – to learn and share expertise. Dylan Wilk gave up his life as a British computer games entrepreneur in the UK after visiting a GK community in 2003. In 2008, he founded Human Nature, a natural cosmetics company that employs people from GK communities. Louis Faure, 23, arrived in 2014 for a six-month internship at the Enchanted Farm, a project spread over 35 hectares (86.5 acres) that links students with local farmers and businesses to develop food products. Two years on, Faure is running a poultry business, initially funded by the farm. He has 950 chickens and expects the business to cover its costs within a few months.   But Meloto’s approach has attracted criticism. Observers have noted the dearth of independent assessments of GK’s work – all the more notable as the movement spreads overseas. About 7,000 families live in GK communities in Jakarta, set up by Filipino expats. There is a GK village in Cambodia and others are planned in Malaysia and Australia. Last year, the Center for Philippine Studies at the University of Hawaii branded Meloto a sexist for a speech in which he reportedly said: “The greatest asset of the Philippines is our beautiful women”. Meloto apparently added that he wanted to attract “the best and brightest men from the west”. Meloto does not deny that his model is male-centric. “Our women are motivated to study. Our men are not. That is the state of our development. When you’re poor you look more at physical strength to develop. You’d rather be into guns, drugs or drinking. So these girls will have to marry men with lesser qualifications than them. What kind of a future am I going to give them if I don’t also motivate the men?”"

"How to get people interested in climate change action when the problem seems so great and so removed from everyday reality? That’s the conundrum governments, activists, companies and the media have faced for decades. Occasionally a standout voice or campaign on climate change action grabs attention – Naomi Klein’s bestseller This Changes Everything, and Al Gore’s Climate Reality Project, for example. All too often, however, the science around climate change fails to resonate with people.  This is why Climate-KIC’s 2015 Climathon – a 24-hour climate change-focused hackathon – is so appealing. Climate-KIC, a European Union-funded knowledge and innovation community, launched the event as part of its larger campaign to raise awareness about climate change ahead of the Paris climate talks in December 2015.  Tapping into a network of public sector organisations, major companies and academic institutions, Climate-KIC invited cities to take part in the 24-hour challenge on 18 June 2015. The goal: to identify – and work on solutions for – local urban climate change problems. The response was impressive, with more than 1,000 teams volunteering to take part from 20 cities. The ideas that emerged from this 24-hour hack ranged from encouraging cycling in Copenhagen to public-private partnerships to reduce food waste in Washington DC. With teams posting more than 5,000 updates about their work to social media accounts, the Climathon was soon trending on Twitter – and Climate-KIC created a dedicated digital wall to amplify the conversation, both for external audiences and its own staff. It was a classic example of how social media can drive widespread interest with minimal resources. Ultimately though, any social media communication project around sustainability will be judged on what it delivers in terms of action. Mentoring and incubating smart business ideas that respond to climate change is a core part of Climate-KIC’s mandate. Through the Climathon, participating teams have been able to make connections with government and business within their own cities, which may be instrumental in ensuring their ideas bear fruit. Climate-KIC is the 2016 winner in the communicating sustainability category of the Guardian Sustainable Business Awards."

"The Hazelwood coal-fired power plant in Victoria may be closed or sold by its owner, French utility Engie, as part of its move away from operating any coal-fired plants, the company said on Wednesday.  Engie’s chief executive, Isabelle Kocher, told a French senate committee on Wednesday that the utility planned a gradual withdrawal from coal-fired power generation in the coming years and that following the sale announced earlier this year of two plants in Indonesia and India the share of coal in its energy mix would fall to about 10% from 15%.   “For the Hazelwood plant, we are studying all possible scenarios, including closure, or a sale if the state of Victoria tells us that it cannot meet power-generating needs without this plant,” Kocher said.  Environmental organisations say the plant – which has a generating capacity of 1.5 gigawatts, accounting for 5.4% of Australia’s electricity supplies – is one of the most polluting power stations in the world.  Hazelwood, close to Melbourne, is supplied with lignite coal from an adjacent open-cut mine, which burned uncontrollably for weeks in early 2014.  Engie’s Australian unit was charged in court in February with failing to provide a safe workplace and ensure public safety over the fire.  Engie (formerly GDF Suez) acquired a majority stake in Hazelwood when it bought UK utility International Power in 2012 and currently owns 72% with Japanese group Mitsui & Co holding 28%. Environment Victoria campaigns manager, Dr Nicholas Aberle, said it was time for the Victorian government and Engie to work together on a timetable for the phase-out of Hazelwood. “Victoria currently has an over-supplied electricity market,” he said. The Australian Energy Market Operator estimates we have 2000 MW more generating capacity than we need.  “Hazelwood is 1600 MW. The incumbent coal-burning power stations are blocking investment in renewable energy in Victoria. Its time they started making way so that Victoria can benefit from the jobs and investment that will come with new renewable energy projects. “Burning brown coal is 50% of Victoria’s climate pollution, and we need to urgently cut this pollution if we’re going avoid the worst of global warming.” In its recent state budget, the Victorian government provided $40m in to start diversifying the Latrobe Valley economy.  “The transition from coal to renewable energy is inevitable, but we need to speed it up, at the same time as looking after the workers and communities who have been so important to powering the state,” Aberle said. Engie will also review its remaining coal plants one by one and close those with the most outdated technology.  In recent months Engie had already closed the equivalent of 1.6 gigawatts worth of coal-fired plants in Europe, notably in Belgium and Britain, Kocher said.  She said a second option would be to convert some of its remaining coal-fired plants to burning biomass, which is deemed to be a renewable fuel.  She said that in developing countries like Indonesia which still rely heavily on coal and where Engie has efficient coal plants, it would sell rather than close these plants.  “Nearly half of the world’s power is still produced by coal, it will take years to reduce that,” she said.  The World Coal Association estimates that coal currently fuels about 41% of global electricity production.  Kocher, appointed earlier this month, wants to focus the utility on renewable energy, grids and energy services. "
"Climate change now poses the single biggest threat to the world’s most famous heritage sites – including the Galápagos islands, the Statue of Liberty, Easter Island and Venice – according to a UN sponsored report.   The researchers looked at 31 natural and cultural world heritage sites in 29 countries that are vulnerable to increasing temperatures, melting glaciers, rising seas, more intense weather, worsening droughts and longer wildfire seasons. They believe this number is the tip of the iceberg. There is an urgent and clear need to limit temperature rises to protect key heritage, the study by the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), the UN heritage body Unesco and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) concludes. The Statue of Liberty in New York is one of the sites at risk from rising sea levels and storms, illustrated by the devastating Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Global warming is raising sea levels and increasing the risk of floods, droughts and potentially fiercer storms, all of which can cause severe damage. The Galápagos islands, where Charles Darwin gained insights into evolution, and monuments and natural wonders from the port of Cartagena in Colombia to the Shiretoko national park in Japan, were also named as being under threat. Other sites that bring in important tourism revenue could be particularly badly hit, such as Uganda’s Bwindi Impenetrable national park, where rising temperatures could affect the habitat of endangered mountain gorillas. Stonehenge, the 5,000-year-old stone circle whose original purpose remains mysterious, is another of more than 30 major world heritage sites under threat from local flooding linked to global warming and increased rainfall. “Climate change is affecting world heritage sites across the globe,” said Adam Markham, the lead author of the report. “Some Easter Island statues are at risk of being lost to the sea because of coastal erosion.” He also pointed to coral reefs, which have been bleached owing to higher temperatures, and the threat to wildlife living in the affected areas, as well as tourism, which is an important source of income helping to preserve many of the sites. Scientists involved in the report said it was vital to limit global warming to no more than 2C, regarded by experts as the limit of safety beyond which climate change is likely to become catastrophic and irreversible. Governments agreed at a landmark climate conference last December that they would cut greenhouse gas emissions to the level needed to prevent temperatures rising that high. “Now, more than ever, we need countries to back up with action the promises they made in Paris,” said Markham, in a conference call with journalists on Thursday. Local economic development in the areas near world heritage sites – which UNESCO is charged with defining and helping to protect – would be damaged if the sites were affected by climate change, said Mechtild Roessler, director of UNESCO’s world heritage centre. That development is essential to protecting the sites, which include areas of natural beauty as well as monuments. “This is the tip of the iceberg,” said Roessler. There is a clear need for more monitoring of important sites, according to the scientists, and coral reefs in particular are at a tipping point. “There is no other threat [than climate change] that affects so many world heritage sites, and has so much potential to cause destruction,” said Markham. Other authors agreed that the report’s assessment was likely to be an underestimate. Without strong action, many areas are likely to face huge bills to protect their treasures. A sea defence being built in Venice is likely to end up costing more than $6bn, for instance. Other studies have also found world heritage areas at risk. Last month, the WWF found that half of the world’s most valued sites were at risk from encroaching development. "
"The lead author of a major UN report on climate change has expressed his shock that every reference to Australia was removed from the final version, following intervention from the Australian government. Guardian Australia on Friday revealed that chapters on the Great Barrier Reef and sections on Kakadu and Tasmanian forests were removed from the World Heritage and Tourism in a Changing Climate report, following the Australian Department of Environment’s objection that the information could harm tourism.  The Union of Concerned Scientists, which jointly published the report with the United Nations environment program and Unesco, published an independent statement on the reef this morning. “The biggest threat to the GBR today, and to its ecosystems services, biodiversity, heritage values and tourism economy, is climate change, including warming sea temperatures, accelerating rates of sea level rise, changing weather patterns and ocean acidification.” Adam Markham of the UCS, the lead author of the report, said he was “really disappointed” by the revelation that parts of the document had been excised. He also noted that with the removal of every mention of Australia went a number of positive stories about research and safeguards, including the protected area management strategies being tested to make Australian world heritage sites more resilient to change. “Australia has a good story to tell about its climate science and it should tell it,” he said. Markham said that the Australian government’s concerns seemed futile when the threats are obvious and publicising them could have had a positive impact on tourism to the country. “You can read in the newspapers almost every day what the threats – including global warming – are to the Great Barrier Reef, so I don’t think anything we would have put in the report would have been a surprise to anyone. “Rather than have a negative effect on tourism, I think this information would have helped galvanise the international community to want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the level where we might be able to reduce the impact on the [Great Barrier Reef] in the long term.” Asked whether he was concerned about the integrity of Unesco reporting, he said the agency was “fantastic to work with” over the year the report took to put together. He said it was a “complicated undertaking” and a joint partnership on the parts of all the agencies involved. Conservation groups have expressed shock at the government’s intervention.  Greenpeace campaigner Shani Tager said the news was “jaw-dropping”, especially in light of the dire state of coral-bleaching on the reef, but in line with cuts to the CSIRO and attempts to undermine the renewable energy industry. “We want an explanation from Malcolm Turnbull over how this can happen and an investigation into this decision. “The Australian public is owed an explanation over how and why this happened, and immediate steps put in place to ensure our scientists are independent of government intervention.” The Australian Marine Conservation Society has condemned the environment minister, Greg Hunt, for claiming that all was being done to save the reef. Great Barrier Reef campaign director Imogen Zethoven said the “cover-up” showed that Hunt and the government were “in denial” about the impacts of climate change. The Wilderness Society has called on the government to release all censored sections of the report, which it said was evidence of the “extreme lengths” the government was prepared to go to “to cover up the impacts of climate change”. “Censoring a report does not diminish the threats to tourism from climate change,” said national director, Lyndon Schneiders. “It makes the Australian government look petty and ridiculous and hampers transparent debate about climate change in Australia.” The Great Barrier Reef is in the middle of its worst crisis in recorded history, with 93% of the reefs along the 2,300km site experiencing bleaching caused by unusually warm ocean temperatures. The draft chapter on the reef pulled from the report but published exclusively by Guardian Australia warned that the reef was “poor and deteriorating” and “assailed by multiple threats”. The removals occurred in early 2016, when there was significant pressure on the government in relation to both climate change and world heritage sites. Less than a year before, the government had successfully lobbied Unesco not list the Great Barrier Reef on its list of world heritage sites in danger. The environment department spokesperson told Guardian Australia there were concerns that the draft report was framed to confuse “the world heritage status of the sites and risks arising from climate change and tourism”."

"“I’d prefer the wording not to focus on environmental damage” – those were the words used in an email by the company Shell, as it attempted to muscle in on the Science Museum’s curatorial decision making. In 2014, Shell had been a sponsor of the museum’s climate science exhibition but once that controversial email had been unearthed – as the result of a freedom of information request – there was no going back. The museum’s reputation was damaged and the end of Shell’s sponsorship became inevitable.  Earlier this month, the campaign group, Art Not Oil, published a damning report into the “corrupting influence” of another fossil fuel giant – BP – on the museums and galleries it sponsors. Once again, it places the Science Museum in the spotlight.   At its recent AGM, BP’s chief executive Bob Dudley insisted that the company gives money with “no strings attached” but documents cited in the report paint the opposite picture. Rather than furthering the understanding of science, BP appears to have been using the Science Museum in order to sharpen its spin and advance its strategic interests with policymakers. Curatorial independence is highly prized in the culture sector but for the Science Museum, BP has often been an exception to the rule. When the museum redeveloped its energy gallery in 2004, BP played a “hands-on” role. An article posted on BP’s website at the time (but now no longer available) described a “BP advisory board headed by Peter Mather, BP head of country, UK” with “10 experts from BP … to help with content for the exhibits.” And the Science Museum’s sponsorship liaison manager said: “We would like to help [BP] meet their objectives on different levels, including corporate responsibility, education strategy and global strategy.” In the intervening 12 years – despite BP’s failure to go “beyond petroleum” as the company once promised – the Science Museum has continued to bend to the company’s demands. It was the sponsor of the museum’s recent Cosmonauts exhibition where it was Bob Dudley and not the museum who personally invited John Whittingdale, secretary of state for culture, media and sport, to the launch dinner. One email showed BP trying to shift the exhibition launch date away from days when “you’d struggle to engage senior officials” in Russia and away from times when BP’s “senior Russia team” would not be in the country. BP currently has a 19.75% stake in the Russian state-owned oil and gas company, Rosneft. And when the Science Museum’s director, Ian Blatchford, subsequently received the Pushkin medal for the Cosmonauts exhibition from Vladimir Putin, the company gained sponsorship recognition at the very top. The museum also continues to help BP with its “education strategy”. It currently partners with the museum on the Ultimate STEM challenge, a competition for key stage 3 children that this year saw students asked to design – with no hint of irony – “a more efficient oil tanker”. In 2004, BP’s head of future fuels described young people as the “energy consumers who will use and choose which energy to use in the future”. It gave the new Energy gallery the whiff of a PR-venture and the Ultimate STEM challenge looks no different. These ethical questions around BP’s influence over the Science Museum form part of a wider debate about how research is carried out and communicated. Earlier this year, over 100 leading researchers called on the American Geophysical Union (AGU) to drop Exxon as a sponsor, following revelations that it misled the public about the risks of climate change. Despite the outcry, the AGU defended Exxon and kept them on board. Other fossil fuel links to research institutions include UCL’s BHP Billiton Institute for Sustainable Resources and the Shell professor of earth sciences at Oxford. These companies are buying a sheen of objectivity and legitimacy by associating their brands with top research bodies – and this in turn helps to shore up their political influence. The Museums Association recently launched a new Code of Ethics which makes it clear that museums should “support free speech and freedom of expression”. But when it comes to BP, the Science Museum has been only too willing to sideline freedom of expression in order to protect the interests of its sponsor. Public trust in scientific research and its communication must come first, and in light of the evidence we’ve assembled, the museum should now end its relationship with BP. Visitors to the Science Museum deserve more than a showroom for “BP-branded science” – something that is already well past its use-by date.

"It’s easy to find a news hook to begin an opinion piece on climate change. Coral bleaching, record-setting heat waves, and expensive, deadly wildfires are a weekly occurrence in the news cycle. But, as climate warming advances, extreme events won’t be newsworthy – they’ll be expected.  We scientists are the gatekeepers of the basic information that fuels decision making by nations, businesses and communities. As these public entities are more and more threatened by the advancing impacts of climate warming, from flooding, to water scarcity, to the spread of tropical diseases, our role as objective scientists has to change. We are so skilled at many, many detailed and quantitative tasks, but, as you would expect from a community of introverts, we are not great at shining that brilliant light back on ourselves.   Earth scientists, who are teaching, or researching, abut a silent, uncertain, and painful threshold. This is the threshold where climate change shifts from being about science and quantification to being about loss and the suffering of others.  For example, my 90-year-old grandmother, who lives in a low-income assisted care facility, suffers greatly when the new heat waves roll across the Pacific Northwest in June, July and August (and now May this year). Heat is deadly to seniors – this isn’t an issue of comfort, it’s an issue of safety. I tell myself, every time I leave her home, that I have to do something. I think of all the other grandmothers and great-grandmothers suffering in silence. I feel the cognitive dissonance, as I drive my Honda home, and the pain of it wells into the palms of my hands and the back of my mouth.  The problem is, we are past the threshold – we are just playing games with ourselves. In the anticipation of it, it has passed silently underneath our feet. We are already committed to a world that is warmer and more dangerous than the world of my grandmother’s childhood. That world – where we had time, we didn’t have to be political, we took only small, calculated risks – has evaporated in front of us. So, why are we still operating under old rules?  One reason may be that scientists are naturally risk-averse where it comes to public dialogue.  Many scientists began their careers with a passion for tide pools, early morning birding trips, or backyard plant dissections. These are people with unique sensitivity for the details of the natural world, who are are humbly wrapped up inside intricate problems. The verbal, argumentative skills common to professions in law, politics, or business do not come easily to most scientists.  Another reason is that we are embedded within staid and formal academic institutions, where our work and productivity is evaluated through lenses that have not changed with the world outside those ivory doors. We are hamstrung by our need for job security, funding, advancement, and promotion – because we, too, are juggling the demands of child rearing, aging parents, urban gentrification, and the winnowing of the middle-class. Regardless, this is the time for a gut-check. Our job is not to objectively document the decline of Earth’s biodiversity and humanity, so what does scientific leadership look like in this hot, dangerous world? We don’t need to all agree with each other – dissent is a healthy component of the scientific community. But, we do need to summon our voices and start shouting from rooftops: “We have options”, “We don’t have to settle for cataclysm”.  We must shine the bright, investigative light of scientific inquiry into the dark, silent corners of our shared fields – and challenge ourselves, our colleagues, and our institutions to truly rise to the challenge of leading the planet in the 21stCentury. I would task every climate or ocean scientist to reckon with these questions: What could you write? What could you say? Who could you speak to? Is your voice really being heard?  To be sure, there are scientists already committed to this work. I am one of many urging for change and social engagement from the scientific community. This isn’t a political call for the advocation of an environmental or “green” agenda – it is about cultural leadership and scientific decision-making in the face of unprecedented change and crisis. I believe most scientists are also, quietly and professionally, mourning the loss of the balance of Earth’s life. The pain doesn’t stop. It’s carried upon every wildfire, coral bleaching, or marine die-off. But, we can use these waves of pain to inform our moral commitment to the present and future. It requires the brave integration of science and self, the acceptance of loss.  Standing our ground, shoulder to shoulder, and speaking truth, we can use our voices to preserve the wholeness of the life that our grandparents and children deserve. The world is worth it.

"People living close to a proposed fracking operation in North Yorkshire have told councillors they do not want to be the first community in the UK to allow the controversial gas extraction technique. A meeting has begun to consider an application by UK firm Third Energy to frack for shale gas at its existing drilling site near the village of Kirby Misperton, between Malton and Pickering, in North Yorkshire.   Councillors were greeted by placard-waving protesters as they arrived for the county council planning committee meeting in Northallerton.  The plan has provoked angry protests from environmental campaigners opposed to the controversial hydraulic fracturing technique as well as groups concerned about more local environmental impact issues.  The first of more than 80 scheduled speakers at the meeting, independent Ryedale councillor Lindsay Burr, told committee members: “Ryedale residents do not want to be the first in the UK to allow fracking.”  Burr said there was a danger the Ryedale district would become known for fracking rather than tourism.  “Do not devastate our area,” she said.  “Please refuse this application for the sake of this beautiful area and our residents.”  Last week, officers at North Yorkshire county council recommended the granting of permission for Third Energy’s application.  The Government has said it is going “all out for shale” to boost energy security and the economy.  But opponents fear fracking - in which liquid is pumped deep underground at high pressure to fracture rock and release gas - can cause problems including water contamination, mini-earthquakes and noise and traffic pollution.  Environmentalists also warn that pursuing new sources of gas - a fossil fuel - is not compatible with efforts to tackle climate change, and that the focus should be on developing cleaner sources of energy such as renewables.  No fracking has taken place in the UK since 2011, when tests on the Fylde coast were found to have been the probable cause of minor earthquakes in the area.  Since then, two high-profile applications to frack in Lancashire have been rejected by councillors and are now the subject of appeals.  Third Energy wants to frack for shale gas using an existing two-mile deep well - called KM8 - drilled in 2013. The firm wants to erect a 120ft high drilling rig over the well.  It said it has taken “every possible step” to ensure the plan will not impact on the environment.  Friday’s planning committee meeting at County Hall, in Northallerton, is likely to continue on Monday due to the number of people who have applied to speak.  Introducing the meeting, committee chairman Peter Sowray said: “This is by far the most controversial application we have ever had to deal with.”  Sowray told the packed hall: “I am sure all members have come along with an open mind and are ready to listen to the facts.”  And he warned everyone: “It’s going to be a long day.”  Sowray also told his committee: “It is not for us to determine national policy on fracking.”  The planning officers’ report, which recommended that the application is approved, said planners came to this decision despite acknowledging that many of the 4,000 representations it had received in consultation were objections to the plans.  The report, published last week, said objections had been raised on the grounds of “climate change, surface and groundwater resources, protected species, landscape, air quality, noise, dark skies, heritage, seismicity/ground vibration and highway impacts as well as lacking compliance and conflicting with development plan policies”.  The report said: “In this particular case it has been concluded that the degree of conflict with policies in the development plan is not sufficient to justify refusal of the application.  “It should also be noted that there is national policy support for the development of a shale gas industry in this country and this is an important material consideration.” "
"The majority of coral is now dead on many reefs in the central section of the Great Barrier Reef, according to an underwater survey of 84 reefs, in the worst mass bleaching event to hit the world heritage site. An average of 35% of coral was now dead or dying in the northern and central sections, according to the surveys led by the Australian Research Council’s Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies.  But in good news for tourists and the tourism industry, only 5% of coral has died on reefs south of Cairns. The in-water mortality studies followed earlier aerial surveys, which found that 93% of the Great Barrier Reef had been affected by bleaching. Coral bleaches when it gets too hot for too long. The water temperature stresses the coral and it expels the colourful algae it relies on to give it energy. If warm conditions persist, the coral dies and can get taken over by seaweed. But if the water returns quickly to temperatures that are no longer stressful, the coral can recover, regaining its symbiotic algae. That is what researchers expect to happen to most of the bleached coral south of Cairns. “Fortunately, on reefs south of Cairns, our underwater surveys are also revealing that more than 95% of the corals have survived, and we expect these more mildly bleached corals to regain their normal colour over the next few months,” said Mia Hoogenboom from James Cook University. The conditions that led to the bleaching event were estimated to have been virtually impossible if it were not for the greenhouse gases humans have released into the atmosphere. Models showed they would be average conditions within 20 years. Terry Hughes from James Cook University, who led the survey work, said: “This year is the third time in 18 years that the Great Barrier Reef has experienced mass bleaching due to global warming, and the current event is much more extreme than we’ve measured before.  “These three events have all occurred while global temperatures have risen by just 1C above the pre-industrial period. We’re rapidly running out of time to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.”  John Pandolfi from the University of Queensland said the reef was already struggling to cope with the regularity of the bleaching events. He said the reef was no longer as resilient as it once was. “It is critically important now to bolster the resilience of the reef, and to maximise its natural capacity to recover,” said Pandolfi. The reef’s ability to recover from the increasingly regular bleaching events is being hampered by water pollution. A recent study suggested $10bn investment was needed to adequately reduce pollution levels and improve the reef’s resilience. The bleaching hitting the Great Barrier Reef is part of a global bleaching event, partly driven by a massive El Niño and climate change. By February this year, the event was already the longest-running global bleaching event in history, and it is expected to continue into the coming months. • The headline on this article was amended on 4 June 2016 to clarify that most of the coral was dead in parts of the central section of the reef, not the central section as a whole."
"On his late-night talk show, Jimmy Kimmel recently invited climate scientists to explain that they’re not just messing with us about global warming.   In fact, climate scientists are so worried that we’re going to fail to prevent catastrophic consequences that some are studying how we can hack the climate, also known as “geoengineering.” This approach is essentially viewed as a last-ditch, “break glass in case of emergency” desperation option in the event of such a failure. Some climate scientists view this as a potentially reasonable way to deal with climate change, but others disagree. It’s a controversial topic. Scientists have proposed various ways that we might use geoengineering to stave off a climate emergency, but one of the most popular involves pumping particles into the atmosphere. Volcanic eruptions spew tiny sulfur dioxide particles (aerosols) into the atmosphere, which reflect sunlight and act to temporarily cool the planet. If humans were to similarly pump aerosols into the atmosphere, in theory we could offset some global warming. This is known as albedo (whiteness) modification, because we would be modifying the Earth’s reflectivity. If the idea of mimicking a continuous volcanic eruption makes you nervous, you’re not alone. A National Academies of Science (NAS) report warned that the potential side-effects of this type of climate hacking are not well understood or quantified. Moreover, it would not solve the problem of ocean acidification – sometimes referred to as “global warming’s evil twin” – a major threat to marine ecosystems that only 20% of the British public has ever heard of.  Hotter and more acidic oceans form a one-two punch that’s killing off coral reefs, for example with the mass bleaching event that’s currently ongoing. Coral reefs are home to 25% of marine fish species, so this is a critical concern. It’s carbon that’s causing the world’s oceans to become more acidic, so we can only solve the problem by cutting carbon pollution or by removing it from the atmosphere. Recently the US Senate appropriations committee passed a spending bill that mysteriously included funding for the computational study of albedo hacking. Some are pushing not just for the computational experiments funded by the Senate appropriations bill, but also for field experiments. They cite the NAS report as supporting such field tests, but one of its authors, Ray Pierrehumbert explained that the report first calls for some sort of regulatory process to be put in place: Our NRC report does have a cautious statement saying that under some circumstances small scale field trials may become necessary to address scientific questions, but that statement is loaded with caveats concerning the (as-yet undemonstrated) scientific payback from such experiments regarding the questions that most need to be answered, and the need for some form of governance process (“serious deliberative process”) which would define what would count as “small scale.” There has not yet been any “deliberative process” of any sort, open, serious or otherwise, and indeed nobody seems to know what such a process would look like. The concern is that there are risks associated with these experiments, and without an international oversight framework in place, conflict could arise between nations with different ideas about the associated dangers: The risk is of a sociopolitical nature: it opens the door to a process that is unregulated, and which nobody knows how to stop, for which there is no governance in place, and which some scholars (myself included) think is fundamentally ungovernable. It’s similar to a nation without nuclear weapons beginning underground weapons testing. It’s not the threat to the physical environment that is the chief source of concern, but rather that the tests breach a significant barrier on the path leading to deployment, and have a substantial risk of triggering escalation as other nations respond. Moreover, this form of climate hacking is inherently riskier than researching technologies to remove carbon from the atmosphere: It’s strange and alarming that they chose to highlight the most dangerous form of climate intervention (albedo hacking) instead of asking for a big push on carbon capture, which addresses the root cause of the problem and moreover is the key backstop technology for staying under 2°C in a way that doesn’t put the Earth in a perilous state.  Since the rising carbon pollution is also the root cause of ocean acidification, unlike albedo hacking, carbon capture technologies would address both problems. We may eventually reach a point where albedo hacking becomes necessary, but field experimentation poses its own risks unless an international oversight framework is first established. The international community has been making significant progress in cutting carbon pollution to prevent the need for an emergency geoengineering effort, particularly through the Paris climate accords. However, Donald Trump has said that if he’s elected US president, he’ll do what he can do undermine that agreement, for example by trying to undo President Obama’s Clean Power Plan, and enacting policies to burn as much fossil fuels as possible.  If Americans make the wrong choice and elect a man who’s dangerously uninformed and believes climate scientists are just messing with us, Trump’s “energy plan” might put the world on a path to catastrophe in which we’re forced to resort to geoengineering, or at least begin dangerous field experiments. However, we’re not there yet. In all likelihood, Americans will make the right choice, we’ll keep progressing in our efforts to slow global warming by cutting carbon pollution, and hopefully climate hacking won’t become necessary. But the climate is changing so rapidly that we already face volatile scenarios like the possibility of escalating international conflicts over potentially dangerous albedo hacking experiments. In this volatile environment, we can’t afford to put an uninformed and unstable leader in charge of one of the world’s most powerful countries."
"This description of the Great Barrier Reef, obtained by Guardian Australia, was written by experts for a Unesco report on tourism and climate change but removed after objections from the Australian government. This draft would have been subject to minor amendments after being peer-reviewed. The lead author, Adam Markham, is deputy director of climate and energy at the Union of Concerned Scientists. Significance: World’s largest coral reef system; marine biodiversity; evolutionary processes; spectacular underwater landscapes.  Climate change is the primary long-term threat to the integrity and biodiversity of the world’s most extensive coral reef ecosystem. The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) was added to the world heritage list in 1981. It is one of the world’s most complex and diverse ecosystems, with at least 400 species of hard coral, 150 species of soft corals and sea fans, and more than 2,900 individual reefs and some of the most important seagrass meadows in the world – teeming with marine life of all sorts, including more than 1,600 fish species, seabirds, seahorses, whales, dolphins, crocodiles, dugongs and endangered green turtles. The GBR extends for 2,300km along the coast of Queensland in Northeast Australia and has evolved over a period of 15,000 years (Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority 2012, Unesco). The GBR region is important for the indigenous heritage of First Australians - Aboriginal and Torres Straits Islander people - who are the traditional wners. Climate change threatens hunting and fishing as well as other traditional and cultural practices. Some sacred sites are also at risk for the more than 70 traditional owner groups for whom natural resources are inseparable from cultural identity (Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority 2012). Louis de Bougainville was probably the first European to sight the GBR in 1768 and Captain Cook was the first to try to navigate the reefs in 1770 and it was the reports of Cook and naturalist Joseph Banks on their return to England that first alerted the scientific world to the existence of this marvel. Captain William Bligh too survived the reef after being cast into a small boat after a mutiny on his ship HMS Bounty in 1789. Bligh and his companions survived a remarkable journey sailing thousands of kilometers to safety in Timor after being cast adrift, finding their way into the GBR at what is still known as Bligh Boat Entrance and out at Restoration Island. The GBR is now one of the world’s most important coastal and marine tourism areas. A few tourists were visiting the reef as early as the 1890s but modern tourism was very minor before the 1950s and only really took off in the 1960s and ‘70s. Today, tourism (including touring, diving, beaches, sailing, fishing and cruising) is the most important economic sector in the GBR communities, contributing $5.2bn dollars to the Australian economy in 2012 and supporting 64,000 jobs, or about 90% of the total economic activity in the region (Deloitte Access Economics 2013). Visitors spent nearly 43m total nights in the GBR region in 2012, of which nearly 2m nights were on the reef, mainly at Cairns and the Whitsunday Islands (Deloitte Access Economics 2013). Direct reef-related tourism alone contributes 4,800 jobs. Approximately 500 commercial boats operate bringing tourists out to dive and snorkel on the reef and there can be negative impacts associated with this, including damage from fuel spills and walking and dropping anchors on fragile corals. Tourism infrastructure, along with other coastal developments, can cause habitat degradation and damaging pollution and sediment run-off. The biggest long-term threat to the GBR today, and to its ecosystems services, biodiversity, heritage values and tourism economy is climate change, including rising sea temperatures, accelerating rates of sea level rise, changing weather patterns and ocean acidification. (Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority 2012). Coral reefs worldwide are being directly impacted by warming waters and ocean acidification and climate change is exacerbating other localized stresses (Hoegh-Guldberg et al 2007). Ocean acidification is occurring because of increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. A significant portion (about 25-30%) of this CO2 is being absorbed by the oceans and the resulting increases in seawater acidity reduces the capacity of some marine life, such as corals, to build their calcium carbonate based skeletons. Significant drops in coral growth rate have been recorded in the last two decades for massive Porites corals on the Great Barrier Reef. Other significant threats include coastal development, agricultural run-off pollution, port-based shipping activities, illegal fishing and outbreaks of the coral-eating crown-of-thorns starfish. Assailed by multiple threats, the GBR has been assessed as being poor and deteriorating. Half of its coral cover has been lost over the last three decades. Unusually high sea temperatures have caused eight mass coral bleaching events on the GBR since 1979, with the worst occurring in 1998 and 2002 (Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority 2012, Steffen et al 2009, Hughes et al 2015). Coral bleaching occurs when higher than usual maximum temperatures disrupt the relationship between corals and the photosynthetic zooxanthelae algae that live in their tissues in a vital and mutually beneficial biological relationship. Bleaching can kill corals, but depending on the severity of the impact and local factors they can also recover. The same is true for coral damage from storms, but damaged or bleached corals and reefs need time to do so. All indications are that bleaching events will become more frequent and tropical storms more intense with continued global warming, and that this combined with a continued trend in warming water and ocean acidification will be massively detrimental to the GBR (Hoegh-Guldberg et al 2007, Steffen et al 2009, Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority 2012). Without global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions coupled with local management responses to increase resilience, current projections suggest that coral cover could decline to 5-10% of the GBR by the early 2020s from 28% in 1985 – a potential loss of 80% in just 40 years (De’ath et al 2012). Similar fears are associated with one of the other keystone ecosystems of the GBR, seagrass meadows representing 20% of the world’s 72 seagrass species. These shallow-water habitats provide vital nursery areas for fish and shrimps, critical food resources for turtles and dugongs and act as carbon sinks, sequestering organic carbon in marine sediments. The combination of agricultural runoff, fishery impacts and climate change may exceed seagrass beds’ natural ability to adapt (Coles et al 2014). Sea turtles too are at risk from climate change as high temperatures and sea level rise impact their breeding and nesting beaches (Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority 2012). Spurred by the direct evidence of climate change already impacting the GBR, degradation of the reefs and the likelihood of much worse to come, the Australian government has begun to plan and implement actions to reduce the risk of future damage. At the core of the adaptation strategy are efforts to build ecosystem resilience, fill gaps in scientific knowledge, and monitor environmental, social and economic impacts of climate change (Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority 2012). Collaborative management strategies are also being developed and tested with local communities, Traditional Owners, as well as with business and industry. The GBR was also the first World Heritage property for which a comprehensive Tourism and Climate Change Action Strategy was developed (Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority 2009). The strategy recognizes the vital importance that a healthy GBR ecosystem plays for the Australian economy and that the tourism industry must quickly come to grips with the problem. Recommended actions include reducing direct impacts and greenhouse gas emissions from tourism companies operating on or near the reef; increased training and awareness for guides and operators; helping to raise public understanding of the threat, and; supporting scientific research and monitoring activities (Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority 2009). The plan also calls for the industry itself to plan adaptive responses for declining reef conditions and to contribute to risk management strategies for climate disasters. Despite these measures, international concern has continued to grow, however, that without a comprehensive response more in keeping with the scale of the threat, the GBR’s extraordinary biodiversity and natural beauty may lose its World Heritage values. IUCN’s World Conservation Outlook 2014 assessed the status of the World Heritage values of the GBR as of “high concern” and experiencing a deteriorating trend (IUCN 2014). The most recent strategy from the Australian government, the Reef 2050 Long-term Sustainability plan, addresses this issue head on and is specifically designed to “ensure the Great Barrier Reef continues to improve on its Outstanding Universal Value every decade between now and 2050 to be a natural wonder for each successive generation to come” (Commonwealth of Australia 2015)."
