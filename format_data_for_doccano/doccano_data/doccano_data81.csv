"George Monbiot (Time to declare the system dead – before it takes us down with it, 25 April) says he has slowly and reluctantly rejected capitalism because the endless impulse for growth and wealth creation ineluctably drives climate change. Asad Rehman, executive director of War on Want, in his global justice seminar at the Extinction Rebellion protests, focused more on neoliberalism – the even more rapacious, ever-expanding incarnation of capitalist exploitation of people and planet over the last four decades – as the driver of global climate inequality and impending calamity. But left-of-centre ideologies also focus on growth in the bid to tackle inequality, with social and economic priorities overshadowing ecological imperatives. This paper has had occasional discussions of the degrowth movement. In one such, Christiane Kliemann (Let’s face it: we have to choose between our economy and our future, 23 January 2015) posited that once we have accepted there are only radical options left, we have a choice between our economy and our future if we are to meet everybody’s needs more sustainably and equitably, using fewer resources. More focus on degrowth on the political left, and more analysis in these pages of its underpinnings and its potential, could contribute to movements for creating a global economy that can truly be described as “ours”, and a future not only for those of us in the global north, but also a present for those in the global south already experiencing the ravages of growth-driven climate change. Sarah CemlynBristol  • For once I disagree with George Monbiot. He overlooks one idea favoured by environmentalists and thinking capitalists: the circular economy. This idea doesn’t attack capitalism per se, rather the traditional take–make–use–waste structure of its linear economy, a structure also found in communism, and a pernicious habit of human life. In a circular economy, resources remain in use for as long as possible, giving their maximum value. Products and materials (both natural and technological) enjoy as many “service lives” as possible. Products and packaging are designed for maximum reuse, repair and refurbishment, thus relegating recycling and energy extraction to the last resort. Reverse logistics provide return networks, with local reuse prioritised. In my view, circular economy is just as necessary as rewilding, emissions reduction and carbon sequestration if we are to slam the carbon brakes on within a decade. Perhaps it is more necessary because, unlike them, it gives objectives and structure to the good transformation of our way of life. I suggest a look at the Ellen MacArthur Foundation for much deeper thinking on circular economy. I have only one quibble with them, which is that so far they say little on how people and communities can contribute – which we can. They seem focused on changing capitalism.Malcolm FowlesReading, Berkshire • George Monbiot calls for replacing capitalism, and the G2 article on the library of things (25 April) hints at a solution. Surely the fourth industrial revolution will involve cooperatives providing many of the services we have come to depend on? As an example, in Zurich – one of the world’s wealthiest and happiest cities – 25% of homes are owned by cooperatives and the city government is raising the proportion to a third. As a consequence, a much wider range of people live on low rents, and have fuller and less wasteful lives.Dr Nicholas FalkExecutive director, The URBED Trust • George Monbiot powerfully argues that constant economic growth on a finite planet results in environmental meltdown. He suggests we need a range of thinkers to frame a coherent alternative to capitalism. A genuinely democratic socialism with a solid workplace and local basis has already a number of blueprints. They include that glorious failure, the alternative Lucas Aerospace corporate plan in 1976, drawn up by shop stewards, advocating socially useful products, and the actions and policies of Preston city council, as described in several Guardian articles by Aditya Chakrabortty.Michael SomertonHull, East Yorkshire • Gaby Hinsliff (Pay heed to the climate rebels. They ask the right question, 20 April) makes a very good point about protests, where arguments may be at best half formed but very strong feelings that something is wrong are articulated. She puts her finger right on the alarm bell when she quotes Gail Bradbrook of Extinction Rebellion saying: “Now is not the time to be realistic.” With global warming, how can the plan to leave the EU, travelling the world looking for new markets, make sense when we should be cutting down on aviation and shipping emissions as fast as we can? The struggle to say goodbye to petrol cars, gas boilers and cookers will be so much harder if we have turned our backs on our nearest markets, relying on far-flung sources for food and needs, and on top of that have to struggle with our failure to really start addressing and reducing the consequences of heating our planet up. This is the big question that overshadows all political squabbling and despite listening to all the arguments has failed to work itself to the surface. Extinction Rebellion may not be ready to be realistic yet but their strong vision and determination and canary they put in the system has put the spotlight on the most important realistic question we should be asking ourselves now.Barbara Mullarney WrightActon, London • I admire Greta Thunberg’s actions on climate change, but I can’t wholly agree with her that “MPs have lied” (Report, 24 April). MPs are held to account by their electorates and, as is clear even in the advertisements that appear in the Guardian, even the best informed voters like cruises to ever more exotic places, they like ever bigger cars, they aspire to lifestyles that come with higher carbon emissions. In other words, we are all deceiving ourselves, and elected politicians who challenge our cognitive dissonance will fear paying a high price for it. While Extinction Rebellion represents one train of thought, the gilets jaunes in France seem to be motivated not by climate change (Macron’s supposed justification for higher fuel prices) but by personal economics. A courageous government would swiftly introduce carbon rationing, with diminishing, tradable rations for each of us. The price of carbon would be determined by a formula based on the contraction and convergence framework, to ensure globally equitable burden sharing. Will it happen? Not until London is inundated I suspect.Colin ChallenLabour MP Morley & Rothwell 2001-2010 and founding chair, All party parliamentary climate change group, 2005-2010 • Arriving home from the Extinction Rebellion protests on Wednesday morning I was really heartened to read your lead editorial (24 April) putting into words most of my feelings: “Doing nothing is not an option.” At the same time I would love to see the Guardian challenge itself to lead the conversation even more: what does the climate emergency mean for you? What role should you play? We all have to do more, faster. It’s an existential crisis. In the same edition you had adverts for British Airways and Guardian holidays. We will all have to start changing our lifestyles and that means less long-distance flying unfortunately. I understand that newspapers’ business model relies on advertising and us paying subscribers. It would be very exciting for the newspaper to embrace the demands of Extinction Rebellion – especially with regard to exploring citizens’ assemblies. This is a process to put people at the centre of power. It is new, and a little bit confusing, but ultimately hugely empowering and powerful for people all at the same time.Henry TrewBuckland Brewer, Devon • I find the Guardian’s ostensible promotion of environmental justice completely at odds with the continuing policy of reviewing tech devices without rating their environmental impact. On the very same day as Peter Beaumont’s article (Rotten eggs: e-waste from Europe poisons Ghana’s food chain, theguardian.com, 24 April), the Guardian published yet another tech review awarding five stars to a product with no mention of a post-use device recycling plan (Huawei P30 Pro: Game changing camera, stellar battery life). As a reader and tech user I want to know which products are least environmentally damaging. I am less concerned about the cosmetic aspects such as “stunning colour options, including the pearlescent oil slick-like ‘breathing crystal’ and the eye-popping amber sunrise”, which the Guardian prioritises over device recycling information. Please act to combat the horrific e-waste industry by insisting that all your tech reviews include clear information for readers about the devices’ in-purchase recycling package. If a tech producer can’t provide a recycling plan for its products, don’t give them five stars.Jonathan ShaveBolzano, Italy • You report that senior politicians “towered over” Greta Thunberg.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSince the gore-filled 10:10 No Pressure clip exploded onto the public scene last week, the reaction from critics, primarily the blogosphere, has been harsh and swift – so overwhelming in fact that 1010 pulled it from the Internet within just a few hours. Major backers like Sony and Kyocera have since disappeared. It was a huge embarrassment. But all of this no thanks to the mainstream media. Nowhere has the silence on this issue of using violence to shut down human dissent been more deafening than in Germany.
Other than a few blogs and discussion forums, a Google search in Germany of “1010 No Pressure” yields no critical reports by German media outlets relating to the controversy. No reports at all. Most of the search results lead to English speaking sites outside of Germany’s borders.  Except for a short uncritical blurb by Focus magazine, no German media has touched this story. They’ve buried it. Why is this so?
It’s because the German media and political classes are so very deeply involved in the green movement, and thus are now incredibly embarrassed by it.  They simply cannot afford having this spread to the German public. Awareness of the 1010 PR film would lead the public to ask serious, inconvenient questions.
New religion
Germany has become an environmenmtaly radical country, with climate protection having become its new religion,  it’s de facto raison d’etre.  Striving to be green is a very noble virtue. The established political classes and media are all deeply entrenched in the ideology, and actively purvey it daily. A green collectiveness has taken over. Former Minister of the Environment and Socialist party leader Sigmar Gabriel once distributed 6000 copies of Al Gore’s AIT to Germany’s upper secondary schools in order to indoctrinate university-bound students. Pupils are shown the movie, uncritically, yearly. Groups like the environmentalist Germanwatch regularly present world doom and gloom scenarios at schools to round out the indoctrination. Dissent, once a positive attribute in the land of poets and thinkers, is now scorned upon.
Being green means being virtuous, and so the result is a competition of who can be the greenest among political parties, and among European countries. Any consideration of the adverse economic and technical impacts this race could have has been thrown overboard. The race to be the greenest is the race to moral supremacy, i.e. the right to lecture the rest of the world on how to behave.
Dissent is not tolerated

Germany has its sceptics, but they have been vilified and severely marginalised by the well-funded scientific, political and media-establishment. Politicians and leaders who dare lift a single finger of scepticism quickly find it bitten off, and are immediately gang-mobbed. The case of Marie-Luise Dött is one example. The tactics of Hans Joachim Schellnhuber and Stefan Rahmstorf of the generously government-funded Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) routinely marginalise scientists who do not agree. Germany and Western Europe have once again become intolerant. Yet, their latest attempt to cover-up the intolerance has only served to expose it.
 Green has become Germany’s business model
Because of it’s faith in the green movement, Germany has invested immensely in climate protection. Even despite it’s gray and rainy climate, the country has become a leader in promoting solar energy, pouring billions in subsidising solar panels and passing aggressive energy feed-in laws. A vast array of green energy sources are heavily subsidised by the government. Billions are are now being poured into green energy infrastructure projects, like huge offshore wind parks. Europe is now getting set to implement Desertec, a massive €400-billion euro Saharan solar power generation facility, where huge corporate giants like Siemens stand to cash in big. Films like 1010 only serve to cast doubt and jeopardise already shaky public support.
Can’t afford to lose it
So with Germany so deep in Green, with everything at stake, it risks losing its very purpose, its mission, the imagined moral high ground that green promises to deliver, it’s entire bank-rolled future. Germany, like many other European countries, has put itself in a position where it simply cannot afford seeing the green movement collapse. Therefore it is doing everything possible to sustain it, and to bury anything that could threaten it.
No, 1010 must never reach public awareness. People could start thinking that the movement is run by zealots. That must never happen.
The deafening silence speaks volumes.

" Bill Shorten has declared Labor will run its own race on climate change, and will “listen” but not replicate Julia Gillard’s joint policy process with the Greens in any minority government scenario after the election. In an interview with Guardian Australia on the campaign trail this week, the Labor leader rebuffed a recent overture from the Greens leader Richard Di Natale to revive the process that applied in the 43rd parliament where the parties worked together to produce the clean energy package.  “Richard would say that wouldn’t he? So, who cares? Richard is looking for relevance at the moment,” Shorten said. “I don’t blame him for doing that, it’s legitimate, but I’m going to lead a Labor government”. Asked what he would do if the Greens made a joint policy process the price of supporting a Labor government in the next parliament, Shorten said: “Well [Di Natale] has to face progressive voters. “The Greens cost us action on climate change in 2009. I didn’t come down in the last shower. Just because Richard Di Natale proposes a sequence of events doesn’t not make those events inevitable. “I’m not going to negotiate before an election what happens after an election, but what I am saying is – we use the word mandate a lot in politics. It gets thrown around. In my case, though, I think people can genuinely accept we have been upfront with the people, we’ve got our mandate, they will be my negotiating instructions. “The Greens really stuffed up climate change in the 43rd parliament by their terms. I’m not going to sign up to a deal that damages our chances to deliver [enduring action] on climate change.” In 2010, Gillard set up a multi-party committee to develop the climate change policy comprised of herself, the deputy prime minister Wayne Swan, the climate change minister Greg Combet, Bob Brown, Christine Milne and Adam Bandt of the Greens and the lower house crossbencher Tony Windsor. A week ago, in an interview with Guardian Australia, Di Natale said: “I would hope Shorten would show the maturity that Julia Gillard demonstrated and bring people to the table to negotiate constructively.” Di Natale made it clear he wanted to negotiate with Shorten to strengthen a policy the Greens regard as insufficiently ambitious, but he also wanted to be clear that the Greens are prepared to vote down a policy “if it’s going to lock in failure”. Shorten said he would behave constructively post-election in the event of a victory, but referencing the Gillard process explicitly, he said: “There will not be signings at the table with a sprig of wattle for everyone. “Let’s see what happens when we get elected but I’m not going to have this argument that somehow, we are going to go into coalition with the Greens. “That doesn’t mean I won’t listen, or I won’t talk to the Greens, I’ll talk to all parties in the Senate and I’ll talk to the opposition if we get elected. I’m a very pragmatic personality and my record is getting things done.” Labor’s climate change policy has been a feature of the opening weeks of the campaign, with the Morrison government trying to land blows on the package in a facsimile of Tony Abbott’s “carbon tax” offensive in 2013, even though Liberals in metropolitan contests are facing a backlash from voters concerned the Coalition has been destructive on climate action. As well as the government attack, Labor’s policy has been criticised by the Greens as not ambitious enough, and Shorten has faced a difficult balancing act on the hustings in Queensland this week about the controversial Adani coal project, with several marginal seats up for grabs, and significant local concern about jobs. Asked whether Labor would persist with a detailed policy to drive emissions reduction if it loses the election on 18 May, given the electoral pain of the past decade and the toxic politics around the issue, Shorten said he was “not contemplating failure”. He said the coming election needed to break the policy deadlock for the good of the country. “Whether we shift post-election is up to the caucus of the day. But we cannot give up on the climate change arguments. “We’ve got to break through this paralysis. We are selling out our future and future generations if we give in to the knuckle draggers on the right. “The problem is this government is not serious about climate change, and whenever anyone comes up with any ideas to do something about it they will always find an excuse to do nothing. “Just ask Malcolm Turnbull.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterBy bitter, I mean much colder than normal. This is a summary of what the experts are saying and what the data are showing.
We just got a strong El Nino behind us and now a La Nina is forming in the Pacific and is barreling ahead in full development, see the chart below. It’s got the potential to be a big one, meaning global temperatures will go into a nosedive in the months ahead.
Joe Bastardi thinks temperatures will reach levels we saw back when Pinatubo blew its top, and maybe lower.
The next chart shows the NWS/NCEP forecast for the fall and winter. Strangely, the German weather services here are predicting a 60% chance the coming winter in Germany will be warmer than normal – which doesn’t agree with what NWS service is forecasting. Europe is projected to be about normal. Note: As Joe Bastardi’s latest video shows, regional forecasts coming out of NOAA are sometimes very very wrong!

Take a look at the Arctic in the right side panels above, i.e. December to April. We’re talking deep freeze. That’s quite a difference from the constant red bloodbath we’re used to seeing from GISS and NOAA. The months ahead are going to be really tough for those trying to avoid the Al Gore effect.

Average global temps to a great extent will depend on the depth of the La Nina. Look at the following graph and compare this La Nina with the last one back in 2007-08. What do you see? Where were we at this time in 07? Looks to me right around zero. This time around we’re already 1°C below that. Also look at the overall slope in this year’s plummet.
This La Nina will seriously depress global temps in the months ahead, thus throwing ice water on the NCDC’s fantasy of the hottest year ever. It’ll be interesting watching them try to pull it off. They need it for Cancun.
The poles are also indicating lower temperatures. No death spiral in the Arctic. Zed’s dead, baby. The DMI chart already shows freezing at 80°+N latitude. But it has ticked up a bit. No matter it was the coldest melt season in that area on record – in the “hottest year ever”. Go figure!
The Arctic will not set a new record low sea ice minimum this year, as many were hoping, panting and drooling for. It isn’t even going to set the second lowest.  A third lowest is still in the works, though the odds are tightening. Total sea ice of the north and south poles is smack normal – and again, this in the “hottest year” on record.
Okay, a winter’s forecast is not climate – many will crow. Yes, but weren’t we told that such winters were a thing of the past? To the contrary, more and more we’re hearing they may very well be a thing of the future.
Folks, all these nice graphs are available at my Climatic Indicators side bar on my homepage. Take a look and you be the judge.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGreenpeace has become a bad spirit for the Inuit
Award-winning Daniel Hannan, a conservative MEP of East England, has written a critical piece of Greenpeace called: Greenland to Greenpeace: your hunger for publicity is putting our lives at risk.
h/t: R. de Haan
Readers may have noticed I’ve been focused on Greenpeace over the last week or so. The once peaceful organisation, which used to be concerned with real environmental issues, has long since turned into a militant, intolerant, greedy and increasingly violent group that is bent on forcing others to submit to their will. So I’m pleased when people like Hannan bring it up.
According to Hannan at the Telegraph:
The prime minister of Greenland – a socialist, no less – has attacked Greenpeace for sabotaging an Arctic exploration rig.

When even the socialists get mad at Greenpeace, then it’s a sure sign how radical the organisation has gotten. Greenland’s socialist PM, Kuupik Kleist, is fuming about Greenpeace’s recent criminal sabotage.
The cabinet regards Greenpeace’s action as very serious and an illegal attack on the country’s constitutional rights. It is worrying that Greenpeace, in their hunt for media exposure, violate security rules made to protect human lives and the environment.
I wrote a post about this as well.
Fantasising and drooling over the next Holocaust? 
It seems so. Greenpeace has no resemblance of the organisation it used to be. Even Greenpeace co-founder Patrick Moore thinks the environmentalists have lost their marbles.

Moore says:
They depict human beings as a malignancy, a cancer on the face of the earth. There’s way too many of us. Guys like Paul Watson and a whole bunch of his ilk are coming out and saying there should only be 1 billion people, and not 6 billion people. 
And: 
I fought for nature all through my years at Greenpeace, and I’m proud of what we did back then. But I do not understand how people can write off the whole human race. 
They’ve gone from green to red, and are now headed for brown.

The German edition of the Financial Times has a story today on wind energy’s latest debacle in Germany: treehugger-bureaucrats. In one corner we have environmentalists demanding the installation of wind energy to avert a climate catastrophe, and in another corner you have environmentalist bureaucrats stopping windparks in order to protect local wildlife.
Green offshore windparks clash with green German bureaucrats.
Meanwhile, energy prices for the consumer are going through the roof.
The Federal Office For Nature Protection (no joke!), responsible for approving offshore wind parks,  is having second thoughts about the foundations used for offshore windmills because “they pose a threat to wildlife”.  As a result that have stopped approving any additional windmills until further notice. This is confirmed by a letter to the FT from the Federal Office For Nature Protection.
The FT reports that 2 types of foundations are used for anchoring offshore wind generators. In one type, huge piles are rammed into the seabed by 15,000 blows delivered by a heavy pile driver. But the noise this work creates is disturbing the whales, and they are leaving their living areas for quieter places. That has to stop.
The second type of foundation is the so-called gravity foundation made of concrete. But the heavy concrete pads end up sealing the seabed and thus damage crabs and mussels. Can’t have that either. According to the letter:
Gravity type foundations cannot be considered as an alternative foundation because they are installed on the seabed using  acoustic ramming. A better way would be to use a foundation that is installed using some sort of boring process.

Technically this is possible, but there exists no company to do it. Meanwhile investors and the numerous companies that are currently installing offshore windparks in Germany’s North Sea now face heavy losses. The FT writes:
Severely impacted are companies that are deep into the approval process. This is because the approval processes are lengthy and costs millions of euros, as they entail comprehensive expert attestations and environmental impact studies.
Needless to say, offshore windpark companies are outraged. And all companies that are in the approval process have left out the question on foundations – fearing not being granted approval. But without a foundation, it’s impossible to put up a windmill – thus every approval becomes worthless.
Lawmakers are also outraged by the delays. Yet, the Federal Office For Nature Protection insists it is not imposing a moratorium of any kind, and that rather it is only trying to find a way to bring offshore wind energy production in harmony with nature.
According one German Parliamentarian, Torsten Staffeldt.
The Federal Office For Nature Protection is drifting into absurdity. If we continue like this, we’ll never reach our goals for expanding offshore wind energy.
Well I’d hate to disappoint Herr Staffeldt, but that point has long been reached and surpassed. Worse yet – the treehugger wars are just beginning.

"Meal-prep kits are often more environmentally friendly than the average trip to the grocery store, according to a University of Michigan study. Researchers at the School of Environment and Sustainability found that, on average, while kits provided by companies like Blue Apron, Sun Basket and HelloFresh often do involve more packaging waste, the emissions for grocery store meals carried two kilograms more of carbon dioxide per meal than those of the meal-prep kits. “There are lots of people who really liked meal kits but were saying ‘Ah, there’s so much plastic and I feel so bad because [it’s] so terrible environmentally,” said Dr Shelie Miller, one of the primary researchers. “I said ‘You know, I bet if we take a bigger picture look, they may not turn out to be that bad.’ Just largely because of the pre-portioned ingredients and potentially, the lack of food waste.” Using five different Blue Apron meals, the researchers tracked and compared the lives of the meals through several different environmental lenses, concluding the disparity in emissions was mostly due to the supply chain and the portions of food. The extra steps stores take to source food add up to more carbon dioxide, as well as encourage food waste. “It really is the food and the food waste that dictate the environmental impact,” Miller said. While the meals did come from Blue Apron, the company did not sponsor the study – but were obviously pleased with the result. “Blue Apron has long been driven by our vision of building a better food system,” said Dr Alison Grantham, their agro-ecologist and director of procurement. “We are delighted to see the positive benefits of our direct-to-consumer model materialize in lower life cycle greenhouse gas emissions.” Meal-prep kits like Blue Apron can be expensive, but there are other solutions for those who would like to be environmentally conscious. “One strategy that has been shown both to reduce food waste but will ultimately also save consumers money is meal planning,” said Brent Heard, the other researcher associated with the study. “It will decrease the amount of food you need to purchase at the store … In line with this, another thing consumers can do is try to purchase food in the smallest portion sizes. Try to select foods that are as close to pre-portioned as possible.” The study did not take into account people who participate in alternative forms of grocery purchasing, like community-supported agriculture. Despite this, both Heard and Miller agree the central message behind the study does not change. “The study really motivates looking beyond what’s directly in front of us when we think about the environmental impacts of a product,” says Heard."

"Climate change is hurling humanity towards disaster. There is no more room to question the science, when nearly every climate scientist is in agreement that the implications of a global rise in average temperature will spell drastic changes for human civilisation. In the face of such a rapidly encroaching threat, political niceties and traditional incrementalism and compromise cannot come close to the level of change and upheaval required to solve, or even mitigate, the problem of global climate change.  Climate scientists continue to stress the importance of lowering carbon emissions significantly, yet they are currently increasing at an accelerating rate. A 2018 UN study found that unless promised emission reductions under the Paris agreement were tripled, they would cause the global temperature increase to reach 3C by 2100 and continue to rise after that. Meanwhile, some of the most influential people in the world continue to deny the very existence of climate change. Even as the relatively tame 2018 IPCC report states that we must cut our emissions in half within the next decade, people are feeling that their elected leaders, and mainstream political avenues as a whole, cannot measure up to this task. The current ineptitude and impotency of the ruling class is unacceptable when the consequences of inaction are so far-reaching. More than ever, it is time for workers – those who will be hardest hit by soaring food and healthcare costs, and by property destruction caused by natural disasters and the rising sea – to exert their power and force the hand of major players (governments and corporations) to avert what is almost certain to be the next global mass extinction. As such, climate activism of all types is blossoming. Greta Thunberg’s school strikes led to one of the largest global climate demonstrations in history. Extinction Rebellion has shut down major intersections in London and held events around the world. The Sunrise Movement caught the attention of the US when children in San Francisco confronted the Democratic senator Dianne Feinstein over her climate policy. Indigenous groups across the globe have been fighting tooth and nail against resource development on their ancestral lands. And Earth Strike is preparing for a global general strike on 27 September 2019. Through all of this, as Greta Thunberg has said, one thing must be made clear. There is no greater way to capture the attention of the public, and the powers that be, than a general labour strike. An old and effective strategy, it is the holy grail of activism. And in such dire times, there is no question that a general strike is sorely needed once more. Earth Strike is seeking to revive the general strike in service of a global, apocalyptic problem – one that encompasses the lives of every creature on the face of this planet. The reason Earth Strike exists is that shutting off the global labour supply will force governments and industry giants to listen. There’s no way to avoid the conversation when profits are in danger of eroding, and production has stalled to a halt. Every day we go into work and spend our time and labour building a system that is burning us alive. The top polluters in the world are directly dependent on this effort. It is time to withhold it. Some will inevitably argue that labour action is too disruptive, and too messy, but that’s the very point. The system causing this crisis needs to be disrupted. A general strike is an exceptionally powerful tool with a long history of gaining concession. In Iceland in 1975, a women’s general strike was instrumental in guaranteeing equal pay; and in India earlier this year, a general strike by between 150m and 200m workers illuminated the injustices inflicted on them by Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata party. We simply don’t have the time to forge a new tool from scratch. In fact, the opposite reaction is more likely. 27 September is only the first strike, and sympathisers all over the globe are bound to take notice. To those who do not feel like they have the power alone, organise. Unions and workers must work together in solidarity. The growing number of participants in this general strike, numbering in the tens of thousands, are already talking about what will come next. For whatever comes, we will fight, and strike, together. • McEver Dugan is the writing coordinator for Earth Strike. Evan Cholerton is the international organiser for Youth for Earth Strike.

Share this...FacebookTwitterResearchers at Germany’s Karlsruhe Institute for Technology have laid the cornerstone for a pilot plant that will produce a new kind of cement called Celitement®. Read here. This new cement developed by KIT researchers can be produced at far lower temperatures and with less lime than conventional cement. It has the potential to save 50% of the energy used during manufacturing.Manufacturing cement, like glass, is a highly energy-intensive process. Cement is an indispensible building product which has made an enormous contribution to civil engineering and to our standard of living. Our prosperity and modern standard of living as we know it would be unimaginable without it. The cement industry consumes about 2 to 3% of the world’s energy and emits more than 5% of manmade CO2, approximately 3 to 4 times more than air traffic.
Not only does the process involve the mining of limestone as the raw material, but also includes transport, handling, processing in rotary kilns, stocking and distribution.
Conventional Cement Production Process
The Celitement® process was developed by KIT researchers and uses new chemical processes during the curing of concrete, according to Prof. Dr. Jürgen Mlynek, President of the Helmholtz Association, to which KIT is a member.
Beginning in 2011, the pilot plant will deliver about 100 kilograms per day. By 2014 an industrial plant will be put into operation and have the capacity to produce 30,000 tons per year. The target is to bring an environmentally friendly, energy-saving product to market as soon as possible.

Share this...FacebookTwitterEarlier today German Radio reported that an uusually large number of dead whales have washed up on the North German Baltic beaches over the last 2 weeks.
Now some believe that a newly installed Baltic 1 offshore windpark (see map) consisting of 21 2.3-MW turbines may be responsible, according to reports.

I searched the Internet for more information, but the story appears to be bottled up for now. The online dnews.de has a small report.
It writes that according to the German Marine Museum, 12 cadavers have appeared so far. According to whale researcher Stefan Bräger:
This high frequency is extraordinary. It is unclear what the cause of death could be, and it cannot be determined due to the extent the whales are decomposed. Researchers believe that it’s due to biological reasons. Young whales and mothers are especially vulnerable shortly after birth. They do not exclude the possibility that the construction of the windpark near the Darss peninsula  may have been a factor.
The windpark was just completed and is operated by energy giant EnBW.

This video link here is an animation of how the windpark was constructed. The video shows how huge mono-piles with a wall thickness of 100 mm are pounded into the seabed. That certainly cannot be very pleasant for any marine wildlife nearby, and certainly represents a major disturbance of habitat.
The issue of ramming huge piles into the seabed is becoming increasingly controversial in the installation of offshore windparks.
According to the Director of the German Marine Museum in Stralsund, Harald Benke, in this n-tv report here:
Whales whose hearing is disrupted or permanently damaged by noise are basically sentenced to death because they are no longer able to orient themselves.
And according to Kristin Blasche of the Federal Ministry For Maritime Shipping And Hydrography:
It has been determined that during pile driving work for offshore windparks – when the foundation is anchored to the seabed – extremely intense shock waves are produced under water.

Share this...FacebookTwitter35 scientists from 12 countries led by the Leibniz Institute for Ocean Sciences (IFM-GEOMAR) studied for 6 weeks the effects that increasing CO2 concentrations would have on life in the sea. Read here (German).Human emissions of CO2 lead to higher concentrations in sea water and thus lower its pH value. The study is led by marine biologist Prof. Dr. Ulf Riebesell, who explains:
This phenomenon can lead to drastic changes in maritime life systems. Calcium forming organisms like shellfish, snails and microscopic plankton, which are at the base of the food chain, react sensitively to ocean acidification.
Cold water  can absorb more CO2, and so ocean acidification will occur earlier and more intensely in the Arctic than in other regions, according to the IFM-GEOMAR press release.
Scientists anchored nine 17-meter long tubes in the Kongsfjord of northwest Spitzbergen. These jumbo sized test tubes held a water column of 50 cubic meters and were subjected to various concentrations of CO2.
According to Dr. Riebesell:
We simulated conditions that we expect to see 20, 40 and 60 years in the future.

As the scientists took measurements and samples daily, they observed changes in the seawater and the enclosed life systems. The simulated ocean acidification led to unexpectedly large changes in the production activity of the plankton with considerable impacts on the release of climate-relevant gases and in turnover rates of important elements in the seawater.
The scientists took measurements and samples for 6 weeks. Every day 300 liters of water were removed from the large tubes and analysed. With over 60 measurement parameters and tens of thousands values, this will be the most comprehensive experimental data set ever taken in studying ocean acidification, according to the press release. Dr. Riebesell says:
We expect to make a great jump in the research of ocean acidification.
Currently the large tubes are now being removed from Kongsfjord. For this job, the scientists are getting assistance from Greenpeace, who have put their vessel ESPERANZA at their disposal.
Greenpeace is on expedition in the Arctic this summer to record the life systems on the sea floor of the Arctic Ocean for the first time and to continue work on glacier melt in Greenland. (Yeah right! Science by an environmental activist group – I wonder what kind of results they’ll come up with!)
The Greenpeace ESPERANZA vessel is expected to arrive in Kiel on July 22. The ship will be open to the public at the IFM-GEOMAR pier on July 24-25.
EPOCA (European Project on Ocean Acidification) started the project in May 2008. The project involves more than 100 scientists from 27 institutes from 9 countries (and Greenpeace). The project will be 4 years long and is funded by the European Commission.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSo much for settled science! With every new climate study, the science just gets more and more unsettled.
Germany’s Max Planck Institute’s latest press release is about a new paper titled:
Tracking the Evapotranspiration Cycle
Reduced evaporation from the earth’s surface despite warming of the atmosphere
to appear in Nature Journal, click here, and is titled in English: Recent decline in the global land evapotranspiration trend due to limited moisture supply
Nature, 10. October 2010; doi:10.1038/nature09396
The Max Planck Institute press release starts as follows:
The earth’s climate system is complex and is not fully understood. Up to now scientists believed that global warming would speed up evaporation and the evapotranspiration cycle. But now scientists of the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemisty in Jena, Germany have run into a huge surprise: using 250 measuring stations distributed over the earth’s surface and satellite data, scientists have determined that the worldwide trend of increased evaporation of the earth’s land surface has weakened immensely, or has even reversed between 1998 and 2008. And this despite that the earth’s atmosphere having warmed up during this time period. One possible explanation is that the scientists found that the ground, especially in southern Africa, Australia and South America, dried up increasingly, and so less moisture could evaporate. Why the land’s surface in the southern hemisphere became drier and whether this trend will continue is still unclear (Online-Version Nature, 10. October 2010).
The scientists of the Fluxnet Initiative have estimated how much moisture rises into the atmosphere. Between 1982 and 2008, 65,000 cubic kilometers of water evaporated globally each year, That’s a water amount equal to the Caspian Sea, the world’s largest lake. According to Markus Reichstein, research group leader at the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemisty in Jena and coordinator of the study:
For the first time our data shows how evaporation has changed during this time period.
First the amount of water evaporating from the global land area rose steadily by 120 cubic kilometers until 1997. But then the trend weakened significantly thereafter. According to Martin Jung, who evaluated the data at Max Planck Institute in Jena:



<!--
google_ad_client = ""ca-pub-3545577860068042"";
/* neu test */
google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




That the temperature increased slightly while the rate of increased evaporation weakened was very surprising. After all, warmer air is known to have the capability to absorb more moisture.
Climate scientists thought up to now that a warmer earth would evaporate more water. However, this appears to be limited regionally. Especially in Australia, East Africa and South America the exact opposite occurred between 1998 and 2008. There, much less water evaporated. This decrease was not able to offset the increase occurring in China and India.
The scientists believe that ground in the southern continents has become more dried out, and thus does not evaporate as much water. Jung warns explicitly against concluding that this is a clear sign of climate change: most probably it has to do with a natural fluctuation that cannot yet be explained.
Dr Reichstein says that the trend must be observed for a longer period and that ENSO cycles may play a role.
According to Nature Journal:
Whether the changing behaviour of evapotranspiration is representative of natural climate variability or reflects a more permanent reorganization of the land water cycle is a key question for earth system science.
The scientists are concerned that drier land in the southern hemisphere could lead to reduced photosynthesis, and thus more CO2 in the atmosphere, and thus more warming. But there is still a lot of scientific that needs to be done to understand what is going on.
Future measuremnts will tell us more, says Reichstein.
——————————————————————————————————
Conclusion: Obviously the models used up to now for predicting future climate have had no semblance to what is actually going on out in the field. They’re not even close. The scientists of the prestigious Max Planck Institute are very surprised by the findings. So much is still unknown about how the climate works.

"Proposals to replace the EU’s strong environmental protections after Brexit “fall woefully short”, according to a highly critical report from a cross-party committee of MPs. The environment secretary, Michael Gove, said in December that the UK’s environmental standards would be enhanced after Brexit. But the MPs’ report said the proposals “severely downgrade” the environmental principles that underpin current EU rules.  It said the new Office for Environmental Protection (OEP), proposed as a replacement for the EU’s enforcement mechanisms, lacks independence from Gove’s office and has limited powers. The report from the environmental audit committee also criticises planned exclusions from environmental rules, which one expert called “absurd”. Most of the laws that protect the UK’s air and water from pollution and its nature from destruction come from the EU. These allow the government to be sued and fined if laws are broken – for example, ministers have lost three times in court over illegal levels of dirty air. Mary Creagh, the chair of the EAC, said: “If we want to be a world leader in environmental protection, we need a world-leading body to protect it. “The government promised to create a new body that would go beyond the standards set by the EU. The bill, so far, falls woefully short of this vision. “The draft bill means that if we leave the EU, we will have weaker environmental principles, less monitoring and weaker enforcement, and no threat of fines to force government action.” The MPs said: “Urgent action is needed to plug gaps in environmental protection post-Brexit.” The report said the OEP must be independent and “free to criticise the government and hold it to account”. But evidence from the National Audit Office said the OEP’s independence was at risk because it would be funded by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and its chair would be appointed by the environment secretary. “The environmental principles which guide and inform EU legislation and policy have been severely downgraded by the proposals in the bill,” the report said. “They are [also] subject to a number of exclusions and to the veto of the secretary of state.” The exclusions include policies relating to taxation, the armed forces – which are large landowners – and “any other matter specified in regulations made by the secretary of state”. William Wilson, a barrister and environmental lawyer, told the EAC the exclusions were “absurd”. Taxation is important in embedding the “polluter pays” principle across government and preventing environmental harm, said Emma Howard Boyd, the chair of the Environment Agency, in her evidence to the EAC. The report also found the enforcement of cuts in carbon emissions to fight climate change “has been deliberately excluded from the scope of the OEP”, an omission Creagh called shocking. Enforcement by the OEP is also limited to whether rules were followed, not whether environmental targets have actually been met, the MPs said, weakening the power currently held by the European commission. The Guardian has requested a response from Defra. On Tuesday, Gove attended a speech to MPs given by Great Thunberg, the Swedish teenager whose solo school strike for climate change action has inspired a global movement. Gove said: “Your voice – still, calm and clear – is like the voice of our conscience. When I listened to you, I felt great admiration, but also responsibility and guilt. “I am of your parents’ generation, and I recognise that we haven’t done nearly enough to address climate change and the broader environmental crisis that we helped to create.”"

"Short answer: no.  As reported on page one of the Australian on Wednesday, the Coalition says the country’s largest companies would face a combined bill of up to $26bn under Labor’s 2030 climate target (a 45% cut in emissions below 2005 levels). It says it will “strangle growth” and is effectively a carbon tax. Among those claimed to be in the gun were the energy giant Chevron (allegedly facing a carbon bill of up to $1.6bn), the aluminium producer Alcoa ($867m) and BlueScope steel ($890m). Woolworths was said to face a $77m bill, potentially pushing up food prices. Similar stories appeared in News Corp papers across the country based on short spreadsheets and background material provided by the Coalition. Versions of it, yes. Headlines have claimed Labor’s climate policies could cost anywhere between $25bn and $60bn. Those estimates were dismissed by some of the researchers whose work the articles cited. They spring from changes Labor plans to make to a scheme known as the safeguard mechanism, which was set up by Greg Hunt as part of Tony Abbott’s Direct Action climate policy. Big polluting industrial sites that emit more than 100,000 tonnes each now get a limit on how much carbon pollution they can release. The limit is known as a baseline. There is no cost on the businesses if they stay within their baseline but, if they exceed it, they must buy an emissions offset – a carbon credit – for every tonne they go over it. Hunt implied that baselines would be reduced after 2020 to cut emissions but the Coalition doesn’t talk about that now. Instead, companies have been allowed to increase their baselines and, in most cases, pollute without penalty. Labor says it would expand the safeguard mechanism so it also covered smaller industrial sites – those that emit more than 25,000 tonnes. It would also reduce pollution limits over time, as Hunt intended. To stay within their baseline, industrial sites would either have to cut emissions on site or pay for offsets for every tonne they go over their limit. Conversely, businesses that emitted less than their baseline would earn free carbon credits they could sell – a reward for reducing pollution. There are questions about Labor’s approach that are yet to be answered – how rapidly it would require industrial sites to cut emissions over the next 11 years, for instance – but the Coalition has based its analysis on assumptions that have little to do with how the scheme would operate in the real world. Crucially, it seems to have assumed that businesses under the mechanism would not cut pollution. The analysis seems to works on the idea they would just pay for international offsets to meet their obligations. The Coalition has used two reports to assume these offsets would cost between $62 and about $100 a tonne by 2030 on an international market. That market does not now exist. (There are a handful of carbon markets that are mostly not linked.) For starters, it not yet clear what sort of offsets will be available to businesses under Labor’s version of the safeguard mechanism. The Coalition assumes a flood of international offsets, but Labor’s policy says it would allow only limited use of credits from overseas. Australia has its own carbon offsets market, where credits sell for about $16 a tonne. The market is small owing to limited demand, reflecting that businesses are mostly allowed to pollute without penalty. Most of the offsets are created through native vegetation projects and paid for by taxpayers via the $2.55bn emissions reduction fund. Labor plans to expand it and have polluters pay for the offsets. Internationally, an obvious market Australia could link to is the European emissions trading scheme, where the carbon price is now about $43 a tonne. That’s unlikely to be appealing to business in the short term. Other offset markets may develop but it is also likely it will be cheaper to cut emissions or buy local offsets rather than pay for credits from overseas, especially in the early years. Analysts at RepuTex found the cost of emissions cuts should line up with the relatively cheap Australian carbon market – less than $20 a tonne – and that a 45% emissions target would push down wholesale electricity prices. An analysis by Citigroup reportedly found that total costs for major emitters under Labor’s scheme were likely to rise by less than 1% a year from 2020 to 2030. It is also worth noting that it is highly unlikely Labor would require every industrial site under the safeguard mechanism to cut emissions by 45%. It says it would provide “tailored treatment” for trade-exposed big polluters such as aluminium, steel and liquefied natural gas. It implies they would be shielded from some of the cost if their competitors overseas did not face a similar regulation. Both. While notable industrial players have repeatedly obstructed attempts to introduce bipartisan climate policy, many companies have been planning for a shift to a low-carbon world for a while. Some multinationals including Rio Tinto have contingencies for future carbon prices of up $140 a tonne built into their decision making. Clean technology is getting cheaper. Some businesses under the safeguard mechanism would use offsets but others are investing or planning to invest in renewable energy and energy efficiency. Not explicitly, but it is worth asking. One of the odd things about the Coalition’s analysis is that it is partly based on a World Bank-backed study that found global carbon prices in 2030 would need to be between US$50 and US$100 to limit global warming to two degrees. But it doesn’t acknowledge that the Coalition has also committed to the two degrees goal (and more) by signing the Paris agreement. Should we also assume the equivalent of up to a US$100 carbon price under Coalition policies? Or is it walking away from its commitment to Paris? Media reporting often focuses on the cost of climate policy while ignoring the other side of the equation – the cost of doing nothing. Several studies have suggested it is significant. A paper in the journal Nature estimated warming of between two and a half and three degrees could cut per-capita economic output by between 15% and 25% this century. Four degrees would be worse again. This sort of scenario is increasingly being considered and factored in by insurers and long-term investors, who say they want action to avoid it. Whether political leaders and newspaper editors are listening is another question."
"Kevin Patterson was delighted when he saw the salmon suddenly jump from the Tweed. Moments later, it happened again and then once more. Such sightings have become remarkably rare. “We’ve got to the stage where we say: ‘Bloody hell, I saw a salmon,’” he said. “That’s a good-sized fish.” Patterson has been a ghillie, a Gaelic term for attendant, on this mile-long stretch of the Tweed for nearly 30 years. He gives expert advice to his anglers, and this is one of the worst seasons in living memory. The Atlantic salmon that once crowded the water have disappeared. It is a similar picture across Scotland’s famous salmon fishing rivers, including the Spey and the Dee. Earlier this week, official figures showed that 2018 was the worst year on record for wild salmon numbers, when just 37,000 were caught across the country. When Patterson first took over the Tweedswood beat near Melrose, about 40 fish would be caught in the spring season. In 1995, three anglers landed 19 in one session. So far this spring, his clients have caught two. Salmon numbers have “gone off a cliff”, he said. He now feels sorry for his clients. “They just want to come here and enjoy their fishing. Anglers aren’t expecting 10 fish. They just want one; two would be mega. But it’s just not happening.” If one is caught, he immediately puts it on Instagram, to alert other anglers his clients have had some luck. The low numbers means ghillies must compete hard to attract clients. Times have changed. Now the emphasis for him and his colleagues on the Tweed is not on numbers of salmon, but a nice day out for the clients. His wood-lined cabin, tucked under the steep, wood-lined banks of the Tweed valley a few hundred metres from Trimontium, the largest Roman army camp remains in Scotland, overlooks the placid, slow-running waters. A heron flaps lazily along the opposite bank before landing to fix its eyes on the river. A brown trout breaks the surface. Patterson said before anglers were banned under a voluntary code from killing their catch to conserve numbers, spring salmon, the youngsters returning for the first time to their home river, were the most prized. Rich in omega 3 fish oil, they have a bright red flesh and a fine flavour. “These are the best fish you can eat, a wild Scottish salmon – and what price can you put on it, because you’re not allowed to kill one. They are the Rolls-Royce of salmon. You don’t get anything better than what’s in there,” he said. The Tweed had its highest catch in recent history in 2010, when 23,000 were caught. Patterson describes that as a freak year but, on average, 10,000 to 15,000 are caught every year. Since 2014, those numbers have halved. Last year, 5,510 were caught. The collapse in salmon numbers means fewer anglers are turning up. So the prices charged for a day’s fishing have been slashed up and down the Tweed. Patterson charges as little as £40; he once charged £140 at this time of year. The most sought-after sites have cut prices by 50% down to a few hundred pounds a day. Local hotels are struggling; many beats are losing money. That economic impact is deeply worrying, said Fay Hieatt, the clerk to the River Tweed Commission, an august body set up by act of parliament in 1807 to police and conserve salmon stocks on the river and its tributaries, which straddle southern Scotland and Northumberland. In 2015, an economic impact study calculated that angling brought £24m into the Tweed region’s economy, supporting the equivalent of 520 jobs. That spending has fallen by between 50% and 60% since then, Heiatt said. The Tweed commissioners suspect natural weather and sea temperature patterns at global level are having an impact. Their records over the last 200 years show there is a 60-year cycle in salmon stocks rising and falling, linked to a meteorological phenomenon known as the North Atlantic oscillation, which affects the climate across the region. That affects food supplies for salmon out at sea, increasing competition for food with species such as mackerel, and altering water temperatures. Climate change, which is warming the sea and harming marine life, is making those pressures much more significant. Their extensive monitoring of salmon breeding suggests there has been no fall in the number of juvenile salmon leaving the Tweed. It is just that very few make it back, perhaps only 1%. “Most of the problems we’ve got are out at sea,” Heiatt said. Alan Wells, the director of Fisheries Management Scotland, says each salmon river faces different challenges, of differing severity. In the north, they come from hydro-electric dams blocking salmon migration routes; on the west coast they are hit by sea lice, parasites attracted by large commercial salmon farms in numerous sea lochs; inland, pollution from farms affects water quality. He said salmon numbers across northern Europe were plunging: the rest of the UK, Ireland and Norway were affected too. But in Scotland there seems to be a lack of coherent action by government agencies, none of which have over-arching responsibility for Atlantic salmon. Protecting their stocks needs to be a national priority, Wells said. “The driver has to be about conserving a species absolutely iconic to Scotland.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn Germany, reporting on the Richard Curtis-produced 1010 No Pressure child-slaughter clip has been virtually off the radar.
Still, NoTricksZone reader Ike has found a short blurb at the online Suedeutsche Zeitung (South German News) publication called jetzt.de, which found the clip: ‘hilarious’.
The blurb was written by someone who goes by the name okkasionalsozialist and is titled:
What’s in Store For Enviro-Skeptics: ‘No Pressure’
Keep in mind that the Sueddeutsche Zeitung is a leading center-left national daily in Germany. But judging by what it feels is fit to print, I’d say it’s slipping back toward the bottom of the gutter.
Here’s what okkasionalsozialist of the Sueddeutche Zeitung jetzt.de says about the 10:10 clip:
10:10 is a funny British campaign that motivates individuals and organizations of every type to reduce their CO2 emissions. To make their educational intent more clear, they had Richard Curtis produce a hilarious little film, which in my opinion is really a bit expressive though.
Allegedly too many viewers misunderstood the clip, and so it was taken down, at least officially, by 1010.
So there you have it. Appalled viewers are simply not sophisticated enough to understand what the exploding kids who chose to dissent really means.

Okay, some will say that jetzt.de is only a sub-publication of the Sueddeutsche Zeitung, and so the Sueddeutsche Zeitung is not really responsible for the content – right?
Wrong.
At the jetzt.de website, it is specifically written that the Sueddeuteche Zeitung is responsbile for content.
Obviously the Sueddeutsche Zeitung is not at all offended by the smut, and offered no words to condemn it.

"If only the Daily Express was right. That is not a sentence I ever expected to type. “Extinction Rebellion protests have WORKED as MPs succumb to calls for change”, bellowed the rightwing rag. Alas, the government has not capitulated to demands to declare a climate emergency, let alone to decarbonise the British economy by 2025. But Extinction Rebellion has retaught a lesson every generation must learn: that civil disobedience works. Amid the spluttering of obnoxious news presenters, it has forced the existential threat of climate change on to the airwaves and into newsprint. But as this phase of protest winds down, the demands must radicalise. With capitalism itself rightly being challenged, the focus must shift to the fossil fuel companies and the banks. As long as they remain under private ownership on a global scale, humanity’s future will be threatened.  Standard Oil’s monopoly is broken up by the US supreme court. The trust which had been set up by John D Rockefeller in 1882, had gained control of nearly 90% of US oil production. The US joins the first world war and supplies allied forces with oil. President Woodrow Wilson appoints multiple oil executives to war-effort committees and nationalises the railways. Brought together by the war, oil executives form a trade body, the American Petroleum Institute (API) in 1919. Ten years later, another trade association, the Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA) is formed to represent smaller companies. During the second world war, the US government worked closely with the oil industry, putting a federal  investigation into its monopolistic practices on hold. A peacetime version of a wartime committee becomes the National Petroleum Council, an advisory committee that exists today. API hosts renowned nuclear physicist Edward Teller at a conference at Columbia University, where he warns of impending global warming. Lyndon B Johnson is the first US president to publicly acknowledge climate change, calling it a serious global threat during a speech. Scientists at the Stanford Research Institute deliver reports to API, warning of global warming induced by CO2 emissions from fossil fuels. President Nixon signs an executive order creating the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Exxon starts an internal climate research programme on carbon dioxide. The EPA relaxes the standard for ozone, which contributes to smog. The move angers environmentalists and industry alike. API sues the agency. Nasa scientist James E Hansen testifies before Congress that the planet is warming because of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from fossil fuels. The Kyoto protocol treaty is signed. Countries pledge to reduce greenhouse gases and recognise the scientific consensus that global warming is occurring and is likely caused by fossil fuel emissions. Some 195 countries back the Paris climate agreement, pledging efforts to reduce emissions and curb global warming. President Trump announces the US exit from the Paris climate agreement, citing industry-hired economists that call the accord a bad deal for US businesses. Supporting the move is Scott Pruitt, a climate-change sceptic, who Trump appointed to head the EPA. Take ExxonMobil, which plans to pump an astonishing 25% more oil and gas in 2025 than it did in 2017. As that well-known bastion of eco-socialism, the Economist, puts it: “If the rest of the industry pursues even modest growth, the consequence for the climate could be disastrous,” adding that “the market cannot solve climate change by itself”. According to the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, if we wish to prevent global temperatures rising by more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels – beyond which climate disasters multiply – then oil and gas production has to fall by 20% by 2030, and 55% by 2050. However, the economic self-interest and political power of the fossil fuel industry is deliberately sabotaging this goal. Last year, the industry spent an astonishing $124,837,199 on lobbying politicians in the US. During the 2016 elections, the industry spent over $100m on campaign contributions; recent top donors include the Koch brothers, Chevron and ExxonMobil. This is not wasted money, far from it. In the neoliberal era, rolling back the state has in practice meant withdrawing state support and social security for the majority, but continuing vast subsidies for vested interests. One recent study found that worldwide fossil fuel subsidies amounted to $4.9tn in 2013. It estimated that eliminating those subsidies would have cut global carbon emissions by 21% and air pollution deaths by over half.  The tentacles of Big Fossil reach further into the political elite: in the US and Europe, there is a revolving door between government and public sector on the one hand, and fossil fuel companies on the other, with lucrative jobs in these Earth-destroying industries on offer for compliant politicians and civil servants. As Bill McKibben – one of the most prominent US environmentalists – tells me, the primary challenge now is not having the means but the will. “We have the tech we need,” he explains. “The work of engineers over the last decade in lowering the costs of solar and wind panels is quite remarkable. We can do what we need to do, or much of it. The problem that remains is fighting the political power of the fossil fuel industries. If we can do that, we can proceed quickly.” Then there are the banks. Since the Paris climate agreement on tackling climate change was signed in 2016, 33 global banks – led by big US financial institutions such as JP Morgan Chase – have provided $1.9tn in finance to the fossil fuel industry. HSBC is funding the expansion of coal plants in Bangladesh, Indonesia and Vietnam; while Barclays bank has shelled out $85bn of financing for fossil fuels since 2015 alone.  So long as these sectors remain in private hands, they will continue to place short-term profit for elite investors ahead of the future of the planet and continued existence of humanity. They must be brought under public ownership, with a legal mandate to “green” the economy. One suggestion by the Next System Project is that the US government could create a community ownership of power administration, modelled on Roosevelt-era New Deal agencies. It would grant legal authority and funding mechanisms to buy back the energy grid and take over energy utilities. But there are more radical solutions. Since the crash, quantitative easing (QE) has been used extensively, with central banks creating money to buy bonds from financial institutions. Why not use QE to buy a controlling stake in the fossil fuel companies? It has been estimated that the US has spent nearly $6tn on its post-9/11 wars. If it has the resources to engage in catastrophic wars, could it not afford to pay a small fraction of that sum to help save the planet from destruction? The same goes for the banks – except rather than nationalising the risks and privatising the profit, as the state did in 2008, they should this time be brought under democratic, accountable public control. These proposals will undoubtedly be dismissed as extreme, but they are nowhere near as extreme as the fate awaiting humanity. According to the IPCC, we must cut global emissions by 45% by 2030 – little over a decade away – compared to 2010 levels to meet the 1.5C target. If not, the droughts and floods will come, the crops will fail, the seas will rise, the ice will melt, the heatwaves and extreme weather will kill and millions will be forced to flee their homes. What do we value more: an economic system which privileges profit above all other considerations, or the continued existence of human civilisation as we recognise it? A reckoning is coming. • Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist"
"The last week has seen environmental activist Greta Thunberg meet with MPs in London, Extinction Rebellion disrupt cities and the BBC air David Attenborough’s rousing Climate Change: The Facts documentary. It feels like we’ve reached a pivotal moment in the climate movement. Readers tell us how it has affected them.  Extinction Rebellion, the School Strike for Climate and Greta Thunberg have changed my understanding of the climate issue by highlighting to me – in a way I didn’t realise before – the urgency of the problem facing us. I have been extremely concerned about the future of our planet in a way I haven’t felt before. While I once imagined having children in the future, I’ve come to realise that may not be possible anymore. I did not fully grasp how quickly we need to act to save the planet – I had a false sense that someone, politicians, scientists, billionaire philanthropists, would swoop in and sort it out before it is too late. Extinction Rebellion and Greta Thunberg have really highlighted that this is not the case. Politicians will not do anything until the public starts caring about these issues and voting in line with them – both in elections and with their pockets.Mairi Jeffery, 24, London This movement has given me great hope. I have felt for a long time that it was almost impossible to talk about the climate emergency; the government has acted so indifferently and there has been such little focus in the media that it seemed difficult to believe we are rapidly approaching a crisis. The protests give the issue a tangible urgency in a way that the scientific reports have struggled. For the first time, my friends and family are talking about the issue without me raising it. This movement has shown me that ordinary people can mobilise effectively and act when our government is failing us.Anna, 31, London I’ve followed the whole climate movement, and I try as best I can to understand all aspects of climate change and how to stop, tax or regulate it. I really hope that things change, but I feel the movement needs to find a way to talk to the normal working-class people I work with. There’s a thousand people working in the same warehouse as me, and I haven’t heard more than one say anything about climate change, and if they have it’s been to make jokes about the people down in London. I really support the people who went to make a huge show down there, to get the media to pay attention, but we need all classes of people to get this, and fast. I do believe that the vast majority will be behind the changes we need to make, but only if they know what we’re up against. They need to be mobilised, not scared.Stephen, 46, Newcastle-under-Lyme I have been campaigning for environmental issues and climate change for almost three years – since I was 12 years old. I have always felt isolated and actually, quite alone. If the movement has given me anything it’s solidarity and hope. It has also allowed me to really feel and express the fear I kept inside. It also made me want to shout louder and become more active. I have been striking from school and I feel empowered – no longer alone but with 1 million children around the world. I feel quite terrified of the future. I think the world adults are presiding over now will be unimaginably different by the time I’m in my 30s. I also feel hope because there is such a surge in involvement and the brave demands are finally being listened to. I thank Extinction Rebellion and Greta Thunberg, you have energised and inspired us to be brave and fearless.Dara McAnulty, 15, naturalist, conservationist and activist, Northern Ireland  I fully support the goal of raising the issue of climate change (and other pressing environmental issues) but Extinction Rebellion’s way is not the way.  There has been some attempt to show that it’s not just a middle-class indulgence but that has only been demonstrated to a limited effect. The alienation of the climate change issue by the campaign has excluded a huge proportion of the UK population, which is potentially very damaging. There’s a very real risk that the smug message the campaign gives out could have a similar effect on the UK as Brexit has. I’m a firm Remainer and environmentalist, but I’m deeply worried that XR has hijacked the issue of climate change to the detriment of any real and proper progress, and we’ll all suffer as a result of that. Tribalism and band waggon-hopping is not an attractive social development.Anonymous, environmental lawyer, UK The movement has been intensely irritating, and the irritations have been self-defeating. I agree with the principle of free speech etc, however, that free speech should not come at the expense of someone else’s rights. So blocking bridges with plastic tents fails to support the reasonably sound motives of the majority of the participants. The protests went on far longer than necessary. It has been damaging to any chance of addressing the fundamental issues. High profile people, like Sir David [Attenborough], ranting on, has consistently ducked the biggest issue: there are too many humans on this planet. I have only heard one pundit in the last five years ever mention population control. If the human population stops growing (or shrinks) the problems of pollution etc also reduce.  The repeated poor and often flawed arguments mean that I now find the environmental movement tedious.David Helliwell, 60, retired engineer, Cambridge For years I have felt quite powerless about the issue of climate change. It has been self-evident for at least three decades, but the political and economic systems of the world are quite unwilling to acknowledge the issue. I have felt fed up, depressed and unable to effect any change to the system.  Suddenly with Greta Thunberg there has been a significant shift and young people have realised that the leaders are not doing enough to address the climate issue. Prior to Easter 2019 I was a bit anxious about Extinction Rebellion and was concerned it might be a cover for anarchists and far-left socialists. But this is different.  I do now believe that it will be possible to convince the political and economic leaders to make the changes required to prevent the crisis.Andrew Mottram, 65, former priest, Herefordshire Throughout my formal education years, and then as an adult, I have always understood the need to protect our planet and its diversity, and have taken steps to do my bit. The recent demonstrations have not changed my views on climate change. The demonstrators do not represent me. None of us are ever guaranteed a future. We have the choice to be forces for good or bad – to be selfish or sharing in all that we do. We can, therefore, help to shape a more positive future for everyone, but there will always be those who feel they deserve more at any level.Anonymous, 58, beekeeper, UK My understanding of the science was sound but the means of expressing it in general conversation was helped enormously by the impact that the protests have demonstrated in TV news programmes. The future is less threatening than it was before the movement was formed. There’s now a real chance that we will be able to face it with concrete proposals for realistic change to prevent catastrophe.Allan Sharman, 75, Cockermouth, Cumbria I am heavily involved in organising the Birmingham Youth Strike for Climate events which has made me aware of the power behind our voices and our actions. Although I would personally not carry out as extreme actions as Extinction Rebellion, like causing £6,000 worth of damage to Shell headquarters, I have so much appreciation for what they are doing: bringing media attention to the issue and pressuring the government to take action. The future will become more hopeful once I feel that as an individual I have done as much as I can to protect my future, and also that the government is actively doing as much as they can.Georgina Nott, 15, Birmingham  "

"A Banksy collector and expert believes a mural that appeared at Extinction Rebellion’s Marble Arch base overnight is an authentic piece by the Bristolian street artist. John Brandler, who owns a dozen pieces by Banksy is convinced the artwork – which features the slogan “From this moment despair ends and tactics begin” next to a young girl sitting on the ground holding an Extinction Rebellion logo – is an original because of its execution and theme.  The art dealer and gallerist said: “I’m convinced about the one in London for two reasons: it’s a topic that he would support, and it’s a continuation of the Port Talbot piece that appeared in December 2018. “The name in the corner is not important, the signature is the work. And this is a Banksy. It’s a wonderful statement and a beautiful piece.” The work appeared at the site which had been occupied by climate activists since protests began in the capital almost two weeks ago. A spokesperson for Westminster council confirmed the work was being investigated but had not been authenticated yet. “We’re aware of the possible Banksy which appeared in Marble Arch overnight. Our officers are looking into this,” he said. Banksy has not confirmed whether the painting is legitimate, and his press team did not respond to a request for comment. Brandler said the Marble Arch piece was much more convincing than another possible Banksy that appeared on a primary school wall in Maidstone over the Easter holidays. “There was a suspected Banksy on a school in Kent, but it was obviously not one,” he said. “‘If we don’t act now, what happens?’ That’s what this little girl is saying. Now is the disaster; now is the time to act. [The Marble Arch piece] is similar to the boy with the flag during the 2012 Olympics. “The only thing I don’t like is that the top of the girl’s head is the same height as the concrete block. Visually, it jars.”"
"Bill McKibben is right to believe in humans (To stop global catastrophe, we must believe in humans again, 23 April). After all, in the blink of an evolutionary eye we have gone from being able to stand upright to being able to fly off our planet, from believing that the horizon was the end of the earth to being able to peer into deep space-time, from understanding how our bodies work to being on the verge of being able to create life itself. We love to compete and we love to collaborate, often combining both activities in the name of sport. We are inherently social and have formed our immensely complex civilisation on the basis of agreeing what is “socially acceptable” and enshrining that with laws and rules. With climate change, where we have gone astray is failing to update those laws and rules to cope with our burgeoning population, especially in our relationship with nature and the functioning of our economy.  There are two actions we could take that would transform our chances of surviving into the future. The first would be to enact a law of ecocide – the death of whose principal proponent was sadly reported in the same issue (Polly Higgins, tireless advocate for ecocide law, dies aged 50, 23 April). And the second would be to change the rules of accounting so that all companies using natural resources had to reinvest, say, 2% of their revenues in the restoration and repair of the natural environment. In Extinction Rebellion and the UK Student Climate Network, we are seeing the emergence of social acceptance that it is wrong to not just allow but to actively reward the destruction of our future. We now need to press for these rule changes that would bring our destructive economy under control.Harold ForbesWareham, Dorset • Greta Thunberg hits the nail on the head in calling for more support from the older generation and for the unions to get more active in tackling climate change (Activist lends support to general strike for the climate, 23 April). A crucial part of generating this support is to recognise that any effective response to the climate threat will mean a massive green infrastructure programme which will generate jobs in every constituency. This would include a labour-intensive upgrading of the energy efficiency of every building countrywide, plus the upgrading of local transport systems and recycling provision. To get support for this approach not only from older people, but also more conservative ones, it will be imperative to emphasise the advantages for small and medium-sized businesses, as well as the investment and savings opportunities involved in addressing climate change. Add to this the concerns of these sectors of society about the future of their children and grandchildren, and this approach should result in a broader range of support for a net zero-carbon future. As such it should appeal to all political parties and so help ensure the urgent demands of Thunberg and Extinction Rebellion can be more swiftly met. Colin HinesConvener, UK Green New Deal Group  • While I applaud the awareness being raised by Extinction Rebellion campaigners, I object to Gaby Hinsliff saying “past generations were oblivious” (Opinion, 20 April). I am 73 and was brought up just after the war. We had no plastic bags and walked to the shops with our own bags. We got 2d on returned glass bottles. We walked to school. We beat cakes with a wooden spoon. We dried our clothes on the line. There was no bubble wrap – we used scrunched-up newspapers for fragile things and also for takeaway fish and chips. We pushed lawnmowers and we didn’t drive to the gym to get our exercise. I could go on! As soon as new products came in, such as plastic and labour-saving electrical goods, some of us realised they were polluting and led to tremendous waste, so I don’t feel our postwar generation should be held entirely responsible for our present appalling climate problems and ocean pollution.Elizabeth EarlChard, Somerset • We are experiencing two protest movements – Extinction Rebellion and Brexit – which might seem to be diametrically opposed. But to what extent do they reflect a shared understanding – that, at least for rich and ageing societies, the costs of a growing GDP are simply too high? For some those costs are represented by the need for an immigrant workforce; for others they are the destruction of the environment. But both movements can be seen as a call for deceleration – a call that traditional politicians simply do not have the language to meet. The empty branding that characterises our main political parties no longer reflects any significant values; the chasms within those parties make that abundantly clear. The response to both these protests – however different they appear – will require a new narrative of interdependence between citizens, particularly between young and old; we need a revised vocabulary to enable new kinds of conversation. Charlotte RouechéLondon • I write in response to letters published on 20 April. I can assure Jean Corston that many Extinction Rebellion members go far beyond using a green energy supplier. We can also tell her that individuals’ energy suppliers don’t count for much if your government’s energy policy is fracking and nuclear power stations. Yes, Andy Brown, most protesters are white but, as I said to a fellow protester, if I were a young black man I would not want to risk being arrested for fear of how a historically institutionally racist judiciary and job market might treat me. Incidentally, the only people to verbally abuse me were white; the many black and non-British people who stopped to talk were all very supportive. Finally, I can tell Colin Baker that, apart from the initial jams last Monday, the police did an admirable job in keeping traffic flowing and minimising disruption. What will be interesting to see is the pollution records for London over the week. Many car journeys in central London are unnecessary, and if we showed some people an alternative way to travel, that can only be for the good of all of our lungs. I did not take part in acts of civil disobedience lightly, but to help protect the beautiful country, and world, that I live in – not just for my son but for future generations.Rebecca FrickerLoughton, Essex • I welcome the contributions from Mark Carney and Larry Elliott (Mark Carney’s warning on climate change is only a start, 18 April) on the role of finance and global heating, but as I returned home after five days on the bridge, what struck me most was the silence from our politicians. Perhaps I was too busy handing out sunscreen or enjoying the atmosphere and music. Or is it because our government has nothing to say on anything? Paradigm shifts in public attitudes and even revolutions occur when the right time comes. Extinction Rebellion have, unlike our politicians, through long preparation and some luck, appeared on the scene just when our politicians’ minds have been emptied of coherent thought, and the supporting establishment (here business and the cut-to-the-bone police) has lost confidence in them.John PaynePenallt, Monmouthshire  • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

"My name is Greta Thunberg. I am 16 years old. I come from Sweden. And I speak on behalf of future generations. I know many of you don’t want to listen to us – you say we are just children. But we’re only repeating the message of the united climate science. Many of you appear concerned that we are wasting valuable lesson time, but I assure you we will go back to school the moment you start listening to science and give us a future. Is that really too much to ask? In the year 2030 I will be 26 years old. My little sister Beata will be 23. Just like many of your own children or grandchildren. That is a great age, we have been told. When you have all of your life ahead of you. But I am not so sure it will be that great for us. I was fortunate to be born in a time and place where everyone told us to dream big; I could become whatever I wanted to. I could live wherever I wanted to. People like me had everything we needed and more. Things our grandparents could not even dream of. We had everything we could ever wish for and yet now we may have nothing. Now we probably don’t even have a future any more. Because that future was sold so that a small number of people could make unimaginable amounts of money. It was stolen from us every time you said that the sky was the limit, and that you only live once. You lied to us. You gave us false hope. You told us that the future was something to look forward to. And the saddest thing is that most children are not even aware of the fate that awaits us. We will not understand it until it’s too late. And yet we are the lucky ones. Those who will be affected the hardest are already suffering the consequences. But their voices are not heard. Is my microphone on? Can you hear me? Around the year 2030, 10 years 252 days and 10 hours away from now, we will be in a position where we set off an irreversible chain reaction beyond human control, that will most likely lead to the end of our civilisation as we know it. That is unless in that time, permanent and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society have taken place, including a reduction of CO2 emissions by at least 50%. And please note that these calculations are depending on inventions that have not yet been invented at scale, inventions that are supposed to clear the atmosphere of astronomical amounts of carbon dioxide. Furthermore, these calculations do not include unforeseen tipping points and feedback loops like the extremely powerful methane gas escaping from rapidly thawing arctic permafrost. Nor do these scientific calculations include already locked-in warming hidden by toxic air pollution. Nor the aspect of equity – or climate justice – clearly stated throughout the Paris agreement, which is absolutely necessary to make it work on a global scale. We must also bear in mind that these are just calculations. Estimations. That means that these “points of no return” may occur a bit sooner or later than 2030. No one can know for sure. We can, however, be certain that they will occur approximately in these timeframes, because these calculations are not opinions or wild guesses. These projections are backed up by scientific facts, concluded by all nations through the IPCC. Nearly every single major national scientific body around the world unreservedly supports the work and findings of the IPCC. Did you hear what I just said? Is my English OK? Is the microphone on? Because I’m beginning to wonder. During the last six months I have travelled around Europe for hundreds of hours in trains, electric cars and buses, repeating these life-changing words over and over again. But no one seems to be talking about it, and nothing has changed. In fact, the emissions are still rising. When I have been travelling around to speak in different countries, I am always offered help to write about the specific climate policies in specific countries. But that is not really necessary. Because the basic problem is the same everywhere. And the basic problem is that basically nothing is being done to halt – or even slow – climate and ecological breakdown, despite all the beautiful words and promises. The UK is, however, very special. Not only for its mind-blowing historical carbon debt, but also for its current, very creative, carbon accounting. Since 1990 the UK has achieved a 37% reduction of its territorial CO2 emissions, according to the Global Carbon Project. And that does sound very impressive. But these numbers do not include emissions from aviation, shipping and those associated with imports and exports. If these numbers are included the reduction is around 10% since 1990 – or an an average of 0.4% a year, according to Tyndall Manchester.And the main reason for this reduction is not a consequence of climate policies, but rather a 2001 EU directive on air quality that essentially forced the UK to close down its very old and extremely dirty coal power plants and replace them with less dirty gas power stations. And switching from one disastrous energy source to a slightly less disastrous one will of course result in a lowering of emissions. But perhaps the most dangerous misconception about the climate crisis is that we have to “lower” our emissions. Because that is far from enough. Our emissions have to stop if we are to stay below 1.5-2C of warming. The “lowering of emissions” is of course necessary but it is only the beginning of a fast process that must lead to a stop within a couple of decades, or less. And by “stop” I mean net zero – and then quickly on to negative figures. That rules out most of today’s politics. The fact that we are speaking of “lowering” instead of “stopping” emissions is perhaps the greatest force behind the continuing business as usual. The UK’s active current support of new exploitation of fossil fuels – for example, the UK shale gas fracking industry, the expansion of its North Sea oil and gas fields, the expansion of airports as well as the planning permission for a brand new coal mine – is beyond absurd. This ongoing irresponsible behaviour will no doubt be remembered in history as one of the greatest failures of humankind. People always tell me and the other millions of school strikers that we should be proud of ourselves for what we have accomplished. But the only thing that we need to look at is the emission curve. And I’m sorry, but it’s still rising. That curve is the only thing we should look at. Every time we make a decision we should ask ourselves; how will this decision affect that curve? We should no longer measure our wealth and success in the graph that shows economic growth, but in the curve that shows the emissions of greenhouse gases. We should no longer only ask: “Have we got enough money to go through with this?” but also: “Have we got enough of the carbon budget to spare to go through with this?” That should and must become the centre of our new currency. Many people say that we don’t have any solutions to the climate crisis. And they are right. Because how could we? How do you “solve” the greatest crisis that humanity has ever faced? How do you “solve” a war? How do you “solve” going to the moon for the first time? How do you “solve” inventing new inventions? The climate crisis is both the easiest and the hardest issue we have ever faced. The easiest because we know what we must do. We must stop the emissions of greenhouse gases. The hardest because our current economics are still totally dependent on burning fossil fuels, and thereby destroying ecosystems in order to create everlasting economic growth. “So, exactly how do we solve that?” you ask us – the schoolchildren striking for the climate. And we say: “No one knows for sure. But we have to stop burning fossil fuels and restore nature and many other things that we may not have quite figured out yet.” Then you say: “That’s not an answer!” So we say: “We have to start treating the crisis like a crisis – and act even if we don’t have all the solutions.” “That’s still not an answer,” you say. Then we start talking about circular economy and rewilding nature and the need for a just transition. Then you don’t understand what we are talking about. We say that all those solutions needed are not known to anyone and therefore we must unite behind the science and find them together along the way. But you do not listen to that. Because those answers are for solving a crisis that most of you don’t even fully understand. Or don’t want to understand. You don’t listen to the science because you are only interested in solutions that will enable you to carry on like before. Like now. And those answers don’t exist any more. Because you did not act in time. Avoiding climate breakdown will require cathedral thinking. We must lay the foundation while we may not know exactly how to build the ceiling. Sometimes we just simply have to find a way. The moment we decide to fulfil something, we can do anything. And I’m sure that the moment we start behaving as if we were in an emergency, we can avoid climate and ecological catastrophe. Humans are very adaptable: we can still fix this. But the opportunity to do so will not last for long. We must start today. We have no more excuses. We children are not sacrificing our education and our childhood for you to tell us what you consider is politically possible in the society that you have created. We have not taken to the streets for you to take selfies with us, and tell us that you really admire what we do. We children are doing this to wake the adults up. We children are doing this for you to put your differences aside and start acting as you would in a crisis. We children are doing this because we want our hopes and dreams back. I hope my microphone was on. I hope you could all hear me."

Share this...FacebookTwitterLast week I wrote about a Russian-German temperature reconstruction from 1600 to 2000 derived from tree rings from the Kola Peninsula in northwest Russia . The paper appeared in the journal Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine Research, Vol. 41, No. 4, 2009, pp. 460–468, by Kononov, Friedrich and Boettger. 
In response, German media outlets all hollered “RAPIDLY RISING ARCTIC TEMPERATURES!”, focussing solely on one statement that temperatures have been rising since 1990. 
It’s a classic example of how a scientific study comes up with Result A, but the public ends up understanding Result Z, all thanks to sloppy and incompetent communication that exists between the two. 
The press release here  provides the following Kola temperature reconstruction graph for summertime temperatures:
Kola Peninsula tree-ring temperature reconstruction. Source: Stephan Boehme/UFZ 
Here it’s plain to see that the temperature reconstruction shows that Arctic temperatures in the Kola Peninsula have been rising since about 1670. This corresponds exceptionally well with Loehle’s 2007 reconstruction using 18 non-tree-ring proxies for the last 2000 years shown as follows: 
 
Both graphics show the Little Ice Age from 1650 to 1750, at which point a warming event ensues. Then it was generally flat from 1750 to about 1920, and then followed by another rise that took place until 1950. Then Kola tree-ring proxies show a cooling up to 1990. Since 1990 warming has occurred again, but it’s  a warming that is completely within the natural range of variation. 
The Kola reconstruction (1) agreed with an earlier reconstruction (2) done in the area, see map below.  What’s more, the Kola reconstruction (1) was compared with tree-ring reconstructions from other Arctic regions: Swedish Lapland (3), Yamal (4), and Taimyr (5).

The reconstructed summer temperatures of the last four centuries from Lapland and the Kola and Taimyr Peninsulas are similar in that all three data series display a temperature peak in the middle of the twentieth century, followed by a cooling of one or two degrees. 
Only the Yamal reconstruction differed completely, resembling the shape of a hockey stick with the blade beginning at 1900. The hockey stick is becoming an artefact of activism.
Except for the Yamal reconstruction, all tree-ring and non-tree ring reconstructions appear to agree, and so indicate no correlation between temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentration.
So what could be driving temperatures then? The authors compared the tree-ring based reconstructions with historical records of sunspots (Lean et al, 1995; Lean, 2000), and say: 
We found that over the whole investigated period fluctuations of summer air temperature reconstructed for the Khibiny Mountains in the central part of the Kola Peninsula have a good consistency (r >0.50) with changes of solar radiation (Fig. 10), especially for the low-frequency signal. 
In the paper’s conclusion we read: 
The broad similarity between this temperature construction and solar radiation indicates that solar activity is an important driver of centennial to multi-decadal trends in summer temperatures of the Kola Peninsula. 
So why did all media reports holler “RAPID TEMPERATURE INCREASE IN THE ARCTIC”. Call it complete communication incompetence by the media players between science and the public.
The Kola reconstructions show no link to atmospheric CO2 concentrations. It all started with a solid scientific paper, and but then was distorted (purposely?) by a vague press release that culminated in alarmist media headlines. 
Let’s call that press release incompetence-gate.

Lee said he experienced an ‘‘awakening” when he watched former Vice President Al Gore’s environmental documentary ‘‘An Inconvenient Truth.”
Hey – it’s a planetary emergency, a climate crisis. We have only a few years, or months even. The tipping point is here. This summer’s extremes confirm it. So action has to be taken!
Nothing is more important than saving … the Lions, Tigers, Giraffes, Elephants, Froggies, Turtles, Apes, Raccoons, Beetles, Ants, Sharks, Bears, and, of course, the Squirrels. The humans? The planet does not need humans.

"Nobody could have predicted that a Swedish teenager would shift the terms of the global climate debate in the way that Greta Thunberg has done. Since she began her school strike in Stockholm last August, Greta has addressed the World Economic Forum in Davos, the European parliament and the UN climate talks in Poland. Last week she met the pope in Rome. On Tuesday she met UK political leaders at the House of Commons. That Theresa May opted out of an encounter with one of the world’s foremost young activists is an embarrassing error of judgment. By any rational calculus, Greta is in the process of doing humanity a huge favour. That is because we struggle to give the global warming and wildlife crisis the attention they deserve. We have the science, with predictions of a manmade greenhouse effect dating back to the 1890s. (One of Greta’s distant relatives, Svante Arrhenius, was a pioneer in the field.) We have the international structures to collate the experts’ findings: the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued its first report in 1990. We have some, although not all, of the knowledge and technology we need to wean us off our addiction to fossil fuels: wind and solar energy; healthy alternatives to meat; bicycles and trains. Many nations have laws to help us transition to a low-carbon future. The world has the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the agreement struck in Paris in 2015. But for reasons that are psychological as well as political, we seem mostly unable to concentrate on the existential threat we face as global warming gathers pace (20 of the hottest-ever years were in the last 22) and climate chaos unfolds. Something else is always more important – or more manageable. Even those who recognise that we must use all the tools at our disposal, to stop emitting greenhouse gases as soon as possible, struggle to be heard. Thanks in no small part to the eye-catching tactic of the school strike, over the past nine months the movement spearheaded by Greta Thunberg has cut through. Green activists and scholars have spoken for years of the generational injustice of climate change. The school strikers belong to a 21st-century generation who have either taken this idea on, or arrived at it through a process of deduction of their own. Greta, who believes her outlook has been influenced by her autism, says she learned about climate change at school aged eight, and became depressed at 11. By 15, her angst had translated itself into a distinctive form of civil disobedience – the Friday school strikes which spread around the world. Hints that Greta has been manipulated by adults appear to be unfounded. As a teenager, she is in any case entitled to advice. And while it is natural to focus on her as a figurehead, the movement does not depend on her. As she told the audience at a Guardian Live event on Monday, she does not see herself as a leader, but as a participant. How the wave of demonstrations she helped start develops will be fascinating, as will the progress of the Extinction Rebellion protesters. Peaceful protest and activism are vital to democracy. The climate crisis makes them urgent and necessary. But decision-making requires processes and structures. This is not easy, and partly explains why so many of the successful civil disobedience campaigns of the past have been shaped by charismatic individuals. The school strikers’ message, similar to the extinction rebels, is that we should panic. Our house, in Greta’s memorable phrase, is on fire. We must embrace “cathedral thinking” – laying the foundations for the carbon-free future without knowing how we are going to paint the roof. This way of thinking does induce fear. But since doing nothing is not an option, except for nihilists and misanthropes, the rest of us have little choice but to battle through these darker emotions – and act with hope. The IPCC said last year that the next 12 years are critical, a warning echoed on the BBC by David Attenborough in a landmark documentary last week. The film should have been made a decade ago. We should have been alert to the dangers before children went on strike. But we still have some time."

The mean of the 16 projections provided by scientists is 4.9 +/- 0.51 million square kilometers, which is likely to be lower than what the final result will end up being.  The July Report  outlook was 4.8 +/- 0.62 million square kilometers. Even that knucklehead Wilson sobered up and realised that his July projection of 1.o million square kilometres was perhaps just a tad too low.
The June report outlook is shown below for comparison.
Why not make a projection for next year? NOAA is forecasting  a brutally cold Arctic winter, meaning colder than normal, La Nina is strengthening, and the major ocean cycles have switched. These all point to more ice for next year. I’ll project 5.75 million square kilometers for September 2011. That’s what my top secret super model says.  (PS: Don’t tell my wife!).

"Five weeks after historic flooding in the midwest, waters still cover pasturelands, corn and soybean fields. Much of the water has receded, but rivers still run high and washed out roads force people to take long detours. Residents in Missouri are putting their ruined possessions on the street and corn stalks heaped by floodwaters look like snowdrifts in the fields. In March, more than 450,000 hectares (1.1m acres) of cropland and 34,000 hectares of pastureland flooded, according to an analysis of government and satellite data, prompting governors from Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, Wisconsin and Minnesota to declare states of emergency.  In all, the damage could cost the country more than $3bn (£2.3bn). Farmers and ranchers are still tallying the number of bushels and heads of cattle lost. And though the damage is unlikely to immediately affect the national or international price of grain and meat, the farmers who experienced the loss will feel the pinch. “We’re talking about an event here of historic proportions, circumstances that nobody ever recalls ever happening in their lifetime,” said Steve Wellman, the Nebraska Department of Agriculture director and third-generation farmer. The “bomb cyclone” – an intense winter storm – that swept through the US in March followed record-breaking cold in January and unprecedented snow in February. Huge blocks of loose ice jammed waterways, and the Missouri river swelled, topping levees in four states, and breaking dams. Climate change, experts say, is altering the landscape for the American farmer. Climate models predict more extreme weather patterns in the midwest over the coming decades that may further damage small-scale commodity and meat producers, making it more difficult for them to make a profit as hurdles mount. The threat of more flooding still looms over the region. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts that snowmelt could inundate rivers as the spring wears on. As these events happen more frequently, “it will be tougher for producers to stay in business long-term”, said Scott Brown, an associate extension professor at the College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources and the University of Missouri-Columbia. Federal farm assistance programmes, he said, probably won’t save the hardest hit. The extreme weather, which occurred during calving season, whisked newborns into freezing waters, and ice jams broke the legs of cattle. Floodwaters seeped into bins where farmers stored grain ready for sale, the soybeans inside expanding until the containers exploded in slow motion. “That will all have to be destroyed because it’s contaminated,” said Blake Hurst, a farmer and president of the Missouri Farm Bureau of the wet grain. “It’s a mess.” Though uncounted bushels of grain were ruined, a large surplus of the crop still sits on higher ground or in bins elsewhere. In the last few years, farmers and ranchers in the midwest have had record yields. Crop production in Nebraska alone, the third largest corn-producing state in the country behind Iowa and Illinois, reached $8.8bn last year. Adam Meyerkorth owns a crop dusting business and helps on his dad’s 800-hectare corn and soybean farm in north-west Missouri’s Atchison county. He said he could be feeling the flood’s effects all year. More than 95% of the farm is still submerged and is likely to stay that way until the US Army Corps can repair the levee along the Missouri river. For now, Meyerkorth and his family of five are staying at the municipal airport. “The general public, when they hear ‘flood’, they hear, ‘Water up, water down – you go in, you fix it, and get back to life.’ Well, we could be displaced for nine months or more,” he said. “This one happened 16 March and we could be looking at September or October before we can physically drive back in, turn power on, and start cleaning everything back up.” Though consumers are unlikely to feel the immediate impact, the floods came fast on hard times for American farmers. In 2018, bankruptcies of midwestern farms were up 19% from the year before, the American Farm Bureau reported. Incomes have fallen by more than half over the last five years thanks to the high quantities of grain on the market. Tariffs from China, Mexico and Canada on American meat and dairy products, in response to President Trump’s tariffs, have also made trade sluggish. Many farmers hoping for higher prices stockpiled grain on their land. Destroyed roads and bridges make getting grain to feed cattle more costly. Some farmers may not be able to plant their crop this year because the land is either too wet or still underwater. “You can draw a scenario where a substantial number of farmers will go out of business if all the breaks go the wrong way,” said Hurst. “It’s too early to tell how many people will lose their farms.” For those farmers and ranchers who felt the brunt of the flooding, government programmes exist to help manage their losses. If a farmer can’t plant this year, crop insurance can pay up to 60% of what a farmer would have made. States and towns will have to fix broken levees, however, before a farmer can purchase insurance for next year’s crop. And no programme exists for stored grain lost in a flood. For ranchers, the Department of Agriculture’s Livestock Indemnity Program pays ranchers for cattle lost in a natural disaster. It will take up to a year, though, for ranchers to see how this event changed their herd sizes or profits because calves won’t go to market for another year, and illness could still affect the herd. “It’s the local issues that are the most important when we think about what’s happened from a flooding standpoint,” said Brown. “For those directly affected, what’s already a tough situation becomes a lot harder.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterNot long ago environmentalists stridently demanded mankind stop its addiction to fossil fuels and convert to renewable energy sources, like wind power. And so some countries did just that. But now we’re finding out that environmentalists don’t like that either.Today Der Spiegel online reports that environmentalists are going to court and challenging almost every planned windpark project under the sun, now claiming they are a threat to birds and wildlife.
For example in 2007 the company Neue Energie Berlin GmbH was getting ready to install Hamburg’s first windpark in an industrial zone called Pankow-Nord. It seemed like a model project for responsible energy production. But before too long, the project ended up getting challenged in court. The environmental protection group called Nabu filed a lawsuit claiming the planned 180-meter tall windmills endangered the only two remaining red kite bird pairs in the city. The project was halted.
Eventually, the court decided the birds were not at risk and gave the project the green light. The nests after all were three kilometres from the construction site. The case clearly illustrates that not only are windparks riddled with technical probelms as reported read here, but also face huge, costly legal obstacles.
Because windparks generally are situated out in the countryside, conflicts with natural wildlife habitats are inevitable. Environmental lawsuits against planned windparks are mounting and threatening to throw sand into Germany’s vision of a green future. Indeed, according to Der Spiegel, Germany’s Minister for Environment Norbert Röttgen warns:
That of all things, precisely the environmental activists are putting plans to expand renewable energy at risk.
The exasperated Minister Röttgen then demands

…that the German environmental organisations put forth their own plans as to how they think wind energy and biomass plants are to be intensified without billions of euros in investments getting blocked by ecological objections.
Currently environmentalists are barricading against government plans for further expansion of windparks in the North Sea. Already 4400 square kilometers of sea area are now planned for offshore windparks. But environmentalists now cite dangers to sea birds and whales. Der Spiegel writes:
A total of 95 offshore-parks are planned to be built in Germany’s so-called  Excluded Business Zones  and thus will seriously encroach on the living space of protected species such as the red-throated and Arctic divers. Even the Federal Office for Nature Protection says the birds will respond by making a wide circle around the windmills. There’s also a danger that construction noise will harm the protected common porpoise.
The regulators at the Federal Office for Nature Protection say:
For this reason not every place in the Excluded Business Zone will be permitted.
So indeed it looks like billions of euros emarked for investment in wind energy are about to hit the big green legal wall.

Share this...FacebookTwitterApproximately 3000 delegates from 177 countries flew to China and negotiated 6 days long, trying to find common ground for a treaty in Cancun in December. The news from Tianjin, China  is out. The result?
FAILURE
Der Spiegel writes here:
No concessions were reached on the questions of climate protection, observers reported – despite 6 days of negotiations.
UN Climate Chief Christiana Figueres says a general framework will have to be hammered out in Cancun, one that will lead to a treaty later in the future. Efforts to sign a treaty in Cancun will not be attempted.
Der Spiegel reports that the gridlock in the negotiations resulted from disputes between China and USA.
EU delegation leader Peter Wittoeck said:
It is disappointing that we were unable to make the progress we wanted.
Both the US and China blame each other for the failure. To the contrary, we ought to thank China and USA for the SUCCESS!

Share this...FacebookTwitterAnke Richter of Der Spiegel has a piece on tourism at the epicentre of climate change catastrophe: the islands of Tuvalu. According to Der Spiegel, the small group of islands is milking the catastrophe scenario for all it’s worth. Call it Tuvalu-gate.
The tiny islands may disappear under the rising oceans in just the matter of a few decades, so it is claimed. Book now and travel to Tuvalu and see a sinking island for yourself! Catastrophe tourists are now jetting in to the Tuvalu island of Funafuti.

5000 people live on just a few square kilometers on the island of Fogafale, the inhabited island of the Funafuti atoll. The remaining 5000 Tuvalu inhabitants are spread out on the other atolls and islands, which are accessible only by boat.
A paradise it is not. Groups of tourists check into the only hotel on the island. Behind its courtyard one finds rotting garbage between the stones. It reeks of raw sewage. The lukewarm shallow lagoon is littered with broken bottles and cans. Eco-tourism seems as remote as it could get.
But don’t bother with that. Tuvalu is raking in the money with climate catastrophe. Tuvalu even has its own Climate Change Official who telephones and organises tours, interviews, studies or projects for climate journalists and tourists. Even though no one is in danger on the islands, the PR machine needs to tell a different story, describes Der Spiegel.
One main attraction for climate catastrophe tourists  is beach erosion. Uprooted palm trees, bleached by the sun, lay on the coral beach like corpses as tourists snap photos from every angle.
Another sight is the island of Tepuka Savilivili, which, writes Der Spiegel, is the Ground Zero of the south seas: a barren moonscape.  But don’t mention that three typhoons wiped out the island’s vegetation back in 1997. That’s just a minor detail. The day trip out to the island costs $200 – catastrophe tourism pays big.
Afafoa Irata, State Secretary in the Foreign Ministry freely admits it:
 We’re sensationalizing the topic.
The Japanese are especially attracted to the islands. Der Spiegel writes:
No where has the “sinking” of Tuvalu captured more interest than in Japan. Every year in February, when the annual spring flood hits and temporarily divides the island for a short time, an Asian camera-team storms the island. “They always film the same thing over and over, they always ask the same questions”, says Shozo Tsunashima, who works for a Japanese NGO in Tuvalu. “Indeed all the hype is completely beyond reality.”
As the circus takes place, the island inhabitants wonder what all the fuss is about. Focus on other real problems is non-existent. Westerners don’t care at all about the rampant problems of alcohol, diabetes, violence. corruption and pollution.
Der Spiegel writes:

The international audience hears nothing about that.
Instead a media sympathy crusade is being conducted. The propaganda machine is humming. Four years ago then Tuvalu Prime Minister claimed before a UN assembly that the climatic threat for his people was like a slow and insidious form of terrorism. One of his predecessors even called it “genocide through environmental destruction”.
That’s the way to attract international funding.
Not surprisingly, what is being conveyed to the world has nothing to do with reality. Many of the islands are in fact growing a couple of millimeters annually. The situation is the same for all the atolls.
Arthur Webb is coastal specialist at the geoscientific organisation of Sopac in Fiji and says much of it has to do with decadal tidal cycles. Erosion is a natural process that has always existed. The sea takes away the beach at some places and deposits it elsewhere.
Webb says;
Surely climate change is a big problem. But that’s not all that is going on in Tuvalu. That’s only a part of it . The atolls are constantly changing. A lot of this is just getting confused. Suddenly everything is getting blamed on climate change.
Meanwhile, writes Der Spiegel, the Finance Minister of Tuvula has to attend a conference in Brussels to take care of some things involving the UN Global Environmental Fund, which will funnel money to the islands. How much can Tuvalu expect? The Minister says:
We’re supposedly at the top of the list.
Catastrophe have never been so profitable. Meanwhile the next plane lands. Der Spiegel writes:
White people pour out of the plane. One is a photographer, one is a sociologist, and two are volunteers who want to plant trees. The show must go on.
It’s the little island that bilks big – all helped along by the UN.

"In times of crisis and catastrophe, children are often forced to grow up quickly. We are now witnessing this premature call to action on a planetary scale. As the adults in government accelerate their consumption of fossil fuels, children are leading the campaign against our species’ looming extinction. Our survival now depends on the prospects for a global movement to follow their lead and demand an International Green New Deal. Several countries have proposed their own versions of a Green New Deal. Here in Europe, DiEM25 and our European Spring coalition are campaigning under the banner of a detailed Green New Deal agenda. In the UK, a new campaign is pushing similar legislation with MPs such as Caroline Lucas and Clive Lewis. And in the US, dogged activists in the Sunrise Movement are working with representatives such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to push their proposal to the front of the political agenda.  But these campaigns have largely remained siloed. Their advisers may exchange notes and ideas, but no strategy has emerged to coordinate these campaigns in a broader, global framework. Unfortunately, climate change knows no borders. The US may be the second-largest polluter in the world, but it makes up less than 15% of global greenhouse emissions. Leading by example is simply not enough. Instead, we need an International Green New Deal: a pragmatic plan to raise $8tn – 5% of global GDP – each year, coordinate its investment in the transition to renewable energy and commit to providing climate protections on the basis of countries’ needs, rather than their means. Call it the Organization for Emergency Environmental Cooperation – the namesake of the original OEEC 75 years ago. While many US activists find inspiration in a “second world war-style mobilization”, the International Green New Deal is better modeled by the Marshall plan that followed it. With financial assistance from the US government, 16 countries formed the Organization for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC), dedicated to rebuilding the infrastructure of a devastated continent and coordinating its supply of energy. But if the original OEEC entrenched an extractive capitalism at Europe’s core –protecting the steel and coal cartel – the new organization for an International Green New Deal can empower communities around the world in a single transformational project. The transnational scope of this mobilization is crucial for three main reasons. The first is production. Recent studies show that, as long as countries cooperate, all continents have the wind, solar and hydropower resources they need in a zero-emissions world. Northern countries and mountainous regions have better access to wind power, while southern lands are better suited to exploiting the sun. An International Green New Deal could exploit these differences and ensure that renewable energy is available to all of them year-round. The second is innovation. Confronting the climate crisis will require more than keeping fossil fuels in the ground. We will also need major scientific breakthroughs to develop renewable sources of energy, adapt existing infrastructure, detoxify our oceans and decarbonize the atmosphere. No country alone can fund the research and development necessary to meet these challenges. The OEEC would pool the brainpower of the global scientific community: a Green Manhattan Project. The third is reparation. For centuries, countries such as the US and the UK have plundered natural resources from around the world and polluted them back out. Less developed nations have been doubly dispossessed: first, of their resource wealth, and second, of their right to a sustainable life – and in the case of many small island developing states, of their very right to exist. An International Green New Deal would redistribute resources to rehabilitate overexploited regions, protect against rising sea levels, and guarantee a decent standard of living to all climate refugees. The UN climate change conferences will not save us from extinction – the demise of the Paris agreement should be evidence enough. These frameworks lock us into prisoners’ dilemmas, in which every country has an incentive to defect on their climate commitments, even if cooperation between them would yield a greater collective good. As long as climate cooperation is framed around sacrifice, it is vulnerable to strongmen like Donald Trump who vow to buck international rules in the name of national interests. The International Green New Deal changes the frame. Rather than pleading for restraint, it sets out a positive-sum vision of international investment, in which the gains from joining in outweigh those to going it alone. This is the strategy that won Franklin D Roosevelt the original New Deal. His plan addressed people who had given up hope and inspired in them the idea that there is an alternative. That there are ways of pressing idle resources into public service. It made sense to the disheartened and offered opportunity to the entrepreneurial. The same is true of the International Green New Deal, which mobilizes public finance to crowd in private investments that, together, fund the $8tn transition. Just like in the original New Deal, public financing will involve a mix of taxes and bond instruments. On the former, we can introduce a global minimum corporate tax rate that is then redistributed on the basis of their sales. On the latter, public investment banks – including the European Investment Bank, the World Bank and the KfW, Germany’s state-owned development bank – can coordinate the issue of green bonds that the major central banks agree collectively to support in the secondary markets. Suddenly, countries with large trade surpluses will realize they are better able to invest their excess capital if green investments in deficit countries are coordinated under the auspices of an international plan. The positive-sum dynamic will prevail. In this sense, the stakes of the International Green New Deal are not merely environmental. By uniting countries in the project of bottom-up economic transformation – and coercing multinationals to fund their fair share of it – it will also stem the tide of bigotry and xenophobia engulfing the world. “Advanced” capitalist countries today are literally falling apart. In the US, net public investment has fallen below half of one per cent of GDP. Across the eurozone, net public investment has remained below zero for nearly a decade. It is little wonder that political monsters are rising again: just as in the 1930s, the grapes of wrath are ripening and “growing heavy for the vintage”. To revive the liberal democratic project, some pundits have suggested making China into a bogeyman. But the real bogeyman is of our creation: a climate crisis wrought by decades of inaction and underinvestment. To address the true existential threat that we face today, we must reverse the economic policies that brought us to this brink. Austerity means extinction. The promise of an International Green New Deal to is to avoid the pitfalls of cold war politics and unite humanity in the only project capable of preserving a habitable planet. To do this, however, we need a powerful progressive international movement to demand that our leaders begin to act beyond their own borders. Let’s start building it. The children are watching.

It’s because even though Sweden has a population of only 9.35 million (compared to USA’s 300 million) and her posts being written in Swedish, she often gets 50 – 100 comments per post, and more, from her readers. By comparison Anthony Watts would have to get 2000 – 3000 comments per post to match her per capita-wise!
A few days ago I got the idea to write a post about the WUWT of Sweden, and so I wrote Maggie to ask her if she’d mind, and included a few questions. She happily went along.
Here’s Maggie on what’s going on with climate science and politics in Sweden, and also a  little bit about herself. Things are looking up in Scandinavia. Hope you enjoy this look at the climate situation in Sweden.

The Climate Scam Website
by Maggie Thauersköld Crusell
The Climate Scam is by far the largest blog about climate issues, not only in Sweden, but also in Scandinavia.

I began blogging at the end of 2007, as a reaction to the “streamlined” reporting on climate issues in traditional media. Soon, the number of visitors doubled, tripled and quadrupled. Obviously, there was a need for an open forum where all views were allowed. The Climate Scam has never been moderated and still isn’t. As long as people refrain from ad hominem-attacks, everyone is free to express their opinion.
Public opinion on global warming is definitely changing in Sweden. After Copenhagen, and the oddly cold winter 2009/10, people are more or less sick of hearing about climate and becoming increasingly skeptical. The phrases “climate change” and “global warming” are used much less today, and mostly by leftish fringe organizations.
There was an election to the parliament earlier this autumn and climate was hardly ever mentioned in the political debates.
What’s bothersome though is that there seems to be a great preference for wind power among Swedish politicians and many dream of wind replacing nuclear and hydropower, which today provide more than 90 percent of Sweden’s energy.
Many people within the environmental movement seem to wish for our society to go back to where it was in 1850s, or even before that, disregarding the fact that technological advances have done so much to improve the state of the world. The hard core of the environmental movement is highly misanthropic and consider humans a plague on earth. Progress is seen as detrimental, consumption as a threat to the environment and population increase as a fast lane to total destruction.
I feel we need to spread a more optimistic view of the future. Today, pessimism is the politically correct attitude and those who are optimists are considered naive and stupid. I am currently writing a book about this very issue.
I follow a lot of blogs, both skeptical ones and more politically correct. Among my favorites are WUWT, Climate Audit and Roy Spencer’s blog. I also subscribe to climate news from all around the world and I receive daily tips from my readers. I have participated in three of Heartland Institute’s climate conferences and would like to recommend them to everyone who wishes to meet some of the most prominent skeptical scientists in the world. I assume there will be a new conference arranged in spring 2011.
One last thing I’d like to add is: treat everyone with respect, no matter what their opinions are. Far too many skeptics and warmists turn to foul play, calling their opponents names and making the debate personal. I prefer to believe that we all want to do good, to preserve our planet and to further evolve humanity. And I try to stay open for views that differ from my own. We can all learn something from each other.

Reading all the climate doom and gloom in the more prominent German online papers like Der Spiegel, Die Welt, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, etc., you’d think by now readers would have long since barricaded themselves inside their homes and crawled under their beds in angst, in order to hide from the dreaded Klimakatastrophe. 
So frequent are the alarmist climate stories. Normally such stories would be better placed in the comics section. But in Germany newspapers don’t have a comics section, and so they get mixed in with the news.
Day after day normally respectable papers are filled with worst-case reports, often extracted from press releases dribbled out by tax-payer funded panic-houses like the authoritarian Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.
But, hardly anyone believes them anymore:  90% to 10%.
Yesterday I read yet another rehashed panic story in Die Welt, whose title translates: Heat Waves Threaten With Increasing Frequency.
Very revealing are the reader comments. Judging from them, a majority of German readers scoff at the claims the planet is heating up catastrophically, and do so with a whoppingly huge majority.

At Die Welt, readers who write comments can be rated by other readers with either a “thumbs up” if you agree with the comment, or a “thumbs down” if you don’t. So I counted up the number of “thumbs up” and the number of “thumbs down” for the first 20 reader comments that appeared after the above mentioned piece. The result (Saturday, 5:15 pm): 
Number agreeing with the sceptics:   1864  (90.2%)
Number agreeing with the warmists:  203  (  9.8%) 
Wunderbar! Alarmist climate science has lost its credibility, authority and trust, it seems. There’s hope for real climate science after all. Yes, a broad majority of informed Germans, at least Die Welt readers, believe climate science forecasts fundamentally are rubbish. Sure this is not a real survey. But to me it’s a clear signal.
 Some online papers have even given up allowing readers to have their say, having grown tired of being told their “news” are rubbish. So give Die Welt some credit for allowing readers to have a voice.
Interestingly, the Germans have a wide selection of words that mean “nonsense”, and one finds them used regularly in reader comments about climate. Here are some: Unsinn, Bloedsinn, Quatsch, Unfug, Dummheit, and Humbug. 
Now we can add another to the list of synonyms: Klimawissenschaft (climate science). So now when my son worries about a minor matter, I simply tell him: “Don’t worry, it’s all climate science”.

But that’s about to change, reports the German edition of the online Russian news service Ria Novosti here.Russian scientists say that the sun will soon come alive after having observed a total eclipse at Easter Island in the Pacific yesterday. They warn that magnetic storms could soon occur.
Dimitri Semyonov, who belongs to the team of observers, says the shape of the sun’s corona indicates an increase in solar activity, but cautions that the observed data still need to be evaluated. He adds:
 The sun is waking up.
Ria Novosti reports:
Dr. Sergei Bogatchov of the Laboratory for Solar X-Ray Astronomy at the Lebedev Institute of Physics told Ria Novosti that the back side of the sun has probably just seen the highest level of activity since the start of the year.
Dr. Sergei Bogatchov says:
In seven to ten days this active area of the sun will reach a position that will enable charged particles to reach the earth. That’s going to impact the geomagnetic situation – may even lead to magnetic storms.
The following graphic shows the location where the solar eclipse was observed yesterday. Sorry it’s in German, but it’s still interesting to look at.
So, it looks like a Maunder Minimum type of solar lull may not happen after all. We ought to be thankful for that. The next one or two weeks will tell us more.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIndeed here in Germany the media have stepped up the dramatic reporting in the wake of Deutsche Welle’s international conference on journalism and climate, reported here: Journalism for Dummkopfs.Driving home yesterday I heard a report on publicly funded German NDR News radio, asking a climate expert (paraphrasing):
Are the recent, numerous weather extremes seen worldwide ominous signs of the climate catastrophe?
NDR went on to mention the weather anomalies in Moscow, Pakistan, China and the local floods in the eastern part of Germany, and emphasized all the death and destruction along with it (They forgot to mention the severe cold in South America). Fortunately, the data tells the opposite story.
Cyclones and storms near all-time lows
Yet anyone taking a closer look will see that all the extraordinary drama is confined to the newsrooms, and is not what’s going on outside.  The latest tropical cyclone energy index shows that cyclones are near all-time lows. Where are all the big cyclones we were told would be coming in the wake of Katrina?

Nasty weather extremes have always occurred, and there are no statistics to show they’ve picked up. The number of deaths resulting from weather and natural disasters is also declining. There are many factors involved here, but the sky fell more often back then than today.
No upward trend in storms and bad weather since 1850
What about tornados in the USA? The following graphic also shows a downward trend. http://www.oism.org/pproject/s33p36.htm
Tornados occurring less frequently

The worst happened in the past

Indeed looking at the top 10 weather catsatrophes in the USA, the worst ones happened long ago. See Live Science here.
  1. 1900 Galveston  Hurricane, 8,000 dead
2. 2005 Hurricane Katrina, 1,836 dead
3. 1930’s Dust Bowl
4. 1906 San Francisco fire / earthquake 3,000 dead
5. 1928 Okeechobee Hurricane, at least 2,500 dead
6. 1980 Heat Wave, massive drought, and 10,000 dead
7. 1988 Heat Wave, between 5,000 and 10,000 dead.
8. 1889 Johnstown Flood, leveled 1,600 homes, killing 2,209
9. 1871 Peshtigo Fire; scorched 12 towns and left 1,200 dead
10. 1925 Tri-State Tornado, nearly 700 dead
But let’s not focus only on the USA, where statistics are easy to get. Let’s look at other parts of the world. Now here’s a graphic (sorry about the quality) showing cyclone activity in the bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea from 1890 until 2000. Looks downward to me. Here the vertical axis shows the annual frequency of cyclones and the x-axis shows the year. The dark line is the 10-year moving average.

Fewer people than ever are dying from weather extremes
And what about deaths globally? With all the bad climate change and growing populations, you’d think people would be getting killed on a massive scale. The following graphic shows the opposite is true.
http://www.disastercenter.com/disaster/TOP100K.html

All the panic is in the newsrooms
So why do some believe that extreme weather events are occurring more often than ever and that more people are dying and suffering? This is because the media stories have increased dramatically over the years, as they report on every Tiny Tim storm out there as if it were a Cat 5.  It’s overhyped.

Mounting media reports

The above graphic shows the number of newspaper reports about climate change, which is often cited as the reason for every weather anomaly happening out there. Fortunately, things on this big blue planet of ours have been quieter weatherwise, and people have caught on with respect to what all the media hype is about.
All the commotion is coming from the over-agitated folks in the newrooms.

"Climate change is becoming hard to ignore. Extreme weather has grown more frequent. Scientists are loudly and urgently sounding the alarm – and people have noticed. The 10-day Extinction Rebellion protests were the biggest act of mass civil disobedience in the UK for generations. The protests, by people drawn from all sections of society, are sure to have a lasting impact. This month has seen the most mentions of climate change in the British media since the landmark Paris agreement in 2015. The country’s political class has been at pains to show it has been moved by the unprecedented outpouring of political feeling. But politicians need to overhaul policy in a far more substantial way than is currently envisaged to stop net emissions of greenhouse gases. The question is not whether this country should achieve a net zero target, but when. Presently the UK is committed in law to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% by 2050 compared to 1990 levels. This is not ambitious enough. Last year’s UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report suggested that to limit the warming effect to 1.5C, global CO2 emissions must reach net zero by around 2050. Next week the UK’s Committee on Climate Change is expected to formally recommend the government goes further. Extinction Rebellion (XR) would like the UK to reach zero by 2025. Underlying this ambition is a commendable sentiment but the target is impractical. Britain, as the first country to industrialise and therefore responsible for a large historical stock of carbon dioxide emissions, ought to aspire to reach the UN’s 2050 goal faster, but not as fast as XR demands.  This is not a flight of fancy. The costs of renewable energy have come down, with falls in the costs of wind, solar and batteries that are much bigger and faster than were until recently thought possible. The example of organisations that have set bold decarbonising agendas, such as the National Farmers’ Union, should be applauded and emulated on a national scale. Norway has agreed a net zero goal by 2030; Sweden by 2045. If other modern European societies are willing to accept the costs of transitioning to a greener and sustainable existence, it is hard to see why the UK could not. It must be acknowledged that having a goal is not the same as meeting one. Projections show the UK will, on its current trajectory, miss its legally binding carbon budgets for 2023-32. The government’s own advisers last year warned that to deliver decarbonisation in the most cost-effective way, even to meet the 80% reduction target, the UK must achieve deeper emissions cuts than those currently set. Putting off difficult decisions will only increase the cost of mitigating and adapting to a decarbonised global economy in the decades to come. What has been heartening is that the climate protests have been rooted in facts taken from UN reports, official statistics and government papers. The demonstrations worked because their supporters had arguments that resonated and could be easily understood. Whether this translates into votes for XR candidates in European elections will be worth watching. Meanwhile the school strikers have made their own set of uncompromising demands, with a youthful energy that could not be written off. Theirs too is a reasonable reaction to an emergency that politicians are staring at but seem unable to see. If those in power did not respond to recent protests, they risked losing a generation of voters not prepared to accept a future decided by politicians many of whom will, by the time the scientists’ predictions come true, be dead. Remarkably, with a US president who does not “listen to the science” and disrupts international cooperation on climate change, green activism seems to be gathering momentum and has not only shifted the global discourse but also put pressure on decision-makers to change their policies."

Share this...FacebookTwitterUN fear-driven energy policy itself is responsible for accelerating large-scale destruction of biodiversity. Forests cleared to make way for ""green"" government-subsidised biofuel.
 There’s been talk recently about a new scare that environmentalists have come up with to replace the all-but-defunct AGW scare.  The evil villains are, again, the very thing that have made our lives immensely better: INDUSTRY. The new scare is: industry is destroying biodiversity.   
Today at least two of Germany’s leading online news outlets are reporting on industry’s threat to biodiversity, based on a UN study. Both Stern here and Die Zeit have almost the same title:   
UN: Corporations Driving Ruthless Destruction of Nature   
And both articles are almost identical, indicating they were likely press releases from the UN itself. According to Die Zeit:   
Species, even complete ecosystems, are disappearing at an unprecedented speed. Companies refuse to protect nature, the damage is in the trillions of euros.   
Species are dying 100 times faster than previously assumed. The environmental damage that is caused by the world’s 3000 leading companies is estimated by the UN to be 1.7 trillion euros, this from a study from the UN Environmental Program UNEP.

According to UN Environment Director Achim Steiner:   
The natural capital of the planet is being destroyed on a massive scale.   
Many economists are still blind to the enormous impact on the diversity of animals, plants and other forms of life and their role in the function of the ecosystem.   
The UN study says that awareness for environmental protection is increasing the most in Africa with 50% of company managers viewing environmental pollution as a threat to their business, 45% in Latin America and only 20% in Europe.   
The UN study will be made public at the International Conference for Species and Biodiversity on Tuesday in London.   
Readers ought to recall how it’s the UN itself and government politics based on UN climate fear mongering  are actually in large part responsible for their claimed massive destruction of nature. Read:
Europe’s Latest Green Megafolly. Burning Forests To Save The Planet!  
And maybe the UN has realised that it wasn’t getting anywhere by nagging and blaming the citizens of the planet. Now it probably thinks it can get more support by demonising industry.

"The world’s oceans have become more stormy during the past three decades, according to the largest and most detailed study of its kind. The findings add to concerns that as the world gets hotter, extreme events such as storms and floods could become more frequent and more devastating in their impact.  Slight increases in average wave height and wind speed were recorded in oceans across the globe, with the strongest effects in the Southern Ocean. The study relied on data from 31 satellites and more than 80 ocean buoys collected between 1985 and 2018, with about 4 billion observations. Extreme winds in the Southern Ocean have increased by 1.5 metres per second, or 8%, over the past 30 years, while the highest waves have increased in height by 30 centimetres, or 5%. The strongest winds increased in the equatorial Pacific and Atlantic and the North Atlantic by about 0.6 metres per second. Prof Ian Young, the first author of the work from the University of Melbourne, said: “Although increases of 5 and 8% might not seem like much, if sustained into the future such changes to our climate will have major impacts.” Young said that increases in wave height could lead to more serious flooding and coastal erosion, and put offshore structures such as wind farms at risk of damage. The researchers said the observations were in line with predictions by climate models and from historical records that suggested that as the world got hotter, weather and storms became more extreme, although the relationship was complex and not fully understood. “The role climate change plays in wind speed and hence wave height is still not clear,” said Young. Others said that the role of global warming in the latest observations was yet to be established. “It’s a bit difficult to extrapolate these finding to the wider picture,” said Dr Paulo Ceppi, of the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London. “During 30-year periods you can still have pretty significant natural variations in winds.” Ceppi said that the observed changes in the Southern Ocean were likely to be driven by the hole in the ozone layer, in the Antarctic stratosphere, to a greater extent than global warming – although this could also be contributing. The study, published in the journal Science, updates previous work from the same team published nearly a decade ago. A major challenge in compiling long-running data series, they said, is accounting for significant changes in technology and data processing over the time period. For the earliest part of the time period the coverage was not as extensive and the measurements were less accurate. The scientists needed to rule out the possibility that they were simply seeing more violent storms because there are now more satellites to spot them, for instance. The findings also suggest that conditions in the Southern Ocean are becoming more treacherous for ships. According to Young, more intense storms circling the Southern Ocean can also generate larger ocean swells that propagate across the Indian, Pacific and South Atlantic. “Increasing wave conditions in the Southern Ocean impact regions across the globe,” he said."
"Support for Extinction Rebellion in the UK has quadrupled in the past nine days as public concern about the scale of the ecological crisis grows. Since the wave of protests began more than a week ago, 30,000 new backers or volunteers have offered their support to the environmental activist group. In the same period it has raised almost £200,000 – mostly in donations of between £10 and £50 – reaching a total of £365,000 since January. The group said the figures showed the public was waking up to the scale of the crisis, adding that pressure was growing on politicians to act. Extinction Rebellion is a protest group that uses non-violent civil disobedience to campaign on environmental issues. Launched in October 2018, with an assembly at Parliament Square to announce a 'declaration of rebellion' against the UK Government, the group has staged regular demonstrations against current environmental policies. More than 1,000 activists were arrested in April 2019 after protesters occupied four sites across London, as well as blocking roads, disrupting a railway line and conducting a protest at Heathrow. Other demonstrations have included a semi-naked protest inside the House of Commons and blockading streets in London, Cardiff, Leeds, Bristol and Glasgow. The group says climate breakdown threatens all life on Earth, and so it is rebelling against politicians who “have failed us”, to provoke radical change that will stave off a climate emergency. The movement has become global with groups set up in countries include the US, Spain, Australia, South Africa and India. Martin Belam “What this shows is that Extinction Rebellion has spoken to people who have been wanting to act on this for such a long time but haven’t known how,” said a spokesperson for the group. “The debate on this is over – ordinary people are now saying it is time for politicians to act with real urgency.” Diane Abbott backed the demonstrators in a speech to the eco-activists in Parliament Square on Wednesday. The shadow home secretary told a crowd of up to 100 protesters – one of whom towered above the group on six-foot stilts while others wielded banners – that she acknowledged a “climate emergency”, one of the group’s key demands. Abbott also emphasised that MPs needed to come together to host a “broad conversation” on one of the activists’ requests to bring the country’s greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2025. She said: “I wouldn’t be in politics if I didn’t think change was possible. If things can change on the issues that I campaigned on when I was a very young woman, I think that things can change … on climate change and we can move towards the 2025 target.” Abbott suggested meeting Extinction Rebellion for a detailed discussion of policy aims – a proposal met with rapturous applause. She reiterated her commitment to learning and listening to protesters and said that, in the long term, climate change was more important than Brexit.  The group’s organisers said the number of people on the streets for the protests had dwindled from a high over the Easter bank holiday weekend but that the number of people who had signed up to support future demonstrations had risen from 10,000 before the protest to 40,000 by Wednesday morning. The Extinction Rebellion spokesperson said the group was also becoming more diverse – attracting more working-class and black and minority ethnic supporters. “But that is definitely a work in progress – there is still more work to do in that area,” she added. The figures came a day after Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish student who sparked a global youth-based movement when she began a “climate strike” outside Sweden’s parliament last year, visited Westminster. In a speech to MPs, she said: “You lied to us. You gave us false hope. You told us that the future was something to look forward to. You don’t listen to the science because you are only interested in solutions that will enable you to carry on like before.” Extinction Rebellion’s youth group wrote to MPs on Wednesday, as parliament restarted after the Easter break, pleading with them to act swiftly to address the crisis. The letter states: “We are writing to ask you to hear the science, to feel the public’s change of heart and to act now to save our futures … Now the time has arrived to stand up and be counted – you are our elected representatives and we need your help.” More than 1,000 Extinction Rebellion activists have been arrested in the past week in a campaign of mass non-violent direct action to highlight how little time there is to halt manmade ecological breakdown. Protesters occupied four sites across the capital and staged acts of civil disobedience including blocking roads, disrupting a train line and conducting a protest at Heathrow. On Tuesday, the group said it intended to carry out further action in the next few days – including blocking roads in and around the City of London on Thursday. It is debating how and when to stop this stage of the protests. On Tuesday, senior Labour figures backed the protesters, likening them to the Chartists, suffragettes and anti-apartheid activists. Speaking in response to an urgent question in the Commons, the shadow energy minister Barry Gardiner said alongside the school strikes, the Extinction Rebellion protests were reminiscent of previous struggles. “All of those victories were won by citizens uniting against injustice, making their voice heard. And Extinction Rebellion and the school climate strikers are doing just that,” he said. Inside the chamber, the former Labour leader Ed Miliband said the government must declare a climate emergency and introduce a “green new deal”. Responding for the government, Claire Perry, the energy minister, rejected the idea of a climate emergency – “I don’t know what that would entail” – and said she had reservations about the Extinction Rebellion protests. She said though she was glad such arguments were being heard, they had caused “disruption for many hundreds and thousands of hardworking Londoners and had required a heavy policing presence. “I worry that many of the messages we are hearing ignore the progress that is being made, and as such make people fearful for the future rather than hopeful.”"
"April has been quite the month for climate action. The organisation I co-founded, the UK Student Climate Network, held its third Youth Strike 4 Climate demonstrations just two weeks ago which for the third month in succession saw tens of thousands take to the streets across the UK demanding climate justice and a Green New Deal. Extinction Rebellion also kicked off a huge act of extended nonviolent civil disobedience by reclaiming public spaces in London and causing widespread disruption to protest climate breakdown. Many hope this could be a crucial turning point in Britain’s political approach to addressing the climate crisis.  Thousands of people taking positive climate action for the very first time are feeling empowered by bringing their rage and frustration at climate inaction to the streets, visibly demonstrating their discontent. Looking at those taking part in all of these actions shows the potential of an emerging group to drive necessary legislative change. At the youth strikes I look around and see today’s brave and courageous climate activists – and tomorrow’s voters. Meanwhile, lots of current voters have been frequenting Marble Arch, Parliament Square and other sites previously occupied by Extinction Rebellion. All of these people, alongside those engaged by TV shows such as Our Planet and Climate Change: The Facts are becoming a new voting demographic: the climate vote bloc. When we’re shielded from the truths of the climate crisis it’s impossible to understand the gravity of the situation. Both movements are doing fantastic work to make the climate a mainstream issue and help understanding of the crisis we face to spread widely. The power of grassroots, widespread climate action cannot be underestimated. When ordinary people start to organise among themselves and create communities of resistance in our schools, colleges, universities and neighbourhoods, those in positions of power begin to notice. The emergent climate movements are organising people of all ages to fight for a better world and to take the necessary steps to pressure political leaders to act. In a moment of beautiful timing – as this climate organising in the UK is coming to a crescendo – the Swedish activist and inspiration for the Fridays For Future movement, Greta Thunberg, arrived for a three-day visit to Britain. Greta’s trip included her taking part in a huge panel discussion on the new climate movement and ways to escalate it, and also delivering a rousing speech in parliament to tell MPs some hard truths about their lack of action. Crucially, there was also historic cross-party climate talks between Westminster leaders. The UK youth strikers Holly Gillibrand, George Bond and myself sat down with Greta, Jeremy Corbyn, Caroline Lucas, Vince Cable, Liz Saville-Roberts and Ian Blackford for the first climate talks of their kind in more a decade. Theresa May’s chair remained empty. We pushed political leaders to commit to and agree upon some positive first steps to start addressing the climate crisis. Tens of thousands of young climate activists forced party leaders to acknowledge the gravity of the climate crisis, driving home the need to act urgently and collaboratively. We negotiated with political leaders to commit to climate stress-testing their party manifestos against the Paris agreement, holding regular and continued cross-party talks, supporting and engaging with youth climate assemblies across the UK, and reforming the education system to address the climate crisis, as well as reinforced respective party commitments to votes at 16. We’ve achieved these victories in just three months. We’re well aware that we need actions and not just words. We know we need to keep pushing for the type of bold and courageous action required to address the climate crisis and make steps toward climate justice. We will keep calling for a Green New Deal in the months to come. The UK Student Climate Network will keep striking to ensure those elected to represent us know we’re holding them to account. We’re tomorrow’s voters and we won’t stop until we have a healthy, livable planet for each and every one of us. • Anna Taylor, 18, is co-founder of the UK Student Climate Network"

"For most of my adult life I’ve railed against “corporate capitalism”, “consumer capitalism” and “crony capitalism”. It took me a long time to see that the problem is not the adjective but the noun. While some people have rejected capitalism gladly and swiftly, I’ve done so slowly and reluctantly. Part of the reason was that I could see no clear alternative: unlike some anti-capitalists, I have never been an enthusiast for state communism. I was also inhibited by its religious status. To say “capitalism is failing” in the 21st century is like saying “God is dead” in the 19th: it is secular blasphemy. It requires a degree of self-confidence I did not possess. But as I’ve grown older, I’ve come to recognise two things. First, that it is the system, rather than any variant of the system, that drives us inexorably towards disaster. Second, that you do not have to produce a definitive alternative to say that capitalism is failing. The statement stands in its own right. But it also demands another, and different, effort to develop a new system.  Capitalism’s failures arise from two of its defining elements. The first is perpetual growth. Economic growth is the aggregate effect of the quest to accumulate capital and extract profit. Capitalism collapses without growth, yet perpetual growth on a finite planet leads inexorably to environmental calamity. Those who defend capitalism argue that, as consumption switches from goods to services, economic growth can be decoupled from the use of material resources. Last week a paper in the journal New Political Economy, by Jason Hickel and Giorgos Kallis, examined this premise. They found that while some relative decoupling took place in the 20th century (material resource consumption grew, but not as quickly as economic growth), in the 21st century there has been a recoupling: rising resource consumption has so far matched or exceeded the rate of economic growth. The absolute decoupling needed to avert environmental catastrophe (a reduction in material resource use) has never been achieved, and appears impossible while economic growth continues. Green growth is an illusion. A system based on perpetual growth cannot function without peripheries and externalities. There must always be an extraction zone – from which materials are taken without full payment – and a disposal zone, where costs are dumped in the form of waste and pollution. As the scale of economic activity increases until capitalism affects everything, from the atmosphere to the deep ocean floor, the entire planet becomes a sacrifice zone: we all inhabit the periphery of the profit-making machine. This drives us towards cataclysm on such a scale that most people have no means of imagining it. The threatened collapse of our life-support systems is bigger by far than war, famine, pestilence or economic crisis, though it is likely to incorporate all four. Societies can recover from these apocalyptic events, but not from the loss of soil, an abundant biosphere and a habitable climate. The second defining element is the bizarre assumption that a person is entitled to as great a share of the world’s natural wealth as their money can buy. This seizure of common goods causes three further dislocations. First, the scramble for exclusive control of non-reproducible assets, which implies either violence or legislative truncations of other people’s rights. Second, the immiseration of other people by an economy based on looting across both space and time. Third, the translation of economic power into political power, as control over essential resources leads to control over the social relations that surround them. In the New York Times on Sunday, the Nobel economist Joseph Stiglitz sought to distinguish between good capitalism, which he called “wealth creation”, and bad capitalism, which he called “wealth grabbing” (extracting rent). I understand his distinction. But from the environmental point of view, wealth creation is wealth grabbing. Economic growth, intrinsically linked to the increasing use of material resources, means seizing natural wealth from both living systems and future generations. To point to such problems is to invite a barrage of accusations, many of which are based on this premise: capitalism has rescued hundreds of millions of people from poverty – now you want to impoverish them again. It is true that capitalism, and the economic growth it drives, has radically improved the prosperity of vast numbers of people, while simultaneously destroying the prosperity of many others: those whose land, labour and resources were seized to fuel growth elsewhere. Much of the wealth of the rich nations was – and is – built on slavery and colonial expropriation. Like coal, capitalism has brought many benefits. But, like coal, it now causes more harm than good. Just as we have found means of generating useful energy that are better and less damaging than coal, so we need to find means of generating human wellbeing that are better and less damaging than capitalism. There is no going back: the alternative to capitalism is neither feudalism nor state communism. Soviet communism had more in common with capitalism than the advocates of either system would care to admit. Both systems are (or were) obsessed with generating economic growth. Both are willing to inflict astonishing levels of harm in pursuit of this and other ends. Both promised a future in which we would need to work for only a few hours a week, but instead demand endless, brutal labour. Both are dehumanising. Both are absolutist, insisting that theirs and theirs alone is the one true God. So what does a better system look like? I don’t have a complete answer, and I don’t believe any one person does. But I think I see a rough framework emerging. Part of it is provided by the ecological civilisation proposed by Jeremy Lent, one of the greatest thinkers of our age. Other elements come from Kate Raworth’s doughnut economics and the environmental thinking of Naomi Klein, Amitav Ghosh, Angaangaq Angakkorsuaq, Raj Patel and Bill McKibben. Part of the answer lies in the notion of “private sufficiency, public luxury”. Another part arises from the creation of a new conception of justice based on this simple principle: every generation, everywhere, shall have an equal right to the enjoyment of natural wealth. I believe our task is to identify the best proposals from many different thinkers and shape them into a coherent alternative. Because no economic system is only an economic system but intrudes into every aspect of our lives, we need many minds from various disciplines – economic, environmental, political, cultural, social and logistical – working collaboratively to create a better way of organising ourselves that meets our needs without destroying our home. Our choice comes down to this. Do we stop life to allow capitalism to continue, or stop capitalism to allow life to continue? • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"
"Zeynep Gurtin (The myths behind late motherhood, Journal, 18 April) omits one reason why there appears to be atrend for women to leave having babies until their late 30s/early 40s: that in their 20s and early 30s they may not have decided whether they want children at all, rather than just delaying having them. They may be enjoying life free of the ties and responsibility of children, working at jobs they love and have studied for and struggled to obtain – jobs they know will be touched by having children in ways that a man’s career won’t. Women are more than their biological ability to give birth, and I salute those who choose to explore and reach their own potential before deciding if they want to undertake the huge task of producing and raising another human being.Roz TreadwaySheringham, Norfolk  • I’m sorry that Zoe Williams, or anyone, felt or feels diminished over breastfeeding (The ‘breast is best’ lobby has failed women, Journal, 23 April). I’m pleased the National Childbirth Trust, or anyone, is able to devote resources to postnatal mental health.

Neither is pretending it’s all about individual choice. The breastfeeding debate, like that of climate change, would benefit from more systemic analysis. They have the same root problem – an economic system that aims to turn everything (water, air, life, child-rearing) into a commodity for profit and relies on the free labour of women to succeed. Formula corporations operate like fossil-fuel ones, ruthlessly pursuing billions in profits and lobbying hard against international guidelines on breast milk.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE)  based in Germany has sent a Letter of Protest to the Intendant of German public broadcaster Deutsche Welle demanding that it refrains from the illegal use of public funds and cancel its one-sided conference for journalists called: The Heat Is On – Climate Change and the Media.
The international conference, scheduled to take place in Bonn from June 21 till June 23, excludes all views that disagree with the extreme AGW gloom and doom, world downfall view.  However, because Deutsche Welle is a publicly funded institution, it is required by German Law to remain neutral and honest.
Instead, Deutsche Welle has decided on its own to abandon journalism and to resort to promoting one single extreme view on the topic of climate change, and to shut out the rest. It’s activism run amok.
One workshop is How to professionally deal with climate scepticism. The workshop’s objective:
This workshop aims to point out what journalists must know about climate change policy, whom to trust and when to question their own professional procedures.
This conference has infuriated a number of scientists and citizens. As a result EIKE has drafted and dispatched a letter of protest to Deutsche Welle. The letter states:

It certainly cannot be in the interest of a publicly financed broadcaster to put its own existence into question with a debate over its objectivity.
and
Enlightened thinking has always been at the centre of our culture, along with sceptical, critical and scrutinising thought. It is intolerable that, here in Germany, public funds are being illegally used under your supervision and under your responsibility to marginalise a large number persons (the majority!) who share a different opinion.
More information about Deutsche Welle and its conference is here and here.

Here’s an ongoing weather event, which is supposed to be rare.
We know it’s been cold as heck in South America. In fact it’s been so cold that fish have been dying on a mass scale. This today is being reported by the German online Stern and other outlets.
Authorities say that 6 million fish have died as a result of the cold. Also read here.  This report writes:
Authorities in the eastern Bolivian province of Santa Cruz declared an alert following the death of fish in the Grande, Pirai and Ichilo rivers that run through the tropical region.
This is an “environmental catastrophe” brought on by the lowest temperatures registered in Santa Cruz in nearly half a century, Gov. Ruben Costas told reporters.
We’ve seen reports on how the cold in South America has been deadly for humans too, see here. Later reports mention 500 dead.
And it’s still cold. And it’s going to remain cold as well, see here.

Joe just calls it weather (that happens to be well below what the climate models predicted). My bet is that it has something to do with solar cycles.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe self-anointed elite class of “real” journalists exposes the raw hostility and contempt it harbours for the very citizenry it purports to serve.
Sometimes you read something, somewhere, that causes many people to get angry. But the latest piece by the UK Guardian, Andrew Marr unloads on citizen bloggers, calling them “inadequate, pimpled, very drunk, angry and single,” just made my day. They are collapsing faster than I ever imagined.
Chumps like Marr are furious because nobody really takes them seriously anymore. Bloggers and free speech are ruining everything, and so he lashes out. Call it Marr’s controlled, yet expressive tantrum.
Enlightened journalists say they are in favour of progress, but progress is precisely what is killing them. They do not know how to deal with it. The growing sense of irrelevance is really tough on them.
The first reaction of course is to lash out emotionally. This is what Andrew Marr of the BBC has done. The Guardian writes:
The BBC‘s website has nearly 100 blogs and invites its readers to “have your say” on an enormous range of topics, from Westminster to the weather.
But one of the corporation’s most familiar faces, Andrew Marr, has dismissed bloggers as “inadequate, pimpled and single”, and citizen journalism as the “spewings and rantings of very drunk people late at night”.
Quoting Marr, who incidently is hired by the publicly-funded BBC, and whose obligation is to inform the public, cannot contain the utter contempt he harbours for his audience. The Guardian quotes Marr:
‘A lot of bloggers seem to be socially inadequate, pimpled, single, slightly seedy, bald, cauliflower-nosed young men sitting in their mother’s basements and ranting. They are very angry people. OK – the country is full of very angry people. Many of us are angry people at times. Some of us are angry and drunk’.
You really need to read the whole Guardian piece. I guarantee you’ll be entertained by the frustration these malcontents are feeling. You’ll quickly understand why they fantasize of detonators with red buttons, and why they think exploding children are “kind of funny”.

google_ad_height = 200;

Well, I really think it’s funny that they are emotionally exploding. And yet it is indeed extremely sad to watch these once reputable journalistic institutions fall so far. But it’s by their own doing.
The citizens’ view of “mainstream” journalism
Allow me to use Marr’s own comments and change them to tell you what we as citizens feel about the established media. I think many will agree. Here’s how I’d put it:
Many of society’s common readers have dismissed ‘mainstream’ journalism as inadequate, hypocritical and condescending, and mainstream journalism as the “spewings and rantings of arrogant, narrow-minded, dogmatic, and frustrated people – day and night.
A lot of mainstream journalists seem to be isolated from the mainstream public, dressed in fancy clothes, arrogant, quite seedy, toupè-wearing, high-nosed grumps sitting in their newsrooms and ranting about how atupid their readers are. They are very angry, frustrated people. OK – the country is full of very frustrated people. Many of us are frustrated people at times. Some of us are really angry and frustrated, and we dream of red-buttoned detonators.
So-called mainstream journalism is the spewings of contempt for the working classes, from very arrogant hypocrites sitting in ivory towers that are funded by the taxpayers. Take Andrew Marr as an example.
It is fantastic at times but it is no longer the future of journalism.
Most of journalism is simply too condescending and too arrogant. Much disinformation is printed because they cannot cope with inconvenient truths. Mainstream journalists fantasize of explosive horror clips, about things that they’d love to do to their uncooperative readers.
The former readers of mainstream journalism, like many in the blogosphere, have previously criticised the tone and the quality of journalism, saying we have stopped reading most mainstream journalism like the BBC. It’s out of touch with its original purpose, and the citizens it is supposed to serve, and not insult.
‘It’s a waste of my time,’ say the average citizens, adding that mainstream journalism is most often written by people who think they ought to tell the rest of us how to think, that citizens are too stupid to do so on their own, and think it’s okay to abuse and insult them, just as Andrew Marr does.
But in the end, we “drunk and pimpled” citizens do not need to fantasize about red buttons and blowing up “real” journalists. The “real” journalists are pressing their own self-destruct red buttons all by themselves.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNot a day goes by without hearing about the “catastrophic BP Gulf oil spill”. Even the media in Europe are fretting hysterically about ocean currents eventually carrying the mess across the Atlantic and over to Europe’s shores – so say all their computer models. There’s now even a lot of discussion about setting up a world environmental court for prosecuting polluters for Crimes Against Nature and Crimes Against Humanity.When I was a kid and milk spilled, we were told not to cry about it, but instead to get up, get a mop, and to clean it up. How are media responding with the latest spill? Many are having fainting spells, some are even leaping out the windows, and the rest just want to beat the crap out of the poor kid who spilled the milk, who by the way gets up early every morning to milk the cow and brings it to the table.
Surely the oil spill was a mess and steps have to be taken to prevent these things in the future. But it’s also important to keep it all in perspective. Globally, once everything settles down, this is not going to be felt at all. It’s reported that 800 million liters have gushed into the Gulf. That sounds like a huge number. Indeed it’s like everyone in the United States dumping 3 quarts.
Pull your head up and look at the big picture. First of all, it has been reported, much to the surprise of the media, that 75% has already been either dispersed or cleaned up. That means 200 million liters are still at large. Of these 200 million liters, what doesn’t end up on shores for manual cleanup, will eventually get carried out to sea.
But for now, let’s stay with the 200 million liters floating out to Europe and beyond. How much is that with respect to the oceans’ sheer volume?
* 200 million liters = 200,000 cubic meters,
* 200,000 cubic meters = 0.0002 cubic kilometers of oil.
* Volume of world oceans: 1.37 BILLION cubic kilometers.
* Concentration of BP oil in ocean: 0.0002 km³/ 1,370,000,000 km³
This equals…folks my calculator doesn’t even get anywhere near that far out! It’s like one rat drowning in Lake Erie. It’s in the trillionths! The average lake has higher concentrations of greasy suntan lotion from swimmers.
Wildlife in the oceans are not even going to notice this, not at all! Fish have other far greater worries on their minds – like not becoming dinner for other fish.

So everybody really ought to just calm down about it. The whole thing has been overhyped a 1000 times.
The Gulf shores will get cleaned up and big mother earth will do the rest.

I’d like to point out that the media focusses too much on the environmental disturbance of the oil spill and ignores the fact that a dozen people lost their lives in the accident. That’s the real tragedy.
And let’s not forget there have been far worse disasters.  167 people lost their lives on the Piper Alpha, making that in my view far worse than anything else in the oil industry to my knowledge. We ought to keep things in perspective.  The environment will rebound – lost lives don’t. How does someone’s business taking a temporary hit compare to loss of life? You coastal residents – you live in America, and so you’ll all get through it just fine. I know it’s tough, but count your blessings.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThat’s the amazing thing warmist and alarmist Prof Hans Joachim Schellnhuber has recently admitted, according to Der Spiegel here (read the last paragraph).
Now in English here!
And again they assert that the public is just too stupid to have a say in this important public issue.
Schellnhuber even compares himself, his fellow “climate scientists” and climate science to Albert Einstein and the theory of relativity (read below).
More on that in just a bit, but first during the night, Anthony Watts posted news that prominent scientist Hal Lewis is resigning from the American Physical Society. Anthony asked other bloggers to spread the news. Anthony feels so strongly about this that he even equated it to Martin Luther:
This is an important moment in science history. I would describe it as a letter on the scale of Martin Luther, nailing his 95 theses to the Wittenburg church door.
Dr. Lewis has had enough of the charlatans and frauds infesting climate science all over the world. Read his complete resignation letter here.  In it he writes about Climategate’s aftermath and climate science:
It was a fraud on a scale I have never seen, and I lack the words to describe its enormity. Effect on the APS position: none. None at all. This is not science; other forces are at work.- Hal Lewis
Now, Schellnhuber and Der Spiegel
Two days ago Der Spiegel came out with one of the nastiest hit pieces I’ve seen in a long time called: Crusade Against Science – The Charlatans of Climate Science. (Note they’ve softened the title in English). The title I translated was the one used here, scroll down.
Fred Singer. Photo source: CFACT
Der Spiegel singled out Fred Singer and attacked every aspect about him, rehashing all the old tobacco and merchant-of-doubt stuff. Naomi Oreskes’s fingerprints were everywhere here. Face it, she’s hopelessly infatuated with Fred Singer.
Der Spiegel calls Singer “one of the most influential climate deniers worldwide” and a lead denier in the NIPCC, which it describes:

Sounds impressive, but is actually just a collection of like-minded scientists that have gathered around him. Also one German is in it: Gerd Weber. a meteorologist who for 25 years was at the service of the German coal industry.
Der Spiegel also goes after Pat Michaels and Myron Ebell, writing that spreading doubt in USA has been easier than in Europe, but that Singer and the “deniers” are working on that too, and have teamed up with the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE). Der Spiegel:
Behind the impressively sounding name is hardly anything more than a post office box in Jena. President Holger Thuss is a local CDU politician [conservative party].
Indeed it is so. There is simply no funding for them and so this small but committed group is forced to operate on a shoestring. EIKE is not showered with tens of millions of euros like activist groups and warmists are. Yet, notice how fearful Der Spiegel and the Science Establishment in Germany are. Even Der Spiegel feels it has to mobilise and slap down the EIKE shoestring operation.
Schellnhuber and debate
Der Spiegel writes that Hans Joachim Schellnhuber of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research has nothing against having a discussion with serious scientists, but refuses to debate with whom he considers “amateurs”. Der Spiegel:
In the end, the science has gotten so complex that the large part of the population is not able to follow it. The climate sceptics, on the other hand, are satisfying “a need for simple truths”.
And that’s precisely where Schellnhuber sees the sceptic’s secret to success. Unfortunately a public debate would not help: “Imagine if Einstein had to defend his theory of relativity on talkshow Maybritt Illner. He wouldn’t have a snowball’s chance in hell.”
What Schellnhuber is saying here is amazing. He’s saying that his climate science would not stand a chance in a public debate. How right you are Herr Schellnhuber. But here it is so because your science is light-years away from Einstein’s when it comes to quality, and not because the people in the land of poets and thinkers are unable to understand it.
And so that’s why he accepts having a discussion only with people who agree with him.

"More than half of the world’s new oil and gas pipelines are located in North America, with a boom in US oil and gas drilling set to deliver a major blow to efforts to slow climate change, a new report has found.  Of a total 302 pipelines in some stage of development around the world, 51% are in North America, according to Global Energy Monitor, which tracks fossil fuel activity. A total of $232.5bn in capital spending has been funneled into these North American pipeline projects, with more than $1tn committed towards all oil and gas infrastructure. If built, these projects would increase the global number of pipelines by nearly a third and mark out a path of several decades of substantial oil and gas use. In the US alone, the natural-gas output enabled by the pipelines would result in an additional 559m tons of planet-warming carbon dioxide each year by 2040, above 2017 levels, according to Global Energy Monitor, citing International Energy Agency figures. This surge in emissions is set to take place at a time when scientists have warned of punishing heatwaves, floods and economic damage if greenhouse gases are not drastically cut. A landmark UN report released last year warned that global emissions must be halved by 2030 and essentially nullified by 2050 to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. “This is a whole energy system not compatible with global climate survival,” said Ted Nace, co-author of the Global Energy Monitor report. “These pipelines are locking in huge emissions for 40 to 50 years at a time, with the scientists saying we have to move in 10 years. These pipelines are a bet that the world won’t get serious about climate change, allowing the incumbency of oil and gas to strengthen.” New gas pipelines outnumber oil pipelines by about four to one, bolstered by a glut of abundant natural gas that is swiftly replacing coal as the leading electricity source for US homes and businesses. The most active area for pipelines is the Permian basin in west Texas, a sprawling formation that contains huge deposits of oil and gas. Other active zones include the shale formations in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia, and the Canadian tar sands of Alberta. Several of these pipeline projects have spurred bitter protests from climate and indigenous activists, such as the Dakota Access project, which resulted in violent clashes at the Standing Rock reservation in North Dakota. The extension to the Keystone pipeline, which would link the Alberta tar sands to refineries on the Gulf of Mexico, has also aroused opposition that Donald Trump has vowed to sweep aside by pushing the project forward. While domestic energy use increased last year – Americans consumed 4% more energy than in 2017, according to US government figures – the boom in oil and gas pipelines is largely set to cater for the US’s increasing role as an energy exporter. Nace said there are “unrealistic expectations” over exports of liquified natural gas to Asia, in particular, due to an increase in gas production there and concerns over climate change. International goals to limit global warming to 2C (3.6F) above pre-industrial times will be “difficult or impossible to achieve” with the completion of the new pipelines, according to Heidi Peltier, an energy expert at the University of Massachusetts, who was not involved in the new research. “From a climate perspective, this is very bad news,” she said. “What we need is increased investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency, not increased investments in fossil fuel infrastructure.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German Der Spiegel has just come out with a piece called: The Myth of Climate Scepticism. You know all that scepticism you’ve been hearing about? Well, it never really existed. It was all just a myth, so says Der Spiegel.
You see, it’s all been disproven by a study coming out of Stanford. All those polls conducted earlier were simply misinterpreted! That’s right, there really isn’t any scepticism at all out there. It was all just a big miragee.
Climategate really has had no effect on what people think about climate change. In fact, there never really was a Climategate. The Oxbourgh report has proven that too.
Indeed last winter in Europe was actually very warm – the warmest we are allowed to remember. Didn’t we all go swimming in the Baltic Sea last February? Shit! A new study shows that too. Just ask Finland.
And weren’t all them potholes we had in the streets in March all caused by the blistering heat of last winter?
I guess all us sceptic bloggers have been just wasting all our time, and we really ought to stop blogging about all that scepticism. The Stanford report says so. Der Spiegel says so too.
A new reality is being manufactured and pulled over our eyes.

"The UK government’s active support for fossil fuels and airport expansion is “beyond absurd”, Greta Thunberg has told MPs. The 16-year-old Swedish student, who sparked a global youth-based movement when she began a “climate strike” outside Sweden’s parliament last year, gave a typically blunt speech. She told MPs: “This ongoing irresponsible behaviour will no doubt be remembered in history as one of the greatest failures of humankind.” Thunberg, who had earlier met the heads of several of the UK’s political parties, also said today’s generation of leaders around the world had not acted fast enough to halt climate change. “You lied to us. You gave us false hope. You told us that the future was something to look forward to,” she said. “You don’t listen to the science because you are only interested in solutions that will enable you to carry on like before.” Some consider the UK to be a leader in the fight against global warming, but Thunberg was fierce in her criticism: “The UK’s active current support of new exploitation of fossil fuels, like for example the UK shale gas fracking industry, the expansion of its North Sea oil and gas fields, the expansion of airports, as well as the planning permission for a brand new coalmine, is beyond absurd.” She said the UK had a “mind-blowing historical carbon debt”, referring to the nation’s cumulative emissions since the industrial revolution. The UK government also uses “very creative carbon accounting”, she said, by not including the emissions from imported goods in headline figures. The former UN chief Ban Ki-Moon also recently criticised the UK government’s funding of fossil fuel projects in other countries. Thunberg said there was still just about time to stop climate change: “I’m sure that the moment we start behaving as if we were in an emergency, we can avoid climate and ecological catastrophe. Humans are very adaptable. But the opportunity to do so will not last for long.” She said the deciding factor for every new economic development must be the level of carbon emissions it will produce. “Every time we make a decision we should ask ourselves; how will this decision affect that [emissions] curve?” About 1.6 million students are estimated to have skipped school to protest against climate inaction, prompting some criticism over lost education. Thunberg said: “I assure you we will go back to school the moment you start listening to science and give us a future. Is that really too much to ask?” Earlier on Tuesday, Jeremy Corbyn and several other Westminster party leaders met Thunberg at parliament, with a symbolic place left at the table for the absent Theresa May. Thunberg, who came to London to speak at the Extinction Rebellion environmental protests, and was due to address activists at Parliament Square later on Tuesday, met Corbyn, the Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, the Green MP Caroline Lucas and the Westminster leaders of the SNP and Plaid Cymru, Ian Blackford and Liz Saville Roberts. May was chairing cabinet on Tuesday morning. Her spokesman said he did not have information about whether the prime minister had been invited to see Thunberg. Organisers of the event said May had been invited, but there had been no response. A place at the table was left empty, with the prime minister’s name. Thunberg told the MPs: “We just want people to listen to the science.” Corbyn told her: “Well done for what you have done.” Lucas, the former Green leader who is the party’s sole MP, told the activist: “I think all of us are really committed to trying to ensure that there’s an ongoing way to really make sure that all of our policies and all of our work in parliament is properly scrutinised by young people with a perspective on climate in particular. “We want young people’s voices to be heard in parliament. This is such an important moment, when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change say we have just 11 years left to get off the collision course we are on for climate catastrophe. “That sense of urgency is here as never before, at a time when there have been protests on the streets not just of London but around the country and all the different nations of the UK. More than ever, politicians have our ears open to your message.” While in parliament Thunberg also met the Commons Speaker, John Bercow, as well as the former Labour leader Ed Miliband and the Lib Dem MP Layla Moran. Outside on Parliament Square, more demonstrators supporting the Extinction Rebellion group were massing, with police warning they risked arrest if they did not remain in a certain area and the protest continued after midnight. More than 1,000 people have been arrested amid sit-in protests in London over the past week, which blocked Parliament Square, Oxford Circus and Waterloo Bridge. Activists are still at Marble Arch. More than 10,000 police were deployed to contain and then break up the protests."
"The UK is breaching the Paris agreement on climate change by excluding international aviation and shipping figures from carbon budgets, according to a leading NGO. The Swedish campaigner Greta Thunberg accused the British government this week of “very creative carbon accounting” after the government defended its work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  The UK government does not include emissions from global flights or shipping when it states it has reduced emissions by more than 40% since 1990. Instead, international aviation and shipping are monitored by two UN agencies, but there are growing doubts that – in the case of aviation in particular – the bodies have the power or ability to tackle major transport carbon emitters. Globally, domestic and international flights emitted 895m tonnes of CO2 last year – 2.4% of global energy-related CO2 emissions, according to analysts at Carbon Brief.  Worldwide, aviation is one of the fastest growing sectors for greenhouse gas emissions, which increased by 76.1% between 1990 and 2012, according to the UN’s climate body. Andrew Murphy, of the Transport & Environment NGO, which sits as an observer at the ICAO, the UN agency responsible for international aviation, said this had to change. “Aviation has been kept off the books. If you look at the UK Climate Change Act both international shipping and aviation emissions are kept off the five-year carbon budgets. “We believe the Paris agreement is clear that international aviation and shipping should be included in national climate targets. Paris calls for a bottom-up approach so individual states can include what they want in their budgets. We don’t see this outsourcing of responsibility by governments for international aviation and shipping as consistent with Paris. It breaches the agreement.” The aviation industry is heavily represented at the ICAO, and there is criticism that the agency is too secretive and dominated by countries pursuing their own national interests to make an impact on tackling aviation emissions. Members of the ICAO this year brought in a much heralded system known as Corsia for airlines to report their emissions. The reporting will be two- or three-yearly, and airlines will be required to offset emissions from a 2020 baseline onwards, but full details of how the offsetting will work have not been finalised. It is not yet known whether emissions reported per airline will be made public. Dan Rutherford, from the non-profit International Council on Clean Transportation, said the Corsia system was not about reducing emissions but making airlines offset their impact. But the efficacy of offsetting was “the elephant in the room”, he said, and it would be a logical step for the UK and other nations to account for the emissions in their targets. “It took the aviation industry almost 20 years after the Kyoto agreement to come to some sort of agreement,” he said. “But because of the exemptions built into the system it will only cover about 5% of international aviation between now and 2050, so the impact is very small and then there is the question of offsetting and whether that is really what is needed in the aviation system, and whether the aviation sector really wants to decarbonise.” Alyssa Gilbert, head of policy and translation at the Grantham Institute for climate change and the environment, agrees that it is time for nations to take responsibility for cross-border aviation. “I think it would be a good idea for nations to report on international aviation emissions, if you report on something it makes it visible. It is kind of invisible at the moment,” she said. The UK’s draft aviation policy, published in December, said: “The UK’s trajectory to meeting its Climate Change Act 2050 target is set out in five-yearly carbon budgets that currently exclude emissions from international aviation. However, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), established by the Climate Change Act as the independent advisory body on climate change, recommends that international aviation should be included by 2050.” Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, said the problem of aviation emissions was going to get worse in the UK. “Heathrow, already the biggest point source of carbon in the UK, could soon get 50% bigger, and the draft aviation strategy supports growth at airports all around the UK and anticipates the need for another new runway this side of 2050. “While most sectors have legally binding emissions reductions targets, international aviation and shipping have been left out of carbon budgets so don’t face the same pressure to reduce. “Carbon offsetting has little or no place in a net zero future,” Lucas said. “In reality there’s no escaping the fact that aviation growth and our expectation of cheap flights can’t go on much longer.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterGreenpeace is known for breaking the law, trespassing, putting other people at risk, and chaining its members to drilling platforms to protest and, more importantly, to reap the capital of publicity. That’s one thing – but it’s quite another to recruit, psychologically manipulate, and exploit a child for the purpose waging psychological war on people who have different opinions. Greenpeace is ratcheting up the level of violence.
In the video that follows, posted by a reader at WUWT, Greenpeace instrumentalizes a hooded young boy as a propaganda pawn. The boy’s anger is clearly visible as he threatens and intimidates people with generational conflict. His expressions are militant, like those we see on tapes of crazed Islamic radicals released to publicize their threats. This is the new level of violence, directed and produced by Greenpeace.

Above: The new face of Greenpeace
No pediatricians in their right minds would condone such a use (misuse) of children. The boy is likely damaged behaviorally and socially because of it. Greenpeace needs to reflect on what it has done.
The child has been fed a diet of radical, angry and intolerant ideology; he makes his thinly veiled threats as prompted by his adult instructors. It’s possible the child is only acting out the part, so it’s not so bad – some will claim. But what has it taught him? That anger, intolerance and intimidation are power? That this is the way to reach objectives? And what message does he send to other children? It’s hardly an example of rational discourse. In fact it’s militant, shockingly militant.
The child is not even at an age that would allow him to form a balanced, informed and well thought-out opinion on the issue. Clearly he’s radicalized; he’s been manipulated. Greenpeace has preyed on a very young mind and used it as a psychological instrument of attack. These are methods and tactics which were once normally limited to most radical of religious groups. For sure the boy got pats on the back and high fives from his directors for his performance. The clip, after all, went viral. Aggression rules.
This new quality of violence by Greenpeace is not an isolated incident. The increasingly disturbing level of violence the once peaceful organization has resorted to is demonstrated by a rash of other violent incidents. The trend could not be more troubling. Gone are the days of a real environemtalal concern and peaceful protest.
Actively seeking violent confrontation
Today, Greenpeace purposely goes out and seeks confrontation – not in democratic debate with lawmakers, but in violent and at times bloody collisions with companies or organizations it disagrees with. Not long ago Greenpeace attacked French fishermen, who were minding their own business, working long days to make ends meet. See video here. If you’re against over-fishing, it’s okay. But take the issue up with the responsible lawmakers. That’s the appropriate avenue. Don’t go vandalizing and sabotaging legal businesses and putting families in financial jeopardy.

In another incident, a Greenpeace ship rammed into a Japanese fishing vessel, see below. Greenpeace claims, with the cover of the media, that the accident was the fault of the Japanese vessel. Judge for yourself:

Not long ago a leading Greenpeace official made threats directed at global warming skeptics. Prison Planet writes:
An article carried by the official Greenpeace website written by a Greenpeace member urges climate activists to resort to criminal activity in an effort to reinvigorate momentum for their stalling global warming agenda, while ominously threatening climate skeptics, ‘we know where you live.’
Demands dissenters be charged with high crimes
The promotion of widespread violence has not only been restricted to Greenpeace. Sympathizers like environmentalist staff writer Dave Roberts of Grist Magazine called for the Nuremberg-style trials for the “bastards” who were members of what he termed the global warming “denial industry”.
Then NASA’s James Hansen complains about democracy, and is quoted by the the UK Guardian as saying:
The democratic process doesn’t quite seem to be working.
He called fossil fuel CEOs criminals, not citing any particular law – except his own. Read here. Hansen says:
 In my opinion, these CEOs should be tried for high crimes against humanity and nature.
James Hansen, and former Vice President of the United States, Al Gore, have actively and openly called for civil disobedience.
Clearly they’ve lost all sense of reason and rationale. With such extreme rhetoric and a poisoned environment, it’s no wonder we got someone like James Jay Lee. And unless radicals like Greenpeace sober up and realize the folly and hazard they’ve become, expect worse to come in the future. It’s time to put these well-known radicals under close observation.

Exploding Children For Climate Protection
The British climate protection campaign 10:10 sparked outrage with its bloody video. Because of protest, the clip was removed from its site.
Included is also a news video in German.

Let’s give them credit for that, at least.

"A line in a scientific report about what climate change might mean to the UK, which caused a lot of trouble for this reporter 25 years ago, suggested that warmer summer weather would create conditions for malaria to return to the south and east of England.  The front-page story said that conditions in the UK for Anopheles atroparvus, the indigenous mosquito most likely to carry malaria, were improving so much that the disease could return in about 2020. Critics considered it alarmist.  Since malaria, referred to as the ague, was common enough in the UK to be mentioned nine times in Shakespeare’s plays, it did not seem too far-fetched a claim but it caused a lot of debate. The argument seemed to be that while conditions for mosquitoes were improving, and they are thriving in the UK’s current climate, it would need the misfortune of a human already infected with malaria to be bitten in order to transmit the disease to the insects.  The infected insect would then have to bite another human to spread the disease locally. Since more than a million UK citizens currently go to malaria-infested countries each year and round 1,500 return with the disease it seems we have been lucky so far.  "
"Organisers of the climate protests that have seen peaceful mass civil disobedience across London over the past two weeks have said the first stage of the “rebellion” is drawing to a close. How much of an impact has it had, and how realistic are its goals? The group has three core demands: 1) Tell the truthThe government must tell the truth about the scale of the ecological crisis by declaring a climate emergency, “working with other groups and institutions to communicate the urgent need for change”. 2) Zero emissions by 2025The UK must drastically cut its greenhouse gas emissions, hitting net zero by 2025. 3) Citizens’ assemblyThe government must create a citizens’ assembly to hear evidence and devise policy to tackle the climate crisis. 1) Tell the truthThe notion that politicians should tell the truth about what scientists, the UN and countless other experts say is an existential threat to human survival appears, on the face of it, to be a modest ask. But Extinction Rebellion (XR) point out that no political leaders in any country – certainly the current government in the UK – are being honest with the public about the scale or severity of the threat or what it will realistically take to address it. In this context, they argue, telling the truth is a radical act from which everything else will flow. 2) Zero emissions by 2025Hitting zero carbon emissions by 2025 represents a huge, some say an almost impossible, challenge. It would require a complete overhaul of the way we are organised as a society in just six years – fundamentally changing everything from transport to domestic and industrial energy systems, food production to overall levels of consumption. The UK’s Committee on Climate Change has currently set the target of an 80% reduction by 2050. XR and its supporters say rather than being guided by what is deemed “politically possible”, policy must now be driven by what is scientifically necessary. And they point out that the chaos of failing to tackle the crisis will dwarf any disruption caused by acting now. 3) Citizens’ assemblyA citizens’ assembly would, say advocates, help lend public legitimacy to what will need to be a radical overhaul of the economy and our society. It has been used successfully elsewhere – including in Ireland in 2016 on the issue of abortion – and could bypass the party political point-scoring in Westminster. Critics argue that the last thing the UK needs is a parallel government confusing an already chaotic democratic process that is struggling to deal with Brexit. Others, particularly on the Labour left, argue it is possible to meet the challenge through the existing political framework if radical enough policies are pursued. The short answer is no. But in each area progress is visible. 1) Telling the truthPartly through pressure from XR, scores of councils and local authorities in the UK have declared a climate emergency in recent months – as has the Labour party. Increasing numbers of politicians – certainly on the opposition benches – acknowledge that this is the biggest challenge facing humanity. However, the Conservative government in the UK has repeatedly dragged its feet. This week, during an urgent question tabled by Labour, the energy minister Claire Perry rejected the idea of declaring a climate emergency, saying: “I don’t know what that would entail.” She said she had reservations about the Extinction Rebellion protests: “I worry that many of the messages we are hearing ignore the progress that is being made, and as such make people fearful for the future rather than hopeful.” 2) Zero emissions by 2025The UK is nowhere near hitting zero emissions by 2045, never mind 2025. But the fact that this demand is now out there has changed the parameters of the debate. This week, confronted by XR protesters outside parliament, Labour’s Diane Abbott said MPs needed to come together to host a “broad conversation” about hitting net zero by 2025. “I think that things can change … on climate change and we can move towards the 2025 target,” she told them. Next week the Committee on Climate Change will announce its revised targets for the UK, including when the country should aim to reach net zero emissions. 3) Citizens’ assemblyThere is no sign at the moment that the government intends to set up a citizens’ assembly to address the climate crisis. A few Labour MPs – including Stella Creasy and Jon Ashworth – have backed the idea but certainly for now, it has not gained any real traction in Westminster. For many the peaceful mass protests of the last week have been transformational. Media coverage of the action has been widespread. The truth about the climate crisis – and the existential threat it poses to humanity – is, campaigners argue, now in the public domain and can no longer be ignored by those in power.  The language around climate change has also changed. Words like “extinction”, “rebellion”, “crisis” and “breakdown” are now part of everyday conversations when discussing the environmental threat. But perhaps most importantly what is deemed “politically realistic” has changed. In the eyes of many seasoned observers, the past two weeks represent a “tipping point”, with the Extinction Rebellion protests coinciding with more school strikes for the climate, the BBC’s David Attenborough documentary, and Mark Carney telling bankers they can no longer ignore the threat. The question now is whether politicians are prepared to rise to the challenge."
"Up to 400 Extinction Rebellion activists have been stopping traffic in moving protests across the City of London to highlight the role of the finance industry in fuelling climate change. Protesters are periodically forming human blockades across roads in the capital’s financial hub, occupying the street and halting traffic for seven minutes before allowing vehicles to pass, and then repeating the action. Traffic on Fleet Street was brought to a standstill for several hours after activists obstructed the road outside Goldman Sachs. A dozen protesters lay on the floor and connected their arms with tubes, blocking up to 30 buses and several cars as they called on the financial sector to divest from the fossil fuel industry. One of the activists on the ground was Cleo Peterson, 33, who seemed unfazed when a police officer told her she was going to be arrested, saying: “I want it on my record as a human being.” Other groups targeted junctions outside Bank station, King William Street, near Rothschild & Co, and Fleet Street. One protester held up a sign that read “Sorry for the delay, we won’t be long”, as about 40 people blocked Upper Thames Street, near London Bridge. Jane Goodland, 29, a maths teacher from Cambridge, said the so-called swarming protests allow small groups of people to cause disruption, while attempting to have engaging conversations with drivers to increase awareness of their cause. “We’ve targeted the financial sector because we believe the economic system in this country is part of the problem,” she said. Augusta Hull, 48, a massage therapist from north London, said: “It’s my first time swarming, but I’m out here because we have a climate and ecological crisis. I’ve been with Extinction Rebellion all week and have been inspired by the way they do things, the non-violence, the support of protesters when they’re being arrested, and the focus on love of the planet.” The environmental group said it was the last day of action before choosing to end its campaign of peaceful mass civil disobedience, following actions that led to hundreds of people being arrested and thousands of police officers deployed to sites occupied by the group for more than a week. Earlier on Thursday, climate change activists glued themselves to the entrances of the London Stock Exchange wearing LED signs saying “Climate emergency”, “Tell the truth” and “You can’t eat money”. Simultaneously, protesters in east London climbed on top of a train at Canary Wharf holding signs including “business as usual = death”, in what the group said was a reference to “the financial sector’s role in our collective suicide”. Protesters at both sites were later removed by police and five people were arrested at Canary Wharf. Among the protesters at Canary Wharf was Phil Kingston, an 83-year-old grandfather who has been involved in multiple direct action protests. One of the first members of Extinction Rebellion, he gained notoriety after chaining himself to a pipe in Oxford Circus. “Like all parents and grandparents, I want a future,” he said. He expressed his concern over the impact of climate change on the poorest people, arguing they would be most affected by ecological collapse. “Everything is going to have to shift,” he added, eating a sandwich on top of the train. Diana Warner, 60, a retired GP, had superglued herself to the train. “I’ve done it because, what else can I do? I want to speak up for all of our children. I also want to speak up for those who are losing their land now, and those who aren’t able to get enough food,” she said. Police detached Warner from the train and arrested her. When asked whether she was scared of being put in remand for a long period of time, Warner said no. “It made it more necessary to be here. We are part of them and they are part of us. We all need to survive. Some people can see it, understand it, and feel with compassion that we need to prevent more death and catastrophe, but there are many who don’t.” There were mixed responses from the public towards the demonstrations. One female bus driver, who did not want to be named, said she had been waiting for an hour for the protesters to move. “They have the right to protest, but it’s not fair for the public who want to go to work. They made their point and it’s been over a week. We all care about climate change, but people have to get to work,” she said. BREAKING: Time for MONEY to tell the truth on its role on the Climate and Ecological Emergency Extinction Rebellion UK is hitting the financial industry today to demand they tell the truth about the devastating impact the industry has on our planet. #lse #rebelforlife pic.twitter.com/zqof4bkCbR Grant, a support services assistant, said: “Climate change is a bigger issue than a lot of politicians are making out and I think something does need to be done about it. Most of the people hanging around here do have kids they need to leave the world to, yet they’re not really considering it.” The protest follows similar action last Wednesday in which Cathy Eastburn, 51, from south London, Mark Ovland, 35, from Somerton in Somerset, and Luke Watson, 29, from Manuden in Essex, were remanded in custody until their trial in May, after they were charged with obstructing trains or carriages on the railway by an unlawful act, contrary to section 36 of the Malicious Damage Act 1861. On Wednesday, the London protesters agreed to remove blockades and campsites at Marble Arch and Parliament Square. The group, which has been backed by senior academics, politicians and scientists, said in a statement that it would leave its remaining blockades on Thursday, but added: “The world has changed … A space for truth-telling has been opened up. “Now it is time to bring this telling of the truth to communities around London, the regions and nations of the UK, and internationally. In this age of misinformation, there is power in telling the truth.” The group said it would like to “thank Londoners for opening their hearts and demonstrating their willingness to act on that truth”. The statement added: “We know we have disrupted your lives. We do not do this lightly. We only do this because this is an emergency.” The activists said protesters had “taken to the streets and raised the alarm” in more than 80 cities in 33 countries. “People are talking about the climate and ecological emergency in ways that we never imagined,” they said. The group said it would work to build up a resilient movement to force politicians to address the climate crisis. The move came as it emerged the environment secretary, Michael Gove, had agreed to the meet representatives of the group. A spokesperson for XR said this was “totally unconnected” to its decision to end the current phase of the protests, adding that the meeting was under consideration. “It may or may not go ahead, depending on the details of how public it is and who will be attending,” they said. Support for Extinction Rebellion has quadrupled in the past nine days as public concern about the scale of the ecological crisis grows. Since the protests began last Monday, 40,000 new backers or volunteers have offered support to the group. In the same period, it has raised almost £200,000 – mostly in small donations of between £10 and £50 – making a total of £365,000 since January."

Share this...FacebookTwitterUPDATE: Edward has just notified me that the Telegraph report was written in 2008! Sorry about that. It got by me.
But hey, it goes to show that the waxwings were right! Winter 2008-2009 turned out to be a harsh one.
My excuse: I wrote the post late last night after having a little fine whiskey with a mate of mine. Surely you can excuse that.
————————————————————-
The UK daily Telegraph has a piece on waxwing birds invading Britain, which means the winter may be a cold one. I wonder if Joe Bastardi takes such factors into account when formulating his seasonal forecasts.
H/T: NTZ reader: Edward.
In my last post I wrote about natural, “non-scientific” indicators for winter forecasting, which are often more accurate than models. The Telegraph piece is just another one to add to that list. So far I haven’t seen many signs that the coming winter will be warm, except that is for the worn out warnings propagated by the warmists and their goofy “models”.
The Telegraph writes:
The birds, from Scandinavia, have appeared all along the east coast of Scotland and England, and have been moving steadily south and west in search of food.

Gee, I thought global warming was supposed to force species further north, and not south. Actually, weren’t we told species were just too stupid to move, and would just die and become extinct. The Telegraph:
Although they are occasional visitors to the UK, the numbers this year are unusually high and have been classed as an “irruption”, to signify a large-scale arrival of a bird not normally found here.
It’s got to be climate change! Yeah, that’s it. Add waxwing birds to the list of things caused by global warming. I bet it aint on the list. Anyway:
Irruptions, or “invasions”, are prompted by failures of berry crops in Scandinavia.
Scandinavia did not have the warmest of summers this year, and light frosts have already hit the region. Good thing that birds are smart enough to adapt and move, and not stay stupid like warmists and just sit there, and rain-dance instead. And, says the Telegraph:
In the UK, large numbers have traditionally been linked to a cold, hard winter.
Another one! Man – I thought cold winters were suppose to be rare, and exciting.
All this of course is anecdotal, and it does not mean that the winter will be cold. It may be just another piece of evidence to support the claim the winter in Europe may be harsh.
And recently, another dodo-bird German scientist said that global warming will mean colder winters for Europe, and so maybe it will be a cold winter for sure. So if it’s cold out this winter – blame it on AGW.
Do read the Telegraph piece. It’s a good article for bird lovers (like my cat Hayli).

Forget all the satellite photos, charts, meteorologists and their reams of data – and especially all the computer models forecasting barbecue winters – or  barbecue summers. (Right now it seems most computer models are projecting a freezer-winter for the northern hemisphere and Arctic regions).
When you talk to people who make their living working outdoors, like farmers, fishermen, etc., especially the old-timers, they sometimes have ways of making seasonal forecasts that seem just as accurate, if not more accurate, than all them super-computer-satellite generated forecasts. Just ask Hadley!
As a kid in Vermont in Northern New England, I recall hearing that heavy fogs in late summer were a sign of an upcoming snowy winter.
Well, this also appears to be a rule for North Carolina too, read August Fogs Could Mean Lots Of Snow. Here Jason Gilmer writes:

There’s an old wives’ tale that says the number of fogs on August mornings are the same as the number of snows in the winter. According to some reports, there were anywhere between 14 and 31 foggy mornings in August.

It looks like we are going to get the chance to test that theory, at least this winter anyway. Fill up the jar with beans.
And according to Gilmer, SkiSoutheast.com’s Mike Doplehas, who has been covering the ski slopes in the area for 15 years, says this was the first year that each morning has been foggy.
”That much snow would make for another great ski season, he said. ‘

The Farmer’s Almanac also forecasts a harsh winter, according to Jason Gilmer:
Farmers’ Almanac gives these other ways to determine the severity of the winter: the thickness of onion skins, lots of acorns, a small orange band on a wooly worm, pigs gathering sticks and trees laden with leaves late in the fall.
Bauernregeln
Germany is big on so-called Bauernregeln: farmer rules for the weather. Here’s a list Bauernregeln in German, and a few I’ve selected for the coming winter:
1. Jakobi ohne Regen, deutet auf strengen Winter – Jakobi klar und rein, wird’s Christfest frostig sein. In English: “A Jacobi (July 25) without rain means a hard winter.” A Jacobi that’s clear and clean, means Christmas will be frosty.
Here it was sunny and dry. So it looks like a cold winter.
2. Bringt der August viel Gewitter, wird der Winter kalt und bitter. In English: “If August brings a lot of thunder, then the winter will be cold and bitter.”
Last August was cool and wet, but not much thunder. I guess it could mean a cold winter.
3. Tragt der Has’ lang sein Sommerkleid, ist der Winter noch sehr weit. In English: “If the hare wears its summer fur for a long time, then the winter is still far off.”
4. Ist der November kalt und klar, wird trüb und mild der Januar. In English: “If November is cold and clear, then January will be mild and gray.”
And I’ve noticed our cat Hayli has had a voracious appetite lately, constantly hanging out near her food bowl and yowling for more food. It’s autumn and nature is telling her to fatten up for the winter. This time around nature is screaming at her to do so.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’m alerted by Tom Nelson’s blog of a ZDF German television clip featuring Hans von Storch and Ottmar Edenhofer.  Edenhofer is a researcher at the Potsdamer Institute for Climate Impact Research, which is headed by Prof Doom & Gloom Hans Joachim Schellnhuber and his underling Stefan Rahmstorf. Need I say more?
ZDF clip here (in German)
The ZDF starts out by introducing the 100+ page IAC report, which was critical of how the IPCC worked and how fundamental reforms are required, and also on how other scientific views have to be included. Hans von Storch’s first comment:
Time and again there have been cases where the complete range of scientific knowledge was not included. The task of the IPCC is not to declare the truth about climate change, but the truth about the knowledge on climate change.
Ottmar Edenhofer on the other hand, sees the situation as far less serious, and attempts to play down the IAC’s findings.

I simply do not agree with the claim that the IPCC knowingly kept out knowledge that it found inconvenient, that didn’t fit the overall narrative. For that, also the team of authors was simply too heterogeneous in the past.

Already the first comment out of Edenhofer’s mouth provoked a harsh reaction from Richard Tol here:
The first remark by Edenhofer is a lie. Edenhofer was a lead author in AR4 WG3. That chapter does not reflect the literature. Papers that were at odds with the IPCC authors’ viewpoints were omitted or cited incorrectly.
Here’s the background on why Tol accused Edenhofer of lying. Edenhofer selected gray literature over peer-reviewed literature.Edenhofer does admit that the Himalayan glaciers blunder was embarrassing and regrettable,  and that the use of gray literature has to be restricted to a minimum. Hans von Storch adds (paraphrasing):
I would ban all literature that comes from interest groups like environmental organisations, re-insurers and energy companies.
On The IPCC getting involved with political advocacy, Edenhofer agreed that it has happened in the past, and that it should not occur. He recommends that a code of conduct ought to be followed.
That’s an understatement. How about just bringing in new personnel?
The IPCC has at least taken the first step in an attempt to reform, says the ZDF clip. It has invited von Storch to be a lead author for the next IPCC report.
Hans von Storch is a luke-warmer to warmist scientist, but we can expect him to be, as his website claims, an “honest broker”.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMy local newspaper Osnabruecker Zeitung (OZ) has an online story here about the dramatic ARCTIC sea ice melting in June. This is typical of German media climate reporting. The introduction reads:
Arctic sea ice last month melted faster than in any June since measurements have been taken, since 1979. 88,000 square kilometers of white area disappeared daily, reports the American NSIDC in Boulder.
The OZ peppers the story with dramatic details like:
Also the extent of northern ice this June reached a record low average of 10.87 million sq km. According to the NSIDC, this ice area is 190,000 sq km below the previous June record set in 2006.
The air temperature is very high, and the ice continues to melt very rapidly.
The OZ then brings in the WWF as experts and polar bears for emotion to round out the propoganda effect.
So let’s stop right here. This is why it’s so important to keep an eye on the 11 Climatic Indicators which I have provided on the right side of my homepage. They allow a sure way to quickly debunk all media climate propaganda. The 11 Climatic Indicators are links to updated charts and graphs that treehuggers and alarmists don’t want you to see.

ARCTIC TEMPERATURES
Have Arctic temps really been very high lately? Judge for yourself, see below, or click here:
Arctic temps
Clearly the chart shows that since the start of June temperatures in the Arctic over 80°N latitude have not been “very high”. Most of the melting ice was ice that had formed in the cold late spring at lower latitudes.
CURRENT MELTING RATE
What about the claim that Arctic ice is melting rapidly now. Again, look at the chart under my 11 Climatic Indicators as follows or, click here (Sea Ice Arctic IJIS).
Arctic Sea Ice
If you look closely you’ll observe a few things: 1) There was a record high ice extent in April, 2) the ice indeed melted rapidly in May and June, but 3) the melting rate has slowed down considerably over the last 10 days, averaging only 59,000 sq km – something the media forgets to mention.
TOTAL GLOBAL SEA ICE
The media also forgot to mention that total global sea ice is dead-on normal, see next chart. They completely ignore Antarctica at the South Pole. Here’s where total sea ice stands now. It’s actually been increasing over the last few years.
Total sea ice, north and south poles
Now let’s take a look at what the sea ice in Antarctica alone is doing, see below or click here. Indeed Antarctic sea ice is near a record high!
Antarctic sea ice anomaly. Sea ice extent is far above average and trending upwards. 
Moreover, look at the trend (blue line which I eyeballed in) over the last 25 years or so. Have we heard any reports about that? Perhaps the journalists at the OZ ought to take a closer look.

"As the last Extinction Rebellion protesters were cleared from Waterloo Bridge on Sunday night, many moved on to sites at Marble Arch and Parliament Square, marking a week-long occupation in London mirrored in 33 other countries. The protests have been met with both resounding support and disapproval. Still, millions of people have now heard their call for transformative and urgent change to avoid climate catastrophe. It’s a message echoed by Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish environmental activist, who is speaking in parliament on Tuesday, and the young people across the world who continue to strike from school each Friday. The climate conversation has now gone mainstream; earlier in the week the BBC aired a primetime documentary from David Attenborough, Climate Change: The Facts, while Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, warned the global financial system faces an existential threat from climate change. It feels as though the message about the climate emergency is being pushed further than ever before. We want to know how you have been affected by this movement in the UK. Has it opened your eyes to the climate issue? Have the school strikes and Extinction Rebellion protests changed your perspective and understanding of the climate emergency? What are the reactions of people around you? Have you and others reacted positively or negatively? Do you feel hopeful or frightened for the future?

WUWT following up on my posts a day or two later seems to be becoming a trend over there.
The NOAA is taking the liberty of declaring 2010 the hottest ever, even though it’s only July! So what’s all the hurry? Well, you have to get them scary global-hotting headlines out while you can, and any way you can. When you’re desperate – you’re desperate.
They’ve seen their own forecasts for the rest of the year, and so they know it’s their last chance. Just check the leading climatic indicators on my homepage and you’ll see why.
Now on Arctic sea ice, allow me to use the same NOAA “scientific” method and declare that the Arctic has experienced the slowest July ice melt ever! (Well, at least  so far).
Look at the ice melts from June 30 – July 15 for the following years, taken from AMSR-E.
                 Sea ice melt                
Year      6/30 to 7/15                Daily rate
2002     1.126 million sq km     75,000 sq km / day
2003     1.014                                  67,000
2004     1.019                                  68,000
2005     1.152                                  77,000
2006     1.210                                  80,000
2007     1.742                               116,000
2008     1.216                                   81,000
2009     1.413                                   94,000
2010    0.807                                54,000
Never has ice melted so slowly in mid summer as it has this year. Indeed sea ice melt in July 2010 is less than half the melt rate in 2007. It’s far below anything we’ve seen on record. Would the NOAA already call it a record low melt for the month?
And as Lubos Motl pointed out 3 days ago here, total global sea ice is above normal. Also see here. Indeed sea ice is rebounding, and surprisingly just at a time when  it’s supposively the “hottest ever”.  Someone is wrong, obviously.
Do you think anyone in the media is going to run this story?

"An increasing number of Americans live in places with unhealthy levels of smog or particulate air pollution – both of which are being made worse by climate change, according to a new report.  Air quality in the US has been improving since the 1970s, but that progress may be backsliding and 43% of Americans are now living in places where they are breathing unsafe air, according to the American Lung Association report.  As temperatures rise, wildfires are getting worse and spewing smoke across the west. And more smog, or ozone, is forming on warmer days.  For the three hottest years on record, 2015 through 2017, about 141 million people lived in US counties that saw unhealthy levels of particle pollution, either in a single 24-hour period or over a year, or unhealthy levels of smog. That is 7 million more people than in the group’s last report. “We’re seeing in this year’s report the impacts of climate change on air quality in really stunning terms,” said Paul Billings, a vice-president for the association. Top 10 U.S. Cities Most Polluted by Year-Round Particle Pollution (Annual PM2.5) Top 10 U.S. Cities Most Polluted by Short-Term Particle Pollution (24-hour PM2.5): Top 10 Most Smog-Polluted Cities: Source: American Lung Association's 2019 State of the Air Report  Eight communities set records for days with spikes in particle pollution, surpassing the group’s data back to 2001, Billings said. Western wildfires might be to blame for much of the uptick, and next year’s report counting 2018 is expected to be even worse, he said. In California, Bakersfield and the Fresno area had among the worst air quality in the country, according to all three measurements. Los Angeles continued to rank worst for smog. Fairbanks, Alaska, ranked third for particle pollution, probably because so many people burn wood to heat their homes. The report is the health advocacy group’s annual assessment of government data. Both smog and particle pollution are linked with breathing problems, lung and heart complications and early deaths. Smog occurs when sunlight reacts with gases from cars and power plants. Particle pollution also comes from burning fossil fuels, as well as from burning wood in fireplaces or stoves, and from wildfires. The federal government’s National Climate Assessment explains that smog levels can increase with warmer days and both smog and particle pollution can increase when weather is stagnant. Worse droughts could also lead to more wind-blown dust. Air pollution has fallen for decades in the US, due to pollution laws like the 1970 Clean Air Act and the use of less coal and more natural gas. One 2018 study found that deaths from air pollution in the US were cut in half between 1990 and 2010. But they still accounted for one out of every 35 deaths – more than from traffic accidents and shootings combined. In comparison, more than 5.5 billion people worldwide, 75% of the population, live in places that do not meet the World Health Organization standard for limiting particle pollution, according to the University of Chicago. The Trump administration has sought to roll back Obama-era environmental progress, including on air and climate pollution regulations, such as rules for power plants and cars. Miles Keogh, the executive director for the National Association of State Air Agencies, said weakening air standards would mean “walking away from a winning strategy”. “We’ve got the tools here,” Keogh said. “We’ve got to use them to shore it up, adapt them to a changing climate and not walk away from things that work.”"

"The outrage of the students striking from school over climate change inaction is “certainly justified”, according to Sir David Attenborough, who said older generations had done terrible damage to the planet. In an interview with the former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres, the broadcaster and naturalist dismissed critics of the widely praised global movement of school strikes as cynics. “[Young people] understand the simple discoveries of science about our dependence upon the natural world,” he said. “My generation is no great example for understanding – we have done terrible things.” The protests by young people were enormously encouraging, Attenborough said. “That is the one big reason I have for feeling we are making progress. If we were not making progress with young people, we are done.” However, asked about the world his great-grandchildren will live in, he said: “I don’t spend time thinking about that because I can’t bear it. I’m just coming up to 93, and so I don’t have many more years around here. I find it difficult to think beyond that because the signs aren’t good.” On Friday, the youth strikes will continue with protests expected in 485 towns and cities in 72 countries, according to the Fridays for Future website. Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teenager whose solo strike sparked the worldwide action, told politicians this week: “You lied to us. You gave us false hope.” “Their outrage is certainly justified, there is no doubt about that,” Attenborough told Figueres, who delivered the landmark Paris climate change agreement in 2015. “There will be cynics who try to dismiss [the school strikers] and say they don’t understand the world and how it works,” Attenborough said in the interview, released in a podcast on Friday by Figueres’s Global Optimism group. “Young people may lack experience but they also have clear sight.” “They can see perhaps more clearly than the rest of us who have been around for some time,’” he said. “We older ones should take notice of what they say.” Global warming is already increasing the frequency of damaging extreme weather. The world’s scientists say sharp falls in carbon emissions are urgently needed to deliver a 50% cut by 2030 and avoid worse droughts, floods, extreme heatwaves and poverty for hundreds of millions of people. However, emissions are still rising. Wildlife is also being annihilated by human actions, with animal populations having fallen by an average of 60% since 1970. Attenborough recently presented a primetime BBC documentary, Climate Change - The Facts, which was watched live by almost 3 million people in the UK. “The scientific evidence is that if we have not taken dramatic action within the next decade, we could face irreversible damage to the natural world and the collapse of our societies,” he said in the show. Attenborough told Figueres action to stop climate change and the destruction of the wildlife was essential: “We have no option, if we want to survive. We have a [moral] obligation on our shoulders and it would be to our deep eternal shame if we fail to acknowledge that.” Figueres, who works with Global Optimism to create social and environmental change, said: “Greta and the other young people are justifiably furious with us. They say we have been at this for 30 years and we still haven’t solved this. Young people are calling us adults to account.” “We now know we can do it: we know we have the technology, the finance [and] the policies,” she said. “The outrage is about how is it possible that, knowing that we can do it, we are not doing it fast enough?” Figueres said that sense of outrage needed to be harnessed to speed up the required transformation to a zero-emission world. She has also backed the Extinction Rebellion protests that ended on Thursday after a week of peaceful direct action in the UK. “Civil disobedience happens when the injustice gets too great,” she said. “That is where we are.” Thunberg resumed her strike outside the Swedish parliament on Friday for the 36th week. The youth strikes now span the globe, stretching from Australia, Japan and Pakistan to Germany, the UK and US. In Islamabad, protesters held homemade banners reading “Don’t burn our future” and “Raise your voice not sea level”. In Bilbao, Spain, another read: “The planet is screaming in pain and we are deaf.”"
"Ian Birrell seems content to mix Asperger’s with autism in considering the diagnostic ramifications of certain pervasive developmental disorders (Opinion, 23 April). He can perhaps be forgiven, on the basis that the terms are now mutually self-inclusive across clinical as well as common parlance scopes of reference. As he might well be aware, the term Asperger’s has been erased from the most recent edition of the diagnostic manual (DSM-5) – itself in continuous flux of conjecture and opprobrium. It’s a pity that either term still prevails, as both are misleading, confusing and carelessly non-specific, poorly serving any person thus labelled. Given that these terms collate and corral a wide spectrum of behaviours, abilities and challenges, why they persist is unfathomable.  Having worked for several years in this challenging area of personal need, I feel that the innate humanity and individuated personality of those foisted with such “diagnoses” is smothered and camouflaged by the imposition of meaningless terminology. Such classifications merely spawn a retrograde claustrophobia, ensuring a blinkered appraisal of need and misguided cultivation of inappropriate nurture. Rightly approving of Greta Thunberg’s rise to global influence, Mr Birrell might want to seek out some further relevant and authentic commentary on the matter from the writings of child and adolescent psychiatrist Sami Timimi. His book The Myth of Autism offers a vital ray of illumination, highlighting the nuanced realities pertaining, promoting a creatively open dispensation beyond useless diagnostic labels. Let children live and adults thrive within a shared communalism of easy tolerance and respectful generosity of spirit. After all, every one of us hovers somewhere along the autistic spectrum, if one insists on allowing that term at all. Thus it is rendered obsolete.Jim CosgroveSenior music therapist, Lismore, County Waterford • Responses to the above letter: How a diagnosis of autism can be your moment of liberation"

Share this...FacebookTwitterDer Spiegel reports here on Russia’s extreme heat that’s has contributed to higher death rates and wildfires, plunging Moscow into a thick, choking smog. Hat-tip to reader DirkH.
The following NASA photo shows where it’s hot, and where it’s cool.
So far 7600 km² have burned. NASA’s Terra satellite shows that the fires began in later July, when temperatures in the areas were 12°C and more above normal. One sees how the heat is concentrated in one spot, while the remainder of the continental area is near normal or even cool. Russian meteorologists say they are unable to find anything in the archives that compares to this, not in the last 1000 years.
While warmists are quick to pin the blame on climate change,  others point out that the fires have other primary causes. Der Spiegel writes that much of the blame for the catastrophe goes to the authorities and mismanagement of forests:

Forest fire experts say the authorities also get most of the blame for the catastrophe. Large fires like this one in Russia are caused primarily by man.

According to Johann Goldammer of the Max-Planck Institute for Chemistry at the University of Freiburg:

 There is no evidence that the fires ignited by themselves because of the drought.

Goldammer says that excessive deforestation of the landscape may be a factor in the fires because they leave barren steppe-like landscapes that tend to dry out quickly and become a tinderbox.
But then Goldammer’s makes the dubious claim that this was caused by the fact that the forests had been put into private hands, and then recommends Soviet-style land use!

It has something to do with sustainable land use, like land-use in the old Soviet Union, where it was much more efficient than today.

Now that’s the way to solve problems. I suggest Goldammer read up on how the Soviets managed to run the entire country into the ground.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman sceptic site Readers Edition has a good story today about the Alpha Ventus windpark, Germany’s first offshore windpark, which officially started up with much media hype last April. It’s made up of twelve 5-MW turbines. It’s a €250-million pilot project that serves to spearhead several other coastal power plants in the coming years.The wind farm is operated by energy companies Eon, Vattenfall and EWE and is supposed to provide power to about 50,000 households. The project has been heavily criticised by environmentalists because of its threat to migratory birds.
But for now environmental problems are the least of concerns for the project’s backers. Technical problems have hampered the project from the get-go. Today it has been reported that two of the twelve wind turbines had been shut down for weeks.
Originally estimated to cost €189 million, the Alpha Ventus park has been plagued by cost overruns and delays.  In late summer and autumn of 2008, bad weather made installation of the first 6 turbines impossible.  Then the equipment to install the monster turbines was not available. Next there were major problems with the transformer facilities.
A few weeks ago the temperature of the bearings in the turbine made by Areva Multibrid was too high and thus they had to be taken out of operation. Now the turbines have to be removed from their 500+ ft. high towers and the bearings have to be replaced. Repair works will take weeks and extend into late summer. It’s still unclear if the other four of the Multibrid turbines have a problem. The remaining 6 turbines are made by Repower and are reported to be running smoothly. There are no reports on how high the costs for the troublesome dismantling and repair works will run.
And if that weren’t bad enough, the construction works on the massive Bard Offshore 1 commercial windparks have been delayed as a 300-foot foundation column crashed onto the construction ship Wind Lift 1 three weeks ago. Now other turbines have to be thoroughly inspected. The Bard project foresees the installation of 320 five-megawatt class turbines over the coming years. The cost for the first 80 Bard turbines alone is climbing far beyond original estimates. First they were estimated to cost over €500 million. Now it’s estimated costs will exceed a billion euros. German online newspaper projects the costs will even reach €1.2 billion.
The promoters of the offshore projects cannot say they weren’t warned of the risks of installing windparks in the North Sea’s harsh conditions. The Nysted offshore windpark and Horns Rev park in Denmark are examples, and have struggled with big problems. For example in 2007 a transformer malfunction occurred at Nysted just 4 years after being commissioned, causing a months-long shutdown. At the Horns Rev windpark there were problems with the turbines only 2 years after they had gone into operation. World leading turbine manufacturer Vestas had to remove all 80 turbines, haul them onshore and perform extensive repairs. Luckily these turbines were only of the smaller 2 to 2.3-MW class, and so much easier to do repair works. Repairs and maintenance on the 5-MW monsters will be much tougher and expensive.
But as long as windpark companies continue to have the full backing of wasteful governments, costs won’t matter.
UPDATE, 17 June 2010: I’m delighted to see one of my favourites, James Delingpole, has featured this post at his blog here. Thanks!

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German online news magazine FOCUS reports here today that a new record low temperature has been set at a station in Antarctica.
The Neumayer III station, operated by Germany’s Alfred Wegener Institute, has recorded the lowest temperature at their Antarctic location since the start of operations there 29 years ago. The mercury dropped to -50.2°C.
According to polar meteorologist Gert König-Langlo of the Neumayer III, such similarly low temperatures have been recorded only 10 times since Neumayer operations began at this location. Says König-Langlo:
This is the first time we’ve gone under the minus 50 degree mark.
The Neumayer III is located on the approximately 200-meter thick Ekstrom Ice Shelf. The station is moving with the shelf ice at about 200 meters per year in the direction of the open sea.FOCUS online is quick to point out that this record cold is not a sign of climate change, but rather it is a local regional weather phenomenon (only warm events are signs of climate change).
According to König-Langlo:
The cause was the ongoing cloudless and very low wind weather conditions, which is rare in the region. A light breeze is enough to put an end to the phenomenon.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGreenpeace activists, in yet another reckless stunt to get on TV and in newspapers, stormed an oil drilling platform off the coast of Greenland, reports Der Spiegel here.  According to Der Spiegel, the intrusion forced an unplanned stop in drilling operation.
Whenever a drilling rig is forced to stop operation, it’s expensive. I can’t imagine what these crazed idiots say when storming a platform. “Stop! We’re here to save the planet! Stop drilling in the name of the planet!”
Anyway, Der Spiegel writes:
Four activists of the environmental organisation climbed onto the oil platform in order to protest the test drilling. Scottish company Cairn Energy stopped their work in response, reported the environmental activists.
“Sure lads, whatever you say”.
The Danish police were not amused. They now threaten the planet-rescuers with consequences. Morten Nielsen, Vice Chief of the Greenland Police:
Laws were broken; those responsible will be punished.

Let’s hope. In the meantime, the activists have chained themselves to the platform, and have enough provisions with them to last four days. They say:
 We have to stop our dependency on oil!
I wonder if they themselves paddle their Esperanza ship as they joyride around Greenland. And I’m sure there are hundreds of activists on-board on exercise bikes all pedalling away to produce the electricity the boat needs. Surely Greenpeace broke its dependency on oil a long time ago. Maybe it’s time to do research on the journeys and footprint of the Greenpeace fleet.
Also Greenland Prime Minister Kuupik Kleist had little sympathy for the publicity-seeking activists, reports Der Spiegel, calling their actions an “openly illegal act” and a “gross violation of safety laws”. It is, he says:
really worrying that Greenpeace, with the sole intention of getting publicity in the media, would employ such efforts to break every safety rule in order to protect people and the environment.
Greenpeace intends to exploit the BP Deep Horizon accident to the max, and take advantage of the sour public mood with oil companies. They want to show how dangerous oil drilling is for the environment. Says Tzeporah Berman at Greenpeace headquarters:
The confrontation in the Arctic is only the start.

"Greta Thunberg took her climate message to the heart of power in Westminster on Tuesday, with a quiet but powerful message to MPs that prompted politicians to declare contrition for their failure to act. After the noise of Brexit in parliament and the disruption of Extinction Rebellion outside, the 16-year-old Swedish activist cut an extraordinarily composed figure as she arrived with her trademark braids, hand-painted placard and a speech that forced politicians to reflect on a crisis that is growing steadily worse despite three decades of political promises. “This ongoing irresponsible behaviour will no doubt be remembered in history as one of the greatest failures of humankind,” she told the packed audience of MPs, officials and fellow school strikers. “You lied to us. You gave us false hope. You told us that the future was something to look forward to.” There was no let-up for the audience. The UK, she said, was very special due to its “mind-blowing historical carbon debt”, a reference to the country’s record as the birthplace of industrialisation. But this was also, she said, because its claims of world-leading progress on cutting emissions are partly the result of “creative accounting” and are belied by the government’s plans for more high-emissions projects. “The UK’s active current support of new exploitation of fossil fuels, like for example the UK shale gas fracking industry, the expansion of its North Sea oil and gas fields, the expansion of airports, as well as the planning permission for a brand new coalmine, is beyond absurd,” she said. She finished to a standing ovation and cheers, then sat quietly as the panel of senior politicians gave their responses. Several appeared chastened. “Your voice – still, calm and clear – is like the voice of our conscience,” said the environment secretary, Michael Gove. “When I listened to you, I felt great admiration, but also responsibility and guilt. I am of your parents’ generation, and I recognise that we haven’t done nearly enough to address climate change and the broader environmental crisis that we helped to create.” Ed Miliband, the Labour politician who led the UK’s delegation to the 2009 Copenhagen climate summit and oversaw the UK Climate Act, said he recognised that what was done in the past has been proven by science not to be enough. “You have woken us up. We thank you. All the young people who have gone on strike have held up a mirror to our society … you have taught us all a really important lesson. You have stood out from the crowd.” Thunberg listened attentively, applauding only when a member of audience criticised the government for pushing ahead with fracking. Her mantra when dealing with governments has been consistent: Never mind the words. Nothing matters apart from actions to halt emissions. The big test on this will come on 2 May, when the climate change committee announces the results of a review of the UK’s targets, including when the country should aim to reach net zero emissions. This was prompted by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report last year, which warned of the dangers of global warming exceeding 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The recent surge of demands for more ambition – on the streets, from the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, and from David Attenborough – have helped to amplify the message that Greta and others are stressing with their climate strikes. Tuesday saw other signs of progress that would have been hard to imagine a year ago. Caroline Lucas, the former leader of the Green party, announced that during Greta’s meeting with party leaders earlier in the day, participants – including Jeremy Corbyn and Ian Blackford – had agreed to start regular cross-party meetings on climate policy, to open consultations with youth climate activists and to have an independent body assess whether party manifestos were in line with the Paris agreement. Theresa May was the only party leader who did not attend but otherwise Greta’s visit proved an opportunity for a renewal of the cross-party consensus on climate. The mood was strikingly in contrast to the bitterly divisive debates of Brexit: Gove applauded Lucas’s moral leadership on environmental issues and said nobody had done more than Miliband to put the UK’s climate policy on a strong track. Gove was, however, criticised for being the person in the room with the most power to change policy, but the most evasive answers. “He’s environment secretary, so it’s not enough for him to feel guilty,” said Lucas. “I hope he takes home the message that he should not be satisfied with warm words.” The standing-room-only turnout was far better than the recent climate debate in parliament, which drew barely a dozen MPs even though it was the first on the crisis held in the main chamber in two years. Several dozen politicians attended on Tuesday, along with government officials and representatives of the UK student strikers movement. Attendees said it was the most crowded event they could remember in more than 10 years at the Attlee suite. The young Swede spoke so quietly at first that many in the audience struggled to catch her speech above the clicks of the cameras. The low volume was deliberate, forcing people to hush and listen intently. “Can you hear me?” she asked repeatedly. “Is my English OK? Is the microphone on? Because I’m beginning to wonder. During the last six months I have travelled around Europe for hundreds of hours in trains, electric cars and buses, repeating these life-changing words over and over again. But no one seems to be talking about it, and nothing has changed.” But now there is undoubtedly more focus on the subject. After Greta’s speech, she went to the main debating chamber of the House of Commons, where MPs greeted her with a roar of applause and Miliband asked the government whether it would declare a national climate emergency. MPs also held a debate about the recent Extinction Rebellion protests and student strikes. Unimpressed, Thunberg said afterwards that the politicians were missing the point. “They turn this into a question of what methods the protesters use – truancy and civil disobedience – but it’s not about that. It’s about the fact that we face an existential crisis.” After the event, she went to St Pancras station to catch the Eurostar, the first leg of a 36-hour journey back to Stockholm. Passers-by, who recognised her on the street with her climate-strike sign, gave her the thumbs up and words of support. During the Easter holidays, she has received rock star treatment, selling out venues, being followed by paparazzi, meeting the Pope and having politicians humble themselves in her presence. As long as the attention serves a purpose it is tolerable, Greta said. But she is now ready to return home. “I like to be left alone,” she said as she headed back to Sweden, back to school and back to her regular weekly strike."

Share this...FacebookTwitterMy last 2 posts have been about this topic, where a one-sided international conference for journalists will provide their marching orders for the months ahead. Normally such a conference if organised privately would be legitimate.
But the shocking thing about this conference is that it is organised by a German publically funded radio and TV broadcaster – Deutsche Welle, and therefore the total absence of neutrality and objectivity is a violation of Germany’s Consitutional Law.
The conference calls on journalists to:
1. Abandon neutrality and to report only on the single extreme view of AGW calamity.
2. Abandon professional procedures in journalism. See here and here.
The European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE)  based in Germany has sent a Letter of Protest (in German) to Deutsche Welle demanding that they refrain from this misuse of public funds and cancel the one-sided conference which clearly excludes any views that disagree with the extreme gloom and doom world downfall view. It requests that it too obey the law, like every other citizen or guest in the country is rightfully expected to do. Currently the letter is only in German.
Hopefully EIKE will post a copy in English.
In the meantime, we urge readers to write or call Deutsche Welle at:
Phone: +49 228 429-2008 (Ask for a Mr Bettermann)
Fax: +49 228 429-2140
gmf@dw-world.de
They speak excellent English. Please politely ask him why they are violating the law by presenting only one radical side of the issue, and insist they present all the other wide range of views from other scientists and experts on climate change. Why is it they are presenting only the worst of scenarios? Is it really their job to emotionalise the audience with the aim to get them to think in one particular way?
Let us know what they tell you. I left my name and number with the secreatry, who said Mr Bettermann will call me back.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThat’s what the reporter in the following clip seems to suggest. So it means the warmists will start claiming cold winters as proof of warming. A number of blogs are buzzing about the “coldest winter in a 1000 years” being reported here: RT Prime Time. Western Asia and Eastern Europe are expecting a cold winter, but let’s not go over the edge here. This is a nutty claim.
We are not even in a little ice age. Does anyone seriously believe the Baltic Sea, and possibly the River Thames will freeze over, for weeks this winter? Take this notion of a 1000-year winter, or even a 100-year winter, and stuff it. Aint gonna happen.
The TV reporter in the above clip quotes meteorologists: “It’s supposed to be a beast of a winter.” That’s a fair claim.
NOAA is projecting a cold winter for Russia, Siberia and possibly Europe too. The reporter talks about the cold hitting the western Russia-European region.
Joe Bastardi in his latest post, however, did not make any commitment, though he seems to be hinting that we ought to expect cold. I have to say I get the feeling he sees something unusual, and so he’s going to take his time to really make sure – maybe just my imagination is just running wild.
An unusually cold winter is not far-fetched. But a 1000-year winter? Get out of here! That’s TV bullcrap. Unless Joe Bastardi comes out later this fall and says so, I aint buying it.
What are the reasons for the projected vicious cold asks the  reporter in the studio? “Is it climate change?”

They don’t really know. They’re looking at global warming.

That along with other factors. Global warming – what nonsense. The following NOAA chart definitely supports Russian meteorologists’ claims that the winter will be harsh.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNASA has released its picture of the week, which is a graphic of global land temperature anomalies for the period July 4-11. Click here for details. What jump outs at me is the number of blue areas that have suddenly popped up on the continents. Where did they all come from?
We keep hearing about the NOAA’s record hot first half of 2010. and seeing these maps covered with all them red dots all them, like this one here for June (sure looks hot, doesn’t it?):
Surely one can see the differences. In some cases they are very dramatic. Compare:
1. Mexico / western North America
2. Greenland
3. Central and Saharan Africa
4. Almost all of Asia
5. Australia
Can the planet really cool that quickly?
You know what I think? I think the NOAA is producing a bunch of crap.
Curiously, the references cited by NASA above all refer to “scorching heatwaves” and “hotspots”. No mention of the cool or cold spots that seem to have the upper hand on the continents.
UPDATE: For more detail and light on this subject, Steve Goddard at WUWT has written up a great analysis, see: http://wattsupwiththat.com/2010/07/16/co2-optical-illusion/#comment-432509

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn my last post I wrote about how German public broadcasting network Deutsche Welle is holding a 3 day conference dubbed: Climate Change and the Media, which features a number of let’s-save-the-planet and let’s-redefine-journalism workshops. Click list of workshops. You’ll find some real doozies. Here are some interesting ones, in case you’re interested in attending.Psychotherapist Mark Bayne
One workshop: It’s about Attitudes: Understanding and Reporting the Psychology of Climate Change, is chaired by former BBC foreign correspondent turned psychotherapist Mark Brayne. In a German interview here, he:
 …is convinced that our media in its current form is overwhelmed and cannot handle this core task of the 21st century.
Bayne is also convinced that as long as politicians, business leaders and voters don’t grasp just how critical the situation is, there will be no chance for a change in opinion, and adds:
And what is the most powerful tool when it comes to changing how people think? The media!  In our reporting, we have to portray the coming collapse as unavoidable. Ironically, that could be the only chance to prevent it – maybe.”
I’d say here, we aren’t the ones in urgent need of psychotherapy.
Advocacy Media
Here’s another journalist workshop: Coverage vs. advocacy – Does the media guide or reflect cultural shift?. It calls on considering media advocacy in place of just plain old coverage.

‘Media advocacy isn’t about a mass audience. It’s not about reaching everybody. It’s about targeting the two or three per hundred who’ll get involved and make a difference. It’s about starting a chain reaction. And reaching critical mass.’
Informing the public is not enough; now it has to be told how to think. Does Germany still sound like a democratic country? Perhaps more and more like the old German Democratic Republic (East Germany – the one that built a wall to keep its people from running away).
Behavioural Changes Are Necessary 
The objective of another workshop Fragile environments in the Himalaya region – The responsibility of local media is to change human behaviour:
This workshop will examine the state of climate change effects now and in the near future and will analyze the role the local media can play in educating people about the environment and the behavioural changes necessary as a result of global warming.
I’m not making this up – it’s for real!
Clearly, with this conference, the publically funded Deutsche Welle is calling for a more dictated news reporting. But should this dictatorial approach be a surprise? Not really. A look at how German public radio and TV are  funded can tell you something about how these media elites operate. In Germany, all radio and TV owners are required to pay hefty licensing fees every year. The fees are collected by an organisation called GEZ – where they are often collected by plainclothes officials who go door-to-door busting fee-shirkers. It’s not enough that they take our money, now they want to tell us how to think and behave too.
Obsessed and drunk with something, the German media are going off course from journalism to thought control. Sound familiar?

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Swiss online NZZ here  has a report on the peer-review process and the problems plaguing it. Peer-review has become a leading topic in science in Europe and all over the world. The NZZ starts off:
Irritated by multiple scandals over the last years, many scientists are up in arms over the peer-review of scientific articles and are hoping for improvement.
Many say there’s a need for reform.

Cartoon Source: http://medinfo.netbib.de/archives/2009/01/23/2975
Scientists say manipulation is as easy as pie.As a whole, the field of science is becoming overwhelmed by the flood of papers seeking publication. The NZZ writes that according to a Finnish study, already in 2006  1.35 million peer-reviewed papers were published, and the trend is accelerating.
And it is unclear whether the current large-scale peer-review process yields the correct, important results every time. Also publishers and peer-reviewers can make mistakes, as hanky panky like copying text and manipulating charts is especially easy in today’s computer age.
The NZZ does not name any particluar science field here, or anywhere else in the report. But for those familiar with climate science and the CRU e-mails, it sounds all too familiar.
The topic of peer-review has gained much importance over the years, as it’s the lifeblood of scientific careers. That’s one reason why the recent European Science Forum in Turin in early July was so jammed pack.
The NZZ asks: Is the current system the best we have?
Based on a 2009 study by Adrian Mulligan of Elsevier publishing, the NZZ reports that one third of the scientists replied with yes, one third with no, and the other third were undecided. The survey sampled 4000 scientists.

With those results one could reasonably assume that half are not really convinced by the peer-review process. That tells me it needs to be reformed. There are many problems with it. The NZZ mentions some of them.
For example, some scientists say that papers do not even get reviewed by experienced scientists, but are often passed down to younger, less experienced colleagues who don’t really know how to do it.
The NZZ writes about being able to reproduce results:
Increasingly, peer reviewers are no longer able to reproduce the results of studies on their own – because the time and effort simply would be too much. Philip Campbell of Nature brought up that point in Turin.
Campbell says errors will always get by peer-reviewers, and sometimes even outright fraud. But that’s rarely the case, as studies such as one from Daniele Fanelli of the University of Edinburgh 2009 in the journal PLoS ONE shows. NZZ writes:
According to the results, an average of 2% of scientists admitted to having made at least one falsification. And up to 34% admit to having committed a dubious act.
Plagiarism is another problem. Fortunately, plagiarism-recognition software such as CrossCheck help to detect plagiarism. The software is based on publication data-banks.
Diagram manipulation is detected using the algorithms in programs for graphic processing. Other offences committed include ghostwriting, including co-authors who did not take part in the study and salami publication.
In my view, the NZZ report places too much of the blame on the sheer volume of papers that need to be reviwed and on human nature, and completely ignores the political aspects that have corrupted the process.
But in the end, its conclusion is correct: Peer-review needs to be reformed, as for now there is no other alternative system available.
