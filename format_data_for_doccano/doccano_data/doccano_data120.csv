"“The consensus gap” describes the yawning chasm between the expert consensus that humans are driving global warming (about 97% agreement) and the public perception of the expert agreement (which polling puts around 50% in the USA). Less than 10% of Americans realize the expert consensus is as high as 97% on this issue.  Research has shown that when people are aware of the expert consensus, they’re more likely to accept the fact that humans are causing global warming, and also more likely to support taking action to address the problem. Hence the consensus gap is a significant roadblock preventing us from tackling global warming. To help close this gap, the website Skeptical Science has launched a 97-hour social media event starting today, 9/7. Each hour, the site will publish a relevant quote from a climate scientist, along with a playful caricature drawn by Skeptical Science founder and University of Queensland researcher John Cook. Each caricature lists the scientists’ name, title, expertise, and academic institution. An interactive webpage featuring the quotes and caricatures will be available at http://sks.to/97. They will also be Tweeted each hour from the Skeptical Science Twitter page (@skepticscience) with the hashtag #97hours, posted on the Skeptical Science Facebook page, and the images will be made available on Imgur. This is a great opportunity for people to engage in this social media event, spread the word about the 97% expert consensus on human-caused global warming, and close the consensus gap."
"The interesting thing about energy policy, as it comes into focus for the start of manifesto season, is that it gives each party the chance to be dreadful in its own unique way. The Conservatives are going with the line that bills are too high (they are), this is because of Labour’s high taxes (it isn’t), and can be rectified by “slashing green levies”. This is their offer: it makes very little financial difference (an average of £50 a year) and no demands on energy companies except to simplify their bills. It looks like a lot of bluster about the “mess they inherited” paired with some ineffectual flapping. In fact it isn’t, it’s an extremely bold statement; by casting green levies as expendable, they show they are not serious about transforming the energy market. They’re not serious about renewables. They’re not worried about carbon targets. They’re not going to prioritise investment in green infrastructure. They’re not 100% convinced that climate change is even happening, and – this bit is crucial – they’re not going to do anything to undermine the market dominance of existing companies selling fossil fuels. Only alternatives will challenge the energy oligopoly, and alternatives need investment.  Bills will get simpler, going down this route. Ultimately, they will be simplified down to one line: “You don’t need to know how much it is, loser, just pay it.” In other words, this is strong, joined-up, pro-corporate policy, sacrificing both the customer and the future to profit, disguised as incompetent meddling. It almost feels cruel to mention Nick Clegg, like tackling a man who is already on his way off the pitch. Yet he will keep coming out with policies – in this case, promising “at least £100” annually off the council tax bills of those who install cavity wall insulation and better boilers. He is correct to identify energy conservation as a key issue, but there his insight ends. The point of saving energy – the quest for negawatts, greens call it – is the long-term environmental benefit of us all. Described in big, ambitious terms as a worthwhile project for us all to get behind and pay for together, this might look a bit more like a policy. Described, instead, as a way for individual households to save money on their council tax bill it sets firing all the wrong synapses: self-interest and the spectre of scarcity instead of collective action and a sense of possibility. It is also, of course, very regressive, rewarding people who can afford to change their boiler with yet more money. Council tax already needs radical reform in the other direction, since the valuations on which the banding is based haven’t been revisited since the 90s. It sounds boring and wonky, but amounts to a situation in which, as the former Treasury advisor Jonathan Portes wrote last week, “owners of grand and very valuable properties pay little more than those in humbler abodes”. Being already unforgivably raked towards the wealthy by political cowardice, the last thing this tax needs is discounts for those who already have spare capital. It demonstrates, furthermore, a profound misunderstanding of what life is generally like – there are nine million renting privately in England. On average, they are spending over 40% of their net income on housing, where the “unaffordability” yardstick is 35%. They have no security of tenure, so sinking money into the cavity wall would be a bad investment. A third of private rentals don’t meet the minimum standards of “decent accommodation”, so are plainly not owned by people with a pro-social and responsible attitude. The more you look at this idea, the more preposterous it is, cooked up by someone who has forgotten how to speak to people, and forgotten how most people live. Against this background, Labour’s promise is the most promising. How could it not be? Caroline Flint says they will get “tough” on energy providers: they will clamp down on mis-selling and poor customer service, removing licenses rather than trusting in the Ofgem fines which energy firms, like banks, appear to take not as deterrents but as the acceptable cost of doing dishonest business. It is much better than Ed Miliband’s promise to freeze energy bills; apparatchiks loved that because it focus-grouped so well, but it was – like so much Labour policy, from housing benefit to working family tax credits –just a way to hose down a derelict market with public money in the hope that it would improve on its own. Markets don’t improve, they just suck up the money and continue to deteriorate; the day the “left” realises this will be the day they can recommence calling themselves the left. And yet Flint is still under-ambitious, still seeing the potential of politics mainly in terms of what it can regulate rather than what it can build. Of course consumers need protection from predatory corporations, but we also need a politics that addresses us as something other than consumers. There is so much to be done that only government can do: the Swansea Bay tidal lagoon could provide 11% of Wales’s domestic power. For the first time, scientists have perfected the see-through solar panel, which means you could meet your energy needs through your own windows. On 3 November last year, wind power production in Denmark met 100% of consumption, then exceeded it. The possibilities are so much greater than simply meeting carbon budgets: nations that are serious about investment are moving toward inexhaustible, mutually owned supply which ripples into every house, every budget, everyone’s future. What’s so extraordinary about our current politics is the willingness with which all its players accept the straitjackets of pessimism or pettiness. They could be making us an offer we can’t refuse.

"We’ve all heard about the dangers of climate change on world food security, but by 2050 our ability to produce food may be lowered by up to 10% due to rising air pollution, according to new research published by Nature Climate Change. “Human activities have increased the concentration of carbon dioxide in Earth’s atmosphere by over 30% during the past 200 years and this figure is expected to double by the end of the century,” says lead author Arnold Bloom. “Our report found this change in air pollution inhibits the growth of field-grown wheat by 10%.”  According to Bloom, air pollution will affect both urban and rural farming alike. Field-grown wheat is a staple crop for most developing countries, so if not addressed these findings show food security will suffer more than previously predicted. Adding to the crisis, worldwide food demand is set to rise by 50% in 2050. “Climate change is already making people hungry,” says Robin Willoughby, Oxfam UK’s policy adviser on food. “Rising temperatures and increasingly extreme and erratic weather patterns are making it harder to grow enough food to eat. Unfortunately, the situation is likely to get worse, placing an additional burden for our humanitarian work as droughts and flooding become more frequent. Climate change threatens to put the fight to eradicate hunger back by decades.” So, what will rising air pollution mean for aid workers delivering food in developing countries? “As air pollution begins to effect food supply, NGOs need to promote farming techniques that conserve water and soil, especially in dry or desert areas,” says Paul Cook, advocacy director for Tearfund, an international NGO. “NGOs also need to work to give farmers in developing countries access to up-to-date information on weather, climate, disaster early warning, and markets, so they can make well-informed plans and responses. Farmers need to experiment with agricultural approaches, so they are equipped to find solutions in an ever-shifting climate.” Cook says the development sector needs to focus on getting wealthy countries to eat less. “NGOs need to help people in rich countries consume less and consume differently, and campaign for government action on climate change. In this way, we may see a different story for issues like food insecurity in 2050.” However, some people in the sector dismiss these findings, and believe food security in future depends more on socio-economic factors than climate change and resulting air pollution. Francesco Tubiello, natural resources officer for the monitoring of green house gas emissions in agriculture for the United Nation’s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), says: “The people that analyse the biophysical data on CO2 effects on plants are not those who can speak volumes about food security. This is because food security and malnutrition have significant dimensions that have nothing to do with science, and much to do with socio-economics.” “The reduction or increase of absolute quantities of food is a very weak proxy for current and future food security levels, as the latter depends more on the economic laws of supply and demand and of redistribution, and on non-biophysical things such as poverty, infrastructure, politics and management.” The solution lies in a more holistic approach to food security, says Duncan Williamson, food policy manager for World Wildlife Fund. “It’s not about producing more, using more nitrogen and industrialising agriculture. We already produce enough to feed over 10 billion. It’s about producing a greater variety of crops and sticking to the more traditional plant-based diets found globally from Italy to India.” Even with 10% less field-grown wheat, we are still likely to have the ability to feed the global population in 2050. The challenge for the future is the same as the one we have now: how to distribute it more equally.

"In her extraordinary book Flight Behaviour, novelist Barbara Kingsolver uses powerful visual metaphors brilliantly to bring the challenge of climate change into rude relief. The plot uses the disruption of the Monarch butterfly’s amazing trans-continental migration as a key twist to illustrate how our natural systems may be bumped brutally into difficult change.  She’s not averse to a colourful turn of phrase in her character’s speech. In one memorable scene, a beleaguered scientist, responding to yet another journalistic probing on the consistency and veracity of the climate evidence, deploys a devastating and haunting visual metaphor: The Arctic is genuinely collapsing. Scientists used to call these things the canary in the mine. What they say now is, ‘the canary is dead’. We are at the top of Niagara Falls [Tina] in a canoe. There is an image for your viewers. We got here by drifting, but we cannot turn around for a lazy paddle back when you finally stop pissing around. We have arrived at the point of an audible roar. Does it strike you as a good time to debate the existence of the falls? In over thirteen years of communicating around climate change I have rarely come across a passage that resonates better with people. I’ve used it extensively in talks around my own book Only Planet as I visited the butterflies’ over-wintering grounds while in Mexico during my flight-free adventure around the world. It leaves audiences emotionally reeling.  The mental image Kingsolver creates embodies the tipping points of climate science, our gentle, blissful and largely innocent rather than ignorant journey to where we are, and the imperative for action not debate, in a few coruscating sentences. It is powerful, memorable story-telling that really matters. The new Weather Forecasts from 2050 that the UN have mocked up in advance of the next, genuinely critical, global climate summit attempt a similar feat: the generation of ‘salience’, the ability of an idea or issue to be prominent and conspicuous, to be comprehended in one’s mind’s eye, to feel real. We need these stories more than we can imagine. We are creatures of time and space and what is proximal spatially and chronologically takes precedence and priority. As a result many have argued climate change is perfectly positioned to paralyse us. We enjoy our “lazy paddle” then panic when it’s all but too late at the point of the “audible roar”. We yearn for stories to help us make sense of the world, to understand it, our relationships with it and to each other. Veteran communicators and campaigners like myself will recall the buzz of activist excitement around the film The Day After Tomorrow back in 2004. We were delighted, despite the Hollywoodisation of the story, that climate change was becoming more salient as a challenge.  At the time we dismissed the hyperbolic hysteria of the polar vortices that created the vicious cold snap in the movie as classic excitable exaggeration. But I can’t have been the only one last winter watching weather warnings in the US of “air cold enough to freeze your eye-balls” with concern. Dramatised blockbuster had become reality. It was a story of sobering salience. Beyond the slick holographic and retro The Day Today graphics, the UN’s mid century weather reports make interesting viewing. A pragmatic mix of problem stories, severe droughts, extreme heat, Venetian-style urban flooding, with opportunities like the Anchorage Olympics, solar farms and Arctic tourism, the content is balanced and even-handed. This is not propaganda, it is provocation – generating salience, asking questions, challenging assumptions and telling stories from our possible, or perhaps quite probable, future. Clever creativity like this won’t be world-changing by itself, but the paradigm shift underway as we respond to climate change is as much a cultural revolution as it is an environmental imperative and economic challenge. Movies, movements, literature, drama, art and activism all have a role to play as we crank our close-to-home, short-termist brains from an immediate, instinctive, intuitive ‘lion-in-savannah’ mode and into a ruminative, reflective, radical ‘creeping-middle-distance-threat’ defence.  In doing so, our ability to imagine ourselves in achievable futures, both a little dystopian but most importantly potentially more utopian, will be instructive.  Now where’s my paddle? We’ve got some tricky waters to navigate. • Ed Gillespie is author of ‘Only Planet - a flight-free adventure around the world’ and Co-Founder of sustainability change agency Futerra."
"The past year has seen the obstacles blocking action on climate change beginning to crumble. Opposition on scientific grounds looks pretty unpersuasive in the light of what has come from the experts on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Their seven-year study states that they are now 95% certain that human activity is a significant and avoidable element in driving climate change around the world. Predicted changes in the climate are now being observed in the most vulnerable countries, confirming the predictive models that have been used. The suggestion that action on this would have too great an economic cost is likewise looking increasingly shaky. This month the New Climate Economy report will be published by a global commission, including Felipe Calderón, the former president of Mexico; Paul Polman, the chief executive of Unilever; the economist Nicholas Stern; and Chad Holloway, the chairman of the Bank of America – as well as a substantial number of finance ministers from around the world. This report will show that action on climate change is entirely compatible with economic growth in almost all countries and that the economic benefits, both short and long term, will outweigh the costs.  It will reinforce the findings of a report published last October by a group of financial heavyweights outlining the threat to US businesses of doing nothing in the face of climate change. Risky Business – by former US treasury secretaries Hank Paulson, Robert Rubin and George Schultz; Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York; and the billionaire investor Thomas Steyer – argued, purely on economic grounds, that ignoring the challenge is folly. Another stumbling block that is also beginning to disappear is political inertia. Politicians, working with short-term election cycles, have constantly been tempted to kick this particular can down the road. But President Obama, having spoken powerfully about the need for action, is now backing up his rhetoric with legislation limiting carbon emissions from US power plants. There are similarly encouraging signs in China, where lethal levels of atmospheric pollution, especially in cities, have at last goaded the government to start to move in the right direction. With actors who have traditionally dragged their feet taking the lead, and with the urgency for action in developing nations beyond any serious doubt, it is now those who have traditionally been more proactive – European nations in particular – who need to step up to the mark. The hope is that the New York summit of world leaders on 23 September, at which climate change will take centre stage, will be the next major prompt to agreed action. Hosted by the UN secretary general, this meeting will show the real leaders in responding to climate change, and should kick-start negotiations ahead of the crucial UN climate summit in Paris in December next year which must decide on limiting greenhouse gas emissions. David Cameron became prime minister on the promise of “Vote blue, go green”. He promised to lead the “greenest government ever”. His presence and actions at this month’s summit will be a significant test of these commitments and aspirations. The moral case for action is clear. It is those suffering the most who carry the least historic responsibility for our situation. The wealthier industrialised nations have the power to act and secure a safe world for today’s poorest and tomorrow’s children. Christian Aid is soon to publish a report by Susan Durber examining the links between theology and climate change, in which it will be made very plain that the call for climate justice is something that echoes clearly the challenges found in the biblical prophets to a complacent and short-sighted society. As Durber says: “Prophets are sometimes unpopular and can be ridiculed by those who have much to lose if people really were to open their eyes. But they are those who consistently, and without fear, speak what they believe to be the truth.” What is needed from our politicians is leadership that takes the long view and breaks free of the tight cycle of calculated electoral advantage – a calculation that often misses the issues that most directly affect everyone’s wellbeing. We’re starting to see this with the publication of a paper from the Department of Energy and Climate Change which outlines the need for, and the benefit of, an ambitious climate deal at the Paris meeting. But as Christiana Figueres, the leading UN spokesperson on climate change, said in a speech in St Paul’s Cathedral last May, we need to see action already in place this year if the deal in 2015 is to be strong enough: we need the groundwork laid, and we need clear signs that the political will is there. The climate summit in New York offers the perfect opportunity for our leaders to show that there is indeed a sensitivity to the kind of prophetic vision that rouses us from complacency, and a will to secure the future of our children and grandchildren."
"This month, the UN secretary general will host a major climate summit: it is a moment in time for heads of state, cities, organisations, and companies to announce bold new initiatives to address climate change in the short to medium term. It is also a moment for an ambitious, scientifically credible and clear vision on where the world needs to aim over the long haul.  Bold initiatives are certainly needed now to slow the growth of emissions before 2020, peak global emissions shortly thereafter and rapidly put in place policies capable of delivering clean and resilient development. Yet, like a young person planning their career, a mayor looking at future demographics or a corporation evolving a business strategy, there also needs to be a long term view of where we want to be fifty years or so down the road. That long term vision is ‘climate neutrality’ – ie not putting in more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than natural processes take out – as soon as possible in the second half of the century.  There is ample evidence from the UN’s climate science panel that global greenhouse gas emissions have to be zero or near zero by the end of the 21st century if we want to achieve the goal of holding a global temperature rise below 2C. It is the best guarantee of ensuring that the poor and vulnerable are spared from ever more threatening impacts such as heat waves, crop failures, floods and water shortages that will increasingly threaten their lives and livelihoods; continued, unabated emissions pose an unacceptable risk of pushing our climate system towards potentially irreversible changes with highly damaging impacts to all sectors of society. Let us be clear. Climate neutrality is not nirvana or an alternative universe – it is about dramatically reducing current emissions to the point where we reach a balance between those emissions entering the atmosphere and the capacity of the Earth to absorb them. This will require charting the path from the high emission society we have today – including initially through some level of certified carbon offsets – to a deep, decarbonisation of the global economy before arriving finally at a climate neutral family of nations. It also demands a rapid transformation in the way we value healthy ecosystems to ensure that nature will continue to play an ever more central role in removing carbon from the atmosphere.  This will require significant investments in cleaner, greener energy and energy efficiency in transport and buildings alongside smarter management to sustain, expand and restore forests and soils. Overall this will be a much less costly economic development path for the entire planet, preventing potentially enormous costs connected with climate change impacts; it will also be good for jobs with many emerging in constructing green buildings, low energy transportation systems and other climate-friendly infrastructure and natural resource management.  The effort is undoubtedly long term and ambitious but must be seen as the eventual target so that decisions taken now are taken with the long game in mind. Climate neutrality may seem like a tall order in 2014 with global emissions still climbing despite the growing penetration of renewable energy, improved energy efficiency in many countries and actions to sustainably manage natural assets like forests. But some countries have already glimpsed the long term and are pointing their economies in that direction: from Bhutan and Costa Rica to Papua New Guinea, Sweden and Switzerland.  Many cities affiliated with associations like ICLEI and the C40 are pledging ambitious long term targets some of which call for 80%, 90% and even 100% emission reductions. These pioneering urban centres range from Copenhagen and Stockholm to Oslo and Seattle. Visionary companies, many of them household names in the internet, high tech and banking sectors, are following suit. Ban Ki-moon’s summit on 23 September is about raising ambition en route to the UN climate talks meeting in Peru this December and in advance of a crucial conference in Paris at the end of 2015. Countries have agreed to ink a new agreement in Paris that can mark a turning point towards bending down the current greenhouse emissions curve and assisting the poor and vulnerable to better adapt to the climate change already underway. But as the science spells out, this is not the end game if poverty is to be truly eradicated and our collective goal of a safe and secure world is to be realised.  Only a long term vision of climate neutrality in the second half of the century can do that and in doing so provide a real and exciting prospect for over 9bn people of a functioning, fit and healthy world for generations to come. • Christiana Figueres is the executive secretary UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and Mario Molina is a Nobel Prize-winning chemist "

"Global warming is here, human-caused and probably already dangerous – and it’s increasingly likely that the heating trend could be irreversible, a draft of a new international science report says. The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on Monday sent governments a final draft of its synthesis report, which combines three earlier, gigantic documents by the Nobel Prize-winning group. There is little in the report that wasn’t in the other more-detailed versions, but the language is more stark and the report attempts to connect the different scientific disciplines studying problems caused by the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil and gas.  The 127-page draft, obtained by The Associated Press, paints a harsh warning of what’s causing global warming and what it will do to humans and the environment. It also describes what can be done about it. “Continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long-lasting changes in all components of the climate system, increasing the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems,” the report says. The final report will be issued after governments and scientists go over the draft line by line in an October conference in Copenhagen. Depending on circumstances and values, “currently observed impacts might already be considered dangerous,” the report says. It mentions extreme weather and rising sea levels, such as heat waves, flooding and droughts. It even raises, as an earlier report did, the idea that climate change will worsen violent conflicts and refugee problems and could hinder efforts to grow more food. And ocean acidification, which comes from the added carbon absorbed by oceans, will harm marine life, it says. Without changes in greenhouse gas emissions, “climate change risks are likely to be high or very high by the end of the 21st century,” the report says. In 2009, countries across the globe set a goal of limiting global warming to about another 2 degrees Fahrenheit (-16.67C) above current levels. But the report says that it is looking more likely that the world will shoot past that point. Limiting warming to that much is possible but would require dramatic and immediate cuts in carbon dioxide pollution. The report says if the world continues to spew greenhouse gases at its accelerating rate, it’s likely that by mid-century temperatures will increase by about another 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) compared to temperatures from 1986 to 2005. And by the end of the century, that scenario will bring temperatures that are about 6.7 degrees Fahrenheit warmer (3.7 degrees Celsius)."
"UN Secretary General, Ban Ki Moon, will host the Climate Summit in New York on 23 September, bringing together more than 100 heads of state, along with chief executives, city mayors, and civil society and labour leaders, to spur renewed efforts on climate change. The summit aims to underscore not just the urgency of low-carbon, resilient development, but also that acting on climate can advance the direct interests of nations, businesses and communities.  Four drivers give meaning to this message. First, the costs of clean, climate-friendly solutions – notably renewable energies – continue to fall as technology improves and business models sharpen. The age-old argument that a green future involves additional expense is giving way to the realisation that a full life-cycle analysis often reveals superior net returns, even when there are higher upfront investments.  Second, national and sub-national policy action is accelerating, crucially in China and the USA, fusing the climate agenda with one geared to human health, energy security and technology innovation, focusing for China in particular on reducing air pollution and water stress. Third, citizens are mobilising and will be on the streets of New York the weekend before the summit at the People’s Climate March – with a refreshed narrative that communicates the often complex climate agenda in popular ways, whether in terms of giant ‘carbon bubbles’, rising inequality or stagnant economies. And fourth, finance is moving, although still hesitantly, often led by the world’s policy-guided banks. Stewards of some of the trillions of private dollars, yuan and euro that lie within the global financial system are readying for the shift that lies ahead, as evidenced by the still small but rapidly growing green bond market.  Financing climate action can in large part be driven by the direct interests of national, business and individuals.  Two high-profile initiatives provide compelling support to this central message. Risky Business was launched earlier this year by co-chairs Michael Bloomberg, Henry Paulson, former US treasury secretary, and renowned financier, Tom Steyer, a formidable team whose message to the US was that addressing climate made sense by any measure.  The second initiative is the Global Commission on the New Climate Economy, due to present its report ahead of the summit. Chaired by ex-president of Mexico, Felipe Calderon, it was commissioned by seven countries – Colombia, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Norway, South Korea, Sweden and the United Kingdom – and is likely to stress the positive economics of taking climate into account in investment decisions. The summit will not, however, just be positive “show and tell” news. The scale and speed of the required shift in policy, finance and behaviour means that it will also be a “show and stretch” event. The assembled leaders need to go beyond their comfort zones and commit to the targets that are required to put the global economy on course for keeping global warming below 2C.  The underlying trends in carbon pollution and resource use are still driving us remorselessly towards a painful crash, as a recent reassessment of the original 1972 Limits to Growth study has highlighted. And for the leaders of the world’s small island developing states meeting in Samoa earlier this month confronting climate is now a matter of national survival.  The key for the leaders is to put in place the signals and incentives that corporations and investors really believe so that capital is redirected ahead of time and market volatility minimised. With the global financial crisis still resonating across the world, the key for the guardians of the world’s financial system is to avoid disorderly markets and engineer as smooth a path as possible to the coming phase of economic development. This task lies at the heart of the UNEP Inquiry. Positively, its initial six months of work has revealed signs of a new era of green financial regulation. In Brazil, the Central Bank’s new resolution requiring banks to have environmental and social risk systems in place is regarded by the financial sector as a necessary stepping stone to mobilising capital for the country’s urgent needs for green infrastructure and sustainable agriculture.  In China, the growing focus on how to green its financial market development has led the central bank, the People’s Bank of China, to launch a working group co-convened with the Inquiry to look at areas where financial policy, regulation and standards might catalyse green finance. And in the UK, the latest Law Commission review on fiduciary duty has helped dispel the old myth that taking action on sustainability was at odds with prudent investing. These positive signs remain, however, at the margin of the still dominant view of the role of, and practices in financial markets. Such markets should respond dynamically and creatively to the new reality about climate change and recognise the value of natural capital. Yet in the main, they don’t, preferring to continue investing in tried and tested high carbon, resource intensive assets.  The scourge of short-termism – exemplified by high-frequency trading – is a contributing factor. In the UK, this was dissected by the Kay Review, but has still not been rooted out of the system despite policy moves, legal challenges and initiatives such as the new IEX stock exchange designed to prevent front-running by high speed traders.  The summit’s message of “show and stretch” will help to address inertia in policies and markets. The financial sector’s creative impulses will rightly be celebrated and encouraged, within a wider recognition that they need to be channeled through policies, regulations and standards to be aligned with the long-term needs of a sustainable economy.  In the matter of finance, our ambition has to rise beyond pricing carbon and the smart use of public finance. Both are essential – but will need to be complemented with measures to overcome the bottlenecks currently embedded in financial markets. A blend of national self-interest and collaborative action is required, only this time involving central banks, financial ministries and regulators, working with banks, investors and insurers, to ensure that the world’s ample savings are deployed safely and securely in the industries of the future.

"Perhaps nothing better exemplifies the spinelessness, hypocrisy and turpitude of prime minister Tony Abbott's position on climate change than his comments on 3AW in December 2009: ""Climate change is real. But I think there are lots of legitimate questions about its extent, how much humans are causing it, and certainly there is a very real and necessary debate about the mechanism for dealing with it."" Abbott made this sneering reference to climate science and global climate change mitigation efforts one day after becoming the leader of the Liberal party, prevailing over Malcolm Turnbull by a single vote. Just a day before, the policy position of that party was support for an emissions trading scheme and acknowledgement of the dangers posed by global warming that had been long confirmed by the scientific community.  The events that precipitated Abbott's comments are important, because they reveal the character of the man who is now prime minister. A month before, on 9 November, senior senator and climate denier Nick Minchin appeared on the Four Corners program on the ABC. Minchin suggested that a global left-wing conspiracy was behind climate change. Minchin encouraged the extreme fringe elements of the Liberal and National parties to speak out against Turnbull: ""I don't mind being branded a sceptic about the theory that that human emissions and CO2 are the main driver of global change - of global warming. I don't accept that and I've said that publically. I guess if I can say it, I would hope that others would feel free to do so."" Several senators did so, including ultra-conservative South Australian Liberal senator Cory Bernardi and Victorian Liberal senator Julian McGuaran, who threatened to cross the floor against any emissions trading deal negotiated by Turnbull. The climate denier caucus delivered Abbott the votes he needed to defeat the moderate Turnbull Having become leader by the grace of this extreme fringe element, Abbott was pandering the day after his elevation to Liberal leader. But even in his pandering, Abbott was hedging. The polls showed that most Australians supported climate action, so he could not, like Minchin, come out directly and deny it was real. Instead, he used talking points imported from the USA designed to cast uncertainty and doubt on the reality of climate change, without denying it outright. The comments received relatively little coverage, as they were caught up in the maelstrom of debate and coverage of the fallout of the Liberal leadership spill, the defeat of the carbon pollution reduction scheme legislation in the senate and the global disappointment in Copenhagen. But Abbott's comments are illustrative. Their purpose was to dissimulate and deceive, to undermine the very notion that anything could or should be done to address or mitigate global warming. Abbott's real views are hard to pin down. Well before the leadership spill, Abbott has come out on the climate denialist side, saying in July 2009 ""I am, as you know, hugely unconvinced by the so-called settled science on climate change."" In October that year, he again used a climate denialist talking point to try to undermine confidence in the scientific community, saying to Channel 9 ""I think that the science is far from settled"". He repeated the lie about global cooling, which has been recently picked up by his chief business advisor Maurice Newman, saying: It seems that the world has cooled slightly since the late 1990s. One of the things which I think has disconcerted a lot of people is the evangelical fervour of the climate change alarmists because they haven't pursued their case with the kind of careful moderation that you normally associate with the best scientists. Yet just a few months before, possibly before there was an inkling that he could become Liberal leader, Abbott said in a Sky News interview on 29 July: ""If you want to put a price on carbon, why not just do it with a simple tax?"" In an interview on the 2UE radio station on 27 November, in the lead up to the leadership spill and just days after a rancorous caucus debate and a failed leadership bid by Kevin Andrews, Abbott said ""You can't have a climate change policy without supporting this ETS at this time."" He challenged Turnbull to the leadership on that same day. Possibly the most revealing statement made by Abbott is his infamous climate change is ""crap"" line. He said to a small audience with a local reporter present in October 2009: ""The argument [on climate change] is absolute crap... however, the politics of this are tough for us. 80 per cent of people believe climate change is a real and present danger."" Here, perhaps, we glimpse the truth behind Abbott's changing position on climate change action. It comes down, not values or morality, but ""the politics"". The inconsistency, weasel words and hedging has continued over the last five years. During the most toxic periods of Abbott's scare campaign against the carbon price, he still declined to fully deny the reality of global warming. For example, he said on the ABC on 9 November 2011 ""I think that climate change is real, mankind does make a contribution and we should have strong and effective policies to deal with it."" Yet a month earlier in an interview with Alan Jones on 2GB, he equated the scientific consensus on global warming to ""theology"" – a common denialist talking point: ALAN JONES: Shouldn't there be open and intelligent debate in a science which is not settled? TONY ABBOTT: Well, Alan, I certainly accept that there's been far too much theology and not enough proper scientific scepticism in this area, I certainly accept that... More recently on the global stage, Abbott still vacillates between repeating denialist talking points and more moderate statements accepting the reality of climate change. After meeting with Barack Obama for example on 13 June this year, Abbott said in an ABC radio interview that ""I regard myself as a conservationist"", yet later that day would front an audience in Texas to laud the unrestrained burning of fossil fuels: Australia should be an affordable energy superpower, using nature's gifts to the benefit of our own people and the wider world. It is prudent to do what we reasonably can to reduce carbon emissions. But we don't believe in ostracising any particular fuel and we don't believe in harming economic growth. Energy consumption defines prosperity. None of this is surprising. Abbott's chief business advisor Maurice Newman is a well-known climate denier. The main political sponsor of Abbott was outspoken climate denier Nick Minchin. Abbott's finance minister Mathias Cormann visited the USA to meet with conservative climate denialist think tanks like the Heritage Foundation. Substantial donations are made to the Liberal party by the fossil fuel industry, almost $13 million according to Charles Sturt University academic Clive Hamilton. Major donors to the LNP since 2010 include Hancock Coal (owned by Gina Rinehart), Minerology (owned by former LNP Queensland president and life-member Clive Palmer), Caltex, Chevron, QCoal, Santos and Woodside. Also contributing to the LNP were energy retailers AGL, Origin Energy and Energy Australia. Since becoming prime minister, Abbott has been very focused on delivering for this key business constituency. Just as, in 2009 after his victory over Turnbull, he fronted the media to cast doubt on the reality of global warming, after his election victory in 2013 he has set about dismantling Australia's carbon pricing and climate mitigation policy framework. The fig-leaf for Abbott is his ""direct action"" policy, to pay polluters to reduce their carbon emissions. This is such a laughably inadequate policy, it could only be supported by a prime minister and political party that believes global warming to be a hoax. Abbott has been described as a weather vane by his Liberal party colleagues in the past. He has supported a carbon tax, then viciously opposed any price on carbon to appease a minority hard-core fringe. He has dismantled Australia's emissions trading scheme and internationally has allied with fossil-fuel addicted nations like Canada to block meaningful global action. Yet while doing this, he boldly declares himself to be a conservationist and that he considers climate change to be a ""significant problem"". There is no other conclusion to draw that on the issue of global warming, Abbott is a climate nihilist. He holds no conviction or moral position on this issue of international and intergenerational significance. Only a climate nihilist could so viciously attack the measures introduced under the previous government that were designed to assist people on low incomes, prevent harm to peoples' livelihoods and the economy, and to (in some small way) mitigate the global climate catastrophe. On this issue, it appears that he believes in nothing and therefore cannot come to a moral judgement or sense any moral obligation to act. The gesture of ""direct action"" is the most contemptible element of his nihilism."

"“Sometimes things don’t go, after all, from bad to worse,” wrote the poet Sheenagh Pugh. “Some years, muscadel faces down frost; green thrives; the crops don’t fail.” News that the ozone layer is showing signs of recovery – 27 years after a ban on the manmade chemicals that damaged it – is welcome evidence that decisive international action can avert self-imposed disaster. It is that rare flower, a positive environmental story. It’s easy to forget the potentially catastrophic threat the world faced only recently. In the 1980s, scientists noted the ozone layer – which screens us from the sun’s damaging ultraviolet rays and without which we couldn’t survive – was thinning. The cause was tracked down to a group of chemicals, chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs, that were being increasingly used in everyday household and industrial appliances and goods, such as fridges and aerosols.  The challenge of removing them seemed great. They were cheap, incredibly useful and everywhere. And yet, trusting the science, and with international leadership, an agreement – the Montreal Protocol – was signed within two years of the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer in the southern polar region. In less than a decade, the content of the damaging chemicals in the vital stratosphere began to decline. Now, the hole has stopped growing bigger and is expected to shrink. The Montreal Protocol itself has long been held up as an example of a great environmental success. And, in fact, it is far from alone. There has been positive action against acid rain, as well as improvements in air and water quality in the northern hemisphere. We have also seen the abandonment of self-defeating “predict and provide” transport policy, which saw concrete covering countryside on the promise of alleviating congestion, only for the extra road capacity to usher in more car use and the return of congestion with all its associated health and fossil fuel dependency problems. The change in the ozone layer is a perfect riposte to the burnout and insidious defeatism, even of some environmentalists, who have given up hope of “winning big” again and settle instead for incremental policy reform. But can this hold out hope for the biggest challenge of all? Fossil fuels are more pervasive than ever, with a bigger industrial lobby protecting and promoting them. We have all to a greater or lesser degree been brought up to be dependent on them – from brushing our teeth in the morning to locking the garage at night. Their use is also not only a problem in isolation, but has literally fuelled us to overconsume, and hence overburden, countless planetary ecosystems on which we depend. In this challenge, it is not enough that we substitute clean energy for dirty energy – in the same way as substitutes for CFCs were found – but that we change habits of consumption that have been fostered during the brief era of cheap fossil fuels. Nevertheless, certain parallels between the ozone triumph and the danger of climate change are clear. There is a scientific consensus about the threat the problems pose to life and human civilisation. It’s a non-choice between runaway warming and gradual irradiation. And in both cases the main culprit is also clear. It remains within our power to act, and there might be even more to gain from action on climate change too. A shift to cleaner energy systems and consumption patterns that are better for personal and planetary health and wellbeing are possible. The inescapable logic of necessary action seems to be creeping up even on the oil companies. Increasingly desperate attempts by the chief executive of Shell to dismiss the need to leave fossil fuels in the ground, giving him the awkward economic problem of so-called “stranded assets”, is the definition of someone who doth protest too much. What is cheering is that when it comes to the ozone layer, it’s taken us less than three decades to move from regulatory action to seeing positive results on a complex, global issue. This should remind us that swift action can still prevent catastrophic, uncontrollable warming. But decisions and action to radically reduce emissions need to happen in the next two years – about the time it took from discovering the hole in the ozone layer to agreeing the Montreal Protocol. As Pugh’s poem went on to say, “sometimes we do as we meant to”."
"Surging carbon dioxide levels have pushed greenhouse gases to record highs in the atmosphere, the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) has said. Concentrations of carbon dioxide, the major cause of global warming, increased at their fastest rate for 30 years in 2013, despite warnings from the world’s scientists of the need to cut emissions to halt temperature rises.  Experts warned that the world was “running out of time” to reverse rising levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) to tackle climate change. Data show levels of the gas increased more between 2012 and 2013 than during any other year since 1984, possibly due to less uptake of carbon dioxide by ecosystems such as forests, as well as rising CO2 emissions. The annual greenhouse gas bulletin from the WMO showed that in 2013 concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere were 142% of what they were before the Industrial Revolution. Other potent greenhouse gases have also risen significantly, with concentrations of methane now 253% and nitrous oxide 121% of pre-industrial levels. Between 1990 and 2013 the warming effect on the planet known as “radiative forcing” due to greenhouse gases such as CO2 rose by more than a third (34%). The bulletin reveals concentrations of gases in the atmosphere, not emissions – around quarter of which are absorbed by the oceans and a further quarter by ecosystems. Oceans cushion the increases in carbon dioxide that would otherwise be seen in the atmosphere – but at a cost, with the world’s seas becoming more acidic at a rate not seen for at least 300m years, the WMO said. WMO secretary-general Michel Jarraud said: “We know without any doubt that our climate is changing and our weather is becoming more extreme due to human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels. “The greenhouse gas bulletin shows that, far from falling, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere actually increased last year at the fastest rate for nearly 30 years. “We must reverse this trend by cutting emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases across the board. We are running out of time. “Carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for many hundreds of years and in the ocean for even longer. Past, present and future CO2 emissions will have a cumulative impact on both global warming and ocean acidification. The laws of physics are non-negotiable.” Carbon dioxide is responsible for four-fifths of the increase in warming by greenhouse gases, with concentrations in the atmosphere averaging 396 parts per million (ppm) in 2013. Last year levels increased by 2.9ppm – the largest annual increase seen from 1984 to 2013. At current rates, annual concentrations will pass the symbolic 400ppm in 2015 or 2016, the WMO said, although that level has already been reached over shorter periods than a year as CO2 levels fluctuate seasonally and regionally. For the first time, the WMO bulletin includes a section on ocean acidification, caused by the uptake of carbon dioxide into the seas, which can harm the ability of wildlife such as corals, molluscs and some plankton to form shells. It could also reduce survival, hit development and growth rates and effect physiological functions in wildlife. Prof Joanna Haigh, co-director of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and Environment, Imperial College London, said: “Far from a slowdown, the concentration is rising faster than ever – with an inevitable impact on future global temperatures... steps need to be taken now to reduce CO2 emissions.” Prof Dave Reay, chair in carbon management at the University of Edinburgh, said: “This is the litmus test when it comes to our efforts to reduce emissions and on this evidence we are failing. Of particular concern is the indication that carbon storage in the world’s forests and oceans may be faltering. “So far these ‘carbon sinks’ have been locking away almost half of all the carbon dioxide we emit. If they begin to fail in the face of further warming then our chances of avoiding dangerous climate change become very slim indeed.”"
"Maybe Maurice Newman was hoping nobody would check. In an opinion column yesterday, the climate science denying (yes, I just said it right up front) former ABC chairman and head of the Prime Minister’s business advisory council launched into another of his embarrassing attacks on climate science and the laws of physics.  Given we’ve been here before, I’m starting to think that Newman might actually have written some clever computer code that first scrapes climate science denial blogs for conspiracy theories and common misrepresentations and then turns them into 950-words for The Australian newspaper. The column, which warned of a concocted threat of “global cooling”, made several remarkable and wrong scientific claims, cherry-picked evidence, misrepresented findings and, in at least one case, badly misrepresented the views of a British scientist. Newman’s central claim is that the activity of the sun and cosmic rays are probably driving climate change and that the world should probably prepare for global cooling. When you start to test Maurice Newman’s claims you find the whole case is about as sturdy as a house made of playing cards placed on a poorly constructed raft made of rolled up copies of The Australian floating on the ocean... in a tropical cyclone. And he doesn’t even use decent quality playing cards. I apologise for the length of this post by the way and some of the overly technical stuff, but every once in a while I think it’s worth picking at the claims made by people in influential positions. Let’s have a pick. Actually, let’s have several picks. At the beginning of the column, Newman claims a recent article in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics “adds to growing evidence that climate change is determined by the sun, not humans”. The problem with this statement is that the journal article in question did not even consider the interactions between the sun and long-term climate change. Even one of the climate sceptic websites that recently featured this research, said: “Unfortunately, it was beyond the scope of this paper to address the potential impact of solar activity on climate.” Professor Steve Sherwood, director of the Climate Change Research Centre at the University of New South Wales, explains: Evidence that the sun influences climate has decreased, not increased. About a decade ago calculations showed the sun caused about 10 per cent of the warming observed since the late 1800s, but it is now estimated to be only about 5 per cent. This new paper does not change these estimates at all, it is only an attempt to extend the sunspot record back to times before direct observations began a few hundred years ago. The paper makes no mention of climate, because it does not have any new implications for climate. Since 1980, during which time we have seen strong warming, solar output has if anything declined slightly. In fact, it is looking increasingly doubtful that the sun even had much to do with the so-called “little ice age”, which most mainstream scientists used to attribute to the minimum in sunspot activity at roughly the same time, but now looks to have been caused mainly by volcanic eruptions. Newman tells his readers that experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Europe had “validated” a hypothesis from Danish physicist Professor Henrik Svensmark that “the sun alters the climate” by interacting with cosmic rays. The former ASX chairman makes it sound like a done deal. But what did the lead author of that research actually think? Did it “confirm the hypothesis” that the sun alters the climate “by influencing cosmic ray influx and cloud formation” as Newman had claimed?  Professor Jasper Kirby, who led the research, said at the time “it actually says nothing about a possible cosmic-ray effect on clouds and climate, but it’s a very important first step”.  So that’s a no, then (minor nit, as Nature also explained, the experiment didn’t use the LHC, as Newman had claimed, but rather the same bit of kit – a particle accelerator - that feeds the LHC). Newman wrote that the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change “and its acolytes” tend to “pay scant attention” to science that might “relegate human causes” as the driver of climate change. Professor Sherwood was a Lead Author on the latest IPCC report chapter to look at these cosmic ray claims. He told me: In writing the relevant section of the report, we examined Svensmark’s work along with many other relevant studies. It is quite clear that the evidence suggesting that cosmic rays influence cloud cover, does not hold up to scrutiny. The IPCC is quite comprehensive in assessing the scientific literature and making an overall assessment. If there is any cherry-picking going on, it is by the so-called skeptics, who typically focus on a tiny handful of papers and often draw unwarranted inferences from them not made by the authors themselves, as Newman has done in this case. Newman name checks other organisations and scientists to try and bolster his argument.  He quotes work by “leading British climate scientist Mike Lockwood, of Reading University” to try and convince readers that the sun might be the dominant driver of the climate. But Newman doesn’t mention what Lockwood actually thinks about these claims of cosmic rays or the sun dictating global temperatures After his work was misrepresented in the British press last year, Lockwood responded on the website Carbon Brief: So what do we think the effect of a return to Maunder minimum conditions on global mean temperatures would be? The answer is very little. In a paper with scientists from the Met Office’s Hadley Centre, we used an energy balance model to show the slowing in anthropogenic global warming associated with decline in solar irradiance to Maunder minimum levels. We found the likely reduction in warming by 2100 would be between 0.06 and 0.1 degrees Celsius, a very small fraction of the warming we’re due to experience as a result of human activity.  I sent Newman’s article to Lockwood to ask if he felt his work and his views were being fairly represented. Suffice to say he’s not too happy. He wrote: The wording in the quote you sent me is a very sly misrepresentation. As a scientist I try to write sentences that are unambiguous ... but this is deliberately ambiguous to make it look like I am saying something that I certainly am not. I have never, ever written anything whatsoever about the “year without summer”, so I have never ever connected it to solar variability and the Dalton minimum. So if I trim the sentence down to “... Mike Lockwood, of Reading University, found 24 occasions in the past 10,000 years when the sun was declining as it is now, but could find none where the decline was as fast. He says a return of the Dalton Minimum (1790-1830) is ‘more likely than not’” Then I would be happy - but the addition of the phrase which included “the year without summer” makes it look like I am connecting that year to the Dalton minimum which I certainly am not. There is absolutely no credible evidence whatsoever that the “year without summer” was either caused by low solar activity or was in any way significant as an indicator of global climate trend. I also asked Lockwood what he thought of Newman’s claim that there was “growing evidence that climate change is determined by the sun, not humans”. Lockwood said: [This claim] is, frankly, scientifically ludicrous. There are a few papers that use inadequate statistical techniques to claim a link between global temperatures and solar activity. Proper significance testing against an appropriate noise model invariably shows that the probability that these sun-global climate connections are purely coincidental is extremely high and that they have been selected whilst a very large number of counter examples have been ignored. This is bad science: it’s equivalent to finding on albino rabbit and declaring all rabbits are albino. There have been many studies, including ones that I have been involved in, that show the solar influence on global mean surface temperatures is extremely small. I personally think there is evidence for some interesting effects in winter (and only in winter, and there are compelling scientific reasons why only in winter) in locations that are strongly influenced by the northern hemisphere jet stream. However these effects are re-distributions of temperature and so, for example, if Europe suffers a cold winter, Greenland has a warmer one. Hence these are regional and season climate changes and quite distinct from global climate changes.  That looks like one less Christmas card for Maurice Newman.  But there’s still more to go at here. Newman quotes a University of Pennsylvania professor of psychology Philip Tetlock as saying: “When journal reviewers, editors and funding agencies feel the same way about a course, they are less likely to detect and correct potential logical or methodological bias.” The quote is actually a decade old and comes from an article published in the journal Political Psychology.  Newman probably got it trawling the blogs of climate sceptics (an article discussing the paper was reposted on the UK’s Global Warming Policy Foundation website earlier this month), which is where, in my view, he probably gets most of his ideas about climate science. You might think, given the context of the article, that Tetlock was talking about environmental science or climate change.  But no. The Tetlock article was discussing his concerns about the preservation of the discipline of “political psychology”. Most of the article is discussing issues around war and peace and racism. Fair and balanced? Earlier this month, the Australian Press Council updated its overarching principles to “ensure that factual material” is accurate and not misleading. The change extended the principles reach from just “news reports” to material “elsewhere” which has been taken to mean opinion columns. In principle three on fairness and balance, the APC says even when a writer expresses an opinion, it should not be done “based on significantly inaccurate factual material or omission of key facts”. The Australian has been hostile to the changes.  You have to wonder if Newman’s latest is a bit of a test run? "

"Climate change is making it more difficult for young people in south-east Asia to find a job, according to a report released on Monday by Plan International (pdf). Livelihoods in countries such as Indonesia, Burma, Thailand and Vietnam are dependent on ocean and coastal environments for food, building materials and medicine. These countries face frequent extreme weather – intense rains, droughts and cyclones – and are exposed to floods and rising sea levels.  Ikun, a 14 year old who lives in Lembata, a village in Indonesia, has first-hand experience of the effects of climate change on job security. “The effects of climate change are failed crops. Out of a field, farmers can only harvest one bag of corn, because the leaves turn yellow … and fishermen can’t sail, because fishermen heavily depend on the wind direction.” According to the report, green-skills training could help to tackle the effects of climate change in these countries. ‘Green skills’ are the skills needed to work in an environmentally friendly way, and have been shown to improve productivity. However, as most young people in developing countries don’t have access to sustainable work practices, the report argues that all NGO-led training programmes should involve green elements to equip the next generation with skills to tackle the effects of climate change. “Young people across the world are concerned about the impact of climate change and want to do something about it,” says Kelly Hawryshylyn, Plan International’s disaster resilience adviser. “Helping young people acquire green skills strengthens their ability to find a job, lift themselves out of poverty and have control over their future.” Sven Harmeling, climate change advocacy coordinator for Care International, says: “Building knowledge and skills, particularly among women, is just as important as trialing new seeds and fertilisers when it comes to tackling the impacts of climate change. In Asia, Africa and Latin America, our work to improve people’s resilience to climatic conditions shows that integrating climate risks across development programmes is a no-brainer – particularly around the issue of food security.” So, at what level should green-skills training work? Hawryshylyn says: “We are working with multiple stakeholders, including government, the private sector, media, donors, schools and of course the people in the communities where we work, to make sure that green skills are prioritised.” As the people whose jobs are most likely to be affected by climate change, young women could benefit the most from environmental training. “As women are often the main food producers, NGOs should provide training so they can work as effectively as possible to improve their chances of growing enough food in the face of increasingly extreme and erratic weather,” says Robin Willoughby, Oxfam’s policy adviser. Harmeling adds: “To be truly effective, new green skills must go hand in hand with promoting gender equality and the equal participation of men and women in all development programmes from the outset.” An issue with this approach is training: often teachers in these countries lack knowledge of green skills and, according to the report, most feel ill-equipped to deliver training. It is therefore essential that international NGOs embrace green-skills training in their work if they wish to combat the effects of climate change on the world’s most vulnerable. With greater knowledge and understanding of the issue, young people in developing countries are empowered to make their work more sustainable and ensure greater job security for future generations.

"Curtis Ravenel dates his enthusiasm for purpose-driven business to his first job as a program associate with the National Recycling Coalition. “I got very interested in the idea that being an environmentalist need not hurt your economic opportunities,” he recalls.  But it would be some time before the notion defined Ravenel’s career.  Ravenel joined Bloomberg LP in 2002 as a financial analyst for internal operations. He eventually rose to a management position in the firm’s capital planning group. Still, his interest in reconciling environmental issues with business was dormant rather than defeated.  Recognized as a smart manager on the rise, in 2006 Ravenel was invited to participate in a global manager-training program. “One night they said to us, ‘We want you to come up with an idea for Bloomberg, and we want you to flesh it out a little bit. You have exactly 18 hours’”, he recalls. “I shot out of bed at four o’clock the next morning,” Ravenel says. “It sounds corny, but I saw all of it.” By “it” he means what is today called BGreen – Bloomberg’s internal sustainability plan. The culture at Bloomberg is unambiguously commercial. It is a business of selling data to make financial markets more efficient – an entity serving money-makers of all stripes. So Ravenel, who is today Bloomberg’s sustainability manager, envisioned an internal effort to reduce resource use that would focus just as heavily on financial savings as environmental benefits, with the cost-cutting accrued directly to the operating groups. Once BGreen was selected for piloting, Ravenel summoned the guts to nominate himself as its leader. He soon saw that what he’d originally envisioned as an 18-month project had to become much more. “You have to have a full-time, permanent group that constantly pushes the envelope,” he says, because a temporary effort creates only temporary buy-in from business units. “If you’re not a permanent part of the work flow, once you walk away they go back to their old ways.” To take the sustainability initiative company-wide, he hand-picked team members from key departments in the company, then set the bar high by telling them: “We have to be more professional, more business-minded, and have our shit more together than any other group, because there’s so much inherent skepticism about what we do.”  This emphasis on cutting costs earned Ravenel and his team instant internal credibility and helped build the capacity to take on even bigger game. “Bloomberg is about helping customers make better decisions with quantitative information,” says Ravenel. “Book value only tells a small part of the market cap story. So much is based on intangibles. Sustainability is one example of that.”  So the team set out to “make sustainability performance more quantitative, consumable and actionable.” As Ravenel made the rounds internally, he brandished his pinstripe suit, his banker’s haircut, and his focus on the bottom line. Over time this “looking the part” helped him move Bloomberg’s sustainability activity beyond reducing the firm’s own footprint to expanding its product line. “Risk bores people,” Ravenel says. “Creating revenue opportunities –that’s exciting.” On Ravenel’s watch, savings from Bloomberg’s internal sustainability successes were channeled from internal risk management to enhancing customer services. Today the company integrates “ESG” data – environmental, social and governance – on sustainability risks and opportunities into its analytical tools for investors, right alongside more established financial benchmarks. The company offers a clean energy sector market intelligence service and a website that serves as a one-stop shop for executives and policy decision makers seeking information and insights on the business of sustainability. The firm’s editorial arm provides sustainability news.  Together these offerings generate millions of dollars in new revenues for Bloomberg, proving that commercial success is not at odds with sustainability. Indeed, commercial success is the primary metric of business sustainability – and nowhere more than in a culture of purpose.   Commercial drive is the oxygen of business. The Curtis Ravenel story clearly demonstrates that commercial drive can move sustainability beyond internal “greening” to becoming a major engine for revenue-generating products and services.  The four leaders profiled in this series – Bob Kidder of Chrysler, Kees Kruythoff of Unilever, Alberto Weisser of Bunge, and Curtis Ravenel of Bloomberg – show not only what leaders can do to build cultures of purpose, but also that the seeds of such cultures can be found in any organization that thinks aspirationally about business sustainability.  Now for an open invitation to other business leaders: what more might you be doing to build a culture of purpose marked by energy, resilience and openness? What opportunities lie at the intersection of commercial drive and sustainability?  Christoph Lueneburger, author of A Culture of Purpose: How to Choose the Right People and Make the Right People Choose You, founded the sustainability practice and currently leads the private equity practice at Egon Zehnder, the world’s largest privately-held executive search and talent strategy firm.

"Later this month world leaders will gather in New York for a historic summit on climate change. This is an opportunity to inspire key decision-makers to act in the face of a growing climate crisis that threatens almost every aspect of our lives. Politicians all over the world cite a lack of public support as a reason not to take bold action against climate change. So on 21 September we will meet this moment with unprecedented public mobilisations in cities around the world, including thousands of people on the streets of London. Our goal is simple – to demonstrate the groundswell demand that exists for ambitious climate action. From New York and London to Paris, Berlin, Delhi and Melbourne we’ll demonstrate demand for an economy that works for people and the planet; a world safe from the ravages of climate change; a world with good jobs, clean air and water, and healthy communities. There is only one ingredient that is required: to change everything, we need everyone. History is our proof that the impossible is smaller than we think. The abolition of slavery. The end of apartheid. The spread of universal suffrage. All proof that the future is ours to shape. We just need to step out and claim it.

We need an energy revolution, 1 September). Behind a PR smokescreen of getting tough on energy companies, it’s clear that both the government and the Labour frontbench are bending over backwards to keep the Big Six energy giants content. It’s little wonder that people feel pessimistic. A major transformation of the way the UK generates its heat and power is essential. Fuel poverty is rife and the UK is languishing near the bottom of renewable energy league tables – costing jobs, as well as endangering our credibility on tackling climate change. Above all, what we need is a revolution in ownership of our energy system. If the main parties were really on the side of consumers, community ownership and decentralised energy would be at the heart of their energy proposals – not just the very periphery. In July, the Institute for Public Policy Research set out clear plans for how cities and local authorities can provide an alternative to the Big Six and create a cleaner, smarter and more affordable energy system. Later this month, Community Energy Fortnight will celebrate success stories of locally owned energy from across the UK – projects such as the Brighton Energy Co-operative that provide a glimpse of an incredibly positive alternative energy future, where people are active producers and not just passive consumers. Profits are reinvested locally, rather than going into the pockets of multinational shareholders. The problem isn’t that we don’t know what policy changes are needed to give all local communities, villages, towns and cities the ability to generate their own heat and power from local renewable energy sources. What’s lacking is the political will to stand up to the Big Six.Caroline Lucas MPGreen, Brighton Pavilion • Matt Gorman, sustainability director at Heathrow – itself an oxymoron –misstates the Committee on Climate Change concerning runway expansion in the south-east (Letters, 4 September). The committee has established a legal limit of 37.5m tonnes of CO2 a year to cover all UK civil aviation emissions through to 2050, to ensure aviation growth fits within the targets for overall greenhouse gas reduction. Current annual aviation emissions are around 33m tonnes a year, so while it might just about be possible to allocate the available headroom – approximately 4.5m tonnes – to an additional runway anywhere in the south-east, which the CCC has said could happen mathematically, this would mean no further aviation CO2 budget for expansion elsewhere in the UK. A busy third runway at Heathrow or a second at Gatwick would very likely soak all this up. We cannot find any statement or form of words that would support Mr Gorman’s claim that the CCC supports a third runway at Heathrow airport. Jeffrey GazzardBoard member, Aviation Environment Federation • Guy Standing (Comment, 5 September) makes some useful suggestions how the fruits of fracking could at least be more fairly distributed than was the case of North Sea oil. One further suggestion: the first use of any profit should be to fund alternative forms of energy for a time when there is no recoverable oil or gas.Richard BullWoodbridge, Suffolk"
"Global consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers has released a timely analysis on economic growth and carbon emissions, which makes the point that there is a ""disconnect between the global climate negotiations aiming for a 2°C limit on global warming, but national pledges may only manage to limit it to 3°C, and current trajectory actually on course for 4°C."" The report was released in the lead up to the United Nations climate change summit in New York, which will also be the focus of global climate rallies, to hammer home the message that ""taking decisive action to avoid the extremes of climate change is a pre-condition for sustained economic growth"".  The PwC analysis shows that in order to keep to the 2°C limit on warming, decarbonisation of the global economy would need to occur at ""five times the rate currently achieved"". In the analysis, Australia topped the chart for the second year running in decarbonisation rates for 2013, recording a 7.2 percent reduction in carbon emissions. China had a decarbonisation rate of 4 percent, while many major economies including the USA, India, Germany and Brazil increased their carbon intensity. This was largely due to increased coal consumption and a ""slower pace of change to renewable energy"". At the New York climate summit, delegates will be discussing how to achieve the 2°C limit on global warming. This is the same limit on global warming that was described in 2009 at the Copenhagen summit as a ""suicide pact"". With less hyperbole, outspoken climate scientist James Hansen warned that ""international negotiations for two degrees of warming is actually a prescription for long-term disaster"". As climate activist and 350.org founder Bill McKibben pointed out in his confronting 2012 Rolling Stone article, the warming we have already locked in, about 0.8°C, is already causing ""far more damage than most scientists expected"". While policy analysis like that produced by PwC is welcome, in that it hopefully emphasises to business and political leaders the urgent need for rapid economic transformation, it also continues the ""myth"" that 2°C is an appropriate limit. The 2°C target, as pointed out recently by climate activist and author David Spratt, is a ""very unsafe target"" and is ""more appropriately considered as the boundary between dangerous and very dangerous climate change"". Scientists and climate policy experts have been saying for this for years. For example, back in 2006, the Independent reported that dangerous climate change would be ""likely to be unstoppable"" if atmospheric carbon concentration exceeded 400 parts per million. In July 2014, the concentration was 399 and exceeded 400 in April this year. Stabilisation at two degrees warming is not a policy for a safe climate. A Royal Society paper by Kevin Anderson and Alice Bows in 2008 points out that ""The framing of climate change policy is typically informed by the 2 degrees C threshold; however, even stabilizing at 450 ppmv CO2e [parts per million of carbon dioxide equivalent] offers only a 46 per cent chance of not exceeding 2 degrees C."" They further point out that the 2°C limit is the result of very optimistic scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and that to achieve ""stabilisation"" would require an unprecedented step change in the global economic model and the rapid deployment of successful CO2 scrubbing technologies"". IPCC scenarios have been criticised as systematically underestimating the pace and severity of global warming. As Glenn Scherer wrote in 2012, we are facing unstoppable, ""non-linear ""light switch"" moments when the climate system abruptly shifts from one paradigm to another"", where global warming becomes locked in and self-reinforcing. The delegates to New York, and leaders around the world, must recognise the stark reality: two degrees is unacceptably and dangerously inappropriate as a mitigation and adaptation target. Having reached the 400 parts per million threshold this year, it is clear that we are struggling to even keep within the 2°C warming limit. Most of the world, including Australia under the Abbott government, is continuing with ""business as usual"". Worse, most countries are giving mere lip service to the the 2°C limit, with many national pledges limiting warming to 3°C. As George Monbiot pointed out last year, governments are collaborating ""in the disaster they publicly bemoan"". A report, ""Paris 2015: getting a global deal on climate change"", released in the lead up to the New York summit by the Green Alliance UK (including Greenpeace and the WWF) underlined this: Emissions reduction pledges for the period up to 2020 have been made by more than 90 countries but, added together, these are, in the words of the UN, ""far from sufficient to close the emissions gap."" ... There is an appetite for action on climate change. But global warming has not been reduced to safe levels. The world is currently on track for warming of at least 3 to 4°C by 2100, which would have far reaching consequences for food security, fresh water availability, and the frequency and intensity of storms.15 At this level of climate change, the efficacy of adaptation strategies would be severely limited. These statements are largely backed up by the PwC report. PwC is hardly a radical green organisation, yet it makes the point that the world's nations have missed decarbonisation targets for six years in a row and that ""we are way behind"" avoiding even the 2°C ""suicide pact"" target. It states that decarbonisation must occur at a rate of 6.2 percent per year, a global rate that is unprecedented. Global investments in fossil fuels continues to outstrip investment in renewables, largely due to global policy settings that favour fossil fuel extraction and consumption. Many of these investments will result in stranded assets as the impact of global warming becomes worse. In Australia, to seriously and substantially contribute to avoiding 2°C in warming, we must reduce our carbon emissions by at least 25 percent by 2020. This reduction goal is the stated bi-partisan policy of both the Abbott government and the Labor party; although the Abbott government's ""direct action"" policy has no chance whatsoever of meeting even the lower bi-partisan target of 5 percent reductions. A challenge for us all leading up to the New York summit is that the 2°C target rhetoric is likely sabotaging policy negotiations that would meaningfully tackle global warming.

"Early springs, rising temperatures and longer growing seasons mean we’re increasingly able to grow a wider variety of foods in the UK. It’s not just luxury products such as British Caviar or English wine, it’s everyday products too, such as tea and beans. In a survey by Farming Futures, over a quarter of farmers reported that they are seeing the effects of climate change on their land now and 60% think they’ll experience it over the next 10 years.  While this presents massive problems both to the global food system and here in the UK, it may also mean that we can grow crops that thrive in warmer soils. So the British larder could soon be stocked with a whole new load of local and seasonal produce. This year is set to be a bumper year for the British tea plantation at the 700-year old Tregothan Estate in Cornwall. Its English-grown tea is available in Waitrose as well as sold online and in independent grocers. “Most people still haven’t got the foggiest idea that tea can be grown in the UK,” says Jonathan Jones, the managing director of Tregothan: “This year, however, is set to be a record harvest for us, with well over ten tonnes of tea.” While it’s possible to cultivate tea bushes, even in colder parts of the UK and urban areas (people plant them in gardens) Tregothan is the only single-estate British tea that’s produced on a commercial basis. The estate’s particular micro-climate makes the tea plantation possible: the tea bushes benefit from the sea water levels deep in the soil, yet the area is far enough inland to avoid a salt breeze from the sea (which would damage the leaves). While the estate currently produces less than one per cent of the UK’s tea needs, this year is set to be a record. “It would be tricky to grow tea elsewhere in Britain,” says Jones: “But over the next few years, it may well be that some of crops that are being grown now in places like Cornwall, will be able to be produced in other parts of the UK.” Quinoa, the ancient Andean superfood, is commonly grown in South America, but it can also be grown in the UK. Hodmedod’s, a company that sources and supplies British staples like peas and beans, says its British quinoa is a popular product. Quinoa is a seed prized for its nutritional value. However, some consumers consider it ethically controversial. Western demand for quinoa has reportedly seen its price treble on the world food markets over the past six years – which according to some reports, meant that communities in Bolivia, where it’s grown were no longer able to afford to eat it. “There was a strong reaction by consumers to those reports,” says Nick Saltmarsh, managing director of Hodmedod’s. “Many people who want to eat quinoa were feeling guilty if they bought the imported product, which is why they’re pleased to find it grown in Britain.” The crop has been grown in the UK for years but not for human consumption.  However, this is the second year that Hodemedods has sold quinoa, grown by farmer Peter Fairs in Essex. The company also sells British-grown fava beans, black badger beans and is currently trialling a red haricot bean. Saltmarsh says: “Fava beans have been grown here since the Iron Age but we’ve forgotten to grow and eat them. We’re trying to bring back traditional beans as well as experiment with varieties of other crops to see what grows well here.” British olives have a rich, fresher flavour and are often smaller than imported olives.“The flavour is incredibly intense,” according to Neil Davy, who has an olive grove outdoors, on his farm in Kent: “One British olive is equivalent in flavour to four of the imported table olives.” Davy is currently experimenting with varieties and crops, and has local chefs using the olives in nearby restaurants. He’s hoping to produce British olive oil in the future. “I’m sending olives to laboratories this year, to test the quality of the oil,” he says: “No one in Britain has produced it yet but then, people didn’t use to think we could grow olives outdoors in this country, but we can.” Sussex-based Stephen and Sarah Nunn say that their olive crop (which is grown indoors) is looking good this year. Last year, the couple harvested 250kg of olives. The olives sell at farmers’ markets, local shops and online, for around £3.50 for 100g. “They’re often bought as gifts as treats,” says Stephen Nunn: “The flavour is intense and people are surprised to find that olives can grow here.” For fresh buffalo mozzarella, your best bet may be Hampshire, rather than Italy. Laverstoke Park Farm is 2,500 acres of organic lane, in Overton, near Basingstoke and home to over 1,000 water buffalos. It sells burgers, sausages, buffalo-milk ice-cream and mozzarella, at its farm shops in Basingstoke and Twickenham, at Planet Organic and online. One of the plus sides to being able to produce more food in the UK, is that the food has a quicker route from farm to fork, which means we’re able to eat products while they’re fresher – and fresh mozzarella has a different taste and texture to the imported types sold in the UK. Jody Scheckter, fomer Formula One champion, took on a very different career as a biodynamic farmer and founder of Laverstoke Park Farm. He says: “For example, with really fresh mozzarella, the milk oozes out and you eat it naturally, with your fingers. In Italy, they say that if you don’t have a mess on your face, you are not eating mozzarella. Only after four days is it eaten with basil and tomatoes and olive oil.” This year is a bumper year for apricots – a fruit that’s now being produced on a commercial scale by farmers in the south of England. “We’re still picking them,” says Sean Finlay, farm manager at Highfield Court Farm, near Canterbury in Kent. “We’re getting about 12 tons of apricots per hectare this year, partly because we had a mild winter.” There are fewer than a dozen farms in the UK which grow apricots on a commercial scale but British apricots are sold in major supermarkets as well as at farm shops.  But while the warmer summers and mild winters mean that growing the soft fruit is possible, it’s still a crop with a question mark over it, according to Finlay. He says: “The problem is that you only get a good crop one year in three so they’re expensive to grow over here for sale. People are willing to pay for British apricots but it’s hard to compete with the imported prices. Our pick your own apricots are £2.50 a kilo whereas the imported apricots are £1 a kilo.” Interested in finding out more about how you can live better?

"Touted as the ultimate superfood and an essential ingredient in everything from mezze to marzipan: the humble almond has never been so popular. But with prices at a nine-year high, almonds are in the frontline of a battle over water as California struggles to cope with one of its worst-ever droughts – stoking fears of an almond shortage over Christmas. Californian farmers, estimated to grow around 80% of the world's almonds, have been accused of siphoning off groundwater at the expense of the state's future water reserves.  As rivers and lakes have dried up, with more than 80% of the state in the grip of ""extreme"" or ""exceptional"" drought, the state's farmers have resorted to pumping groundwater – underground reserves – to nourish almond trees, vineyards and orchards. David Zetland, economics professor at Leiden University College in the Netherlands, says farmers are pumping water at a rate four to five times greater than can be replenished: ""The people of the state of California are more or less destroying themselves in order to give cheap almonds to the world."" Although California produces even more milk and grapes than almonds, the spotlight has turned on the $4.3bn (£2.65bn) almond crop, following a rapid expansion in planting. Almost a million acres of California's central valleys have been planted with almond trees – a twofold increase since 1996. The world's appetite for the nut – which botanists actually classify as a seed – apparently knows no bounds, with scores of academic studies extolling its ability to lower cholesterol, sate the appetite and improve the skin. In the US, almonds have overtaken peanuts as the country's favourite snack, while almond milk has overtaken soy, as milk from cows continues to fall out of favour. In the UK, sales of almonds increased by 45% over 2012-13 after a marketing blitz in lifestyle magazines. In China, where the nuts were initially marketed as ""big American apricot kernels"" – a fruit with lucky connotations – demand has grown by 110% since 2008, although sales dipped last year after the name of the product was changed. California has emerged as the world's almond orchard because it is blessed with near-perfect conditions found in few regions of the world: brief cold winters that chill the seed to accelerate its flowering (vernalisation), early warm springs and long dry summers. David Doll, crop adviser for Merced County at the University of California, says the state may be approaching peak production for almonds. ""The future for farming almonds in California will always be there,"" he says, pointing out almonds are more tolerant to drought than other crops. ""It is more about coming into balance with our water resources."" But nearly two thirds of farmers with large almond holdings recently said they expect to pump more groundwater this year than last. A recent report from the University of California found that farmers had spent an extra $500m in pumping extra water to cope with the drought, while the total cost to the state reached $2.2bn. However, Richard Howitt, a co-author of the study, cautions against singling out particular crops: ""Don't blame almonds for the problem. The problem is one of water mismanagement."" He wants to see sweeping changes in how California manages water, so farmers monitor their use of groundwater and replenish supplies when rain is more plentiful. ""[The farmers] should be repaying what they are taking. And if they are taking more, as they always are in droughts, then they should be making plans to repay it back in the wet years,"" he says. ""If you treat your groundwater they way you treat your retirement account, then everything would be OK."" A spokesperson for the Almond Board of California says almond producers are using water more efficiently than ever before. ""California almond growers are proud leaders in agriculture water efficiency, using 33% less water per pound of almond produced as compared to 20 years ago."" The US department of agriculture is forecasting a record 952bn kg crop. But when the harvest ends in late October, most experts think the crop will be smaller, as that estimate – based on a survey of 890 orchards – was made before the drought's severity was clear. With the drought forecast to drag on into 2015, many growers are unwilling to sell this year's crop, sending prices soaring. Growers want to conserve stocks, because they fear the damage to next year's crop will be even worse. ""Most farmers have been able to get by this year because they have begged or borrowed water,"" says Doll. ""If we have another year of drought we will probably start to experience problems."" And if the drought goes into 2016, ""the impacts would be devastating"". The price of Californian almonds has climbed by 10% over the last six to eight weeks to $10,500 a tonne, according to Giles Hacking, a London-based trader and vice president of the International Tree Nut Council. ""The prices are rising because concerns about crop size are bringing more buyers to market, but suppliers are holding back from sales. It has the effect of squeezing prices,"" he says. Sanjoy Das, founder of Freeworld Trading in Edinburgh, says trade is at a standstill. ""These are record high prices. The result will be very expensive [almonds] and a lack of almonds for the Christmas market."" Zetland says higher prices should be welcomed, if combined with tighter regulation of California's water management. He dismisses the idea that consumers should steer clear of Californian almonds, arguing that the only way to curb ""unsustainable"" supplies would be even higher prices. ""The problem is that California, because of its failed institutions for managing water, is allowing these almonds to come on market at $3-$4 a pound wholesale, when the price would be tripled if California was managing its water sustainably and farmers faced the real cost of water."""
"We have long suspected that greenhouse gases which cause the Earth to warm would lead to a wetter atmosphere. The latest research published by Eul-Seok Chung, Brian Soden, and colleagues provides new insight into what was thought to be an old problem. In doing so, they experimentally verified what climate models have been predicting. The models got it right… again. To be clear, this paper does not prove that water vapor is a greenhouse gas. We have known that for years. Nevertheless, the paper make a very nice contribution. The authors show that the long-term increase in water vapor in the upper troposphere cannot have resulted from natural causes – it is clearly human caused. This conclusion is stated in the abstract,  Our analysis demonstrates that the upper-tropospheric moistening observed over the period 1979–2005 cannot be explained by natural causes and results principally from an anthropogenic warming of the climate. By attributing the observed increase directly to human activities, this study verifies the presence of the largest known feedback mechanism for amplifying anthropogenic climate change. As stated earlier, climate models have predicted this moistening – before observations were available. In fact, the models predicted that the upper troposphere would moisten more than the lower atmospheric layers. As the authors state,  Given the importance of upper-tropospheric water vapor, a direct verification of its feedback is critical to establishing the credibility of model projections of anthropogenic climate change. To complete the experiments, the authors used satellite measurements of radiant heat. The emissions have changed but it wasn’t clear why they have changed. Changes could be caused by increases in temperature or from increased water vapor. To separate the potential effects, the authors compared the first set of experiments with others made at a different wavelength. That comparison provided a direct measure of the separate effect of moistening. Next, the authors used the world’s best climate models to test whether the observed trends could be caused by natural changes in the Earth’s climate or whether they require a human influence. Sure enough, only the calculations that included human-emitted greenhouse gases matched the observations. The authors conclude that,   Concerning the satellite-derived moistening trend in recent decades, the relations of trend and associated range among three experiments lead to the conclusion that an increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gases is the main cause of increased moistening in the upper troposphere. The authors then went further by showing that their computed results encompass third-party measurements only when the impacts of human-emitted greenhouse gases are included. I chuckled when I asked Dr. Andrew Dessler about this study, and he told me, Because of water vapor’s importance as a greenhouse gas, the water vapor feedback occupies a central role in the climate system. Over the years, our understanding of this process has increased steadily, and this paper is a very useful contribution. It nicely demonstrates that the observations of upper tropospheric moistening are unlikely to have arisen without the increase in carbon dioxide from human activities. At this point, I think it would be fair to say, “stick a fork in it, the water vapor feedback’s done.” So once again, observations have confirmed the models and the scientists can check another item off their “to do” box."

"India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, reportedly will be a no-show at the United Nations climate summit this month. Could it be because he does not accept the science behind climate change? Modi used to be a supporter for climate action. But in public remarks on two occasions in the last week, the leader of one of the fastest growing – and biggest emitting – economies appeared to express doubt about whether climate change was even occurring. “Climate has not changed. We have changed. Our habits have changed. Our habits have got spoiled. Due to that, we have destroyed our entire environment,” the rightwing leader told students in a video Q&A, according to India Today on Friday. Modi was also vague on global warming and its causes in an interview with The Hindu a few days earlier.  “Climate change? Is this terminology correct? The reality is this that in our family, some people are old ... They say this time the weather is colder. And, people’s ability to bear cold becomes less,” he said.  “We should also ask is this climate change or have we changed. We have battled against nature. That is why we should live with nature rather than battle it,” he said. Both sets of comments are at variance with Modi’s earlier views on climate change, set out in an e-book, published in 2011 when he was chief minister of Gujarat.  The e-book, called Convenient Action in an apparent tribute to Al Gore, frames action on climate change as a moral duty.  “Climate change is definitely affecting the future generations which, as of now, have no voice on the actions of present generation,” Modi wrote.  As Gujarat’s chief minister, he oversaw the final phases of construction of the hugely controversial Narmada dam. But he goes to great length in the e-book to promote his actions on climate change, expanding the use of solar and wind power, and switching to natural gas as fuel for vehicles.  In the book, Modi also took a swipe at climate deniers. “I remember, a few years ago, I used to read on lot of sceptic views of climate change, whether or not it was actually happening. Having been in public life, I am aware of behind-the-scene lobbying by vested interests that normally accompany any such carefully orchestrated campaigns.” So what’s changed? Since his election, Modi has dismantled a number of environmental protections, clearing the way for new coal mines and other industrial projects. He also blocked funds to Greenpeace and other environmental groups and is known to be vehemently anti-NGOs. But the real problem could be the fast rising pace of India’s emissions. In the past few months, the other giant emitters – China and America – have taken steps to reduce carbon pollution.  Projections from the Energy Information Administration show China’s emissions could start levelling off in 2030. India’s? They are due to rise by 60% between 2020 and 2040.  That could put Modi under some pressure on 23 September when the United Nations secretary general Ban Ki-moon convenes his climate summit of world leaders. So while Modi has created confusion about his views on climate change, one thing seems clear: he does not want to have a conversation about what India plans to do about it."
"The UK government is lobbying the European commission (EC) to keep open one of Europe’s dirtiest coal power stations, even though its nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions exceed new legal limits by five times. The EC has begun infraction proceedings against the UK because its proposals for reducing emissions under new European laws have been littered with “inconsistent or missing” data.  Aberthaw power plant in south Wales was named in the top 30 highest carbon-emitting plants in Europe by an alliance of NGOs last month. But its emissions of NOx, which causes respiratory problems and lung disease, are also extremely high. The plant is specifically designed to burn coal from the local area, which is unusually difficult to ignite and needs a chemical catalyst added to make it burn. This process results in NOx emissions of around 1,000 mg/Nm3. The limit on NOx set by the European industrial emissions directive (IED) is 200 mg/Nm3. Under this new law, the 1,555MW plant would have to be shut down by 2016. The EC and UK disagree on whether the plant qualifies for an exemption from the limits. An EC spokesperson confirmed that the UK continues to lobby for the plant to stay open, adding that “for the time being, the closure of the plant is not considered”. A spokesperson for the Welsh government, which is leading negotiations on Aberthaw, said it hoped to come to an “acceptable resolution” but would not specify what the government defined as acceptable. He confirmed the UK’s Department of Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs (Defra) was also “heavily involved”.  Defra refused to comment, saying infraction cases are subject to a confidentiality agreement. Greenpeace energy analyst Jimmy Aldridge said: “The fact that it’s [Defra] that is trying to keep one of the most polluting power stations in Europe open is beyond parody. If the government’s special pleading is successful then Aberthaw will continue to produce toxic emissions harming people’s health for years to come and seriously damage our efforts to tackle climate change.” Aberthaw currently receives an exemption from the EC that allows it to emit up to 1,200 mg/Nm3 of NOx. This is based on previous UK pleas to allow the plant to continue because it was using low-volatility indigenous coal and supporting a major local industry. The 43-year-old station operators, RWE npower, is now mixing local coal with other types of coal, that is easier to combust. Currently 30% of the coal on site is from overseas, mainly Russia. The EC exemption is based on the plant burning coal of less than 10% volatility. Now, it uses coals of between 6% and 15% and the UK has not provided precise data on the annual average volatility.  The EC says that it is therefore no longer eligible for the extra emissions. The government disagrees with the EC and says Aberthaw should be treated as a low-volatility plant. Defra has submitted two Transitional National Plans (TNPs), which outline to the EC how emissions will be reduced, which include the maximum exemption of 1,200 mg/Nm3 for Aberthaw. It is unclear how long the UK is asking for the exemption to last. The EC has rejected both proposals and commenced formal infraction proceedings against the UK.  Unions are now worried that the conflict could leave no room for compromise and the plant could close in less than two years. Aldridge says that if Aberthaw receives the full allowance of 1,200 mg/Nm3, it might not just water down emissions reductions for one plant, but the whole country. Under the UK TNP, plants would be given tradeable credits that they can sell to other more polluting plants if they reduce their own emissions.  In July, RWE npower announced plans to retrofit low-emission boilers to Aberthaw, with the potential to reduce NOx emissions by 60%. This could flood the UK market with meaningless emissions credits. A spokesperson for rival power company Eon said special treatment should be avoided. “Our view is very much that each time special treatment is granted for a specific named plant, investments in emissions abatement that have been made in good faith, on the assumption that regulations will be implemented consistently, are undermined.”"
"Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to take to the streets of New York, London and eight other cities worldwide in a fortnight to pressure world leaders to take action on global warming, in what organisers claim will be the biggest climate march in history. On 23 September, heads of state will join a New York summit on climate change organised by Ban Ki-moon, the first time world leaders have come together on the issue since the landmark Copenhagen summit in 2009, which was seen as a failure.  The UN secretary general hopes the meeting will inject momentum into efforts to reach a global deal on cutting greenhouse gas emissions by the end of 2015, at a conference in Paris. Ricken Patel, executive director of digital campaign group Avaaz, one of the organisers of the People’s Climate March on 21 September, said the demonstration was intended to send a signal to those world leaders, who are expected to include David Cameron and Barack Obama, though not heads of state from China and India. “We in the movement, activists, have failed up until this point to put up a banner and say if you care about this, now is the time, here is the place, let’s come together, to show politicians the political power that is out there on there. Our goal is to mobilise the largest climate change mobilisation in history and the indications are we’re going to get there,” he told the Guardian. Patel said he expects more than a hundred thousand people at the New York march alone, which will be the focus of the day’s events. Although many of the hundreds of organisations that have committed to taking part are environmental groups, he said not all those attending would be traditional ‘green’ activists.  “There’s a very strong range and diversity of people from all walks of life, including immigrant rights groups, social justice groups. Whoever you are and wherever you are, climate change threatens us all so it brings us together.” Open contributions: Climate March Nearly 400,000 have signed a call on Avaaz’s site, saying they will attend one of the global events, which also include marches in Berlin, Paris, Delhi, Rio and Melbourne. Patel added: “We’re building for the longterm here. This is about launching a movement that can literally save the world over the longterm. We want to build to last. We recognise that at this stage what needs be done is build political momentum behind this issue – our governments are nowhere near even the planning to reach the agreements needed to keep warming below [temperature rises of] 2C.” Around 500 adverts will appear on the London tube network from Monday, calling on people to join the march, and advertising has already appeared across the New York subway. In Rio, the organisers have permission to project messages about the march on to the statue of Christ. In an open letter to be published this week, environment and development groups including Greenpeace, Oxfam and WWF, plus politicians including Green party MP Caroline Lucas and Labour MP Tom Watson, have joined with trade unions and faith groups to call on world leaders to use the UN summit to take action on climate change.  “Politicians all over the world cite a lack of public support as a reason not to take bold action against climate change. So on 21 September we will meet this moment with unprecedented public mobilisations in cities around the world, including thousands of people on the streets of London.  “Our goal is simple – to demonstrate the groundswell of demand that exists for ambitious climate action,” they write. Celebrities backing the People’s Climate March include model Helena Christensen, musician Peter Gabriel, actor Susan Sarandon, Argentine footballer Lionel Messi and actor Edward Norton. The previous biggest assembly for a climate march was in Copenhagen in 2009, when tens of thousands of people took to the streets. Separately on Monday, NGOs Greenpeace, WWF, Green Alliance, RSPB and Christian Aid published a report, Paris 2015: Getting a global agreement on climate change, laying out the level of ambition required for a deal at the UN climate talks in Paris.  Matthew Spencer, Green Alliance’s director, said: “There is a fashionable pessimism about multilateralism which shields people from disappointment but does nothing to protect us from the insecurity that climate change is bringing. Only a strong international agreement can avoid that and give nation states the confidence that they will not be alone as they decarbonise their energy systems.” "

"You could cut the triumphalism on the climate science denialist blogs right now with a hardback copy of George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four. Their unbridled joy comes not in the wake of some key research published in the scientific literature but in the fact that a climate sceptic has got a mainstream newspaper to give their conspiracy theory another airing.  The sceptic in question is Dr Jennifer Marohasy, a long-time doubter of human-caused climate change whose research at Central Queensland University (CQU) is funded by another climate change sceptic. I choose the Nineteen Eighty-Four analogy in my introduction because it is one of Marohasy’s favourites. She likes to compare the work of the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) to the various goings on in Orwell’s fictional dystopian novel. The conspiracy theory is that BoM is using a technique to selectively tamper with its temperature data so that it better fits with the global warming narrative. The people at NASA are in on it too. Now the great thing about conspiracy theories is that, for believers, attempts to correct the record just serve to reinforce the conspiracy. Like a video clip of the moon landing on a constant loop, the whole thing feeds back on itself. Correspondence posted on Marohasy’s blog shows she has been pushing her claims for months that BoM has “corrupted the official temperature record so it more closely accords with the theory of anthropogenic global warming”, according to a letter she wrote to Liberal Senator Simon Birmingham, whose parliamentary secretary portfolio includes responsibility for the agency. Marohasy lays it on thick in the letter, accusing the bureau of engaging in “propaganda” and littering the text with claims of “corruption”. The Australian’s environment editor Graham Lloyd was approached to cover the “story” and stepped bravely forward with four pieces in recent days covering Marohasy’s claims. Lloyd wrote there was now an “escalating row” over the “competence and integrity” of the BoM despite the fact that Marohasy has not published her claims in a peer reviewed journal (the two papers mentioned in Lloyd’s story actually relate to rainfall prediction, not temperature). Yet this matters not. The climate science denialists, contrarians and anti-environmental culture warriors are lapping it up with headlines like “Australia Government Climate Office Accused Of Manipulating Temperature Data” and “Australian Bureau of Meteorology Accused of Criminally Adjusting Global Warming”. This evening the BoM has released a statement that explains the processes at the bureau. I’ve posted it in full at the bottom of this post, but here’s a quote: Contrary to assertions in some parts of the media, the Bureau is not altering climate records to exaggerate estimates of global warming. The BoM maintains several sets of data on temperatures in Australia and the agency makes all that data available online. One of those datasets is known as the Australian Climate Observations Reference Network – Surface Air Temperature (ACORN-SAT) and this is the one BoM used to declare 2013 was the hottest year on record. Marohasy has been looking at some of the temperature stations that are included in ACORN-SAT and analysing the impact of a method known as “homogenisation” that the BoM sometimes employs with the ACORN-SAT data. It’s no secret or even a revelation that the Bureau of Meteorology employs these techniques and others. On the bureau’s website, anyone is free to lose themselves in a world of homogenised data sets, gridded temperature analysis and temporal homogeneity adjustments. Go for your life. While Marohasy’s central claim – that BoM is doctoring figures to make them more acceptable to a narrative of warming - remains entirely untested in the scientific literature, the bureau’s methods used to compile ACORN-SAT have been peer reviewed. Unusually, the bureau’s full response to one set of questions from Graham Lloyd has found its way onto at least one climate sceptic blog. In the response the bureau explained why three specific site records it was asked about had been homogenised.  At Bourke, for example, the station had been moved three times in its history. Detective work had found that a noticeable shift in the readings in the 1950s had likely been due to changes in vegetation around the instrument. At Amberley, the bureau noticed a marked shift in the minimum temperatures it had been recording, which was also likely due to the station being moved.  Another site at Rutherglen had data adjusted to account for two intervals – 1966 and 1974 – when its thought the site was moved from close to buildings to low-flat ground.  Marohasy wants heads to roll [rolls eyes] because she claims that the Rutherglen site was never moved and so there was no need to homogenise the data. However, the bureau has documentary evidence showing that sometime before the 1970s the weather station was not in the place where it is now. The bureau had initially spotted a break or jump in the data that pointed to a likely move at Rutherglen. Perhaps all of these movements of temperature stations was a conspiracy in itself, cooked up in the 1950s? Professor Neville Nicholls, of Monash University, worked at BoM for more than 30 years and from 1990 until he left in 2005 had led efforts to analyse rainfall and temperature readings from across the country. He told me: The original raw data is all still there – it has not been corrupted. Anyone can go and get that original data. Pre-1910 there was not much of a spread but also there was more uncertainty about how the temperatures were being measured. By 1910, most temperatures were being measured in a Stevenson Screen. A lot of measurements were taken at Post Offices but in many cases these were moved out to airports around the middle of the 20th century. That produces artificial cooling in the data. Towns for example in coastal New South Wales originally had temperatures taken near the ocean because that’s where the town was. But as the town grew the observations would move inland and that is enough to affect temperature and rainfall.  Are we supposed to just ignore that? A scientist can’t ignore those effects. It’s not science to just go ahead and plot that raw data. Nicholls said if people didn’t trust the way the BoM was presenting the data they could look elsewhere, such as a major project known as Berkeley Earth undertaken by former sceptic Professor Richard Muller which also used BoM data from as early as 1852 to mid-2013. Before joining CQU, Marohasy spent many years working at the Institute of Public Affairs – a Melbourne-based free market think tank that has been promoting climate science denialism for more than two decades.  After leaving there, she became the chair of the Australian Environment Foundation, a spin-off from the IPA. Marohasy has said that Bryant Macfie, a Perth-based climate science sceptic, funds her research at Central Queensland University. In 2008, after Macfie had gifted $350,000 to the University of Queensland in a donation facilitated by the IPA to pay for environmental research scholarships there, he wrote that science had been corrupted by a “newer religion” of environmentalism.  In June, Marohasy made her claims about BoM to the Sydney Institute. In July she travelled to Las Vegas to speak at the Heartland Institute’s gathering of climate science denialists and assorted contrarians. The Heartland Institute is the “free market” think tank that once ran a billboard advert with a picture of terrorist and murderer Ted “Unabomber” Kaczynski alongside the question: “I still believe in Global Warming. Do You?” Also speaking in Las Vegas was federal MP for the Queensland electorate of Dawson, George Christensen, who appeared on a panel alongside Marohasy. Christensen described mainstream climate science as “a lot of fiction dressed up as science”. Dr Lisa Alexander, the chief investigator at the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science, explained that in Australia it was not uncommon for temperature stations to be moved, often away from urban environments.  She said that, for example, sites moved only a kilometre or so to more exposed areas such as airports would tend to record lower temperatures. That then creates a jump in the time series that’s not related to a jump in the climate. The bureau is altering the temperature data to remove those non-climatic effects that are due to changes like new instrumentation or site movements. Is the bureau fiddling the figures to fit with a global warming conspiracy? No! Are they amending the records to make them consistent through time? Yes. Also included in the BoM’s statement comes the following graph that overlays 18 different sets of temperature data for Australia - including (in yellow) another BoM dataset which is not homogenised. The graph also includes temperature measurements by satellite. Now either the satellites are also in on the warming conspiracy, or there’s something else going on. I wonder what that might be? Here is the Bureau’s statement in full. Contrary to assertions in some parts of the media, the Bureau is not altering climate records to exaggerate estimates of global warming. Our role is to make meteorological measurements, and to curate, analyse and communicate the data for use in decision making and to support public understanding. To undertake these tasks, the Bureau employs highly skilled technicians and scientists and invests in high quality monitoring equipment. The Bureau measures temperature at nearly 800 sites across Australia, chiefly for the purpose of weather forecasting. The Australian Climate Observations Reference Network – Surface Air Temperature (ACORN-SAT) is a subset of this network comprising 112 locations that are used for climate analysis. The ACORN-SAT stations have been chosen to maximise both length of record and network coverage across the continent. For several years, all of this data has been made publicly available on the Bureau’s web site. Temperature records are influenced by a range of factors such as changes to site surrounds (eg. trees casting shade or influencing wind), measurement methods and the relocation of stations (eg. from a coastal to more inland location). Such changes introduce biases into the climate record that need to be adjusted for prior to analysis. Adjusting for these biases, a process known as homogenisation, is carried out by meteorological authorities around the world as best practice, to ensure that climate data is consistent through time. At the Bureau’s request, our climate data management practices were subject to a rigorous independent peer-review in 2012. A panel of international experts found the Bureau’s data and methods were amongst the best in the world. The Bureau’s submissions to the review were published on the Bureau’s website, as were the findings of the review panel. The Bureau’s methods have also been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. Both the raw and adjusted ACORN-SAT data and the larger unadjusted national data set all indicate that Australian air temperatures have warmed over the last century. This finding is consistent with observed warming in the oceans surrounding Australia. These findings are also consistent with those of other leading international meteorological authorities, such as NOAA and NASA in the United States and the UK MetOffice. The high degree of similarity is demonstrated in Figure 1 (above). The Bureau strives to ensure that its data sets and analysis methods are as robust as possible. For this reason we place considerable emphasis on quality assurance, transparency and communication. The Bureau welcomes critical analysis of the Australian climate record by others through rigorous scientific peer review processes."
"For several centuries, the North-West passage was a myth. The idea of a route around the frozen north of Canada to the Indies that avoided the French, Dutch and Spanish ships that prowled the south seas was a fabulous prize for the British, one that spawned hundreds of expeditions, beginning as early as the reign of Henry VII.By 1815, war with Napoleon was over and the British had a gigantic navy with nothing to do. For John Barrow, the secretary of the Admiralty, finding the passage was an obsession, says Michael Smith, author of Last Man Standing, a biography of Francis Crozier, the captain of the HMS Terror. He sent a flurry of expeditions. As Smith says: “All spectacularly failed.”The Franklin expedition, in 1845, was Barrow’s last shot. It was commanded by Rear Admiral Sir John Franklin, a retired diplomat and explorer who had never actually attempted a polar expedition by sea before. The HMS Terror and the HMS Erebus, state-of-the-art steamships with iron-reinforced hulls, set sail from England on 19 May, accompanied by a supply vessel, the Baretto Junior, which was to go as far as Greenland.The Guardian – at the time still the Manchester Guardian – printed a letter sent back to England with the Baretto Junior by one of the officers of the expedition, written by the light of the midnight sun. “The weather here is delightful,” it reads. “We have received accounts from the Danes that the state of the ice to the northward is very favourable to our enterprise.”“Who knows!” it goes on. “We may get through this year.”The two ships were reported seen by British whaling ships in Baffin Bay, west of Greenland, before they left to cross Lancaster Sound. They were never seen again.  Exactly what happened to the Franklin expedition was a mystery that captured the public imagination. Dozens of missions to find the ships were launched, and while they never found them, during the search the northern waterways of Canada were mapped and explored.John Rae, a Scottish explorer and a consultant for the Hudson Bay Company, contacted native Inuit who had found the remains of some of the members of the doomed expedition. He concluded that “it is evident that our wretched Countrymen had been driven to the last dread alternative – cannibalism”.To prove his case, he brought back some artefacts the Inuit had. One of them was a silver plate engraved with the name of Sir John Franklin.Apart from these findings, the fate of the expedition remained a mystery for almost 170 years – until this week, when the wreckage of one of the ships was found by a Canadian scientific team. Ryan Harris, one of the lead archaeologists on the expedition, said that finding the ship was “like winning the Stanley Cup”. The official announcement of the find was made by Stephen Harper, the prime minister of Canada.  “This is truly a historic moment for Canada,” he said, in a bombastic statement to the press. “Franklin’s ships are an important part of Canadian history given that his expeditions, which took place nearly 200 years ago, laid the foundations of Canada’s Arctic sovereignty.”The certainty of the statement was perplexing to Suzanne Lalonde, a professor of international law at the University of Montreal. “I’ve been struggling with it – the way Prime Minister Harper announced the find as if there was a monumental confirmation of Canadian sovereignty,” she told the Guardian.Canada’s position is that the North-West Passage is already Canadian. In an official statement to the Guardian, Christine Constantin, a spokeswoman for the Canadian embassy in Washington, said: “All waters of the Canadian Arctic archipelago, including the various waterways known as the ‘North-West Passage’, are internal waters of Canada … Canada’s sovereignty over its waters in the Arctic is longstanding and well established.“No one disputes that the various waterways known as the ‘North-West Passage’ are Canadian waters.” The routes usually taken to constitute the North-West Passage pass between Canada’s mainland territory and its Arctic islands. Unfortunately, the United States disputes just that. A State Department official told the Guardian there has been “no recent change in our position – the North-West Passage is an international strait”. This might come as news to most Canadians. “If you asked the average Canadian,” says Tim Harper, a columnist for the Toronto Star (and no relation to the PM), “they would have no idea there was dispute. We believe that is our territory.” Harper thinks that the prime minister’s statement is a conscious move by the Canadian government, aimed at establishing Canada’s de facto sovereignty over the North-West Passage in the collective psyche.  “The way [Stephen Harper] made Arctic sovereignty a priority when he came to power – he is trying to counteract the US view that this is an international waterway,” he said. “The more activity, the more high-profile actions – which this certainly was – it makes a sort of de facto case. It reinforces in the public and international consciousness that this is a Canadian waterway.”He said nobody would go so far as to suggest that finding the ship made a legal case for sovereignty – the ship is, after all, British – “but it helps as a symbolic case”.The disagreement between Canada and the US dates back as far as the Reagan administration. In 1985, a US icebreaker called the USCGC Polar Sea navigated the North-West Passage without Canadian authorisation, which caused outrage in Canada – outrage the Soviet Union stoked by officially backing Canada’s position.In the wake of the controversy, Canada’s drew lines around its outer Arctic limits, and has since claimed everything within those lines as “internal waters”. But the US never recognised that move as legitimate.In a letter to the Canadian prime minister, Brian Mulroney, President Reagan said “we cannot agree to an arrangement that obliges us to seek permission for our vessels to navigate through the North-West Passage”. Since then, an uneasy pact between the two positions and the relative impassability of the North-West Passage to any vessels other than icebreakers has left the issue largely academic. But now, climate change is drastically improving ice conditions – the same change that made it possible to find the wreck – and promises to turn the North-West Passage from the murderous icebound straits that claimed the Erebus and the Terror into the sort of lucrative trade route Franklin set out to find.The US Office of Naval Intelligence Arctic Roadmap shows that while in 2012 the North-West Passage never dropped below 40% sea ice – to all intents and purposes impassable to commercial traffic – it projects that by 2025 therewill be an eight-week “shoulder season”, where the passage will have only 10-40% sea ice, and by 2030 there will be five weeks in mid-September where the route is projected to be “open water”, with less than 10% sea ice.In fact, the first large freight vessel ever to pass the North-West Passage did so last year – the Nordic Orion, delivering coal from Vancouver to Finland. As the Panama Canal reaches capacity, the potential for another viable shipping route between the Pacific and the Atlantic is of vast commercial significance. Ultimately, Lalonde, who spent four years working on a research project about the legal and political implications of a thawing and increasingly navigable North-West Passage, thinks that Harper’s braggadocio – as well as the millions his government spent on the search – is meant as a visible and symbolic confirmation of how serious Canada is about the north, and how determined he is to reaffirm it as part of Canada’s national identity. She said the lines drawn in 1985 only have legal basis if their claim to outline “historic waters” gain credibility.“If that’s the case,” she said, “if he can convince the world of that, then the fact that we’ve been integral in discovering the wreck, and we keep hammering home that we have been present in those waters for a century, that we are governing those waters, [then] I think these are all elements that feed into that legal position.”Canada, which has been a signatory to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea since 2003, is currently working on the second part a submission to a UN commission that would extend its sovereignty by defining by coastal shelf – which would almost certainly also bring it into direct conflict with Russia, which, like Canada, claims jurisdiction reaching past the North Pole.Russia’s tactics have also been symbolically manipulative, even going so far as to plant a flag on the seabed at the Pole in 2007. At the time, a former Canadian foreign minister responded testily: “This isn’t the 15th century. You can’t go around the world and just plant flags.”"

"Children in developing countries are the worst affected by climate change, according to a recent Unicef report. This is not news. In 2013, a Unicef report found children in developing nations will bear the brunt of climate change, and in 2012 research by Oxfam likewise lamented the rise of malnourished children due to climate change. Why, after years of these findings, have governments and NGOs failed to include children in climate change debates? And how can policymakers include children's voices while tackling climate change? ""Schools and education can have a massive effect,"" says Roger Hart, lead author of the Unicef report and part of the children's environment research group. ""In developing countries children may have deep experience of an issue, such as water and sewage, but won't be involved in the decision making process. Engagement should begin through community projects at a grassroots and local government level."" One example is the Rockaway youth taskforce, located in Queens, New York, who, in the aftermath of hurricane Sandy, were the most visible aid group in the community, and gained international recognition for organising food supplies, and delivering them door-to-door to disabled and senior residents. Another young campaigner, Brianna Fruean from Samoa, was just 14 when she began organising community events and attended UN environment programme (Unep) conferences to promote sustainable transport and healthy living in response to climate change. ""Children can do things adult politicians can't,"" says Dale Rutstein, chief of communication and advocacy at Unicef. ""Young people need to be the ones making choices, as they are going to inherit this problem."" Rutstein also argues there is a role for NGOs, civil society, governments and community groups to involve children in meaningful, high level negotiations. There are, of course, obstacles to this approach: ""The problem is that when governments involve children, the ultimate decision is given to politicians or bureaucrats representing the government,"" says Scott Fisher, a researcher from the graduate centre of the City University of New York. ""We need to flip the traditional relationship of child citizens and create a view of government and citizens supporting each other, rather than citizens serving the government. This new relationship is necessary for addressing the challenges of climate change."" The development community should also aim to educate children as early as possible about the effects of climate change. ""We need to build environmental awareness, including youth knowledge about environmental processes and access to valued local environments,"" says Bronwyn Hayward, an author on the report and senior lecturer at the University of Canterbury, New Zealand. ""It is incredibly hard for children to protect something they don't have a natural, everyday affinity for. Children need access to quality natural environments for informal play and in everyday family life."" So, why isn't this already happening? ""The key obstacle is a lack of understanding of the important role that children can play,"" says Catherine Cameron, director at Agulhas Applied Knowledge, a research and knowledge hub specialising in the nexus between climate, fragility and governance. ""Policymakers need to prioritise this – do it first, then you build the action around the children, rather than trying to retrofit an adult based approach."" Governments, NGOs and academics must invite children into their climate change talks, listen to them and include them in the decision-making process. While this is counter-cultural in many societies, projects outlined in the report show children can be successfully integrated in the planning and implementation of responses to climate change, even in remote areas. As the most affected by this issue, children should be involved and have been shown to mobilise a more efficient response.

"There is a grassroots environmental revolution going on across the UK that gets little or no recognition. We hear about examples individually – a project here, a green group there – but we rarely stitch together the full picture.  But a closer look at almost any small or large community, any city or village, reveals a multitude of people working on a local scale to make their homes and neighbourhood kinder, closer, and greener. There are projects to calm or eject traffic, projects to grow food and to plant flowers, projects which bring people together, where the stronger provide help and support for the more vulnerable. There are farms which have been set up by the local community, there are gardens planted on rubbish heaps, there are local harvests scattered across a street’s front gardens.   This may come as a surprise, if you’re not already involved in one of these groups. For the last few years, ever since the car-crash of international negotiation that was the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference, most of us have fretted that little or no progress is being made environmentally, that progress is stalled. And on an international level that was certainly the case for a good few years.  But on a local level it has been a completely different story. While politicians have wrung their hands, or stuck their heads into the nearest sandbank, communities everywhere have said: “We’d better get on with it then.” And then they have. (It’s notable just how many of those groups started in or around 2009, the year of Copenhagen.)   Over the next month on Live Better we’re going to focus on 17 different groups around the country who are all carrying out work that is hair-raisingly inspiring. Each project, in its own way, is doing vital work out of sheer passion and dogged determination. Each has had a transformative effect on the community that has instigated it; over and over again we’ve heard about groups getting some wind in their sails and going on to dream larger and larger dreams, and then beginning to make those dreams reality. Over and over again we’ve heard people say: “We never imagined we could do this.” And yet they have.  We’ve picked these groups with the help of a long list of organisations who have put them forward; 10:10; FOE; Project Dirt; Neighbourly; UK Community Foundations; Groundwork; Business in the Community; Federation of City Farms and Community Gardens; the Prince’s Trust; Garden Organic; the Royal Horticultural Society; the RSPB; Keep Wales Tidy; The Wildlife Trusts; and Mind. Each organisation has sent us lots of suggestions, (and each has lobbied and enthused about the groups they work with). Over a couple of painful weeks we have narrowed several hundred down to just 17. We have picked groups that are lively and active in their own right, but also groups that will, taken altogether, make an attempt at representing the full breadth of grassroots activity across the country.  We’re dispatching writers to each of the 17 and profiling one, every weekday, for the next month – along with details about how you can help them, how you can find one in your own neighbourhood, or how you can set up something similar yourself. At the end of the month we’ll open up votes and you can pick your favourites. We will give the one with the most votes £1000, and the second and third £500 each (one voter will win £150 eco-vouchers in the process).  The groups we’ve chosen are all thriving, all inspiring in their own right. But best of all, there are countless hundreds more, just like them, all over the UK. We hope you will feel as inspired and cheered up by this lot as we do.  This article is part of the Live Better Community Project month. In September, we are showcasing 17 community projects from around the UK. On Wednesday 24 September, we will ask you to vote for your favourite project. The project with the most votes will be awarded £1,000 of funding, and two runners-up will each receive funding of £500. One voter chosen at random will receive £150 worth of gift vouchers for Nigel’s Eco Store. Terms and conditions here.

"Due to changing demographics, the health and social care system in the UK could become one of the largest sectors of the economy over the next 50 years. According to the Office for Budget Responsibility (pdf), health spending will rise from 6.8% of GDP in 2016-17 to 9.1% of GDP in 2061-62.  A big part of this system, the National Health Service (NHS) is one of the largest organisations in the world, with two million staff catering to a population of 52 million. The delivery of its services has a significant impact on the environment. The NHS, for example, is responsible for approximately 25% of all public sector greenhouse gas emissions in England. There are a number of reasons for growing engagement with the sustainability agenda, including increasingly stringent legislation and targets for costs savings. Healthcare waste has been included as one of the eight priorities in the waste prevention plan for England and the NHS is expected to have achieved efficiency savings of £15–20bn over 2011–14. Under the government’s Climate Change Act, NHS organisations have a commitment to meet a 10% reduction in carbon emissions by 2015 from a 1990 baseline. They are also expected to hit the mandatory governmental targets for emission reductions of 34% by 2020 and 80% by 2050. They are mandated to include sustainability and climate change in their annual reporting to Monitor, the independent regulator of NHS foundation trusts and the Department of Health. Tackling these environmental issues is a huge and complex task but improvement can realise significant financial, social and environmental dividends. The issue is how stakeholders can work together to make these initiatives work better. As a waste manager in a large organisation whose priority is patient care, convincing people of the need for efficient use and disposal of resources can be challenging. For example, it took over a year to get mixed recycling bins introduced to clinical spaces. You have got to pick your battles and celebrate your successes in the hope they spread. The terms “disposable” and “single use” are swear words to a sustainability professional, but they are often critical in a healthcare setting to reduce the spread of infection. There is, however, a tendency to extend this beyond necessity. It is important that we challenge this wherever possible, working with clinicians to make balanced decisions. We are getting there. In the last three years we have made over £800k of waste-related savings in our trust. This was achieved mainly by bringing together a number of waste and recycling contracts into a single one with tight sustainability focused specifications. This saved money and incentivised compliance with the waste hierarchy, tripling the rate of recycling and eliminating waste to landfill. NHS Trusts across the country are having to find millions of pounds worth of efficiency savings. Shifting to a circular economy can help achieve this, freeing up funds for patient care. In healthcare, far too many high value items such as furniture, unused medical products and pharmaceuticals end up as waste. A long-standing frustration in waste management has been measurement. For years, it was common for healthcare providers – and most public and private companies for that matter – to be presented with a waste invoice without clear or broken-down analysis of volumes or types of waste removed. We are addressing this at Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust by working in partnership with Bywaters, a waste services provider. Through staff education, regular auditing of waste streams, and the implementation of a department-specific tagging system for waste, the trust is revolutionising its approach to waste management. A small weighbridge at the Guy’s site – which spends nearly £500,000 on waste each year – will provide the team with a full understanding of where waste is coming from. This information can be used to engage staff and motivate them to reduce their waste. For those high value items that used to sneak into the waste, there are measures in place. If furniture is damaged the waste team, in partnership with Bywaters, provides in-house repair. When furniture is no longer needed in departments, an in-house sharing programme allows departments in need to request and receive the items free of charge. Since it began about five years ago, this programme has saved the trust hundreds of thousands of pounds. We waste resources at our economic, ecological and social peril. Using common sense and maximising the lifecycle of a product is simply good business.

"In this last post about the Years of Living Dangerously series, I focus on episode 8 (A Dangerous Future). This episode follows Matt Damon, Thomas Friedman and Michael Hall as they all become investigative journalists in different parts of the world. Each story is individually, is impactful but when they are juxtaposed, the connections between climate change and human welfare are obvious.  We meet Michael Hall as he disembarks in Bangladesh on a mission to find impacts of climate change on workers in developing economies. He meets with Bangladeshi journalists and top climate scientists and we learn about the tremendous impact of large and increasing storms on persons near the coast. These coastal people, who often lack robust infrastructure, face tough life choices following devastating storms. Scientific literature shows we expect approximately 3 feet of sea level rise by the end of the century. Because of the very flat topology of Bangladesh, approximately 17% of the land area will be inundated with sea water – 20 million people will be (and already are being) displaced. They are some of the world’s first climate refugees.  Bangladesh is a country the size of Iowa with half the population of the United States – think of that population density. What happens as increasing numbers of coastal communities are forced to migrate? What Michael Hall learns is that climate migrants are not a prediction of the future, rather a fact of the present. We meet some of the migrants who are forced to leave their home communities to seek dangerous work elsewhere. First-hand evidence shows that climate change stacks the deck against people in the developing world.  Next, the internationally respected journalist, Thomas Friedman, brings us to Yemen. This country survives with very little rainfall – rain which is decreasing in amount but increasing in variability (rainfalls, when they occur, happen in heavier downbursts). We learn that Yemen is a country that might actually run out of water. While water scarcity isn’t a problem limited to Yemen, this country nevertheless offers a glimpse of futures elsewhere. And of course, the problem of water in Yemen, like elsewhere, isn’t just a problem of climate change. It is an intersection of politics, history, violence, population growth, and water management. Like a systems engineer, Friedman sees the nexus of these connections through his investigating lens; with current social problems being multiplied into the future.  We see that in parts of the country, wealthy citizens can afford to have water brought in by truck. Less wealthy rely upon charities or other community water sources. In some areas, where water is available, reduced rainfall and increased populations have made it a resource worth fighting over. Two villages, literately a stone’s throw away (literately), are fighting over what little water remains after a 2/3 reduction in rainfall.  Of course, the Yemen government realizes this and in interviews with Friedman, they articulate an informed understanding of the problem. As with other countries, however, there is only so much they can do to resolve the water-scarcity problem facing its citizens. The third intersecting story is navigated by Matt Damon. His journey takes him deep into the human health effects of a warming planet. We meet Dr. Alex Hall from UCLA and learn how climate change is global, regional, and local. In large cities like Los Angeles, a global temperature increase is magnified by lack of trees and green spaces which would otherwise lower temperatures. Poorest areas, with very few green spaces, get hit harder during heat waves. During interviews with medical professionals, we learn firsthand that elevated body temperatures and dehydration can induce problems like premature delivery – a problem experienced first-hand by Matt Damon’s family.  Matt Damon’s ability to put 2 and 2 together is very sound science. My own research on biological thermal management clearly shows that extended durations of elevated temperatures induce stresses on humans. The effects can be acute or cumulative. Heat stress isn’t just a problem for vulnerable persons (elderly and children) - it can strike anyone. Heat is the leading cause of death for high school athletes. We also learn that conservatively, heat stress kills more people than all extreme weather events combined. Heat-related death is often camouflaged by common death causes (heart attack, stroke, etc.). But Matt Damon’s investigation, which compares death rates during hot times with those at other times, shows that heat is manifested under the radar as a silent but powerful killer. From episode 8 of Years of Living Dangerously (and all the episodes of the series), we learn good science; science that is echoed in the leading academic studies. But scientific studies generally don’t tell human stories. Sure, we can predict temperatures changes globally and regionally. Sure we can measure changes to rainfall patterns and drought indices. But what impact does this have on real people? What are the options real people have to deal with a climate changing now (not just in the future)? These episodes tell the stories that answer the questions. This is where the rubber meets the road – where a changing climate intersects our lives and the lives of those we care about. This is one of the reasons many climate scientists like myself are so passionate about communicating our understanding of the Earth’s system. What we do to the climate is having tremendous impacts today. But the good news is that there is something we can do about it. Yemen doesn’t have to be the future of the world; the power is in our hands to bend the arc of history."
" Australia’s chief scientist has suggested Tony Abbott’s top business adviser should stick to economics rather than “trawl the internet” for papers questioning the overwhelming scientific opinion on global warming. Maurice Newman, former chairman of the stock exchange and the ABC and now chairman of Abbott’s business advisory council, wrote an article in the Australian last week in which he warned that the world would be ill-prepared for global cooling, citing scientific papers predicting this would be the result of reduced solar activity.  Asked about the article, chief scientist Ian Chubb told Guardian Australia: “If you trawl the internet on a regular enough basis you can come up with the sorts of things that article was saying, but you still need to explain why the huge, the overwhelming scientific evidence says the opposite. “If you want to put up alternative theories you have to find some kind of credible evidence to support them … if you can’t do that you tend to resort to name-calling, calling global warming things like a religion or a cult or some kind of conspiracy,” Chubb said. In the article, Newman said that “like primitive civilisations offering up sacrifices to appease the gods, many governments, including Australia’s former Labor government, used the biased research to pursue “green gesture politics” and accused the “political establishment of being deaf” to evidence that global warming had “paused” and cooling was possible. “Having put all our eggs in one basket and having made science a religion, it bravely persists with its global warming narrative, ignoring at its peril and ours, the clear warnings being given by Mother Nature,” he wrote. Chubb suggested Newman stick to his areas of expertise. Chubb said he was “not an economist so I would be unwise to make a comment on the economy. I try to speak where I have knowledge. Almost everyone with knowledge would say Mr Newman’s comments are at odds with what they know, but people with no scientific knowledge persist in the view that they can find three or four papers from the hundreds and hundreds of papers on the subject and then dismiss the overwhelming bulk of evidence … it is a silly response to a very important issue.” Chubb’s response is not the first time the prime minister’s scientific adviser has taken issue with his business adviser’s views. In February, Chubb said the scientific evidence for human-induced global warming was so overwhelming that those who reject it are usually forced to “impugn the messenger” with “stupid expressions like ‘groupthink’” or “silly” arguments that global warming is a “delusion”. Newman was among those who had used the phrase “groupthink” in relation to the debate about climate science.  Tim Flannery, head of the climate council, said last week he was keen to meet Newman to discuss his understanding of climate science because the businessman appeared to have “little regard for science and facts”. Newman told the Australian environmentalists were trying to subject him to a gulag-style “re-education campaign”. Asked whether he had sought to speak to Newman, Chubb said: ”Neither of us has sought to speak to the other.” But he said he had “spoken to members of the government about the basic fundamentals of climate change science … about how we can actually observe what is happening.” As the Abbott government comes under fire for big cuts to science and research funding, and for not appointing a science minister, Chubb said he was establishing a new “science council” of business people, researchers and scientists to reset the way the government was advised on science policy. It would replace the prime minister’s science, engineering and innovation council, which has not met since the Abbott government was elected almost a year ago, but met regularly under former governments. “We are trying to say what is done is done and now we are trying to be strategic,” Chubb said. He said he “could not complain” about his own access to government, having met the prime minister on two or three occasions as well as other ministers. The claims made by Newman in his article have been fact checked by Guardian blogger Graham Readfern."
"Melting of glaciers caused by human activity has soared in the past 20 years, a study has shown.  Human influence is now the strongest driver of glacier melting, which has been occurring since the end of the “Little Ice Age” in the mid-19th century, it is claimed.   Between 1851 and 2010, only a quarter of glacial mass loss was due to human-induced climate change, scientists calculated. But during the last two decades of that period the human contribution rose to two thirds.  Lead researcher Dr Ben Barzeion, from the University of Innsbruck in Austria, said: “Typically, it takes glaciers decades or centuries to adjust to climate changes. In the 19th and first half of 20th century we observed that glacier mass loss attributable to human activity is hardly noticeable but since then has steadily increased.  “While we keep factors such as solar variability and volcanic eruptions unchanged, we are able to modify land use changes and greenhouse gas emissions in our models. In our data we find unambiguous evidence of anthropogenic contribution to glacier mass loss.”  The researchers, whose findings appear in the journal Science, used climate computer simulations to map glacier changes everywhere in the world outside Antarctica.  A global glacier database called the Randolph Glacier Inventory made the study possible.  The scientists reconstructed the area and volume of each glacier in 1851. Two different simulations then predicted how those glaciers might have retreated since.  One only included natural factors such as solar variability and volcanic eruptions. The other also incorporated human influences such as changes in land use and greenhouse gas emissions."
"In The Magnificent Seven Deadly Sins, a comedy made in 1971, Spike Milligan portrays Sloth as a tramp trying to get through a farm gate. This simple task is rendered almost impossible by the fact that he can’t be bothered to take his hands out of his pockets and open the latch. He tries everything: getting over it, under it, through it, hurling himself at it, risking mortal injury, expending far more energy and effort than the obvious solution would require. This is how environmental diplomacy works. Governments gather to discuss an urgent problem and propose everything except the obvious solution – legislation. The last thing our self-hating states will contemplate is what they are empowered to do: govern. They will launch endless talks and commissions, devise elaborate market mechanisms, even offer massive subsidies to encourage better behaviour, rather than simply say “we’re stopping this”. This is what’s happening with climate change caused by humans. The obvious solution, in fact the only real and lasting solution, is to decide that most fossil fuel reserves will be left in the ground, while alternative energy sources are rapidly developed to fill the gap. Everything else is talk. But not only will governments not contemplate this step, they won’t even discuss it. They would rather risk mortal injury than open the gate. The same applies to biodiversity, fisheries, neonicotinoid pesticides and a host of other issues affecting the living planet: negotiators have tried to work their way under, over and through the gate, while ensuring that the barrier remains in place. It wasn’t always like this. There was a time when they took their hands out of their pockets. This week the UN revealed that the ozone layer is recovering so fast that, across most of the planet, it will be more or less mended by the middle of the century. Ozone is the atmospheric chemical that blocks ultraviolet-B radiation, protecting us from skin cancer and from damage to our eyes and immune systems, and protecting plants from destruction. It’s coming back, and this is a great advertisement for active government. Like human-induced global warming, the problem was forecast before it was observed. In the case of global warming, Svante Arrhenius predicted in 1896 that the “carbonic acid” (carbon dioxide) produced by burning fossil fuels was sufficient to raise the global temperature.  In 1974, before any noticeable issues had arisen, the chemists Frank Rowland and Mario Molina predicted that the breakdown of chlorofluorocarbons – chemicals used for refrigeration and as aerosol propellants – in the stratosphere would destroy atmospheric ozone. Eleven years later, ozone depletion near the South Pole was detected by the British Antarctic Survey. Had governments not acted, the UN estimates: atmospheric levels of ozone depleting substances could have increased tenfold by 2050 The action governments took was direct and uncomplicated: ozone-depleting chemicals would be banned. The Montreal protocol came into force in 1989, and within seven years, use of the most dangerous substances had been more or less eliminated. Every member of the United Nations has ratified the treaty. This was despite a sustained campaign of lobbying and denial by the chemicals industry – led by Dupont – which bears strong similarities to the campaign by fossil fuel companies to prevent action on climate change. The Montreal protocol is one of those victories that allows us to forget. We are not wired to recognise an absence; we don’t spend our days celebrating the eradication of smallpox, or the fact that diphtheria no longer ravages our cities. But were the protocol not in force, scarcely a day would pass when the problem did not impinge on our consciousness. The UN maintains that the protocol  will have prevented 2 million cases of skin cancer annually by 2030 There are still issues to resolve. Earlier this year, scientists detected four new ozone-depleting chemicals in the atmosphere, which are likely to be either industrial feedstocks or black market products. There will always be cheats and freeloaders, but the treaty can keep evolving to address new threats.  The Montreal protocol has famously done more to prevent global warming (which was not its purpose) than the Kyoto protocol, which was designed to prevent it. This is because some of the chemicals the ozone treaty bans are also powerful greenhouse gases. So what’s the difference? Why is the Montreal protocol effective while the Kyoto protocol and subsequent efforts to prevent climate breakdown are not? Part of the answer must be that the fossil fuel industry is much bigger than the halogenated hydrocarbon industry, and its lobbying power much greater. Retiring fossil fuel is technically just as feasible as replacing ozone-depleting chemicals, given the wide range of technologies for generating useful energy, but politically much tougher.  But I don’t think that’s the only factor. When the Montreal protocol was negotiated, during the mid-1980s, the notion that governments could intervene in the market was under sustained assault, but not yet conquered. Even Margaret Thatcher, while speaking the language of market fundamentalism, was dirigiste by comparison to her successors: enough at any rate to be a staunch supporter of the Montreal protocol. It is almost impossible to imagine David Cameron championing such a measure. For that matter, given the current state of Congress, it’s more or less impossible to see Barack Obama doing it either. By the mid-1990s, the doctrine of market fundamentalism – also known as neoliberalism – had almost all governments by the throat. Any politicians who tried to protect the weak from the powerful or the natural world from industrial destruction were punished by the corporate media or the markets. This extreme political doctrine – that governments must cease to govern – has made direct, uncomplicated action almost unthinkable. Just as the extent of humankind’s greatest crisis – climate breakdown – became clear, governments willing to address it were everywhere being disciplined or purged. Since then, this doctrine has caused financial crises and economic collapse, the destruction of livelihoods, mountainous debt, insecurity and the devastation of the living planet. It has, as Thomas Piketty demonstrates, replaced enterprise with patrimonial capitalism: neoliberal economies rapidly become dominated by rent and inherited wealth, in which social mobility stalls.  But despite these evident failures, despite the fact that the claims of market fundamentalism have been disproven as dramatically as those of state communism, somehow this zombie ideology staggers on. Were the ozone hole to have been discovered today, governments would have announced talks about talks about talks, and we would still be discussing whether something should be done as our skin turned to crackling. Tackling any environmental crisis, especially climate breakdown, requires a resumption of political courage: the courage just to open the sodding gate. Monbiot.com"
"Just two days after being appointed by Jean-Claude Junker, the EU’s new climate and energy commissioner is under pressure to drop his shares in two oil companies which members of European parliament say represent a conflict of interest. The MEPs say EU’s proposed new climate and energy commissioner, Miguel Arias Cañete, must dispose of any oil company shareholdings before they consider giving his nomination a green light at European parliament hearings later this month.  One environment committee member, the German social-democrat Jo Leinen, told the Guardian there was “no guarantee” that Miguel Arias Cañete would be confirmed at European Parliament hearings, which have powers to send back proposed commissioner lists to Juncker. In his declaration of interests, the former Spanish agriculture and environment minister lists holdings in two oil companies, Ducor SL and Petrologis Canarias SL, as well as work as a lawyer. The current worth of his stock is unknown but Cañete valued the shares at €326,000 (£259,000) in a Spanish government interests statement in 2011. His office declined to respond to any questions about the matter. “A commissioner has to be independent from special interests and in my opinion it is obligatory that he give up any shares in oil companies if he wants to fulfil his duties in office free from any conflict of interests,” Leinen, a German social democrat MEP, said. “He must not be compromised by commercial or personal interests.” Cañete had previously served as president of both companies but stepped down in 2012. His brother-in law, Miguel Domecq Solis, became director of both Petrologis andDucar. His son Miguel Arias Domecq is a board member at Ducar.  A close ally of the current Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, Cañete’s nomination as climate commissioner surprised many, after the new EU president, Jean-Claude Juncker’s high-profile pledge that 40% of his new commissioners would be women. Cañete, an independently-wealthy vintage car collector, was criticised for using sexist language to disparage a female Socialist opponent in a televised debate earlier this year. “Holding a debate with a woman is complicated, because showing intellectual superiority could be seen as sexist,” he said. But it will be his oil industry involvement while he was agriculture and environment minister – itself the subject of ‘conflict of interests’ allegations – that is likely to set the tone of the parliamentary hearings. “We will question him in the hearing about his commitment to a low carbon economy as well as his personal and political integrity and we expect clear answers,” Leinen said. “Parliament has refused various candidates in the past so there is no guarantee that he will come out as a commissioner.” Leinen was one of 25 all-party MEPs – including Conservatives and Liberals – on the environment committee who signed a letter to Juncker last week protesting leaks of this week’s decision to merge the EU’s energy and climate change portfolios in the new administration. The Climate Action directorate was created after the last European election in February 2010 as a way of implementing three climate and energy goals for 2020, projecting 20% cuts to emissions, improvements in energy efficiency and market uptake for renewables by 2020. This was considered the minimum necessary to align Europe’s emissions with the 2C global warming trajectory recommended by the UN’s climate science panel, the IPCC, and a statement of intent to help unlock UN climate negotiations. “A year before the conclusion of a new global climate agreement, this is not the right time to send the opposite signal by not appointing a dedicated climate action Commissioner,” the MEPs wrote. As well as merging climate action and energy, Juncker’s new-look commission will mesh the bloc’s environment portfolio with its fishing and maritime directorates, and reshuffle long-standing environmental priorities. The ‘G10’ group of Europe’s biggest green NGOs – including Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and WWF – has expressed “grave concerns” at the mandate handed down to the EU’s nominee-environment, maritime and fisheries commissioner, Karmenu Vella, a former Maltese tourism minister. It “seems entirely centred on deregulation,” the NGOs wrote in a joint statement. “The inclusion in the mandate of orders to consider changing the EU nature protection legislation, pre-empting the results of the ongoing fitness check, suggests a high level decision to weaken biodiversity protection in the EU.  “This is even more troubling as the environment portfolio is given to a commissioner whose government is under intense international criticism for failing to implement EU bird conservation legislation, which the commissioner will now be in position to amend.”"
"Britain's most senior scientist has launched a fierce attack on influential figures who distort scientific evidence to support their own political, religious or ideological agendas. The president of the Royal Society, Sir Paul Nurse, said scientists must challenge serial offenders from all spheres of life who continually misused science to support their preconceived beliefs.  Speaking ahead of an inaugural speech he will give next week as the incoming president of the British Science Association (BSA), Nurse said it was not enough for scientists to sit on the sidelines and sneer when public figures expounded unscientific nonsense. He urged researchers to forge relationships with politicians, lobbyists, religious figures and leaders of organisations in the hope that they might feel ashamed to misuse scientific evidence. But if that approach failed, Nurse urged researchers to call offenders out in the media and challenge them in the strongest way possible. ""When they are serial offenders they should be crushed and buried,"" Nurse said. The Nobel prize winner will use his presidential address to argue that science has been the most revolutionary act in human history. He will trace the origins of scientific thinking from ancient times through the Copernican and Darwinian revolutions to modern times and warn that threats to science have always existed. Nurse said: ""Today we have those who like to mix science up with ideology and politics, where opinion, rhetoric and tradition hold more sway than adherence to evidence and adherence to logical argument."" Offenders, he said, ranged from politicians and religious figures to industrial leaders, NGOs and charities. ""We have to be aware of, and beware, organisations that masquerade as lobbying groups, which we see a lot in climate change. We have to be aware of politicians that cherry pick scientific views, even ministers who listen to scientists when it's about GM crops and then ignore them when it's about climate change,"" he added. This week the identities of two secret funders of the UK's most prominent climate sceptic organisation, the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF), were revealed. Both are linked to a free-market thinktank, the Institute of Economic Affairs, which has taken money from fossil fuel companies and argued against climate change mitigation. The GWPF's annual lecture this year will be given by Owen Paterson, the former environment secretary who is widely described as a climate sceptic, but has urged Europe to embrace the potential of GM crops. Nurse's call to arms goes against the stance of some scientists who refuse to debate people who have certain world views. Richard Dawkins has turned down debates with creationists, while other scientists are reluctant to become embroiled in debates over climate change because they are so exhausting and time consuming. Nurse said: ""It can be terribly time consuming. There is a constant regression to little points that constantly require rebuttal, so it can be very stressful. But once the debate is in the media or on the airwaves or TV we have to be engaged."" The BSA's British Science Festival in Birmingham runs from 6-11 September."
"Global ambitions to reduce emissions are becoming a bit like the resolutions we make to give something up at new year: the intention is sincere, but we don’t always deliver. For the sixth successive year of the PwC Low Carbon Economy Index, the global carbon target has been missed. And inadequate action today means that even steeper reductions are needed in the future. The target is based on projections of economic growth and the global carbon budget set out by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) which gives a reasonable probability of limiting warming to 2C. Globally, annual reductions need to be five times current levels, averaging 6.2% a year, every year from now to 2100, compared with 1.2% today. At the national level, Australia is at the top of our decarbonisation league of G20 nations, followed by the UK. Both countries had a strong increase in renewable generation, albeit from a low base, combined with slight a reduction in coal use. The US was nearer the bottom as coal use bounced back, retaking a share of the electricity mix from shale gas. The world is currently on track to burn this century’s IPCC carbon budget within 20 years, and a pathway to 4C of global warming by 2100. For many of us, 2034 is within our working lifetime. It’s within the timeframe of decisions being made today, on long-term investments, on the location of factories and their supply chains. So businesses are making those decisions faced with uncertainty about climate policy and potential impacts of climate change. It is clear that the gap between what governments are saying about climate change and what they are doing about it continues to widen. While they talk about two degrees at the climate negotiations, the current trend is for a 4C world. There is little mention of these two degrees of separation in the negotiations, in policy documents, in business strategies or in board rooms. Operating in a changing climate is becoming a very real challenge for UK plc. Some of the biggest names in business are mapping the risks posed by a changing climate to their supply chain, stores, offices and people. But while the findings question the reality of the 2C target in negotiations, consider two situations in the analysis that demonstrates the strong case for the negotiations’ role in focusing everyone on co-ordinated action on climate change. First, our analysis shows that the top 10 destinations for the UK’s foreign direct investment in 2011 were exposed to almost $100bn worth of extreme weather losses in 2013. Multi-billion pound UK investments are wrapped up in transport, technology, retail, food and energy sectors, making this an issue on everyone’s doorstep. Second, co-ordinated, ambitious action to tackle emissions growth should protect business in the long term. It could even be a boost to growth. It would avoid inevitable short-term decisions that may look attractive, such as shutting down a steel operation in a country with a high cost of carbon to move it to another with a lower cost, but merely relocate emissions. And take jobs with them. The concern about short-term costs and impacts on investment is paralysing our ability to address the long-term climate risks. Perhaps competitiveness is the new climate scepticism. Businesses call for a level playing field on carbon pricing, when it should be seen in the wider context of labour and energy prices, the skills market and wider legislative environment. There’s a danger when we talk in small numbers – whether they are one or two degrees, or the 6% now required in annual decarbonisation (every year for the next 66 years, by the way), that they sound manageable. The 6% figure is double the rate the UK achieved when we dashed for gas in the 1990s. A shale gas revolution might help, but would need to be accompanied by a revolution in carbon capture and storage and revolutions in renewables, in electric transport, in industrial processes and in our buildings. The UK’s results are encouraging, even if they fall short of the overall target necessary. Leadership in low carbon for the UK is down in part to policies and investment, partly the structure of our economy, and partly traditional factors such as skills and education. But it’s notable that while the Low Carbon Economy Index shows that the UK’s carbon intensity is lower than many, it is still higher than in France, Argentina or Brazil. It’s a neat encapsulation of a view of the world through a low carbon economy lens, not just a GDP one. The UK’s competitiveness or attractiveness today needs investment to hold on to it for tomorrow.

"The renewable energet target (RET) review has concluded with largely expected results. After hand picking a review panel led by a noted climate change skeptic, the review has recommended scrapping or substantially scaling back the RET. The panel’s findings are neither surprising nor consequential: without the support of the Labour party or the Palmer United party, major changes to the RET are likely to be very challenging to implement. Stepping back from the RET, it is remarkable that Australian climate and energy policy has made no forward progress. After repealing a carbon tax that appeared to perform exactly as price theory 101 would suggest – carbon emissions down, revenues up – the Liberal party has tied itself in knots devolving the previously dry field of environmental economics and externality pricing into a kind of internal cultural identity politics.   As someone who considers himself green, Liberal and fond of science and policy making that are evidence-based, it is utterly maddening – but it is where we are now and from whence we have to move forward.  Between the RET and the carbon tax, Australia’s efforts to cut emissions in the electricity sector have been impressive. Data from Pitt Sherry indicates that electricity emissions are down 14-15% from June 2006 on the back of a decline in power demand. Part of this can be attributed to the carbon tax and RET, but a far greater portion is due to other factors. A ~6% decline in demand has been caused by a storm of more energy efficient appliances, lighting, and a collapse in the price of solar panels (from ~$3.50 per Watt for modules in 2008 to approximately $0.65 per Watt today).  Try as policymakers might to load the dice, technology has and always will be a far greater force over the long run. As far as can be determined, cheaper solar is here to stay and will only get cheaper. You can deplete a resource but not technology or knowledge; if policymakers and power generators wish to swim against the rip tide broad based technological progress they can, but it is unlikely to have any lasting effects. For investors such as myself, the coal fired generation sector of Australia has a finite life. It is a matter of when, not if. For example, the current dynamics in the eastern Australia power market are dire. The market is egregiously oversupplied with baseload power, according to data from AGL. AGL would know – they own the largest baseload generator in the country, Loy Yang A.  Peaking power is in relatively short supply and expensive due to the fact that the only thing more politically radioactive in NSW and Queensland politics than putting a nuclear plant on Fort Denison is regulating fracking and coal seam gas. There are issues with fracking, but similarly there are issues with acute gas shortages.  This is unlikely to be resolved as long as this political deadlock continues. Similarly, the oversupply of baseload power is not likely to be resolved without a carbon tax, since the generators with the cheapest cost of power in the LaTrobe Valley are also the most carbon intensive.  It is an endless source of wonder to me that with power generators unwilling to draw straws as to which units should exit the market, that the Energy Suppliers Association of Australia has not split with less carbon intensive generators pushing for a carbon tax or some means by which to force more carbon intensives generators to exit. Until that happens and the government buys into such a strategy, Australia cannot expect any sudden change to electricity sector emissions – just the gradual water torture of having demand eaten away by distributed solar.  With the stationary energy sector at deadlock barring some rift emerging between cleaner generators and the most carbon intensive ones, is there anything that the Abbott government can do to reduce emissions without reinstating a carbon tax?  There is, and it is completely consistent with the government’s foreign policy and desire to end the “age of entitlement”. The answer is in the Cedex data below. The only sector that has shown a substantial increase in carbon emissions is petroleum or transport fuels. As can be seen above, most of that has been in bulk diesel used in the mining industry though aviation and passenger vehicles have also notched substantial increases in demand. While the budget has been poorly received, there is an essential truth in much of what has been said by the government in that the deficit is high and a lot of public funds were wasted by the previous government.  The problem has largely been that the belt tightening on the household sector in the budget is acute, whereas corporates and particularly the mining sector has been non-existent. Indeed, members of the minerals council have had a mining tax removed and the carbon tax repealed and can now expect a drop in the corporate tax rate. It is not hard to see how Australian voters’ sense of fairness has been offended by this.  One smart thing the government might consider is a scrapping or paring of the diesel excise exemption. It would save in the order of $6bn per annum according to budget estimates, and would ensure that the load is shared between households and a sector that has done very well indeed out of the change in government.  A change in the diesel price would lead to more frugal use of the fuel, likely through mine sites using solar or solar and diesel in place of diesel for power generation. While mining companies may not like it, there is not much they can do about it: manufacturers and service businesses can relocate but unless you move the minerals abroad it is hard for miners to do the same. For passenger vehicles, the treasurer has already found little sympathy for the policy of re-indexing fuel excise and not without cause – this is a regressive change to the tax. A compensatory move may be to turn the small and ineffectual luxury car tax into something more meaningful – a fuel efficiency tax.  By encouraging higher fuel efficiency in the vehicle fleet and a transition to electric vehicles, the government could offer rebates to buyers of smaller, more fuel efficient vehicles and heavily tax Ferraris, stretch Humvees and their like.  This would have four key benefits. Firstly, it would cut emissions from transport even after accounting for Australia’s high carbon power grid. Any decarbonisation of the power grid in the future would have more “punch” in the future. Secondly, it would increase power demand and slow the “death spiral” of higher power prices leading to lower demand leading to higher power prices which has led to reduced profitability at generators and higher prices for consumers. Thirdly, it would reduce Australia’s exposure to imported commodity price volatility and cut the trade deficit while also reducing the country’s exposure and dependence upon oil exporting nations like Russia, with which Australia’s relationship is charitably described as complicated.  There are no political impediments to such a move now. Australia no longer has any car industry to speak of that churns out fuel inefficient, overpowered sedans and the power sector has everything to gain from such a change. The increase in power demand would make the RET’s 20% renewable target by 2020 more of an achievable possibility by offsetting declining demand. It is long overdue that environmentalists and the media move past the Punch and Judy of the carbon tax and RET to other more politically workable environmental legislation. The carbon tax will likely come back if only because it is harder to “double Irish” away a ton of emissions than a million dollars in profits. Nonetheless, there is plenty we can do now and which the current government is in no way impeded from doing both ideologically and practically. "

"The key to the slowdown in global warming in recent years could lie in the depths of the Atlantic and Southern Oceans where excess heat is being stored – not the Pacific Ocean as has previously been suggested, according to new research. But the finding suggests that a naturally occurring ocean cycle burying the heat will flip in around 15 years’ time, causing global temperature rises to accelerate again.  The slowdown of average surface temperature rises in the last 15 years after decades of rapid warming has been seized on by climate change sceptics and has puzzled scientists, who have hypothesised that everything from volcanic eruptions and sulphur from Chinese power stations to heat being trapped deep in the oceans could be the cause. Several studies have focused on the Pacific as potentially playing a major role. The new study, published in the journal Science on Thursday, concludes that the Pacific alone cannot explain the warming “hiatus” and that much of the heat being trapped by greenhouse gases at record levels in the atmosphere is being sunk hundreds of metres down in the Atlantic and Southern Oceans. Ka-Kit Tung, author of the paper and University of Washington professor, said: “The finding is a surprise, since the current theories had pointed to the Pacific Ocean as the culprit for hiding heat. But the data are quite convincing and they show otherwise.” “We are not downplaying the role of the Pacific. They are both going on [the oceans having an effect on temperatures]; one is short term [the Pacific], one is long term [the Atlantic],” he told the Guardian. A shift in the salinity of the north Atlantic triggered the effect around the turn of the century, the study says, as surface water there became saltier and more dense, sinking and taking surface heat down to depths of more than 300 metres.  Using temperature data from floats across the world, Tung found the Atlantic and Southern Oceans “each account for just under half the global energy storage change since 1999 at below 300m”. The study’s result, he says, does not support the “Pacific-centric” view of earlier work on whether heat is being stored.  “We were surprised to see the evidence presented so clearly. When you go with the energy, you cannot argue with that,” said Tung. Jon Robson, a climate scientist at the University of Reading and who is unconnected to the study, said the new work did not disprove evidence of the Pacific’s role in the warming slowdown.  “The hiatus really is a patchwork problem of lots of different things, volcanoes, the Pacific, the Atlantic. This paper does elevate the Atlantic’s role, which has been largely ignored before. This does suggest a role for the Atlantic but there’s a lot more to it than that,” he told the Guardian. “It doesn’t dispel the key role for the Pacific in the hiatus. There is evidence that the hiatus is a northern hemisphere winter phenomenon, which does point the finger quite strongly to the Pacific.” Piers Forster, professor of climate change at the University of Leeds, said: “This paper suggests that heat disappearing into the depths of the Atlantic and Southern Oceans are the dominant cause. Their ideas seem fine but I’m also convinced there is more going on: the El Niño and relative cooler European and Asian winters remain important aspects to understand.” The study, Varying Planetary Heat Sink Led to Global-Warming Slowdown and Acceleration, gives little room for complacency that the oceans can safely store heat caused by human activities because the cycle that buries the heat deep in the Atlantic will “inevitably” switch back. Heat would then no longer be removed deep underwater, leading to “another episode of accelerated warming” at the surface. Forster added: “Most importantly, this paper is another a nail in the coffin of the idea that the hiatus is evidence that our projections of long-term climate change need revising down. Variability in the ocean will not affect long-term climate trends but may mean we have a period of accelerated warming to look forward to.” This February, the national science academies of the US and UK said the global warming slowdown did not “invalidate” the long-term trend of rising temperatures caused by man-made climate change."

"President Barack Obama often highlights his administration’s “all-of-the-above” energy strategy as a model for sustainable economic growth. But three months after the Environmental Protection Agency unveiled its landmark proposal to regulate carbon-dioxide emissions from US power plants for the first time, that all-inclusive catchphrase seems more than ever like hyperbole. The plan sets a targeted carbon-dioxide emissions rate for each state to hit by 2030. On average, these goals represent a 30% drop from 2005 rates, but – as critics have pointed out – the benefits and sacrifices of the plan are unlikely to be shared equally.   “At the highest level, there are some clear winners and losers,” said George Favaloro, managing director of PricewaterhouseCoopers’ sustainable business practice. The same concept applies to the rest of Obama’s overarching Climate Action Plan, announced in 2013, as well. As programs growing out of the action plan begin to bear fruit, it’s becoming increasingly apparent that some businesses will gain while others will lose.  When it comes to the EPA’s plan, it’s easy to pick out some early beneficiaries. “Companies selling clean energy and energy efficiency products and services in residential, commercial and utility-scale markets are going to benefit,” Favaloro said. “You can debate what the final impact of the Clean Power Plan and other proposals will be, but there’s definitely going to be support for more renewable energy coming on line,” he added.  This could mean more business for solar power companies such as First Solar, SolarCity and SunPower, which have led a solar building boom in the US in the past two years. Traditional engineering and construction companies could benefit as well. Bechtel, for example, already has expanded into solar power plant construction.   The EPA’s power plan aligns nicely with other Obama administration climate initiatives. For example, the US Department of Energy, which has backed large-scale solar and wind projects with billions of dollars of loan guarantees, recently announced that it is enabling $4bn in loan guarantees for additional renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. This comes after the DOE’s April announcement that it plans to recharge its $16bn Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Loan program. Ford, Nissan and Tesla have used the program to improve fuel efficiency and produce electric vehicles.  Other supporting initiatives include a Department of Agriculture plan to invest $236m in improving rural electric infrastructure in eight states and a $1bn national disaster resilience competition that will be conducted through the Department of Housing and Urban Development. More than 80% of the HUD program’s funds are targeted at regions where Obama declared major disasters in 2011, 2012 and 2013.   The initiative is modeled after HUD’s Rebuild by Design competition, launched in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. The six winning Build by Design proposals – which were awarded $920m in June – aim to buoy regional infrastructure resiliency to protect New York and New Jersey against storm-related threats, especially floods and power outages. Dozens of design, architecture and construction firms and institutes are involved in the winning projects, including Bjarke Ingels Group, Interboro Partners, MIT, PennDesign and Scape/Landscape Architecture.   Additionally, the administration’s new Climate Data Initiative aims to spur the private sector to use public climate data to help make communities more resilient to climate change. Google, Intel and Microsoft are participating.  As a whole, the Obama administration’s efforts to mitigate and to prepare for the impacts of climate change are designed to have “a broad impact on the transportation, building and power sectors”, Favaloro said.  But not everyone will be a winner.   Despite the Obama administration’s efforts to prepare for the effects of climate change, “the US still relatively underinvests in infrastructure”, observes Jonathan Woetzel, a director at McKinsey.   “The American economy and people deserve better infrastructure,” he said, pointing to the American Society of Civil Engineers annual infrastructure report card, which last year gave the country a mere “D+” grade. It remains to be seen whether Obama’s most recent climate-related efforts will change that, he added.  On the other hand, argues PricewaterhouseCoopers’ Favaloro, Obama’s climate initiatives could accelerate a painful process of transformation, leaving behind companies that don’t understand “what it means to build in a resilient way”.   In terms of the Clean Power Plan, some energy stakeholders, particularly those that are deeply invested in coal, could stand to lose billions of dollars. This, in turn, could accelerate coal’s replacement with natural gas, renewables and efficiency.   Companies that could be hit hardest include coal producers Alpha Natural Resources, Arch Coal and Peabody Energy; unregulated power companies with large fleets of coal plants, such as NRG Energy and Dynergy; and suppliers of coal-mining equipment, like Caterpillar, according to Moody’s Investor Service.  Regardless of the long-term effects of the EPA’s power-sector proposal, it’s increasingly clear who its first beneficiaries will be: lawyers. The EPA already faces a lawsuit filed last month by a dozen heavily coal-reliant states. Murray Energy, the largest privately held coal-mining company in the country, filed suit in March.  As such litigation illustrates, the impact of Obama’s climate initiatives will play out over time, and not for the benefit of “all of the above”. And, as similar lawsuits will undoubtedly work their way across several affected industries, it’s clear that the struggle for climate resilience will, at least to some extent, play out in the courts.

"At the Met Office in Exeter the clouds are gathering ominously. It's a typical dodgy-looking summer's day and, glancing up, I have no idea whether to reach for the sun cream or dig out my brolly. But while the clouds have me baffled, they are one of Dame Julia Slingo's specialities. In fact they're one of the reasons why Slingo became a meteorologist in the first place. ""Meteorology just seemed to me to be the epitome of physics in action,"" she tells me once I duck indoors. ""You could look out of the window and see a rainbow, or you could see clouds form, and you knew exactly what was going on to create what you were seeing."" In taking up the mantle of chief scientist at the Met Office in 2009, Slingo returned to the very institution in which she began her career nearly 40 years before. Managing the work of around 500 scientists, it's Slingo's responsibility to steer research that ranges from forecasting tomorrow's weather to modelling what the climate will be up to a century from now.  But it's a high-powered position that began with a baptism of fire; just months into the role, Slingo was slung squarely into the limelight. The Met Office's breezy expectation of a barbecue summer had turned sour, with the country dripping in the wake of widespread downpours. The Met Office, the papers concluded, had dropped the crystal ball. Slingo, however, remains defiant. ""What people forgot was that it said it was 'odds on for a barbecue summer',"" she says. ""It is probabilistic and therefore it is not right or wrong."" But she admits that, blunder or not, it was a wake-up call. ""It actually spurred us on to really do some very serious research about seasonal forecasting, and how do we communicate probabilities and the elevated risk of this type of weather or that type of weather,"" she tells me. ""We've made fantastic progress in the last four or five years and [had] some real breakthroughs I don't know would have happened if we hadn't had that little 'incident'."" Perhaps, given what followed, it is hardly surprising that the faux pas seems just a 'blip'. For that winter, ""Climategate"" broke. Fuelled by emails hacked from the University of East Anglia, allegations of scientific misconduct were splattered over the front pages. With the potential to undermine public acceptance of global warming, and an international climate change conference about to kick off in Copenhagen, a strong response was urgently needed. Slingo gave it, from organising a huge collection of signatures from scientists in support of the science behind global warming, to coordinating a vast release of data. ""It wasn't for me to comment on what was in the emails,"" she says, ""[But] I didn't feel any doubt about the science."" Indeed despite her calm, almost reticent demeanour, I am beginning to suspect Slingo is a glass-half-full kind of woman. ""I felt you just had to turn it into a positive actually,"" she says, ""and use it to help to communicate the science that we do and be much more open and transparent."" Not that such sanguinity hasn't been sorely tested. Just as the Climategate inquiries neared their conclusion in spring 2010, yet another emergency exploded as the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajökull began spewing ash into the air. ""They were wanting us to forecast not just where the ash was going, but how much ash there was in the atmosphere,"" she says. ""Nobody really knew what the aircraft engines could tolerate."" It was a tense time, with the aviation industry champing at the bit to get its planes back in the air. ""It was a very fast-moving period where we had to do some research on the hoof,"" she says. Yet despite the pressure, Slingo rather enjoyed it. ""It is kind of what scientists like really – the challenge."" But then, she's always loved the practical side of science. ""I just like understanding how things work that I can see in the real world,"" she says. It was this that drew Slingo – born Julia Walker to teachers in Warwickshire in 1950 – to study physics and later meteorology. Graduating with a BSc from Bristol, she was expecting to embark on a master's course at Imperial College, London, when she heard that her application to join the Met Office had been successful. Imperial was pragmatic. ""They said 'science jobs in the Met Office are like gold dust,'"" Slingo says. So she took it. What followed was an intense course in meteorology, from the theory of atmospheric circulation to making weather forecasts. ""In those days all the observations would come on little machines and it would be a string of numbers and you would have to plot them by hand on the weather map,"" she says. It was, Slingo believes, valuable training – even now, she reveals, she can glean a pretty shrewd idea of the forecast from a shuftie at the maps. ""It never leaves you,"" she says. It was an exciting time to be at the Met Office. With climate modelling still in its infancy, Slingo and her colleagues pushed ahead to develop new, cutting-edge models. One of Slingo's key contributions was to write the computer code for a new ""radiation scheme"" – code that essentially allowed researchers to investigate how land and oceans as well as clouds, gases and other atmospheric components interact with solar and thermal radiation. ""It was a huge piece of code,"" she says. Slingo went on to tackle a host of issues, from developing a new cloud scheme to using climate models to investigate the formation of weather systems over Africa that lead to hurricanes in the Atlantic. She also produced some of the Met Office's earliest work on the effects of increased CO2 levels on our planet's temperature. ""I don't suppose any of us at that time thought it [global warming] would be such a big deal in 40 years,"" she admits. After she left the Met Office in the early 80s to have her first daughter, she was soon snapped up by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. A second daughter and a stint at the National Centre for Atmospheric Research in the US with her husband and fellow meteorologist, Tony Slingo, followed. Returning to the UK in 1990, she took up a position at Reading University and continued to work on tropical weather and climate, as well as investigating the impact of climate change on communities. She also persuaded academics to adopt the Met Office's climate model (""I think that enabled us to really forge ahead scientifically,"" she says), founded the interdisciplinary Walker Institute for Climate System Research and, over the years, gained a reputation for pushing for more powerful computers. So when Japan unveiled the world's most powerful computer, the ""Earth Simulator"", in 2002 it was no surprise that Slingo's team was quick to collaborate. That, she says, stole them a march on researchers the world over. By the time Slingo became chief scientist at the Met Office, she was not only a professor of meteorology and president of the Royal Meteorological Society – the first woman to hold these positions – but also director of climate research at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science. But what should have been a triumphant return to the Met Office was marred by tragedy. Just after Slingo was appointed the post, a sudden illness claimed the life of her husband. Nevertheless she decided to stick with her decision. ""He was desperate that I took it,"" she says. Since then, Slingo has pushed ahead on all fronts, from developing academic collaborations to tackling science's gender imbalance and, crucially, advocating that weather forecasting and climate prediction use the same models. ""That's absolutely the core of the reason of why we are so successful as an organisation,"" she tells me. But it hasn't been easy. In February, following her remarks that the heavier rainfall recorded over the UK might be linked to climate change, Slingo found herself in the firing line of climate-change sceptics, receiving a personal attack from the former Tory chancellor Nigel Lawson. She shrugs it off. ""It reflected more on him than on me. He didn't like the message that I was giving,"" she tells me. Her confident, unflappable attitude is almost steely, but then, as she puts it: ""I always stick to what the science says."" And with that, it seems, one can weather any storm."
"They say the first way to treat a problem is to admit the problem exists. In that respect, the Australian government may be coming to terms with what it will take to turn around the worrying state of the Great Barrier Reef. An outlook report by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA), the government agency tasked with overseeing the reef’s health, declines to mince its words.  The reef is an “icon under pressure” that has suffered a dip in health since the last major analysis of its condition in 2009. “The overall outlook for the Great Barrier Reef is poor, has worsened since 2009 and is expected to further deteriorate in the future,” the assessment warns. “Greater reductions of all threats at all levels, reef-wide, regional and local, are required to prevent the projected declines in the Great Barrier Reef and to improve its capacity to recover.” Greg Hunt, the federal environment minister, has previously been at pains to inform the world, via the UN, which has threatened to list the reef as “in danger” next year, that the reef is still in good shape and that his Reef 2050 plan should be enough to return it to its halcyon days. Just two weeks ago, Hunt appeared on Andrew Bolt’s show to assure viewers that approving Australia’s largest coalmine was no issue for the reef, despite the GBRMPA citing climate change as “the most serious threat to the reef.” Asked about the implications of rising temperatures (by Bolt, of all people) Hunt could only offer up the fact that the mine would provide more Indian people with electricity. Hunt also pointed out that the Adani mine was “500km inland, not on the coast as the GetUps and the extreme left of the Australian political scheme would have people believe”. Such a belief would indeed be strange, although it would also be odd to ignore the fact the mined coal will be transported via a port adjacent to the reef, requiring five million tonnes of dredged spoil to be dumped within its marine park. This week, however, Hunt has been admirably candid about the reef’s condition, and the threats that face it. “The basic position I think is this; that what you see when you read the reports today is a mixture of pressure and progress, and the pressure is real. I don’t think we should understate that,” he told the ABC. He added that in the southern portion of the reef there were “some real negatives to be honest”. Here are five findings in the GBRMPA assessment that will have been sober reading for Hunt, and others concerned about the reef’s future. Climate change, which is causing the oceans to warm, is cited as the leading threat to the reef, followed by pollution running off the land into the sea, coastal development and direct impacts such as fishing. The GBRMPA has dropped a prediction, used in its draft report, that the reef will not remain a “coral based system” with more than 1.5C of global warming. However, the trend remains a worrying one, given the report’s clear demonstration of rising sea surface temperatures in the Coral Sea since 1900. “Climate change remains the most serious threat to the Great Barrier Reef,” the report states “It is already affecting the reef and is likely to have far-reaching consequences in the decades to come. Sea temperatures are on the rise and this trend is expected to continue, leading to an increased risk of mass coral bleaching; gradual ocean acidification will increasingly restrict coral growth and survival; and there are likely to be more intense weather events.” A plague of coral-eating starfish has munched its way through the reef, with the government funding attempts to eradicate it. But while coral cover, the cornerstone of the reef, has alarmingly halved in the past 30 years, the decline in seagrass is also of concern. Seagrass meadows are the main food source for dugongs and sea turtles, and they also provide crucial habitat for several fish species. Extreme weather and poor water quality have led to a decline in seagrass abundance since 2007, although there are signs of a slight recovery. Numbers of humpback whales, estuarine crocodiles, loggerhead and green turtles are recovering. However, the report states: “The condition of a number of species has deteriorated since the 2009 assessment, with some important species such as sharks and rays, corals, some marine turtles and dugongs now assessed as being in poor condition. Two species of inshore dolphins are considered at high risk and in decline.” The report acknowledges that we now know a lot more about the impact of human activity on the reef, with measures targeted at reducing their effects, such as pollution. But there is still clear room for improvement. The report estimates that 12,114kg of herbicide flooded onto the reef in 2013, as a result of agricultural use on land. These nutrients, in turn, fuel outbreaks of the coral-eating starfish. “Declining marine water quality, influenced by land-based runoff, is one of the most significant threats to the long-term health and resilience of the Great Barrier Reef,” the report warns. Shipping through the reef’s coral corridors is “well regulated and well managed” according to the report. Still, it estimates the number of vessel calls to ports in the region will increase by around 250% over the next 20 years. While ship groundings are uncommon, the reef takes “decades” to recover from them. A key battleground for environmental groups is the issue of dredging near the reef. The expanded Abbot Point port, near the town of Bowen, will require five million tonnes of seabed to be dug up and dumped within the reef’s marine park. A recent study indicates that dumped dredged material can double the rate of disease in coral. But there has been relatively little other work done to assess the impact of dredging on the reef. “Understanding of the ecosystem effects of port activities, in particular the fate of dredge material disposed at sea, is still incomplete but improving,” the report states. “Increasing port activities directly affect local areas and uncertainty remains around ecosystem effects of dredging and the disposal and resuspension of dredge material.” Hunt points out that plans to dump sediment have been downgraded, but the long-term trend is clear – 28 million cubic metres dumped into the World Heritage Area since 2001. The summary report card at the end of the GBRMPA’s assessment is downbeat. About a dozen key threats to the reef are identified and ranked, with current measures for the three worst (climate change, coastal development and pollution) rated as “poor” or “very poor” in their outcomes. The report reads: “Given the only partial effectiveness of existing protection and management in addressing the most significant pressures on the ecosystem (principally arising from outside the region), the loss of resilience is expected to continue.” While there are improvements in areas such as reducing run-off onto the reef and sensitively-handled tourism, it’s clear the reef is in need of some serious care. The government has said its reef strategy will improve matters, while critics will contend that little progress will be made with the approval of carbon-spewing coal projects and the dumping of sediment into the marine park. Unesco, which has already highlighted concerns with the government’s approach, will make its call in June next year."
"Extensive changes to the Abbott government’s “Direct Action” climate change policy being proposed by independent senator Nick Xenophon could bring it within reach of meeting Australia’s 2020 emissions reduction target, new research shows. The research, by Reputex, found that without amendment, the $2.55bn fund – which the government will seek to pass through the Senate this week – will fall drastically short of meeting Australia’s target of reducing emissions by 5% by 2020, compared with 2000 levels.  But among the proposed changes are measures the government has categorically rejected, including allowing the purchase of some international carbon credits (the prime minister once described the idea as sending “money … offshore into dodgy carbon farms in Equatorial Guinea and Kazakhstan”) and putting teeth into the government’s deferred “safeguards mechanism” which would impose penalties on electricity generators or manufacturers who exceeded normal emission levels. (This has been fiercely resisted by industry and could also push up power prices.) And the projections also rely on retaining the renewable energy target, while the government is torn between dramatically paring it back, or closing it to new investments. As it stands the “Direct Action” plan – presented in the form of amendments to the existing carbon farming scheme – is facing defeat with the opposition of Labor, the Greens, the Palmer United party and other crossbench senators. But as reported by Guardian Australia at the weekend, talks have been under way behind the scenes to find a “grand bargain” that might allow the passage of an amended scheme. Xenophon’s proposals are one of the options being considered. Reputex says the emissions reduction fund, as it is designed, would buy only 67 million tonnes of greenhouse abatement and leave Australia 354 million tonnes short of its 2020 target. With the amendments it would be about 128 million tonnes short. The environment minister, Greg Hunt, insists the fund, as it stands, will “easily” meet the 2020 target. Among the amendments proposed by Xenophon and modelled by Reputex are: * A clear pledge to spend another billion dollars before 2020. The budget contains $1.15bn for the fund between now and 2017-18. The amendments propose that another $1bn originally promised by the government be spent in the following two years before 2020.  * Tougher “safeguards” – with companies penalised for failing to meet an emissions baseline and credited for doing better – an idea that over time could start to look like a version of an emissions trading scheme. The “safeguards” designed to stop industrial emissions increasing and wiping out any emission reductions bought by the emissions reduction fund have been fiercely resisted by industry and were left out of the initial legislation to go to parliament this week, after cabinet could not agree to them. Reputex says the Xenophon amendments propose that they be implemented immediately. * Longer contract periods for organisations bidding in to the emissions reduction fund. Xenophon said he had “put in a lot of hard work and engaged in a lot of tough negotiations with the government in good faith” over the amendments. Asked whether he believed cabinet would agree to impose penalties on polluting industries or to retain the renewable energy target he said, “My plea to those in the Coalition who think that way is that there are many swinging voters who want to see Australia credibly reduce its emissions in a cost-effective way.” According to the research, Australia will not meet its targets without the existing renewable energy target. Keeping the RET has not been an option for the government, which has now received the report from a review headed by businessman and self-professed climate sceptic Dick Warburton. The prime minister favours closing the scheme to all new investments, and Hunt and the industry minister, Ian Macfarlane, favour a significant reduction in the mandated gigawatt hours of renewable energy. The three were meeting on Sunday to discuss their deep divisions on the issue. PUP has insisted it will support Direct Action only if the government accepts its proposal for a “dormant” emissions trading scheme, which would become “active” only when the climate change authority decides that major trading partners EU, Japan, Korea and China had in place their own ETS or “equivalent measures” to make a “comparable effort” on reducing greenhouse emissions. But the government has made it clear it will not support another ETS similar to the one the parliament just abolished, even in a dormant form. A tough safeguards mechanism could be presented as a compromise to try to secure PUP support. “We do not view PUP’s ETS and Direct Action as mutually exclusive. A revised Direct Action plan can act as a short-term gateway to PUP’s longer-term climate solution,” said the chief executive of Reputex, Hugh Grossman. A former Australian Conservation Foundation head, Don Henry, who was been instrumental in the talks between the PUP leader, Clive Palmer, and the former US vice president Al Gore, has been discussing the ideas with both Gore and PUP. Henry, now a professor of environmentalism at the University of Melbourne, told Guardian Australia: “The important thing is to reduce what goes up into the atmosphere. There are different ways to do it ... and you could add some dimensions to Direct Action and you could build on the renewable energy target and you could end up with a cost-effective way of driving emissions reductions. “I am talking to Gore and PUP about all of this because at the moment the government has an election commitment on Direct Action which it doesn’t have the numbers to deliver, and the pressure will continue to increase for Australia to act.” Danny Price, who was chosen by Hunt as an “eminent economist” to co-chair the expert reference group advising him on Direct Action, has also been involved in devising the changes."
"Carbon emissions from the electricity grid rose after the repeal of the carbon price, with analysts predicting further increases as coal-fired power takes a greater share of Australia’s energy mix. In the year to August 2014, emissions were 1m tonnes higher when compared with the year to June 2014. This is equivalent to an increase of 0.8% in emissions.  The data from the National Electricity Market, which covers about 80% of Australia’s population, shows that the leap in emissions is the largest two-month increase in eight years. Hugh Saddler, energy analyst at pitt&sherry, which compiled the data, said the repeal of the carbon price by the government in July was “probably” the largest factor in the emissions rise. There were a number of other factors, including “unexpectedly low” wind-power generation and an increase in electricity demand after a period when it had fallen. Hydro Tasmania, one of the largest clean energy companies in Australia, increased its generation in the months before the repeal of the carbon price, in anticipation of the mechanism’s demise. Saddler said he expected further rises in emissions due to the lack of a carbon price, as well as faltering renewable energy generation due to uncertainty over the future of the renewable energy target. “There is a lot of cheap gas in Queensland but once that nosedives the rest of the capacity is in either coal generation or wind,” he said. “There is heaps of capacity in coal-fired power and the RET review means there isn’t much new wind generation, so the only new source of generation to replace gas will be coal. “We will see the changes over the last four years gradually unwind. We will see more renewable generation than five years ago, but the share of coal will go up and emissions will go up,” Saddler said. A key variable in emissions reduction will be the Coalition’s Direct Action plan, which has yet to gain support in the Senate. The scheme’s centrepiece, the Emissions Reduction Fund, will pay businesses that wish to reduce their emissions but it has not conducted any analysis to show how much it will abate. Asked by the Greens in the senate about the rise in emissions, the government’s finance minister, Mathias Cormann, said the Coalition wanted to grow the economy, which would result in higher emissions.  “We inherited an economy growing below trend and below expectation and you know what happens when an economy grows less? It emits less,” he said. “We can stop emissions altogether if we all just sit here and do nothing, but we think it’s a good idea to have a strong economy and create more jobs. “ Adam Bandt, the Greens’ deputy leader, said: “Tony Abbott has decided that the big polluters can do whatever the heck they like, at the cost of the planet and of the people. “Australia could be a renewable energy world leader, instead we are turning our back on the 21st century in favour of polluting energy sources.”  • On 8 September 2014 this article was amended to correct the name of the company that compiled the data.

"At the end November 2013, Philip Jennings, the general secretary for the global union federation UNI Global Union spoke at a climate conference in Toronto. His message was simple: ""there is nothing more important facing humanity than the dangers of a warming planet. We have no time to lose."" For Jennings, who is from Welsh mining stock, the threat of global warming amounts to a ""class war"", with the world's poorest people paying the highest price for the carbon production of the richest. ""While billionaires prepare safe havens for themselves and their money,"" he said, ""workers will bear the cost of climate change.""  For global unions like UNI Global, the climate struggle is starting to merge with the struggle for workers rights, especially in the third world. ""For unions, employment and decent work is core business and climate change is not employment friendly,"" said Jennings. Bangladesh is a country where climate action is at the forefront of significant struggles by organised labour. As a nation, it is facing enormous risk from extreme weather and sea level rise, both exacerbated by global warming. In fact, Bangladesh is considered the country most vulnerable to climate change, according to Maplecroft's 2013 Climate Change and Environmental Risk Atlas: ""With global brands investing heavily in vulnerable growth markets to take advantage of the spending power of rising middle class populations, we are seeing increasing business exposure to extreme climate related events on multiple levels, including their operations, supply chains and consumer base,"" said James Allan, one of the authors. ""Cyclone Phailin demonstrates the critical need for business to monitor the changing frequency and intensity of climate related events, especially where infrastructure and logistics are weak."" The massive workforce that textile sweatshops that feed the world's major clothing brands rely upon come from farmers fleeing swamped regional areas. When they're not busy evacuating their homes due to flooding, the workers in Bangladesh's slums are at risk of workplace accidents in largely unregulated factories, construction sites and sweatshops. For unions, this poses a challenge. Global warming is clearly having major impacts on working people; not just in their workplace, but their personal lives and in their communities. The catastrophic Cyclone Phailin hit India in October 2013 killing 36 and uprooting over 550,000 people; Cyclone Mahasen hit Bangladesh and Burma in May 2013 causing one million people to be evacuated and killing 14. The workers in low-lying areas are living and working in ground zero for climate change. As organisations committed to improving the working lives of their members, what priority or response should unions and global unions give to climate change? This was the question I asked Sharan Burrow, the president of the International Trade Union Confederation, the global union's peak representative body, in July this year.  Burrow was the president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions before being elected to the ITUC in 2010, and Australian unions under her leadership played a key role in working with environment groups and supporting national climate action. The global unions response has been to launch an international campaign to support climate action.  The objective, says Burrow, is ""to mobilise union members in the lead up to Paris and Peru"" and ""achieve a just transition focusing on skills, jobs and technology"". ""The last IPCC reports were shocking,"" Burrow said, ""and the picture is clear. We need to decarbonise our societies and economies."" One of the greatest climate threat facing the 170 million workers represented by the ITUC is displacement. ""Workers in places like Africa are already experiencing climate displacement. Thousands of agriculture workers in Africa are being uprooted by drought and natural disasters,"" she said. ""Over the next 25 years, the destruction of regional industry through climate displacement is a bigger risk than the closure of industries due to other economic reasons."" The desertification in parts of Africa is not just seeing industries wiped out, but entire communities. The global union agenda is to support actions limiting warming to 2 degrees Celsius, with the central mission being the just transition. ""The just transition must start now,"" Burrow said.  ITUC research suggests that even a small investment in renewable energy and related industries could create tens of millions of jobs, as well as safeguard industries like steel, concrete and aluminium by cleaning them up. ""Aluminium has a future,"" she said, ""it's just the energy mix."" ""We can transition,"" Burrow said,"" if we tackle fear head on."" Facing unions like UNI Global Union and their national affiliates, representing service workers such as finance workers, garment makers, call centre workers, post officers and cleaners are hostile multi-national corporations, many of whom are at the cutting edge of union-busting tactics. Jennings, in an interview with The Guardian, explained the scale of the challenge that global unions like UNI face: The center of the world's union busting industry is the US. Companies adopt an almost paramilitary approach to place fear, threaten livelihoods and dismissal of staff. These are iron fist tactics used by household names from Walmart to T-Mobile. Labour standards and rights in many countries, including the US, are often scant or non-existent; often they simply serve to give legal punitive powers to employers. With multinational corporations prepared in some nations to take, as Jennings says, ""paramilitary"" approaches to prevent the unionisation of their workforce, and working people in developing nations facing serious injury, death or deportation, unions face a tough choices. Although global warming is increasingly affecting workers, unions often have to focus on ""traditional"" industrial matters like safety or wages. Climate campaigning can sometimes be portrayed as a luxury, but with the UN World Meteorological Organization predicting a ""climate hell"" and more disasters and uncertainty, union leaders like Burrow and Jennings warn climate change is union business and that climate change would mean the biggest industrial change of our generation. ""The time for a peaceful transition is starting to run out,"" said Jennings. ""The world must cut global emissions by 50% compared to 1990 levels and leave more than half of fossil fuel reserves in the ground to give us a chance of limiting rising temperatures to 2 degrees. It means that the world needs to achieve zero emission societies by 2050."" Burrow says the biggest barriers to change is lack of political will. ""Our leaders lack the political will to change, and can be dominated by self-interested corporations, who support populist political parties who want to scare people."" The global union climate motto is ""no jobs on a dead planet"". The role of unions globally is to empower working people, said Burrow. ""We need to mobilise for an ambitious global agreement.

"World governments are facing a ""pivotal moment"" on dealing with climate change, the UK's energy secretary will say on Tuesday, before a meeting of heads of state and government in New York this month. The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, has called the meeting of world leaders on the back of the UN's annual general assembly as a prelude to crunch talks in Paris next year at which a new global agreement on the climate is supposed to be signed.  Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat energy and climate change secretary, will unveil the UK government's strategy for the negotiations. Although the current talks are ""not the last hope"" of tackling climate change, he will say: ""While the negotiations will undoubtedly be challenging, I judge the prospects of a comprehensive climate change deal to be the best since we first began this journey many decades ago."" He said the UK had brought businesses and environmental campaigners together to push for unity. ""Our business community has recognised that decarbonisation and securing long-term prosperity go hand in hand, from the savings that can be made through energy efficiency to the growth prospects through the supply chain. A strong, vocal and committed network of NGOs, pressure groups and activists have been instrumental in sustaining political will and public acceptance. We must show the rest of Europe and the rest of the world that we speak with one voice on this."" He also called on the G7 and the G20 groups of industrialised nations to show similar commitments to emissions cuts, but did not set out what targets from those nations would be acceptable to the UK. Davey will not be present at the crunch meetings in the UN climate summit on 23 September, as the UK will be represented by the prime minister, David Cameron. UN officials hope that private conversations among leaders will bring greater progress than has been made at the set-piece negotiations held each year under its framework convention on climate change. A report from the Department of Energy and Climate Change on Tuesday sets out benefits to the UK from cutting emissions, including economic savings from greater energy efficiency, and avoiding the dangerous effects of climate change including flooding. Davey will call for ""emissions reductions from all countries"". However, it is unclear whether this would mean absolute cuts in current emissions levels, even from the poorest developing countries, which would be highly controversial, or commitments from such countries to ensure lower emissions levels in the future than is projected if emissions levels continue to rise at their current rates. The latter is the formula usually used for the least developed countries, many of whom have been among the nations calling most strongly for an international treaty, and recognises their continuing need to develop and the greater responsibility of nations that have benefited from earlier development to cut their emissions by higher amounts. A DECC official said the UK did not have a fixed idea on a timetable by when cuts should be achieved. Europe has agreed to cut emissions by 40% by 2030, relative to 1990 levels, a target that green campaigners have said is too low, as most of those cuts have already been achieved. But for a global pact to be effective, a timetable on nations' targets would have to be included. Leo Hickman, chief adviser on climate change at WWF-UK, said: ""With China and the US making increasingly positive noises, this [DECC] report is further proof that governments around the world are feeling ever more optimistic that a global climate deal can be secured in Paris at the end of 2015. The question now is not whether there will be a deal or not, but what that deal looks like. ""It must deliver the following: a strong legal framework and clear rules; ambitious action that keeps us well below a temperature rise of 2C since preindustrial times; and a central role for equitable financing that ensures vulnerable nations can adapt to a changing climate as well as make the transition to a low-carbon economy.""  "
"It is widely acknowledged that the planet’s political leaders and its people are currently failing to take enough action to prevent catastrophic climate change. Next year, at the United Nations climate change conference in Paris, representatives of all the world’s countries will be hoping to reach a new deal to cut greenhouse gases and prevent the planet overheating dangerously. So far, there are no signs that their leaders have the political will to do so.  To try to speed up the process, the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, has invited world leaders to UN headquarters in New York on 23 September for a grandly-named Climate Summit 2014. He said at the last climate conference, in Warsaw last year, that he is deeply concerned about the lack of progress in signing up to new legally-binding targets to cut emissions. If the summit is a success, then it means a new international deal to replace the Kyoto protocol will be probable in late 2015 in Paris. But if world leaders will not accept new targets for cutting emissions, and timetables to achieve them, then many believe that political progress is impossible. Ban Ki-moon’s frustration about lack of progress is because politicians know the danger we are in, yet do nothing. World leaders have already agreed that there is no longer any serious scientific argument about the fact that the Earth is heating up and − if no action is taken − will exceed the 2C danger threshold. It is also clear, Ban Ki-moon says, that the technologies already exist for the world to turn its back on fossil fuels and cut emissions of greenhouse gases to a safe level. What the major countries cannot agree on is how the burden of taking action should be shared among the world’s 196 nations. Ban Ki-moon already has the backing of more than half the countries in the world for his plan. These are the most vulnerable to climate change, and most are already being seriously affected. More than 100 countries meeting in Apia, Samoa, at the third UN conference on small island developing states, in their draft final statement, note with “grave concern” that world leaders’ pledges on the mitigation of greenhouse gases will not save them from catastrophic sea level rise, droughts, and forced migration. “We express profound alarm that emissions of greenhouse gases continue to rise globally.”  Many of them have long advocated a maximum temperature rise of 1.5C to prevent disaster for the most vulnerable nations, such as the Marshall Islands and the Maldives. The draft ministerial statement says: “Climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time, and we express profound alarm that emissions of greenhouse gases continue to rise globally. “We are deeply concerned that all countries, particularly developing countries, are vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change and are already experiencing an increase in such impacts, including persistent drought and extreme weather events, sea level rise, coastal erosion and ocean acidification, further threatening food security and efforts to eradicate poverty and achieve sustainable development.” Speaking from Apia, Shirley Laban, the convenor of the Pacific Islands Climate Action Network, an NGO, said: “Unless we cut emissions now, and limit global warming to less than 1.5C, Pacific communities will reap devastating consequences for generations to come. Because of pollution we are not responsible for, we are facing catastrophic threats to our way of life.” She called on all leaders attending the UN climate summit in New York to “use this historic opportunity to inject momentum into the global climate negotiations, and work to secure an ambitious global agreement in 2015”. This is a tall order for a one-day summit, but Ban Ki-moon is expecting a whole series of announcements by major nations of new targets to cut greenhouse gases, and timetables to reach them. There are encouraging signs in that the two largest emitters – China and the US – have been in talks, and both agree that action is a must. Even the previously reluctant Republicans in America now accept that climate change is a danger. It is not yet known how many heads of state will attend the summit in person, or how many will be prepared to make real pledges. At the end of the summit, the secretary general has said, he will sum up the proceedings. It will be a moment when many small island states and millions of people around the world will be hoping for better news. "
"The Palmer United party leader, Clive Palmer, has announced plans to host an unofficial “world climate change convention” at his Sunshine Coast resort, but would not reveal who would attend. The 17 November event will be held one day after the G20 meeting of world leaders in Brisbane, and just two weeks before a 12-day climate change conference in Lima, Peru, of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.  Palmer’s event is scheduled to occur less than a month after another official UN event: a five-day climate change conference in Bonn, Germany. Amid calls for climate change to be added to the G20 agenda, Palmer suggested that “major international leaders” would be coming to his Palmer Coolum Resort “to draw attention to climate change, what can be done about it”. “It will be held the day after the last day of the G20 in Brisbane and it will be keeping attention on the need to have a global emissions trading scheme,” Palmer said on Monday. “Over the coming weeks and months we’ll be making announcements of the world leaders who will be coming to attend this conference just after the G20. That’s an exciting thing for the Sunshine Coast.” Palmer provided no details about people likely to attend his event. “Well, we’ll be having ex-presidents of other countries – I can’t tell you who they are because their own countries have got to announce them – former presidents and former heads of state of other countries,” he said. “There’ll be some other eminent people, Nobel prize winners and others that’ll be coming here on climate change.” Palmer’s senators voted in July to abolish the carbon pricing scheme legislated by the previous government. The abolished system was due to move to a floating-price emissions trading scheme next year. The mining magnate appeared alongside the former US vice-president Al Gore at Parliament House in June to state his in-principle support for an emissions trading scheme, but argued Australia should not activate such a scheme until specific trading partners took similar action."
"Mr Johnson’s estuary proposal, as it is never described, has loomed large in the aviation debate, despite its abject lack of seriousness. London’s mayor put forward an entirely new airport on the Isle of Grain, which would cost five to 10 times as much as expanding Heathrow. The technocratic Airports Commission were bound to reject it, although they chickened out of quite saying so to Boris Johnson last year, agreeing to give his pet project one final look, even as they dropped it from the shortlist. Yesterday, adding new arguments about birdlife and the sheer dislocation of moving the capital’s main airport 70 miles to their original cost concerns, they finally gave the formal thumbs down. Mr Johnson was having none of it – insisting his scheme was “not dead” at all, because in the end it will not be for Sir Howard Davies and his commissioners to decide, but instead for the next government. As he plots his move from City Hall over to the Uxbridge parliamentary constituency, close to Heathrow, if the dismal environmental legacy of his mayoralty isn’t weighing on him, deep resentment about air traffic noise across the west and south-west of the metropolis assuredly is. A Conservative party that absorbed painful London losses in May will not recover in the capital without rebuilding in these areas of historic strength. Attention could yet turn away from the two proposals for a bigger Heathrow, and towards expanding Gatwick in true-blue Sussex. The stage is set for dull debates about “hub economics” and the feasibility of one city hosting two different sites at which the world disembarks, buys some lunch and a magazine, then clambers on to another plane.  The question of where is drowning out the question of whether bigger London airports are desirable. Amid the sound and fury over noise, the deeper environmental damage done by the carbon belched out by jet engines has dropped out of the equation. Just a few years ago, at the depth of the Great Recession, Ed Miliband tried (and for the most part failed) to resist Heathrow expansion while inside the Labour government, and in opposition David Cameron made green play of making a stand against. Today a recovering economy ought to permit more discussion about the sort of growth we want, but policy appears to boil down to “planning for rising demand”. The argument may have fallen silent, and yet the implications of unresting climate science grow ever closer. As the melting of the Greenland ice sheet picks up pace, those solemn promises of an 80% cut in emissions by 2050 could be rendered entirely hollow by aviation. Yes, increased efficiency may do some good, as may biofuels. It is true, too, that some of the immediate additional climate-changing costs of flying could be easier to reverse than the fundamental damage done by the carbon, which makes it tricky to be precise about the numbers. But then not much precision is required, since the only carbon price that bites on air tickets at all comes from the emissions trading system. It bites only on European flights, and some experts say it currently leaves carbon 100 times cheaper than it will eventually need to be. Without gripping aviation in the south-east, Britain could probably only hit its green ambitions by restricting northern airports, which hardly fits with regional policy, or by making reductions of unrealistic depth in other sectors. The biggest chunk of air travel is holidaying, where the net effect is always to deepen the current account deficit with sunnier parts of the world. In the Skype age, the proportion of flyers on business trips has been in decline, and with high-speed rail in prospect, internal flights could become entirely superfluous. The economics do not dictate that fast projected growth in air travel must be taken as a given: it ought to be possible to manage demand instead. But given Europe’s broken carbon market, there is no easy way to do that without keeping a lid on capacity. Instead, however, Westminster indulges passengers and airlines with the old lie: the sky’s the limit."
"Australian and US researchers have shown that the slowdown in the rate of global warming in the early 2000s, known as a so-called “global warming hiatus”, could have been predicted if today’s tools for decade-by-decade climate forecasting had been available in the 1990s. Although global temperatures remain close to record highs, they have shown little warming trend over the past 15 years, a slowdown that earlier climate models had been largely unable to predict.  This has been used by climate change sceptics as evidence that climate change prediction models are flawed. Gerald Meehl, a senior scientist at the National Centre for Atmospheric Research in the US, along with the Centre for Australian Weather and Climate Research in Melbourne, decided to challenge the assumption that no climate model could have foreseen the hiatus.  “We wanted to know: if we could be transported back to the 1990s with new decadal prediction capability, a set of current models and a modern-day supercomputer, could we simulate the hiatus?” Meehl said. Studies have shown global warming had not stalled but was occurring in the deeper layers of the world’s oceans instead of the surface, he said, which were absorbing the heat and obscuring levels of warming. In other words the “pause” was actually a slight slowing of the rate of increase in surface temperatures, with 93% of the extra heat trapped in the oceans. Decadal climate prediction uses the state of the world’s oceans and their influence on the atmosphere to predict how global climate will evolve over the next few years. It is a relatively new area of climate science driven by supercomputing, increased sophistication of global models and the availability of higher-quality observations of the climate system, particularly the ocean. When Meehl and his team applied these decadal climate prediction models to past-observed conditions in the climate system starting in the late 1990s, the three-to-seven-year forecasts consistently simulated the leveling of global temperature that was observed after the year 2000. While Meehl said all the factors that might be driving the hiatus were still being studied, his research, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, suggested natural decade-to-decade climate variability was largely responsible. “Because this is a brand new way of doing predictions we need to be careful as to how reliable these predictions are,” he said. “But there are indications from some of the most recent model simulations that the hiatus could end in the next few years.” Professor Matthew England, the deputy director of the climate change research centre at the University of New South Wales, said the study was important because it revealed initialised climate models could have predicted the recent slowdown in surface atmospheric warming. “This gives us confidence in the skill of these models for longer-term climate projections, as they appear to be able to capture the interplay between decadal variability and long-term warming,” he said “Like a weather prediction system, the models just need appropriate initial conditions, and then their skill on the decadal time-scale comes through.”"
"If the 20th century was the “age of extremes”, to quote Eric Hobsbawm’s famous title, the 21st may well be the age of the combined effects of debt and climate change. And it will, no doubt, witness its share of extreme events. Debt and climate change are nothing new, of course. As David Graeber has shown, debt is almost as old as humankind, whereas climate has varied across geological epochs. However, both have become more important in the past decades, and have now taken centre stage.  Debt and climate change are deeply connected, and understanding their interplay is crucial to making sense of upcoming political events. It is also crucial to building coalitions between social movements fighting austerity policies implemented in the name of debt reduction in Europe and elsewhere, and movements fighting climate change. For this, one can search for inspiration in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) fifth report, which was published early this year. The second part of the report includes a section (10.7) dedicated to the effects of climate change on finance and insurance. It was barely commented upon when the report was published. Yet it is a decisive section, as it establishes a link between the environmental crisis and economic and financial issues. Climate change will represent a major challenge for finance and insurance, the IPCC report observes. The increase in the number and intensity of natural catastrophes, for instance, will lead to significant raises in insurance payouts. As the world population and the economy grow, more people and goods are insured, and will therefore give rise to more claims in the event of disasters. With a cost of around $20bn for insurers, Hurricane Sandy in 2012 was only the beginning of a trend that will worsen in the decades to come. Likewise, finance will suffer from the impact of climate change. The value of securities is linked, in (sometimes very) complex ways, to underlying material assets, which will be affected by natural hazards. Moreover, disasters can disrupt supply chains, and hence put corporations in jeopardy. IT systems on which trading relies can also break down. Contrary to common belief, finance is a concrete, down-to-earth activity; it will not be immune to the impacts of an environmental crisis. Climate change will also affect public finances. According to the IPCC report, “a financial gap [will open] in the months immediately following an extreme weather event, often exacerbated by over-stretched public finances”. This financial gap is precisely where the connection between debt and climate change takes place. Here’s how. Today, states are burdened by mounting debt levels. Public debt is a political construction that goes back to the 1980s, when massive tax cuts for the rich started being implemented by neoliberal governments across the world. However, debt skyrocketed in the wake of the 2008 crisis, which greatly aggravated what Wolfgang Streeck calls in his recent book the “fiscal crisis of the state”. What does this have to do with climate change? Overstretched public finances, the report suggests, will make it more difficult for the state to take action in the event of natural catastrophes: rescuing the victims, rebuilding infrastructures, implementing preventive measures etc. And since pollutions, floods and heatwaves will become more numerous and intense, demands for state action will inevitably increase, thereby deepening the crisis. This fiscal crisis of the state will weigh not only on reaction and adaptation to climate events, but on mitigation policies. Cutting greenhouse gas emissions implies an energetic transition on a massive scale towards clean energies. This requires investments by the state, which will be difficult given the already overstretched public finances. Rising debt levels inflicted on societies by neoliberal tax cuts for the rich gravely compromise our capacity to adapt to climate change. So far, so good. But then the IPCC report takes a final step – in the wrong direction. To bridge the gap in public finances caused by recurrent extreme weather events, it recommends appealing to private investors. More precisely, it advocates the implementation of financial instruments such as catastrophe bonds or microinsurance as a means to lighten the burden on the state in the face of a changing climate. Where the state does not have the resources to act, financial markets should take charge. This financialisation of adaptation was already encouraged, in the years preceding the release of the IPCC report, by organisations such as the World Bank and the OECD. Thus, a 2012 working paper published by the OECD spoke of the need to “immunise public finances” from the effects of climate change, by issuing so-called “sovereign” catastrophe bonds, ie catastrophe bonds issued by states. Financialising adaptation is a bad idea for numerous reasons. Here are two. Firstly, finance is prone to crisis, as the subprime market’s collapse demonstrated in 2007. Thus, financialising adaptation would put adaptation policies – parts of them at least – at the mercy of the erratic behaviour of financial markets. Adding financial instability to environmental instability will only increase the scale of disasters. What is needed, on the contrary, is less reliance on the logic of markets, and more environmental long-term planning. Secondly, finance is in its essence undemocratic, ie out of the control of democratic deliberation. It is a form not only of economic dispossession, but of political dispossession, where the few choose for the many. Adaptation to climate change, however, will require the involvement of the people, the deepening of the democratic process, and even the invention of new democratic institutions. Without their active commitment, their knowledge and knowhow, it is doomed to fail. The reason for this is that adaptation will in a good part be a matter of reorganising the daily lives of the people, and that this will obviously not be done without them. Adaptation to climate change, from this perspective, may well be our chance to revitalise democracy “from below”. The IPCC report has done a wonderful job at alerting the global public opinion about the urgency to prevent, or at least limit, climate change. Also, it has correctly identified the growing pressure climate change will put on public finances, thus worsening the crisis of the state. But when it comes to finding solutions, it has not escaped the neoliberal zeitgeist, and especially the tendency to see in financial markets an answer, rather than a source of social problems. It will be the task of future coalitions of social movements to not only acknowledge the growing connection between debt and climate change, but to imagine new ways of countering their damaging effects on societies."
"Brazil is building a giant observation tower in the heart of the Amazon to monitor climate change and its impact on the region's sensitive ecosystem, a newspaper has reported. The Amazon Tall Tower Observatory is a project of Brazil's National Institute of Amazonian Research and Germany's Max Planck Institute, O Estado de São Paulo said.  The tower, which will rise 325 metres from the ground, will be equipped with high-tech instruments and an observatory to monitor relationships between the jungle and the atmosphere. It will gather data on heat, water, carbon gas, winds, cloud formation, carbon absorption and weather patterns. The project has been seven years in the making, with a site finally being selected far from any human presence, about 100 miles from Manaus, capital of the state of Amazonas, project coordinator Antonio Manzi told the newspaper. The steel structure has been transported to the site on trucks and rafts from southern Brazil. The Amazon jungle is one of the world's most sensitive ecosystems, with a powerful influence on the atmospheric release and intake of carbon. ""The tower will help us answer innumerable questions related to global climate change,"" said Paulo Artaxo, a project coordinator from the University of Sao Paulo. ""We will gain a better understanding of the role of the Amazon and other humid tropical areas in climate models."""

"“We managed to involve a rather sceptical community, and everybody’s sort of joined together,” says Sam White. “There’s a lot more crossover now between the people in the community and the school … It’s brought people together.” White is a parent at Pendock Primary school in rural Worcestershire. Back in 2012 this tiny school of just 49 pupils was one of the first to sign up to 10:10’s Solar Schools project. They had an ambitious plan – to raise £9,000 to buy solar panels for their roof in just two terms. That’s impressive for any school but for one this size, some local residents felt it was out of their league. But just five months later, thanks to a dedicated group of school volunteers (and our back-up, we like to think) they hit their target. Now the school’s very own solar array sits proudly on the school roof – cutting the carbon emissions and saving the school money. In fact, on a sunny day they can provide the entire electricity needs of the school. When we first set up the Solar Schools project back in 2011, we wanted a project that would really bring renewable energy into the centre of communities. We wanted to cut carbon, but it was about more than that. By working with a well-loved institution at the centre of the community, we hoped to create a real buzz about the benefits of solar among pupils, parents and staff – and through their own positive practice experience, winning hearts and minds for renewable energy and tackling climate change. But what we hadn’t really anticipated was the incredible social impact the project would have on the participants and wider community. As the volunteers reached out beyond the school gates, the communities rallied round in support. It has brought parents right into the heart of the school, started relationships with community groups and businesses that have lasted well beyond the solar fundraising, and left a legacy of greater confidence and new skills, such as using social media or public speaking for the first time. Prof Sir Tim Brighouse, British educator and former schools commissioner for London, agrees. “I know many of the schools involved in Solar Schools and am hugely impressed by its impact on community involvement and how it motivates students.” And that’s certainly what they saw at Pendock. As part of their fundraising, the team decided to hold a fun run through the village. They were concerned neighbours might not appreciate muddy children running past their front gates, but how wrong they were. Hundreds of villagers came onto the streets to cheer the children on. The money they raised helped towards the solar target, but the legacy has been far greater than that. The following year they decided to organise the run again and it’s now become something of an annual village event. Their experience is echoed by Sue Jepson, deputy head teacher of Barnes Primary School in west London: “Taking part in Solar Schools was an incredible opportunity for our school, and an experience that will benefit us for years to come. Not only are we now enjoying the great financial and environmental benefits of solar panels, but our pupils, staff and parents got a huge amount out of the fundraising process itself.” 10:10 has now worked with 50 schools in a diverse range of communities from the Isles of Scilly to Stockton-on-Tees, who have collectively raised over £400,000 for Solar. This October, with support from Good Energy, we’re equipping another 20 schools with our toolkit of on and offline resources and training as they begin their solar journeys. Solar Schools works differently in every school – they really make the project their own – from organising school discos and cake sales to a sponsored bungee jump and seven hour table tennis marathons. It’s not easy – ambitious projects never are. The schools face a number of challenges along the way, least of all convincing sceptics that such a huge fundraising target isn’t crazy. But seeing the panels on the roof makes it all worth it. Sarah Sharrock, a governor and PTA member at Newnham Croft Primary in Cambridge, sums it up perfectly. “It has been an exciting and eventful journey, with its fair share of ups and downs, but it shows how we can work together to make things happen. And in the end, that is how we are going to beat climate change.” For information about community energy projects:  It’s worth following Community Energy Fortnight, which starts September 13. CEF was established by the Community Energy Coalition (CEC), which was formed in 2011 by some of the UK’s most influential and trusted institutions and charities such as the Church of England, the Women’s Institute (WI), the National Union of Students (NUS) and the National Trust.  1.

"If your company is aiming to improve the efficiency of its factory, it might aim for a 3% improvement in productivity each year, with a stretch target of 5%. Hitting those goals would deliver meaningful benefits to the company’s bottom line. If, however, your company is trying to plan for operating in a world where every fundamental resource – from water to energy to talent – is increasingly constrained, standard business goal-setting strategies may not apply.  Instead, sustainability advocates and consultants are increasingly encouraging companies to get a better grasp on the science behind various environmental impacts – and the reality of climate change – and to set goals accordingly. A similar approach is being encouraged for social responsibility goals, although there’s not necessarily the same consensus there on metrics – no global standard exists (yet) for measuring employee happiness or productivity, for example.   The push for more science-based (or what some call “context-based” or “reality-based”) goals in sustainability began in earnest in 2013, as various leading-edge companies, including Unilever, Autodesk, and Intel, began to talk more openly about incorporating science into goal-setting. In late 2013, Climate Counts released the world’s first science-based ranking of corporate carbon emissions. It calculated not only the amount of CO2 each company emits, but also each company’s potential reductions, placed against a backdrop of the global reductions climate scientists say we need in order to stem the tide of climate change. “Five years ago, it was the norm to set incremental goals for sustainability in the same way that you would for other aspects of a business – people would look at what they did the previous year and aim to do 3% better,” says consultant and Vanderbilt professor Jeff Gowdy, who partnered with author and consultant Andrew Winston (also a Guardian contributor) to launch the site PivotGoals.com, a database of corporate sustainability goals, last year. “That makes sense if the boundary for your goals is inside your company. But the problem is that we’re all operating in an external, finite system. There are finite resources and finite places to put waste. That means we need to set goals for companies that take that broader system into account. If we can reduce emissions by 4%, great, but we need 80% by 2050, or more. And if we don’t hit that, we may not have a viable place to do business.”  To that end, when Autodesk created its greenhouse gas reduction goal-setting strategy – Corporate Finance Approach to Climate-Stabilizing Targets (C-FACT) – it decided to open-source the methodology and encourage all companies to use it. The company claims that if all companies were to adopt the free C-FACT approach and meet the targets defined by the methodology, private-sector emissions would be on track to help stabilize the climate by 2050. The method has proven successful for Autodesk as well: In fiscal year 2014, the company achieved a 38.1% reduction in its total emissions compared with its 2009 baseline, exceeding its C-FACT target of a 23.4% reduction.  ‘Look at things from a planetary level’ Using science as a basis for sustainability targets is fundamentally about risk management, although it comes with potential reputational benefits as well. “You have to look beyond your company, and even your industry, and look at things from the planetary level, especially for large companies in global industries,” Gowdy says. “If you’re pulling from multiple continents, what happens if the worst-case scenario plays out and there’s a five-to-ten foot sea rise in Bangladesh, and 80% of your shirts are made there? It’s about risk management, reputation management, and scenario planning.” Intel’s climate policy offers a current-day example. Along with the rest of the tech industry, it worked to reduce its emission of fluorinated gases­ – greenhouse gases that stick around in the atmosphere forever – as much as possible over the past several years, voluntarily complying with the US Environmental Protection Act’s target to reduce emissions of fluorinated gases by 10% by 2012. (The industry reached that target well ahead of the deadline). “What has driven us is a fear that people will ban the use of fluorinated gases,” Stephen Harper, global director of en­vironment and energy policy at Intel, explained to Sustainable Brands earlier this year. “We try to substitute lower GWP [global-warming potential] gases for higher GWP gases, and to be more effi­cient in recycling and reuse, and where it is needed, develop destruction technologies that turn those gases into other things that are less harmful.” As the world’s governments and markets inch closer to putting a price on environmental impact and a value on ecosystem services, companies with a better understanding of ecosystem services ­– the natural benefits, ranging from clean water to a healthy population, that our ecosystem provides – and how they both impact and rely upon those services, could be better positioned to operate in a world in which those services are less available and more expensive. “I think we could expand the understanding of some companies of what ecosystem services are supplied and how they might want to think about them in the future,” says Ann Kinzig, chief research strategist for the Julie Ann Wrigley Global Institute of Sustainability at Arizona State University. “We could help them better understand the ecosystem services they rely on and the challenges and benefits to better management of those services.” Gaps in the science: what we don’t know But like all science-based goal setting, tying one’s sustainability strategy to a broad understanding of ecosystem services is complicated. Models exist now that can predict how changes in land use or land cover (trees versus forest meadows, for example) will affect the delivery of ecosystem services, but Kinzig says there’s a gap in the knowledge of how to then reach the ideal scenario laid out in the model.  “We can’t yet say what policies would cause you to get forest here and grassland there,” she explains. “If it’s public land, it’s a bit more straightforward. But if it’s a bunch of private landholders, predicting what they’re likely to do under particular incentive or regulatory schemes is harder. We need to be able to say: ‘If you did a payment-for-ecosystem-services scheme here, this group of people would likely achieve a 70% improvement, these would probably cheat, and these others might exceed expectations.’ We don’t have that capacity yet.” Then there are the complexities of balancing ecosystem services. What is most important to a company might not be crucial to the public good, and focusing on any one ecosystem service often comes with tradeoffs in other areas. The global emphasis on CO2 and climate change, for example, has sometimes led to environmental tradeoffs in other areas, like water.  “We have to look at what other ecosystem services we might be gaining or losing by addressing one aspect,” Kinzig explains. “By reforesting watersheds in the name of carbon sequestration, for example, we have often reduced water supply.” Balancing those tradeoffs is not the job of companies, nor should it be, Kinzig is quick to point out. But understanding how those shifts in ecosystem services could affect one’s employees or business down the road could be quite beneficial to companies. “Let’s say you have lots of infrastructure on the coast – you might want to learn more about storm surge damage and how coral reefs or mangroves can help protect against it,” Kinzig says. “If you’re in a fire-prone region, it may be worthwhile to work with your community on fire regulation. You don’t have to be directly dependent on natural resources, like a timber or water company, to care about ecosystem services.”  What’s good for the CEO is good for the scientist The business world’s embrace of science-based sustainability goals could ultimately be good for science, too. As more companies like Intel and Autodesk voluntarily embed the findings of climate scientists and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change into their strategic operations, it becomes more and more difficult for others to dismiss climate science, the human contributions to climate change, or the impacts of climate change on business. To that end, non-governmental organizations are encouraging companies to be clearer about the science behind their sustainability targets, as well, and stronger in their endorsements of that science. “A clear message from [the NGOs we work with] is for companies to have a climate policy based upon the science, to strongly support the validity of the science, given that there continues to be a lot of misinformation out there,” Harper said.

"Emma Thompson was on a ship recently, bound for the Arctic, with 37 crew and her 14-year-old daughter, Gaia, part of a Greenpeace mission to highlight global warming. She has done a lot of trips like this, to Africa and south-east Asia – ""raising awareness"", as the exhausted phrase goes – but the ship cleaving through ice seemed particularly apt. Thompson, at 55, is regarded as formidable in almost the Edwardian style, the actor-activist more concerned with the cause than with what you might think of her – or, for that matter, with the niceties of the charity world. ""When a disaster occurs,"" she says, ""there can be a rather unsavoury rush to plant the flag of your NGO in the nearest head of whoever's surviving."" She will not bite her tongue for anyone.  Nor, for the most part, will she play the movie star card. We are in Thompson's work space in a semi-detached house in suburban north London, near where she grew up and where her family still lives. She looks like a graduate student in a Greenpeace sweatshirt, torn jeans, owlish glasses and trainers, her face fresh without makeup – an observation that, after spending an hour with Thompson, one hesitates to make for fear of letting the side down. Still, she is an actor, and pulls another version of herself out of the hat when necessary, appearing on talkshows and at awards ceremonies to promote, in the US at least, a highly stylised Englishness that the Americans find charming and the English, perhaps, find a little de trop. ""Well, it's just energy. It's performance energy,"" she says. ""It's not what you do, and you might regard it with some horror, but it's what I do. And it's what pantomime performers have done for centuries in our country. I don't have to do too much that's truly idiotic."" This is true. Thompson's roles have, over the years, inspired an unusual devotion. A week before our meeting, I was at a US immigration office in New York where a harried, thirtysomething officer insisted on having a reason for my trip, and when I gave him one, transformed before my eyes. Sense And Sensibility, he said, was his favourite film. I thought he was going to cry. Even at 20 years' distance, Thompson's Elinor Dashwood in the Ang Lee adaptation of Austen's novel – especially the moment where she finds out that Edward Ferrars is not, after all, married – does something weird to one's system; so, too, her Margaret Schlegel in Howards End, and the scene (the only good one) in Love Actually, when she crumples on discovering her husband Harry (Alan Rickman) is lusting after someone else. Thompson is ordinarily so brisk, so seemingly sorted and amused, that when she goes, we all go. Anyway, she is in a mildly brisk mode today, on a mission to inform us about the planet which, of course, we should be thoroughly engaged with, but who has the time, and aren't there a million other things to be worried about? ""It's your grandchildren,"" she says. ""You've got skin in the game, mate. And if my daughter is lucky enough to have children, if she wishes them, and I have grandchildren, these are the people who are going to be dealing with the mess. So unless we get to grips with this instead of just wibbling on, it's going to be really hard."" The nine-day voyage to the Smeerenburg glacier, part of the Svalbard archipelago in the Arctic Ocean, was designed to flag up the environmental threats posed by climate change and oil drilling. ""We have a dependency, in the same way we had a dependency on tobacco until we realised it killed us. Fossil fuels were a really good idea at the time. But they're not a good idea any more. It's so hard, because you've got corporations with trillions and trillions of dollars who see things that are trapped in the Earth's crust as their inheritance. And I think one of the reasons people zone out is they feel guilty and helpless."" At one point in the Guardian's film of the trip, while standing on the ice in full Arctic gear, she holds up a sign addressed to Tony Abbott, the Australian prime minister who, though he has since softened his stance, once referred to climate change science as ""crap"". (The sign says: ""Tony Abbott Climate Change is REAL I'm Standing In It""). Any word from his office? ""No, no, sadly not. I'd be very happy to have a chat to Tony about his attitudes to women and abortion. Look at the things that Tony Abbott has said – oh, he's a corker."" She bursts out laughing. ""Tragic."" It's embarrassing, I say. Thompson says drily: ""People are embarrassing."" Embarrassment is one of the emotions she plays well. Also, indignation and bafflement. Remember her in The Remains Of The Day, trying to wrangle a human response out of Anthony Hopkins' repressed butler? In her most recent role, as PL Travers in the biopic Saving Mr Banks, she went the full Edith Evans with a performance that tipped, here and there, into parody. But Thompson is always fascinating to watch, the frank intelligence of her performances somehow acknowledging the absurdity of the whole acting exercise without ever quite killing off suspension of disbelief. She will talk effectively about dwindling roles for women in their 50s, but is affronted by suggestions – even indirect ones – that she downplay her age. While on ship, her daughter made her tweet, something that doesn't come naturally. ""No, no, I wouldn't dream of it, normally. It's not my generation."" Really? ""No. I'm 55. It's not my thing at all."" She says this very firmly, as if countering a wrong but widely held assumption about 55-year-olds in general. ""I mean, it took me ages to get used to using a computer."" She is having a great decade, what with the success of the Nanny McPhee franchise, and plaudits for Mr Banks. But don't be fooled, she says. The reason she said yes to Greenpeace (apart from the fact that a great friend asked her) is that it met the stringent criteria she now applies to all projects: ""Is the subject right and fascinating, and can I bring every best energy I have to it? Especially now, when time's running out. It's a different patch of life, your 50s."" She feels that? ""Yes. Absolutely. Sorry. Not in a horrible way, but…"" I thought 50 was the new 35? ""Can I just say, very loudly, bollocks. If you look after yourself and you're healthy, then you'll have the energy to do things. But not to recognise getting older for what it is? I do think the infantilisation of our generation is one of the huge issues of our time. People wanting to be 35 when they're 50 makes me think: why? Why don't you be 50 and be good at that? And also embody the kinds of choices that are sustainable at that age."" What sort of choices? ""Well, I see people starting life over and over again. And you want to say: just go deeper into the one you've got. Because you can skim very easily. It's set up for that because we're such a disposable society. And I think that relationships are regarded as more disposable than they were, and that's short-sighted of us."" Thompson is married to the actor Greg Wise, whom she met on the set of Sense And Sensibility. Theirs is perceived to be a good union; I tell her that before our meeting, a friend said one of the reasons she admires Thompson is that she ""has a great marriage"". She gives me a rather dry look. ""I think the first 20 years are the… bedrock. And then you can start having a good time."" How many years has she been married? She smiles. ""Nineteen."" As a child, Emma Thompson was regarded as bossy. She has said, in interviews, that this impression continued into adulthood and that some, in the past, have found it hard to deal with – ""mentioning no names, but my first husband"". (She was married to Kenneth Branagh for six years from 1989.) Now, she says, ""I saw 'bossy' used in reference to a man recently, which I thought was very encouraging. I wouldn't refer to myself as bossy in the normal run of things, but of course I was called bossy, constantly, when I was younger. As was and is everyone, as Rebecca West would say, who has an opinion that doesn't chime with that of a doormat."" Her mother, Phyllida Law, and her father, Eric Thompson, were in the entertainment business, a jobbing actor and director. Their two girls, Emma and Sophie, grew up in the mild bohemia of 1970s north London, which Law has written about in two very charming memoirs, Notes To My Mother-In-Law and How Many Camels Are There In Holland? The kitchen table at dinner was a lively place. ""We were surrounded by writers and directors and actors, so there was a lot of talk about theatre. But not, I would imagine, the sort of talk that was around Peter Brook's table. It was humbler, really. We talked about books, a bit. Mum's a great reader. But it wasn't a political atmosphere, in the way that our house now has a political atmosphere. I don't think I discovered politics of that kind until I was at uni."" Both parents had to work, as did Thompson from her early 20s; one of the most useful things she learned from her parents is that it is OK to be out of the limelight. ""Sometimes there was money and sometimes there wasn't. They weren't particularly famous, none of their friends was famous. It was just a job. It's just my job. Fame is a completely accidental by-product. I don't have any feeling of, you've got to keep your face up there."" After Gaia was born, Thompson scaled back for many years. When she did re-engage, she was lucky to have Wise around to pick up the slack at home. ""I could never have done any of my work that involved filming otherwise. Writing's great, but going off to work on something like Saving Mr Banks I couldn't have done. I'd have had to take her with me or something."" Presumably she could go off with a clear conscience, though, because Gaia was with her dad. ""Not really. There's always guilt."" For the last few years, Thompson has been working on first the writing, then the filming of Effie Gray, the story of the 19th-century art critic John Ruskin and his long-suffering wife, played by Dakota Fanning; Thompson plays the imperious Lady Eastlake and Greg Wise plays Ruskin. The film was stuck in legal purgatory for years while Thompson successfully defended two plagiarism suits brought by American writers. It's a strange film, slow and a little thin, but beautifully filmed and the performances are terrific – especially from Wise, who makes Ruskin's rejection of his wife and adherence to his mother (Julie Walters) skin-crawlingly creepy. It's very British, in lots of ways, full of people failing to say what they think or mean, although, as Thompson points out, the Americans can be just as bad. ""They're often very dishonest, especially in my business. 'Oh, yeah, great, you were fabulous!'"" The Brits probably have it worse, though. ""I think the British can be very twisted about their genuine feelings. Have you read [Edward St Aubyn's] Patrick Melrose novels? Oh my god! Talking of false identities and people's disguises."" To Thompson's delight, Gaia loved the trip to the Arctic, and found the people on ship deeply sympathetic. They were all ages, all backgrounds, some optimists, some pessimists, which Thompson liked. (She is, unusually for someone promoting a cause, deeply sceptical about the aid world. ""I liked the fact that you weren't with a load of people saying, 'We're going to save the planet!' The question of whether it's a form of make-yourself-feel-better tourism I think is a very fair one."") Gaia, meanwhile, said, ""'I've found my tribe.' And I knew exactly what she meant."" As a teenager of roughly the same age, Thompson was ""very loud and angry"". In the Guardian's video, her daughter comes across as a thoroughly nice kid. ""Well, yeah, let's hope so. She's wonderful and I think she's fantastic. I think the proof will be on the analyst's couch in 30 years' time, if that occurs. I don't think so, though, because I think of Gaia and Tindy as being very much hand-reared. They've been checked, and picked out, like a little garden. They haven't been handed over to anyone. There's a lot of soil work."" Tindy is Thompson's 27-year-old adopted son, a former child soldier from Rwanda whom she and Wise met at a Refugee Council event when he was 16. He has accompanied her on many aid trips and is now a human rights lawyer. Gaia was just two when he came into their lives, and the two regard each other as siblings, absolutely, she says. ""For Tindy, Gaia's incredibly valuable, because she's a proper sister. And he drives her mad and they fight. They fight! Which is brilliant. When that happens, I'm secretly thrilled."" At Cambridge in the early 1980s, Thompson shaved her head and grunged out, as the times permitted. Her feminism was uncompromising and it stayed that way after her hair grew back. It is absurd that, by talking without caveat about sexism, she is considered almost eccentrically radical by the standards of her industry. (She traces the destruction of the Arctic – the fact that we're ""fucking the Earth over right, left and centre"" – to patriarchal standards set during the industrial age. Most Hollywood actresses would rather die than use the word ""patriarchy"".) ""Yes, it does baffle me. I don't understand. When you say, 'But feminism means equal rights for women' – sorry, what's the problem? You think it's done? Then think again and inform yourselves, because it isn't done. Don't be daft about it. So what's the issue? Is it that there have been feminists who have said things that shock and appal you?"" Perhaps other actresses think they won't get jobs. ""Well, I would not be in work if that was the case. It's very, very odd. I've worked with some young, brilliant women whom I would consider feminists, who don't like to use the word."" Does she remonstrate with them? ""Yes. I say, why? It seems to be out of fashion. Surely it's a bottom line thing that has nothing to do with fashion, one way or another."" Parenting teens, Thompson says, strikes her as much harder than stewarding younger children. She and her oldest friend from university took Gaia and three other teens to the Reading festival last month, whereupon ""the most important thing is that they know you're there, but that you can be picked up and used as and when needed. I think people sometimes think, oh, they're teens now, they're up and running. But this is the crucial time; when they're little, they just need feeding and cuddling. But not this later stuff. You have to be around."" She thinks back to when she was 15, ""reading Jackie fucking magazine. Reading articles like How To Find Your Man And Keep Him. I was wading through a huge heap of insidious twaddle."" The insidious twaddle available to today's teens is much more pervasive. Like most sensible parents, Thompson keeps the computer in the kitchen, but you can't police your teen's phone. The sheer weight of sexual imagery to which they are exposed, she believes, means people growing up now ""don't have any connection to their own sexuality. It'll be our children who will tell us later: why the fuck didn't you do something about this? Do you know I haven't had an erection since 1989 or whatever?"" Has Thompson's strength of feeling, her willingness to campaign, interfered with her work? Would she use a film to proselytise? ""Give me an example of a proselytising film. In The Name Of The Father or something?"" Well, except that was a great movie. Could a script light her political fire but still be a bad film? ""No, no, no, no, no. I get offered a ton of political stuff, and a lot of the time it's not good enough. There aren't very many films that are truly political and truly great. The Lives Of Others, City Of God. Some of Mike Leigh's are wonderful, and Ken Loach's can be fantastic, but sometimes a bit too proselytising for me. I need to be surprised. It's like reading Victor Hugo's Misérables. I got exhausted by agreeing with him. I thought, yes, I know, it's awful, the poor get shat on."" She chuckles. She was heavily criticised, and called an IRA sympathiser, for In The Name Of The Father, Jim Sheridan's 1993 biopic of the Guildford Four, in which she played defence lawyer Gareth Peirce. And there was criticism when she publicly opposed the first Gulf war. Not all of her judgment calls are right, mind you; Thompson added her name to the ill-advised petition in support of Roman Polanski some years ago. ""Yes, but then I had to take my name off it. Mike Nichols rang me up and said, sign this, and sent me a documentary about the utterly appalling [judicial] process. Made by a woman. And I thought, OK, well it's a tricky one. Then I spoke to a woman at Tindy's university who said no, rape is rape, and I thought about it and thought, mmm, yeah. Yeah. You're right. And it was such a messed up process of justice, it was rotten. But rape is rape. And you look at what's been going on recently here with Operation Yewtree and it makes your eyes water."" Gaia pops her head round the door, very much following in her mum's sartorial style in DMs and a jacket that would look great on a demo. She is off out for the day. ""Are you going to be warm enough, mate?"" Thompson says cheerfully. ""Take a scarf."" She turns back to the kitchen table. Her political interests, she assumes, are tolerated in the US, ""because they know I'm going to go away. I'm not going to live there and fiddle with their menfolk. Or indeed their women. I don't know."" And she half-shrugs, as if to say, either way, it doesn't make the blindest bit of difference. • Effie Gray goes on general release next month.  Emma Thompson will be speaking at the People's Climate March in London on 21 September, part of a global day of action on the climate crisis.

"The planet's two largest ice sheets – in Greenland and Antarctica – are now being depleted at an astonishing rate of 120 cubic miles each year. That is the discovery made by scientists using data from CryoSat-2, the European probe that has been measuring the thickness of Earth's ice sheets and glaciers since it was launched by the European Space Agency in 2010. Even more alarming, the rate of loss of ice from the two regions has more than doubled since 2009, revealing the dramatic impact that climate change is beginning to have on our world.  The researchers, based at Germany's Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research – used 200m data points across Antarctica and 14.3m across Greenland, all collected by CryoSat, to study how the ice sheets there had changed over the past three years. The satellite carries a high-precision altimeter, which sends out short radar pulses that bounce off the ice surface and then back to the satellite. By measuring the time this takes, the height of the ice beneath the spacecraft can be calculated. It was found from the average drops in elevation that were detected by CryoSat that Greenland alone is losing about 90 cubic miles a year, while in Antarctica the annual volume loss is about 30 cubic miles. These rates of loss – described as ""incredible"" by one researcher – are the highest observed since altimetry satellite records began about 20 years ago, and they mean that the ice sheets' annual contribution to sea-level rise has doubled since 2009, say the researchers whose work was published in the journal Cryosphere last week. ""We have found that, since 2009, the volume loss in Greenland has increased by a factor of about two, and the West Antarctic ice sheet by a factor of three,"" said glaciologist Angelika Humbert, one of the study's authors. ""Both the West Antarctic ice sheet and the Antarctic peninsula, in the far west, are rapidly losing volume. By contrast, East Antarctica is gaining volume, though at a moderate rate that doesn't compensate for the losses on the other side of the continent."" The researchers say they detected the biggest elevation changes caused by ice loss at the Jakobshavn glacier in Greenland, which was recently found to be shifting ice into the oceans faster than any other ice-sheet glacier, and at Pine Island glacier, which like other glaciers in West Antarctica, has been thinning rapidly in recent years. The discovery of these losses of ice is particularly striking and represents yet another blow to claims by some climate-change deniers, who argue that the rapid loss of ice in the Arctic currently being observed is being matched by a corresponding increase in Antarctica. CryoSat's measurements show that Antarctica – although considerably colder than the Arctic because of its much higher average elevation – is not gaining ice at all. Indeed, it is – overall – losing considerable volumes, and in the case of West Antarctica is doing so at an alarming rate. This point was stressed by Mark Drinkwater, the European Space Agency's CryoSat mission scientist. ""These results offer a critical new perspective on the recent impact of climate change on large ice sheets. This is particularly evident in parts of the Antarctic peninsula, where some of the more remarkable features add testimony on the impact of sustained peninsula warming at rates several times the global average."""
"Meteorologists have the tools to clearly understand how humans are affecting the Earth’s climate. For folks who study weather every day, the changes they’ve seen defy natural explanation. But most meteorologists have to balance their very limited airtime and their reporting obligations with a desire to convey the reality of climate change.  It’s very rare that a meteorologist, let alone a major media organization, take time to bring in-depth discussions to their listeners. But, just this has happened approximately a year ago at Minnesota Public Radio, the largest public radio enterprise in the United States with their star meteorologist Paul Huttner and his deeply knowledgeable host Kerri Miller. This unique venture (a weekly climate show CLIMATE CAST and a weather and climate blog UPDRAFT) and talented team is setting the standard for climate reporting in the United States.   In barely a year, their guest list has included Kevin Trenberth, Ben Santer, Jennifer Francis, Gary Yohe, Anthony Leiserowitz, Steve Vavrus, and Ralph Keeling among others. The depth and reach of Climate Cast have motivated my selection of Paul as my latest Scientist in Focus. As with most of us, Paul can trace his climate trajectory to his lived experiences. Almost 20 years ago, he covered the infamous Chicago heat wave. That event, which killed approximately 750 citizens, opened his eyes to the impacts of extreme weather events.  He later lived in Arizona, a southern desert-like state. There he noticed that droughts were leading to damaging wildfires that were destroying long-lived mountain forests. Fortunately, Paul Huttner was able to learn from Jonathan Overpeck, Andrew Comrie, and Malcolm Hughes, whose collective expertise in drought, health, and paleoclimate gave Paul a valuable lens through which to view his own observations. Paul Huttner deepened his study of climate and became one of the few short-term weather forecasters who also understood longer term changes and their connections. A leader among his peers, Paul has gained a reputation by connecting the dots. That old adage of, “we cannot say this event is caused by human emissions” has become “what we are seeing is unusual and is consistent with predictions… all weather is now being impacted by humans.”  Among the things that stand out for Paul are changes to atmospheric circulation, manifested by weather in the middle USA that drunkenly swings from extreme wet to extreme dry, from extreme hot to cold. These events have pushed little Minnesota into the top three list of states for catastrophic insurance losses from extreme weather in three of the last seven years. But Paul doesn’t just see extremes in his region, he also points to observations in other parts of the country and the world.  What makes Paul a perfect choice for my second Scientist in Focus is that his accomplishments have been acknowledged by his peers, who are well-known and respected in their own right. University of Minnesota Professor Mark Seeley told me, Aside from scientific knowledge, Paul is blessed with the gift of communicating valuable information through stories and analogues. He is highly regarded for his ability to talk about the contentious issue of climate change by framing it in historical and consequential contexts thereby encouraging people to see the impacts on both our natural resources and societal infrastructure. In fact, this focus on the impacts of climate change and our need to simultaneously mitigate and adapt has put Paul at the vanguard of communication. He uses terms like “hidden adaptation tax” to articulate the reality that we are already spending resources to prepare ourselves for tomorrow’s weather. This articulation has captured the attention of an elite and discerning crowd. Bud Ward, editor of the Yale Climate Connections, and one of the few go-to climate communicators told me, Paul Huttner’s innovative Climate Cast program sets a high bar for public radio stations across the U.S. He has an uncanny ability to make the timely timeless, by fitting today’s breaking weather developments into the longer-range climate, and climate change, context. That he does so consistent with the world’s most authoritative scientific findings and evidence -- and yet easily digestible by an engaged but non-expert audience -- makes it all the more valuable to his audience. If only public radio audiences in other states had comparable access to such authoritative reporting and analysis on a regular basis Another national climate communication expert, Andrew Freedman, who was a senior science writer at Climate Central and now writes for Mashable said, Paul is unique in the U.S. as an authoritative and curious radio broadcaster in a weather-obsessed state. He sounds like his audience, with the classic aww-shucks Midwestern mentality and accent. He is the only radio broadcast meteorologist to be regularly featuring climate science content, and he finds ways to engage with his audience rather than fall into the myriad political traps that haunt this beat. That’s not easy to pull off consistently, but he does. In short, MPR is lucky to have him. Let’s hope that the success of Paul, his colleagues, his weekly show, and the positive response they’ve received become a motivation for other meteorologists to take the leap into this important communication space."
"This is like the movie Groundhog Day. I seem forever forced to correct the State Department’s errant analysis of Alberta tar sands emissions. Now, however, other people are agreeing with me. A recent paper published in Nature Climate Change reviewed the State Department’s accounting and found it deeply flawed.  The authors, Peter Erickson and Michael Lazarus of the Stockholm Institute included the impacts of Keystone on the global oil markets. This inclusion tripled the climate change impact of the Keystone pipeline compared to the State Department’s analysis. Let’s get into the study to see the reason for the change and also to understand why even this new analysis is flawed.  First, the State Department assesses the impact of tar sands by assuming it will merely displace, barrel for barrel, some other oil extracted somewhere else on the planet. Therefore, the State Department analysis only counts the incremental emissions for tar sands. Tar sands are approximately 17% worse in terms of emissions than other fuels (it depends on which fuel is the reference); the State Department only counts these extra emissions. What the new study does is ask, how will the Keystone pipeline increase oil extraction globally? For instance, if oil prices decrease because of Keystone, then more oil will be extracted (up to 0.6 barrels more per barrel of tar sands). They reason, correctly, that an honest account must include the increased extraction.  In fact, this new accounting shows that the actual emissions are up to four times those proposed by the government analysis. To put some real numbers in, the authors report that Keystone would lead to up to 110 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year.  The paper received a lot of well-deserved attention in the media both online at Think Progress and at Climate Central, by first-rate writer Seth Borenstein, and others. Of course, there was the quick (and ironic) complaint from Andrew Leach who is the Enbridge Professor of Energy Policy at the University of Alberta. The first irony is that Enbridge is a Canadian company that deals with tar sands and is fighting to expand its own pipelines. The second irony is that Andrew Leach argues we should consider the economic benefits of increased oil consumption at lower prices but is silent in his critique about the economic consequences of climate change. But it is clear that even this new analysis is too low. Why do economists take an incremental approach to emissions? The true way to count the amount of carbon that the Keystone pipeline is responsible for is to count the amount of carbon that would flow through the pipeline when it is built. Another way of thinking about this is that we have three possible alternatives. Now, economists like to compare prospect 1 to prospect 2. Instead, we should compare prospect 1 to prospect 3. I have made this argument in a court filing in Minnesota this year against the Enbridge pipeline, here in the Guardian, and elsewhere. With a caveat that we do not know the blend of mixture that would be pumped through Keystone; if it were all tar sands (or even mostly tar sands), the climate impact would be huge.   With the planned 830,000 barrels per days and emissions of 575 kilograms of carbon dioxide emissions per barrel (~ 625 when petcoke is included), the emissions associated with Keystone amount to about 480,000 tons of carbon dioxide per day (520,000 tons of CO2 per day with petcoke). This is, respectively, 170-190 million tons of carbon dioxide annually.  As a comparison, this carbon dioxide is equal to approximately 40 million cars or 55 coal plants. As an alternative, if the U.S. simply increased fuel efficiency 4 mpg, then we would save the entire stock of tar shipped through Keystone, we would reduce pollution, and each American would save approximately $250 per year. Of course, this solution is just too simple to work."
"Tony Abbott’s top business adviser, Maurice Newman, has been invited to meet climate scientists following his assertion that the world is in fact in danger of cooling, rather than warming. Newman used an opinion piece in the Australian newspaper on Thursday to say the world was “ill prepared” for a period of global cooling, accusing governments of being hostage to “warming propaganda” from climate scientists.  On Friday Tim Flannery, head of the Climate Council, told Guardian Australia he was keen for Newman to meet him and other scientists. “I’d be happy to meet with him to explain the facts, we’ve made the offer and we await with baited breath,” he said. “But there are deeper issues to this. Maurice Newman is a business adviser to the prime minister; you’d expect him to be representing the interests of the business community. “But what he’s saying fundamentally misrepresents the interests of business, which faces a huge risk, along with the rest of us, from climate change. He’s using his position for a personal crusade in what, I think, is a serious dereliction of duty.” Newman, who does not have a scientific background, has written a number of articles on climate change, as well as appearing on the ABC to discuss the topic, since his appointment as chairman of the prime minister’s business advisory council. He has said that Australia has become “hostage to climate-change madness” and has also attacked the renewable energy industry. Climate scientists have roundly rejected Newman’s theory that a drop in solar activity will see the world dramatically cool, pointing out that the influence of warming greenhouse gases is far greater than solar cycles. Flannery said: “[Newman] is just demonstrably wrong. This is a fundamental problem for the prime minister, who needs to make him do his job. Anyone would be deeply embarrassed by this kind of performance. I have no idea where this idea of global cooling has come from.” Gerry Hueston, former head of BP Australasia and member of the Climate Council, said: “Newman holds views that are out of step with those held by serious energy businesses globally and mainstream business in general. “His views are scientifically wrong and completely ignore the economic and business risks that climate change presents. It is worrying that he is providing this sort of ill-informed advice on energy policy and climate risk to the highest levels of government.” On Thursday, Labor called Newman’s comments “terrifying”, while Greens deputy leader Adam Bandt called on Abbott to fire Newman. The prime minister’s office has yet to respond to questions put to it by Guardian Australia on Newman’s repeated pronouncements on climate change. A spokeswoman for Newman said he was not aware of an invitation to meet Flannery or other scientists. According to the IPCC, the world has warmed by about 1C over the past century and will warm further, by up to 4.8C, by 2100, based largely on the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere."
"Although the global climate has continued to build up heat at an incredibly rapid rate, there has been a keen focus among climate contrarians and in the media on the slowdown of the warming at the Earth’s surface. The slowdown is in fact a double cherry pick – it focuses only on the 2% of global warming that heats the atmosphere (over 90% heats the oceans), and it only considers the past 10–15 years. Nevertheless, because there was so much attention paid to the surface warming slowdown, the latest IPCC report addressed it specifically, saying, The long-term climate model simulations show a trend in global-mean surface temperature from 1951 to 2012 that agrees with the observed trend (very high confidence). There are, however, differences between simulated and observed trends over periods as short as 10 to 15 years (e.g., 1998 to 2012).  From 1998 through 2012, the Met Office estimated that global surface temperatures had warmed by about 0.06°C, whereas the average climate model projection put the value at closer to 0.3°C. This apparent discrepancy only represented a tiny fraction of overall global warming, and over a short enough period of time that the internal noise of the climate system could be having a significant influence, but it was nevertheless a challenge for climate scientists to explain the precise causes of the difference.  However, research published since the release of the IPCC report has gone a long way to explain the discrepancy, and it turns out the climate models are doing a pretty good job after all. One important paper published late last year by Kevin Cowtan and Robert Way found that the discrepancy wasn’t nearly as large as believed. Climate scientists have known that the surface temperature record is incomplete because of gaps between instrument stations, especially in the Arctic. The Arctic happens to be the fastest-warming region on Earth, and so if it’s excluded from the surface temperature record, the record will have a cool bias. Cowtan & Way took two separate clever approaches to address this issue, using statistics and satellite measurements to fill in the gaps. Both methods yielded similar results, showing that the Met Office estimates were accurate up to 1998, but underestimated the warming since 1998 by more than half, due in large part to the particularly rapid warming in the Arctic during that time.  The Cowtan & Way estimates put the global surface warming from 1998 through 2012 at about 0.17°C, explaining nearly half of the apparent difference between measurements and the average climate model projections. But the other half still needed to be explained. A great many studies published over the past two years have shown that since 1998, more heat has been funneled into the deep oceans, leaving less to warm the atmosphere. Kevin Trenberth and colleagues produced one of the best data sets measuring ocean temperatures, finding an unprecedented warming of the deep oceans since 1998. A new paper shows that while oceans around the world are warming, most of the deep layer warming is happening in the Atlantic and Southern oceans.  A recent study led by Matthew England showed that unprecedented trade wind strength has invigorated the circulation of the Pacific Ocean, causing more heat from the surface to be mixed down into deeper ocean layers, while bringing cooler waters to the surface. Papers by Kosaka & Xie and James Risbey and colleagues showed that when climate models accurately reflect ocean cycles, their global surface temperature simulations are also accurate. At the same time, solar activity has declined and volcanic activity risen since 1998. Volcanoes pump aerosol particulates into the atmosphere that cause short-term cooling, and a decline in the amount of solar energy reaching the Earth’s surface also has a cooling effect. Another recent paper led by NASA climate modeler Gavin Schmidt showed that when incorporating the observed changes in these two factors and the Cowtan & Way corrections, climate models did a good job reproducing the observed global surface warming. With these internal (ocean cycle) and external (solar and volcanic activity) explanations, we were still left with the question – how much was each responsible for the global surface warming slowdown? A new paper published by Huber & Knutti (good explanation here) has found that from 1998 to 2012, ocean cycles caused about 0.06°C global surface cooling, the sun caused 0.04°C, and volcanoes caused 0.035°C cooling. Putting it all together, we have 0.17°C observed surface warming according to Cowtan & Way, and 0.13°C cooling from natural influences. If those natural factors hadn’t caused cooling since 1998, we would have seen 0.3°C global surface warming, right in line with climate model projections. The figure below from the Huber & Knutti paper illustrates the point nicely. The dotted orange and solid black lines show the unadjusted average model projection and measured global surface temperatures, respectively. The solid orange and dashed black lines show these estimates adjusted to reflect the changes in ocean cycles, solar output, volcanic activity, and surface temperature measurement biases. Huber & Knutti show that when climate models account for these short-term natural changes, their temperature projections are right on the money.  The bad news is that we can’t yet predict changes in ocean cycles, solar output, or volcanic activity accurately, so it’s going to be hard to improve short-term climate model projections. The good news is that these factors make little difference in long-term climate changes or predictions. Solar and volcanic activity tend to be relatively stable, and will barely make a dent in human-caused global warming. Positive and negative phases of ocean cycles cancel each other out over the long-term. Long-term global warming is dictated by the Earth’s climate sensitivity. Huber & Knutti showed that the average climate model output (with an average climate sensitivity of about 3°C global surface warming at equilibrium from a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide) produces accurate global temperature predictions.  They also tweaked the sensitivity of a climate model of intermediate complexity, and again showed when the aforementioned internal and external factors are accounted for, models with an equilibrium climate sensitivity of 3°C do the best job reproducing global surface temperature changes. When tweaked to have equilibrium climate sensitivities of 2°C and 4°C, the model surface temperature simulations were significantly less accurate. All of the available evidence indicates that the global surface warming slowdown is temporary, and will only last as long as solar activity keeps falling, volcanic emissions keep rising, and until ocean cycles switch phases.  It’s only a matter of time until global surface warming once again accelerates. And until we get our carbon pollution under control, we’ll remain on a path towards highly dangerous and costly climate changes."

"New coal power stations designed to burn Europe’s massive deposits of lignite pose a serious threat to the continent’s decarbonisation efforts, according to figures released on Wednesday. Analysts from Greenpeace’s Energydesk compiled data from the German government that shows burning Europe’s reserves of lignite would wipe out the EU’s entire carbon budget from 2020 until the end of the century. Lignite – also known as brown coal – power stations currently make up more than 10% of the EU’s total CO2 emissions. Greenpeace said that if Europe is to continue to play its part in keeping the world within the internationally accepted limit of 2C of warming, 90% of the carbon contained in its lignite reserves must remain buried. Despite this, lignite-fuelled power stations are still being built, locking in consumption of the fuel for decades. There are 19 such facilities in various stages of approval, planning or construction in Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Greece, Germany, Poland, Romania and Slovenia. Greenpeace figures show these new projects alone would emit almost 120m tonnes of CO2 every year – equivalent to three-quarters of the annual carbon output of the UK’s energy sector. The average lifespan for a coal power station is about 40 years, meaning the plants could release nearly 5bn tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere. Greenpeace energy analyst Jimmy Aldridge said: “The expansion of lignite mining in Europe is today the most serious symptom of the continent’s chronic addiction to dangerous fossil fuels, and a massive threat to its efforts to tackle climate change. The companies involved will continue for as long as they can – we need our political leaders to act in order to stop this situation from getting worse. [Barack] Obama has taken decisive action against coal in the US, it’s time European leaders did the same.” But Max Grünig, an energy sector economist at the Ecologic Institute in Germany, said the continued burning of lignite did not represent an immediate threat to carbon targets. “The total cap for the EU emissions trading scheme is decreasing and ensures that the energy sector is on track to meet the climate targets. If there are more coal power plants, they will have to compensate by buying emissions allowances from other sectors, but net emissions of CO2 cannot increase.” Grünig said the strategic reliance on lignite in politically powerful Poland and Germany had made these countries resistant to more ambitious emissions targets. Poland was especially belligerent during the process of creating the 2030 emissions target of a 40% reduction by 2030. “Poland is in the sad position to depend mostly (above 90%) on coal and has therefore very high costs associated with stricter emissions targets. Thus, they have to resist proposals for stricter targets in their own financial interest. It’s a trap,” he said. On Saturday, 7,500 Greenpeace protesters created a human chain across the German-Polish border. The symbolic gesture linked two villages earmarked for destruction to make room for the planned expansion of an open cut lignite mine. On the German side of the border in Lusatia, Sweden’s state energy company Vattenfall operates mines and power stations that emit as much CO2 as the whole of Sweden, according to Greenpeace figures. The company is looking to expand its mining operations at three of its existing sites. Greenpeace claims Vattenfall also has two entirely new mines in the planning process as well as a new power station. Vattenfall says there are no new mines being planned. But a spokesperson for Vattenfall said new power infrastructure was dependent on the approval of expanded mining operations. “As long as the extension of Jänschwalde opencast mine will be agreed by the states government of Brandenburg, in a midterm there will be needed a newly built power plant in Jänschwalde.” Lignite is an increasingly important part of the world’s energy supply. Consumption in Europe has remained stable since the late 1990s, but grew slightly over the past few years on the back of high gas prices and the scaling back of nuclear power in Germany. In Poland, lignite burning increased 3.7% in 2012, a year when power demand was actually falling. A recent analysis by Standard and Poor’s found that 50-60% of the world’s coal reserves were low-quality, high-emitting coals such as lignite."
"The fantastic Showtime series, (and recent Emmy-winning Years of Living Dangerously) goes on sale tomorrow as a DVD. As I watch the shows, it is clear my earlier reporting on the strength of this project was understated. Many people have seen the first episode, which was available online. That was just a glimpse of what was to come. Here, I review the second episode which juxtaposed fires in two very different parts of the planet.   It begins with actor and former Republican Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger. He travels through California which is suffering from combined droughts and wildfires which threaten biological systems and human society. Persistent lack of snow and rainfall and rising temperatures are altering western fires. The trends are not just described in scientific literature, although you can read about them here for instance. The trends are also being seen on the ground, by people who know fire. Mr. Schwarzenegger travels with these fire-fighting “hot shots” as they brave fire and “widow-makers” (falling debris) to protect homes, property, and lives. These young parents, husbands, and sons take dangers in stride even as the country mourns 19 of their colleagues killed in the line of duty.  While the extent of fires varies a lot year-to-year, the destruction of fires has increased on average, and year-to-date statistics are regularly updated. But mingled with these personal stories is real science. We learn that warming along the Pacific Coast of North America has pushed fire regions further north into Canada. The effect on Canada is enormous with record burns being set in British Columbia and elsewhere.  What was perhaps the most impactful scene was Arnold talking and joking with the guys – it reminded me of camping trips I take with my family. Only in the show, there was a dangerous specter in the back of my mind as I thought about what they would face tomorrow on the slopes and all that they had to go home to, families, kids, weddings, and futures. We also learn that pine beetles are an even bigger threat than fire. Made more prevalent because of the mild winters, they are attacking and destroying otherwise healthy forests. Out in California it is a perfect storm. Increased temperatures, lower humidity and rain, a collision of wildfires, humans, expanding cities, and invasive species… the cost of tree-loss in this part of the planet is something that should concern us all. At that was just half the show. Forest loss in the United States is mirrored by purposeful fires in Indonesia. In Borneo, we find Harrison Ford investigating deforestation to clear lands for cash crops (mainly for palm oil). Harrison Ford visits an animal refuge where saved orangutans cling to Harrison like a lost father. As we learn that the parents of the young orangutans have been killed, the symbolism becomes more poignant. But Harrison’s quest continues into the deep intersection of politics, corruption, economics, and back-room deals. He introduces us to local officials with the will but not the authority to make changes and stop the fires. As any great investigator, Harrison Ford keeps searching, keeps knocking on doors, until he gets to the real decision makers. He meets with the Forestry Minister where we learn that 80% of forest-lands have been commercially exploited. The meeting with the minister is painful to watch, like a slow motion crash with dodges, ducks, and dekes as Ford’s questions are greeted with half answers. Next, Ford meets with the President under the bright lights of cameras and public attention. After that encounter, real action happens – real changes are made. We are left hoping that these positive changes to preserve the forests will be maintained after attentions are turned elsewhere. Real solutions to stopping slash-and-burn policies in Indonesia can turn this laggard into a world leader – a paradigm for the rest of the world.  Finally, Ford returns to the United States to follow the trail of palm oil into commercial markets. He meets with leaders of Unilever, a major palm oil user. There, we learn that Unilever has plans to improve its already strong standards of tracing its palm oil sources. After Harrison Ford asks the obvious question, “How do we know you are sincere?”, new plans were announced confirming their sustainability commitments. Finally, I was surprised to learn what a critical role Greenpeace had in enacting changes both in Indonesia and in the United States. So often we hear about environmental groups and we wonder what impact they really make. Well for Greenpeace, the verdict is in – confirmed by multiple independent sources. It empowers people from around the world. Sure, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Harrison Ford can travel to the front lines fighting forest fires, meet with the President of Indonesia, and bring attention to critical subjects. But so can the rest of us. We can all make an impact and this episode shows us just how impactful actions are – real change can happen."

"“Seeing is believing”, it is often said, so I want world leaders to see for themselves what our islands are doing to deal with climate change, natural disasters and the tough economic challenges thrust upon us. Samoa will host the third international conference on small island developing states (Sids) from 1 September, and I want leaders from the 193 nations attending to rise above rhetoric and grandstanding, and move closer to binding international agreements on climate change. We understand the concerns of industrialised countries about economic growth and greenhouse gas emissions, but if we don’t act now it will be too late for many of our small islands that are already being inundated by rising sea levels. The international community has to understand that in an increasingly interrelated world, critical problems recognise no borders and ride roughshod over sovereignty.  Sids such as mine have come together, not as part of some glorified talking shop, but to review the progress we have made and to come up with solutions and reach agreement on what more needs to be done to meet the most pressing global challenges of our time. The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, who supports the need for action for small, vulnerable nations like ours, will join us in Samoa. When he visited one of our neighbours, Kiribati, in 2011 he recalled meeting a young boy who told him that he was afraid to go to bed at night for fear of being inundated by sea water. That was brought home to the secretary general further by the fact that there was a life-jacket in his room. He later learned that the government had bought land in Fiji in case the entire population needed to be relocated if predictions that the sea will rise by one metre by the end of the century prove accurate. I hope that agreement reached in Samoa will impact directly on the secretary general’s climate change summit in New York on 23 September. Countries like mine have played second fiddle to the agenda of the large powers in the world. In Samoa and in New York, our experience as the “canaries in the coalmine” must finally be understood by the international community and acted on. We come together not to plead for aid but to forge genuine partnerships to fill the void of declining official assistance. Partnerships should not be held hostage to the north-south ideological divide. We want the rest of the world to understand that our problems are shared problems. These partnerships are practical and they ensure our countries are better prepared for climate disasters such as hurricanes, volcanoes and earthquakes as well as the critically important task of protecting the oceans and bio-diversity. While we in sea-locked nations represent a small physical land mass and population, our surroundings – the oceans – cover three-quarters of the planet. Oceans are the world’s most important shared resource connecting and feeding people, while acting as a vast ecosystem regulating climate and weather. They are a key driving force in the global economy. The seas bring us together, not simply in terms of the bad news that is the global rise in sea level, but as an asset whose sustainable development binds us together and can contribute to our collective wealth as nations. Our isolation from industrial centres has hindered our development in the past, but we are turning this to our advantage through responsible tourism for discerning tourists who value unspoilt and distant islands. Tourism is now the leading income earner for the majority of oceanic states. The theme song for the Samoa summit is “There is hope”, but for our islands to realise this hope we need solutions to our challenges and the means to implement them. We also need meaningful, deliverable targets. We think we are getting there – and should anyone have any doubts about how serious I am, I would gently remind them that I know a thing or two about targets since I won a silver medal in target archery as the first prime minister to represent my country at the South Pacific Games in 2007."
"Many of the planet’s most prized destinations, places considered exquisite and idyllic, where nature seems bountiful and people appear at ease, are under threat. In less than a decade, climate change-induced sea level rise could force thousands of people to migrate from some of the world’s 52 small island developing states (Sids). How Sids respond to threats such as sea level rise, and the degree of support they receive, is indicative of how we, collectively, will adapt to a host of climate change impacts in the coming decades.  When we think of Sids, we may be tempted to imagine small patches of paradise scattered with lightly populated fishing villages, unfettered by the demands of modernity. In fact, almost one in every 100 of us is from a small island developing state. Sids boast a diversity of cultures, natural resources, biodiversity, and indigenous knowledge that makes them mainstays of our planetary ecosystem. From the multi-billion dollar economy of Singapore, to Papua New Guinea, one of the least explored countries in the world where 1,000 cultural groups are thought to exist, to the very remote Niue, which is one of the world’s largest coral islands – each small island developing state is endowed with its own unique attributes. Yet what they increasingly share in common are escalating environmental threats that are further aggravated by economic insecurities. Sea level rise is among the most daunting of these threats, which in some regions is up to four times the global average. According to recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates, if average global temperatures increase by approximately 4C, sea levels could rise as much as one metre by 2100, a scenario that would see nations such as Kiribati, Maldives, Marshall Islands and Tuvalu become uninhabitable, while a large share of the population of many other Sids could be displaced or otherwise. What makes this situation even more grievous is that the climate change threats facing many Sids are by-and-large not of their own making. Their total combined annual carbon dioxide output, although rising, accounts for less than 1% of global emissions. Sids are suffering disproportionately from acts of environmental negligence of which we are collectively guilty. Larger economies, until recently, have managed better than small ones to mask the impacts of exhausting their natural capital and contributing heavily to greenhouse gas emissions, but the consequences of this neglect are catching up with them too. Responses to these threats that apply the business-as-usual economic models that have brought them to the state of economic and environmental vulnerability they are in today will be temporary at best, and catastrophic at worst. That is why Sids are beginning to take the first steps on a blue-green economy transition – a strategy that targets resource efficiency and clean technology, is carbon neutral and socially inclusive, will provide a healthy environment and help conserve resources, while integrating traditional knowledge and giving priority to island community and culture that will build their resilience to the impacts of climate change. But we should not look at climate change threats in isolation from other influenced by human activities, because climate change is in fact exacerbating problems that we have already created, such as desertification, biodiversity loss, and food insecurity. Take the degradation of marine ecosystems as an example. A number of studies show that it is overfishing that currently outweighs all other human impacts on marine ecosystems, including climate change. With Sids accounting for seven out of 10 of the world’s countries most dependent on fish and seafood consumption, reducing emissions alone will not be enough to ensure a sufficient supply of fish in the future. The governments of these small island states are recognising that many policies of the past have left them ill-prepared to respond to the impacts of climate change, and it is this awareness that is motivating them to make sustainable economic growth the cornerstone of their development. The energy sector, where they are leading the switch to renewables, is a prime example of necessity driving innovation and change. On average, Pacific island households spend approximately 20% of their household income on energy, and can often pay up to 400% more per kilowatt-hour of electricity than the United States. As a result, many states are now developing their domestic renewable energy markets. For instance, the small South Pacific island of Tokelau is close to meeting 100% of its energy needs through renewables – even powering generators with locally produced coconut biofuel. And Barbados, already the leading producer of solar water heaters in the Caribbean, is set to save an estimated $283.5m (£171m) through a 29% switch to renewables by 2029. From valuing and managing their natural resources, to putting the right incentives in place to switch to renewable energy, Sids are leading the blue-green economy transition. And next week, at the third international conference on Sids in Samoa, they will reaffirm their commitment to advancing national sustainable development goals in front of a global audience. What they need from the rest of the world is the solidarity, technologies, and resources to act on that commitment on a scale that will radically change their fortunes. It is hoped that the new international climate change agreement currently being negotiated, and which will be adopted at the Paris conference in 2015, might help to relieve some of their economic burden of adapting to the impacts of climate change, while also reducing the severity of the impacts by reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. Supporting Sids on this journey of transition provides an unprecedented opportunity to be part of game-changing socioeconomic solutions that can be applied in broader contexts and bigger economies. We should look upon Sids as microcosms of our larger society, and not stand back and allow them to grapple with a threat for which they are largely inculpable."
"A blue chalk line – heralded as the largest art work ever commissioned in the UK – has begun weaving its way around Bristol's streets to raise awareness of what could happen if global warming goes unchecked. The HighWaterLine project is designed to show which parts of the city are at risk of disappearing under water if sea levels rise and more extreme weather batters the coast of England's west country.  Over the next fortnight, hundreds of residents are expected take to the streets to create the 32-mile line, which aims to show what could be lost. The concept was dreamed up by US artist Eve Mosher, who marked out a similar high water line in New York. Last year, Miami residents also created a 26-mile line highlighting the historic buildings they believe are at risk. Bristol has been chosen as it is regarded as a vulnerable place for flooding because of its proximity to the Bristol Channel, which has the world's second-highest tidal range. Those behind the project accept the line is not precise and does not necessarily represent one huge deluge, but it highlights the areas at risk of flooding. They have used data from the Environment Agency and Bristol city council and have worked with Bristol University's school of geography to try to make sure the artwork is backed by science. The project has been commissioned by art organisation Invisible Dust, which works with artists on environmental issues. Over the last six months it has run workshops and talks about the risks the city faces and what could be done to mitigate them. Isobel Tarr, project manager at Invisible Dust, said: ""It's been wonderful to see people from all parts of the city come together and start conversations about positive solutions to this problem so that Bristol can be a more resilient city in the face of change."" Mosher's original HighWaterLine involved the artist herself marking out a line 10ft (3m) above sea level around the coast of New York City. When subsequently parts of the route were flooded after hurricane Sandy in October 2012, people began to see her work as an innovative way to visualise the future impacts of climate change."
"Chinese president Xi Jinping has decided to skip a meeting of world leaders on climate change in New York, according to climate insiders, casting doubt on the summit’s potential to make progress ahead of next year’s major UN climate summit in Paris. President Xi had been expected to attend the 23 September summit called by the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, but is now set to send another senior Chinese politician in his place, though Beijing officials are yet to confirm this.  The news will be a blow to summit organisers, coming swiftly after the announcement that Indian prime minister Narendra Modi will also miss the meeting. Modi is scheduled to go to New York on 26 September and his decision not to advance his trip by three days to appear at the informal climate summit has created further paralysis among bureaucrats. Most of them do not even know if the environment minister is planning to go instead. In this situation, the statement issued after the recent New Delhi meeting of environment ministers from BASIC (Brazil, South Africa, India and China) countries assumes added significance. The joint statement stuck to the long-held stand of developing nations.Since then, there have been reports in India about alleged attempts by industrialised countries to woo Philippines away from the Like Minded Developing Countries (LMDC) group. Other members of the group include India, China, Cuba, Venezuela, Argentina, Nicaragua and Saudi Arabia. During last year’s UN climate summit in Warsaw, Philippines took a leading position in this group by pressuring industrialised countries to live up to their commitments to mitigate emissions and help poorer nations tackle climate change effects. This position was strengthened because that summit was held in the immediate aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan, which devastated large areas in the Philippines. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon’s informal summit comes as climate negotiations are heating up because a comprehensive global treaty to tackle climate change is expected by the end of 2015. Industrialised countries – led by the US and the European Union – are pressing for all 192 nations to take on legally binding obligations to rein in greenhouse gas emissions. India has so far opposed this strongly. At a negotiating session of the UN’s climate secretariat this June, on behalf of LMDC the Venezuelan delegation submitted a draft of what the global climate deal should contain, a draft that was promptly opposed by negotiators from many industrialised countries. Indian negotiators now say they are waiting to see the draft being prepared by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change secretariat. They want this ready before the next UNFCCC summit – scheduled in Lima this December – so that every government has a year to negotiate before the 2015 deadline. Leaders of climate NGOs that regularly shadow the UNFCCC summits are apprehensive because they have heard the French government is preparing its own secret draft – the 2015 summit will be held in Paris – just the kind of activity that led to a fiasco at the 2009 summit in Copenhagen. Negotiators from most developing countries are keen to see a public draft months before the deadline. The UN Secretary General’s informal summit is being held against this backdrop, with the hope that heads of government will provide some much-needed political impulse to the negotiations.  Led by US President Barack Obama, many heads of industrialised nations are expected at the summit. The absence of China and India at the highest level will take some of the sheen off, but they can possibly come back on board if leaders of industrialised countries make serious commitments about what they are going to do to mitigate emissions and help developing nations. An expert group set up by the UN Secretary General has already given recommendations on how to finance a greener economic path for all countries. The office of the UN Secretary General is bringing business and civil society leaders to meet the heads of state and government at the summit, hoping for announcements of new commitments and practical actions to address climate change. It will be the first time since the Copenhagen summit that a majority of world leaders will get together on the issue. Green NGOs are mobilising to hold street marches in New York and elsewhere to coincide with the summit. Speaking ahead of the summit, Ban Ki-moon said: “Solutions exist and we are already seeing significant changes in government policies and investments in sustainable ways of living and doing business. The race is on, and now is the time for leaders to step up and steer the world towards a safer future.”"
"An expert on climate change policy has called for more action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as it emerged the country saw the warmest period from January to July since records began in 1910.   It was also the third-equal wettest such period for those months, the Met Office confirmed.    So far, not including 2014, seven of the UK’s warmest years on record, and four of the five wettest years on record, have all occurred since 2000.   Bob Ward, policy and communications director of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at LSE, who had analysed the figures which the Met Office confirmed, said: “These figures are further evidence of the impact of climate change on the UK.   “This should increase the urgency of UK politicians to join international efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and take measures to make us more resilient, such as boosting flood defences.”   Met Office spokesman Dan Williams said July was the eighth month in a row which had seen warmer than average temperatures in the UK.   The seven-month period concerned was not one of the Met Office’s “standard reporting periods”, he added, saying: “It doesn’t tell us how 2014 will finish in the record books, we have five months of data to add, and a lot can change.”   Increasing warmth will not be in evidence over the bank holiday weekend, though most places will enjoy some sunshine before the weather deteriorates from Sunday evening onwards, forecasters have said.   There will be a few showers on Saturday, with the heaviest in the east, the Met Office said. Many places will see some sunshine and it will become largely fine and dry from the west.   The good weather should last through much of Sunday, though an area of low pressure moving in from the Atlantic may bring some rain and stronger winds to western areas later in the day.   Conditions for bank holiday Monday look unsettled, with rain and wind affecting many areas, though some parts of eastern England may have a mostly dry day until later.   Chief Meteorologist Martin Young said: “We are expecting a good deal of dry weather this weekend before an area of low pressure moves across the UK by Monday.   “It is likely that Sunday will have the best of the dry and bright weather, with rain and brisk winds affecting many places on Monday.”   Matt Dobson, senior forecaster with MeteoGroup, said: “On Saturday we expect to see sunshine and scattered showers.   “A good place to keep the brolly handy will be across northern England, down to Lincolnshire and Yorkshire in the east, where there could be some thundery downpours.   “Sunday is looking good, but Monday is not - there is a lot of rain to come.   “Anyone hoping to dodge the rain should be in north east England or north and eastern Scotland, they should be quite dry.   “Temperatures are going to be a few degrees below the average for this time of year, and the nights are going to be fairly chilly - on Friday and Saturday night, it could fall to 2 or 3C, that’s six to eight degrees cooler than normal.   “On Monday, though it will be rainy, we should see milder air trying to push through, and by Tuesday, things should be starting to get back to normal temperature-wise, though there will still be some rain about.”   James Berresford, chief executive of tourist organisation VisitEngland, said: “There are 4 million Brits planning a holiday trip in England this weekend, which is testament to the fantastic product on offer in England.   “With an enormous amount going on this weekend at our world class indoor and outdoor attractions and a host of events and festivals happening across the country, there is still time to plan a last-minute short break or day trip in England to enjoy, whatever the weather.”"
"Richard Branson has failed to deliver on his much-vaunted pledge to spend $3bn (£1.8bn) over a decade to develop a low carbon fuel. Seven years into the pledge, Branson has paid out only a small fraction of the promised money – “well under $300m” – according to a new book by the writer and activist, Naomi Klein.  The British entrepreneur famously promised to divert a share of the profits from his Virgin airlines empire to find a cleaner fuel, after a 2006 private meeting with Al Gore. Branson went on to found a $25m Earth prize for a technology that could safely suck 1bn tons of carbon a year from the atmosphere. In 2009, he set up the Carbon War Room, an NGO which works on business solutions for climate change. But by Klein’s estimate, Branson’s “firm commitment” of $3bn failed to materialise. “So the sceptics might be right: Branson’s various climate adventures may indeed prove to have all been a spectacle, a Virgin production, with everyone’s favourite bearded billionaire playing the part of planetary saviour to build his brand, land on late night TV, fend off regulators, and feel good about doing bad,” Klein writes in This Changes Everything, Capitalism vs The Climate. Klein uses Branson and other so-called green billionaires – such as the former New York mayor, Michael Bloomberg – as case studies for her argument that it is unrealistic to rely on business to find solutions to climate change. Branson routed a first pay-out of his $3bn commitment, about $130m, through a new Virgin investment company into corn ethanol. The fuel has now been widely discredited as a greener alternative to fossil fuels, because of its climate change impacts and for driving up the cost of food. Virgin went on to look at other biofuels, at one point exploring a project to develop jet fuel from eucalyptus trees. “But the rest of its investments are a grab bag of vaguely green-hued projects, from water desalination to energy efficient lighting, to an in-car monitoring system to help drivers conserve gas,” Klein writes. By last year, the total of those investments, in corn ethanol and elsewhere, amounted to about $230m, she estimates. Branson made an additional small investment in an algae fuel company, Solazyme. But Branson still puts the total spend at well under $300m – just a tenth of his $3bn pledge. The British entrepreneur has acknowledged that his efforts to mobilise large investments on cleaner fuels have fallen short. However, he told the Observer earlier this year he had lost many millions in failed green investments. “There is no question that Virgin is involved in a number of businesses that emit a lot of carbon, and that is one of the reasons why I have to work particularly hard … but, more importantly, to try to help other people balance their books as well,” he said. “We have invested hundreds of millions in clean technology projects. We haven’t made hundreds of millions profit,” he said. Branson also told the Observer that he felt he had a responsibility to do something for the climate – given that so much of his empire is built on carbon-intensive transport industries. “There is no question that Virgin is involved in a number of businesses that emit a lot of carbon, and that is one of the reasons why I have to work particularly hard … but, more importantly, to try to help other people balance their books as well,” he said."
"Half of North America’s bird species, from common backyard visitors like the Baltimore oriole and the rufous hummingbird to wilderness dwellers like the common loon and bald eagle, are under threat from climate change and many could go extinct, an exhaustive new study has found.  Seven years of research found climate change the biggest threat to North America’s bird species. Some 314 species face dramatic declines in population, if present trends continue, with warming temperatures pushing the birds out of their traditional ranges. Ten states and Washington DC could lose their state birds. “It is hard to imagine that we are not going to lose some of these birds permanently,” said Gary Langham, chief scientist for the Audubon Society and leader of the study. “The scale of disruption we are projecting means that many familiar sounds, and many familiar birds that people may see in their backyards and on their walks, that help them define a place for them, may no longer be there.” The outlook was far bleaker than a US government report just a few years ago on the fate of North America’s birds under climate change. That report, in 2010, projected ocean and Arctic birds would be most vulnerable to climate change.  An updated version of that report is also due out on Tuesday. The Audubon researchers found that by mid-century, 126 of the 588 bird species in the study would lose more than half of their traditional ranges, and would go into decline. An additional 188 species would lose their range by 2080, according to the study. Maryland would lose the Baltimore oriole, the mascot for the baseball team as well as the state bird, which would no longer be able to breed in the mid-Atlantic. Lousiana would lose the brown pelican. Minnesota would lose the common loon, its state bird, which would be unable to survive in the continental United States. Idaho, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Utah, Vermont, and Washington DC would also lose their state birds. The bald eagle, once considered a success story for American conservation, could lose 75% of its range by 2080. Some birds, such as the trumpeter swan, would lose virtually all of their range towards the end of the century, according to the projections. The study found 274 birds would maintain or increase their range under climate change. But Langham said that was not an automatic guarantee for survival. Even if the birds find more room to expand, they could face renewed competition from other species, as well as new predators.  The researchers drew on more than a century of observations from birders as well as a 40-year historical record from the US Geological Survey, combining the data with 17 climate models. The Audubon’s chief executive, David Yarnold, described the findings as a “call to action”. The group is calling for cuts to the carbon emissions that cause climate change, as well as measures to preserve more habitat and give the birds a better chance of survival. But the findings, though grim, may underplay the threat to survival of North America’s birds. Langham said the study did not take into account other factors associated with climate change – such as sea level rise, which can flood marshes and other bird habitat with salt water; drought, which can kill off insects and other food sources, or extreme storms. As a result, it was likely a conservative look at the fate of birds, he said."
"Campaigns don’t need to be an all-dancing, all-singing affair to be a success. Over the last 18 months, over 640,000 people have spoken up as part of Oxfam’s Behind the Brands campaign, asking the 10 biggest food and drink companies to do more to tackle gender inequality, land grabbing and climate change. Many of the brands have listened, proving that consumer power is still a force to reckon with. At the heart of the campaign is a desire to see Associated British Foods, Coca-Cola, Danone, General Mills, Kellogg’s, Mars, Mondelez International, Nestlé, PepsiCo and Unilever, use their power to tackle global sustainability problems. This includes shaping how their suppliers do business and how the industry lobbies governments.  And it’s working. In the last few weeks, after targeted campaigning pressing Kellogg’s and General Mills to do more to tackle climate change, both companies responded by taking bold steps. The headline is a commitment to reducing emissions across the board in their supply chains, making Kellogg’s and General Mills the first of the large food companies to do so. This includes reducing emissions from agriculture, which have gone unchecked until now, despite agriculture being the biggest emitter in supply chains. The targets will use a science-based methodology approved and endorsed by industry and other stakeholders, which is consistent with the goal of keeping global temperature rise below 2C (35.6F). Along with taking these new steps, the industry is beginning to speak louder on climate change. Unilever’s chief executive, Paul Polman, has advocated for more action on climate change for some time, recognising the power the brand’s voice can have. When Unilever took steps to tackle deforestation in palm oil production for example, it also led a group of other stakeholders to encourage others to follow its lead, which was key to ensuring broader action for more impact. As part of its response to Oxfam’s campaign, both General Mills and Kellogg’s are joining the Business for Innovation Climate and Energy Policy (BICEP), a progressive coalition advocating for meaningful climate and energy action by governments. They are also joining companies such as Mars, Unilever and Nestlé, in signing onto BICEP’s Climate Declaration, making it clear to US leaders that they must lead on tackling climate change. With the Ban Ki-moon climate summit on 23 September, the UN climate change talks in Lima and in 2015 in Paris, it’s a good time for food companies and other businesses to demand more ambition from governments to tackle climate change. Their voices will be critical if global decision makers are to understand the cost of inaction on climate change far outweighs the cost of action. The recent movement by food and beverage companies on climate change follows similarly important commitments by the big chocolate manufacturers on gender rights and by Coca-Cola and PepsiCo on land rights. In March 2013, over 100,000 supporters of Oxfam’s Behind the Brands campaign asked Mars, Mondelez and Nestlé to do more to tackle women’s inequality in cocoa production and the companies responded with new commitments and action plans. When over 270,000 people supported Oxfam’s campaign to challenge the brands to ensure suppliers respect the rights of communities over land, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo made commitments on land rights. This triggered others to start taking steps on land rights across the sector; competitors followed suit with similar commitments and suppliers started to take the issue of land rights more seriously. Oxfam’s Behind the Brand campaign isn’t highlighting emotive issues that pull easily at people’s heartstrings. These are complex issues, involving policies on land rights, community consultation processes and the science of agricultural greenhouse gas emissions. The public is being presented with a scorecard of the policies of the big food and drinks companies, based on over 270 indicators cutting across seven themes: women, climate, land, smallholder farmers, water, workers and transparency. But the pleasant surprise is that consumers aren’t turned off by this complexity. Instead more than 640,000 have engaged with Oxfam’s analysis by telling brands to do more. The response to Oxfam’s campaign shows the power of consumers to influence what happens deep inside the supply chains of companies. General Mills and Kellogg’s are committing to drive down greenhouse gas emissions on farms growing the commodities that go into their products. Both companies are disclosing top suppliers in key commodities including palm oil and sugar and will set and disclose supply chain GHG reduction targets, including agriculture. Both have also agreed to participate in the Carbon Disclosure Project, including annual reporting on Scope 3 emissions data and responding to the Forests Information Request. Likewise, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are rolling up their sleeves to pressure suppliers to consult communities before acquiring land. Oxfam will continue to monitor closely how these commitments are implemented but what is clear is that with power comes responsibility and the big food and drinks brands are beginning to grasp just how their power can shape the behaviour of many others to ensure a fairer and more sustainable planet.

"As people’s understanding of climate science grows, among both experts and non-experts alike, we become more accepting of the fact that humans are the driving force behind global warming. That’s because the evidence supporting human-caused global warming is overwhelming; hence rejection of that reality is usually based on an incomplete understanding of the scientific evidence. In Australia, Prime Minister Tony Abbott’s chief business adviser Maurice Newman offered a prime example of global warming denial last week. Writing in The Australian, Newman suggested that we’re headed for a period of global cooling due to declining solar activity and related influences from galactic cosmic rays, calling mainstream climate science “a religion.”   As Graham Readfearn showed in his fact check of The Australian opinion piece, Newman got the science badly wrong in almost every way imaginable. Scientific research has consistently shown that a grand solar minimum would barely make a dent in human-caused global warming, and that galactic cosmic rays do not exert a significant influence on the Earth’s climate. To argue otherwise, Newman relied on selective cherry picking of some research, and a misinterpretation of other studies. Due to his lack of a scientific background, combined with his likely ideological biases, it’s understandable that Newman would get the science wrong on this issue. The problem is that Newman has the ear of Australia’s Prime Minister. Worse yet, the country’s biggest-selling national newspaper printed his error-riddled editorial, misinforming its readership in the process. As a result of this sort of thinking, the Australian government recently revoked its carbon tax without a replacement plan to meet its carbon pollution reduction targets. The United States has been moving in the opposite direction, with the EPA drafting rules to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from power plants as the centerpiece of a larger climate action plan. Some candidates are even beginning to make climate change a central focus of their campaigns. Many in the Republican Party have criticized the Obama Administration for enforcing the law (specifically the Clean Air Act) with these regulations, but all they need do is vote to pass a small government, free market, economy-growing alternative solution to replace them. However, many Republican politicians are currently frozen with fear on the subject of global warming. Specifically, fear of the Tea Party.  In stark contrast to their party’s public stance on Capitol Hill, many Republicans privately acknowledge the scientific consensus that human activity is at least partially responsible for climate change and recognize the need to address the problem ... In Bloomberg BNA interviews with several dozen former senior congressional aides, nongovernmental organizations, lobbyists and others conducted over a period of several months, the sources cited fears of attracting an electoral primary challenger as one of the main reasons many Republicans choose not to speak out. The subject of global warming is less politicized for America’s neighbors to the north, but their leadership seems not to have the least interest in doing anything about it. To the contrary, the Canadian government appears determined to exploit the Alberta tar sands to the fullest extent possible.  However, continuing to expand tar sands production will make it impossible for Canada to meet its promised carbon pollution cuts. The Harper government seems satisfied to pay lip service to the critical issue of climate change whilst muzzling its climate scientists and maximizing its dirty fossil fuel production. In the UK, Prime Minister David Cameron’s recently-sacked environment secretary Owen Paterson has since bragged about fighting against environmental groups, writing, Like the nationalised industries and obstructive trade unions of the 1970s, the Green Blob has become a powerful self-serving caucus; it is the job of the elected politician to stand up to them. We must have the courage to tackle it head on, as Tony Abbott in Australia and Stephen Harper in Canada have done, Paterson will now give the annual lecture at the anti-climate policy advocacy group, the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF). Like Maurice Newman, the GWPF has a tendency to cherry pick its preferred climate science research. Last year’s GWPF lecture was delivered by former Australian Prime Minister John Howard, who described advocates of tackling climate change as “alarmists” and “zealots.” Under Paterson, the money spent on preparing the UK for the impacts of global warming was almost halved, and he has suggested that we can simply adapt to the consequences of climate change.  There is a pattern among these examples of politicians rejecting the full body of available scientific evidence and the consensus among climate experts – each is in an English-speaking country. The UK-based market research firm Ipsos MORI recently conducted an international survey asking respondents if they agreed with the statement, “The climate change we are currently seeing is largely the result of human activity.”  Rejection of human-caused global warming was most prevalent in the USA, UK, and Australia, with Canada not far behind in 7th. These four countries also share the commonality of highly influential fossil fuel industries, and the wide reach of the Murdoch media empire, known for its global warming denial. The rejection of inconvenient scientific evidence also originates from conservative political parties in each country. That needn’t be the case; as Barry Bickmore recently wrote, real conservatives are conservationists who value evidence. Meanwhile, these countries are also being battered more frequently by extreme weather. Australia and the western North America have been hit by heat waves and harsh droughts, while cold winter temperatures have chilled the UK and central and eastern USA, and Canada has joined those regions in being flooded by intense deluges. A new study has found that “blocking patterns,” where hot or wet weather remains stuck over a region for weeks causing heat waves or floods, are becoming more frequent, potentially as a result of human-caused global warming. Recent research has also found that global warming will intensify droughts. Global warming denial remains a tenable position for politicians in English-speaking countries because voters in those regions don’t yet view the issue as urgent or a high priority, in large part due to the false balance in media coverage of the subject. However, as people continue to directly experience more intense and frequent extreme weather events, this will inevitably change.  We’re in the midst of a critically important race. Will the political climate in these countries change quickly enough for them to take action to prevent the most damaging global climate changes?"
"Climate scepticism is still rife among the Tory parliamentary party, according to a new poll of MPs.  More than twice as many Conservative MPs as Labour MPs who responded to the poll cast doubt on scientists having “conclusively proved” climate change is caused by humans, despite the world’s most authoritative panel of climate scientists last year saying they were 95% confident that recent global warming is manmade. The news came as Downing Street confirmed that David Cameron would be attending a crucial UN climate summit in New York later this month. Green groups welcomed the news that the prime minister will join other heads of state at a New York meeting hosted by UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, to discuss bolstering international efforts to reach a deal on climate change before a deadline of December 2015. But in the Populus poll of 119 of parliament’s 650 MPs for trade magazine PRWeek, including 57 Tories and 51 Labour MPs, only 17 Tories agreed that it was a scientific fact that climate change is largely caused by humans, compared to 34 Labour politicians.  Thirty Conservatives agreed “there is a widespread theory that climate change is largely man-made but this has not yet been conclusively proved”, and another 10 agreed that “man-made climate change is environmentalist propaganda for which there is little or no real evidence.” For Labour, 12 MPs agreed with the former statement, and just one with the latter. Amber Rudd, a Tory MP appointed energy minister in Cameron’s July reshuffle, defended the party’s stance on climate change science, telling the magazine: “Man-made climate change is one of the most serious threats that we face. In 1988 Margaret Thatcher, a scientist herself, put climate change firmly on the political agenda in her speech to the Royal Society when she said: ‘It’s we Conservatives who are not merely friends of the Earth — we are its guardians and trustees for generations to come. No generation has a freehold on this Earth. All we have is a life tenancy — with a full repairing lease. This government intends to meet the terms of that lease in full.’” Michael Howard, the former Conservative party leader and a member of the advisory board for the non-profit Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, welcomed the news that Cameron would attend the New York meeting: “The prime minister is to be commended for continuing a long tradition of Conservative Party leadership on climate change.” Ruth Davis, Greenpeace UK’s political director, said: “This summit is a vital opportunity to inject fresh momentum into global negotiations ahead of a crunch year for action on climate change, so it’s encouraging to see David Cameron is making a priority of it.  “But if Britain wants to reclaim its leadership role on climate, the prime minister needs to put his own house in order first. This means scrapping subsidies for coal plants and setting out a clear plan to phase out coal burning by the early 2020s.” Owen Paterson, who was sacked as environment secretary in the same reshuffle, has emerged as one of the Tory party’s most outspoken climate sceptics, previously saying “we should just accept that the climate has been changing for centuries”. Cameron and Labour leader, Ed Miliband, clashed over the issue of climate scepticism in Conservative party ranks in the aftermath of the floods that hit England and Wales in the wettest winter for 250 years."
"Napa Valley grower Eckhard Kaesekamp is very pleased with a certain group of around 20,000 grapevines he has been nurturing. Their yield has been 5% better than what he’d expected. Their root mass is greater than his other vines as well – which means they’ll hold water better. In drought-hit California, that’s gold.  Kaesekamp, whose Knights Grapevine Nursery supplies vines and rootstocks to the region’s wineries, believes these vines did especially well thanks to a soil treatment called CoolTerra – a product made from a carbon-rich substance called “biochar” that is supposed to improve soil fertility and increase water and nutrient retention.   Cool Planet Energy Systems – the startup company that manufactures CoolTerra – formed to produce a biofuel replacement for gasoline. The master plan was and remains to use wood chips, corn stover and non-food crops as the feedstocks for this fuel. The firm always intended to have a side venture in selling the byproducts as biochar. But right now, the business is all about CoolTerra – which is bringing in modest amounts of revenue. The textbook definition of biochar is a solid material resulting from the carbonization – the elimination of water and volatile chemicals – from plant matter.  Inspired by the fertility of the biochar-rich Amazonian soil called terra preta, enthusiasm for biochar soil and water additives has grown in recent years. Biochar is said to enhance soil quality by increasing its microbe content – improving yields while requiring less water and fertilizer. In water, it acts like a filtration agent. And biochar is potentially a tool to fight climate change because it can sequester and hold carbon in the soil for a long time.  When asked for its assessment of biochar’s market potential, Cool Planet responded: “Biochar-based soil enhancement is a nascent market” concentrated in the food and energy sectors. “We believe the potential global market for CoolTerra could be measured in millions of tons annually.”  Authoritative information about the biochar industry is scarce, with attempts to quantify the market varying widely. Tom Miles, a biomass energy consultant and coordinator of the Pacific Northwest Biochar Working Group, thinks that the US alone produces around 5,000 tons in a year. But the International Biochar Initiative, a trade and advocacy group for the nascent industry, estimates that 827 tons of biochar were produced globally in 2013.  According to a business research firm called  Transparency Market Research, biochar generated $229m in revenues on production of 100,000 tons globally in 2013, and will grow to $572m in revenue on about 300,000 tons of production by 2020. IBI considers these 2013 estimates inflated, but admits that its own assessment could be way off. It is working on its own state-of-the-industry report. No one seems to disagree that the biochar business is poised for rapid expansion, however. “It’s only in the last 10 years that biochar has taken off as an industry on it’s own,” says Sanjai Parikh, an assistant professor of soil chemistry at the University of California at Davis. “It’s very popular and is growing quickly.” Given the sprouting of biochar businesses, the IBI two years ago established industry standards and a certification process. The first product it certified as safe to use was CoolTerra. It’s still an open question what the long-term effects of current biochar products will be on soil or plants.  “The main problem with biochar is that every biochar every person creates is different,” Parikh says. But regardless of how it’s made, he says: “it’s not a fantasy soil. It’s part of a solution that works in certain situations”. According to Milton E McGiffen Jr, an agronomist and plant physiologist at the University of California at Riverside, CoolTerra stands out from other biochar products because its composition is consistent from one batch to the next. In his department, six faculty members and 15 students use CoolTerra in most of their work involving biochar. Parikh maintains a healthy skepticism, however. Regarding CoolTerra, “from my point of view, as an academic, we need to know how they make [their biochar]”, Parikh says. “Apparently, they have some catalyst and claim it’s a different product.”  On the strength of its biofuel business plan rather than its biochar side business, Cool Planet – which has offices in Greenwood Village, Colorado and Camarillo, California – has raised around $150m from corporations and venture capital investors including Exelon, BP, Google Ventures, General Electric, North Bridge Venture Partners, Shea Ventures and Concord Energy.   “We look for companies that are disruptive technologies and potentially complement or add to our portfolio of existing businesses,” says Mike Smith, head of Constellation Technology Ventures, the investing arm of Exelon. And they do need to fit in with Exelon’s sustainability goals, he adds. “Carbon-negative bio-gasoline is consistent with that mantra.” Exelon plans to be an early customer for Cool Planet’s biofuel, Smith says.    But Cool Planet isn’t making fuel yet and so isn’t producing biochar from scratch. Rick Wilson, a company vice president, says the company currently buys raw biochar from the market and then prepares it with a proprietary process. “A year from now, we will have partnerships with the soil amendment companies in Home Depot and the biggest seed companies in the world,” says Wilson, who declined to share names.  For now, the company is distributing CoolTerra to a small but diverse group of potential customers. One of these, a California firm called Organic Waste Solutions, plans to buy and use the product in three pilot programs to treat wastewater and storm water runoff in Southern California. CoolTerra won over Kasekamp with the results he has observed in his wine grapes. Bill Camarillo, chief executive of California-based soil company Agromin, is also convinced. In four years of researching biochar, he says, he hasn’t found anyone else who “has invested time, energy, and money to use technology that can enhance biochar, no matter who makes it”.  Camarillo has been testing CoolTerra as a composting additive to determine if it can speed up decomposition of organic matter, reduce odors from the process and help release nutrients locked up in the compost for use by plants. “The tests have come back positive in all three uses,” he says.  BioChar’s $0.50 per pound (0.45 kg) price is a challenge when the chemical equivalent goes for about $0.12 less by weight. Still Camarillo has agreed to distribute CoolTerra alongside Agromin’s own soil products. His target market: the 23m productive acres spread across California.  Despite the growing interest in its biochar, Cool Planet’s overall goals remain centered on bio-gasoline.  CEO Howard Janzen, who has grown the startup from 40 employees to 110 in the past two years, says that an emphasis on micro-production will set Cool Planet apart from others in the biofuel industry. The company intends to build hundreds of small plants in the US – and thousands overseas – as opposed to one large refinery, he says. This will allow the company to locate plants near their feedstocks, cutting shipping costs for raw materials. According to Janzen, Cool Planet has committed to building and operating three biofuel plants in Louisiana. The first – a facility that will cost between $50m and $60m and have the initial capacity to produce more than 1m gallons per year – broke ground earlier this year in Alexandria. The company expects it to begin operating in late 2015 or early 2016. While its business model today is based on biofuels, concern about negative impacts of commercial fertilizers is growing along with interest in greener alternatives. So if it can find a way to increase volumes and cut its prices, Cool Planet could soon see a growing business in biochar.

"The Abbott government’s chief business adviser, Maurice Newman, has warned that Australia is ill prepared for global cooling owing to widespread “warming propaganda” in his latest critique of mainstream climate science.  Newman, who chairs the prime minister’s Business Advisory Council, said there is evidence that the world is set for a period of cooling, rather than warming, leading to significant geopolitical problems because of a lack of preparedness.  Adam Bandt, deputy leader of the Greens, said Newman’s comments were an “embarrassment to the government”. “Tony Abbott needs to repudiate these views and dump Mr Newman from his Business Advisory Council,” Bandt said. “Someone with these flat-earth views has no place helping set policy for 21st century Australia.” Mark Butler, Labor’s environment spokesman, said of Newman’s article: “These kinds of comments would be laughable if he didn’t have the prime minister’s ear. “As it is, it’s terrifying that Maurice Newman continues to advise the prime minister at the same time as he campaigns against clean energy for Australians, and peddles myths unsupported by any credible scientist in the world.” In an opinion piece for the Australian, the latest in a number of articles for the newspaper on climate change, Newman says: “What if the warmth the world has enjoyed for the past 50 years is the result of solar activity, not man-made CO2? “The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and its acolytes pay scant attention to any science, however strong the empirical evidence, that may relegate human causes to a lesser status.” Newman says money spent on studying climate change has been “to largely preordain scientific conclusions”. Governments “like primitive civilisations offering up sacrifices to appease the gods” have used the “biased research to pursue gesture politics”. The former ABC chairman says this has caused “serious damage on economies and diminished the west’s standing and effectiveness in world affairs”. Newman claims scientists have discovered a rapid drop in solar activity, with a “global warming pause” having occurred in the past 18 years. “But the political establishment is deaf to this,” he says. “Having put all our eggs in one basket and having made science a religion, it bravely persists with its global warming narrative, ignoring at its peril and ours, the clear warnings being given by mother nature. “If the world does indeed move into a cooling period, its citizens are ill-prepared.” Newman, who has no scientific background, has waged repeated assaults on mainstream climate science over the past year, claiming that Australia has become “hostage to climate change madness” and dismissing the overwhelming evidence of warming caused by carbon emissions. He has also railed against investments into renewable energy. Climate scientists told Guardian Australia that Newman was misguided and “arrogant” for dismissing well-established evidence of warming in favour of a theory of global cooling. “There’s nothing credible to what he says, I can’t believe this stuff about cosmic rays is being raised again after it has been discredited so often,” said Professor Matthew England, whose work shows how strong Pacific winds are pushing surface heat underwater, contributing to the slowdown, or “pause”, in the global temperature rise. “The amount of greenhouses gases we are pumping into the atmosphere means that the solar minimum is just a blip in the next few decades,” he said. “The idea that solar cycles can override climate change driven by greenhouse gases is fanciful. “Saying we aren’t prepared for global cooling is like saying we aren’t prepared for an alien invasion. There is no credible scientist saying this is on the horizon.  “It’s completely weird to be calling for investment into something that’s completely unfounded and I think he’s arrogant to think he knows the answer to climate physics when he hasn’t studied it.” Professor Steve Sherwood said he wasn’t sure how to respond to Newman, given the number of errors in his article. “The sun doesn’t have as much influence on the climate as we previously thought, the latest estimates are that it explains only 5% of the warming over the last 150 years,” he said. “We have been in a solar minimum and no one really knows what the sun will do next. I don’t think anyone is saying that the sun will compete with greenhouses gases when it comes to warming the planet. “What he says may be entertaining but it’s also scary because it’s so out there. It’s so prominent that it’s concerning.” Despite the warming “pause” that Newman has repeatedly referred to, 13 of the 14 warmest years on record occurred in the 21st century. 2001 to 2010 was the warmest decade on record, while each of the past three decades has been warmer than the previous one. According to the IPCC, the world has warmed by about 1C over the past century and will get even warmer – by between 0.3C and 4.8C – by 2100, based largely on the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere."
"I denied climate change for longer than I care to admit. I knew it was happening, sure. But I stayed pretty hazy on the details and only skimmed most news stories. I told myself the science was too complicated and the environmentalists were dealing with it. And I continued to behave as if there was nothing wrong with the shiny card in my wallet attesting to my ""elite"" frequent-flyer status. A great many of us engage in this kind of denial. We look for a split second and then we look away. Or maybe we do really look, but then we forget. We engage in this odd form of on-again-off-again ecological amnesia for perfectly rational reasons. We deny because we fear that letting in the full reality of this crisis will change everything. And we are right. If we continue on our current path of allowing emissions to rise year after year, major cities will drown, ancient cultures will be swallowed by the seas; our children will spend much of their lives fleeing and recovering from vicious storms and extreme droughts. Yet we continue all the same. What is wrong with us? I think the answer is far more simple than many have led us to believe: we have not done the things needed to cut emissions because those things fundamentally conflict with deregulated capitalism, the reigning ideology for the entire period we have struggled to find a way out of this crisis. We are stuck, because the actions that would give us the best chance of averting catastrophe – and benefit the vast majority – are threatening to an elite minority with a stranglehold over our economy, political process and media. That problem might not have been insurmountable had it presented itself at another point in our history. But it is our collective misfortune that governments and scientists began talking seriously about radical cuts to greenhouse gas emissions in 1988 – the exact year that marked the dawning of ""globalisation"". The numbers are striking: in the 1990s, as the market integration project ramped up, global emissions were going up an average of 1% a year; by the 2000s, with ""emerging markets"" such as China fully integrated into the world economy, emissions growth had sped up disastrously, reaching 3.4% a year. That rapid growth rate has continued, interrupted only briefly, in 2009, by the world financial crisis. What the climate needs now is a contraction in humanity's use of resources; what our economic model demands is unfettered expansion. Only one of these sets of rules can be changed, and it's not the laws of nature. What gets me most are not the scary studies about melting glaciers, the ones I used to avoid. It's the books I read to my two-year-old. Looking For A Moose is one of his favourites. It's about a bunch of kids who really want to see a moose. They search high and low – through a forest, a swamp, in brambly bushes and up a mountain. (The joke is that there are moose hiding on each page.) In the end, the animals all come out and the ecstatic kids proclaim: ""We've never ever seen so many moose!"" On about the 75th reading, it suddenly hit me: he might never see a moose. I went to my computer and began to write about my time in northern Alberta, Canadian tar sands country, where members of the Beaver Lake Cree Nation told me how the moose had changed. A woman killed one on a hunting trip, only to find the flesh had turned green. I heard a lot about strange tumours, which locals assumed had to do with the animals drinking water contaminated by tar sand toxins. But mostly I heard about how the moose were simply gone. And not just in Alberta. Rapid Climate Changes Turn North Woods into Moose Graveyard read a May 2012 headline in Scientific American. A year and a half later, the New York Times reported that one of Minnesota's two moose populations had declined from 4,000 in the 1990s to just 100.  Will my son ever see a moose?  In our desire to deal with climate change without questioning the logic of growth, we've been eager to look both to technology and the market for saviours. And the world's celebrity billionaires have been happy to play their part. In his autobiography/new age business manifesto Screw It, Let's Do It, Richard Branson shared the inside story of his road to Damascus conversion to the fight against climate change. It was 2006 and Al Gore, on tour with An Inconvenient Truth, came to the billionaire's home to impress upon him the dangers of global warming.""It was quite an experience,"" Branson writes. ""As I listened to Gore, I saw that we were looking at Armageddon."" As he tells it, his first move was to summon Will Whitehorn, then Virgin Group's corporate and brand development director. ""We took the decision to change the way Virgin operates on a corporate and global level. We called this new approach Gaia Capitalism in honour of James Lovelock and his revolutionary scientific view"" (this is that the Earth is ""one single enormous living organism""). Not only would Gaia Capitalism ""help Virgin to make a real difference in the next decade and not be ashamed to make money at the same time"", but Branson believed it could become ""a new way of doing business on a global level"". Before the year was out, he was ready to make his grand entrance on to the green scene (and he knows how to make an entrance – by parachute, by jetski, by kitesail with a naked model clinging to his back). At the 2006 Clinton Global Initiative annual meeting in New York, the highest power event on the philanthropic calendar, Branson pledged to spend $3bn over the next decade to develop biofuels as an alternative to oil and gas, and on other technologies to battle climate change. The sum alone was staggering, but the most elegant part was where the money would be coming from: Branson would divert the funds generated by Virgin's fossil fuel-burning transportation lines. In short, he was volunteering to do precisely what our governments have been unwilling to legislate: channel the profits earned from warming the planet into the costly transition away from these dangerous energy sources. Bill Clinton was dazzled, calling the pledge ""ground-breaking"". But Branson wasn't finished: a year later, he was back with the Virgin Earth Challenge – a $25m prize for the first inventor to figure out how to sequester 1bn tonnes of carbon a year from the air ""without countervailing harmful effects"". And the best part, he said, is that if these competing geniuses crack the carbon code, the ""'doom and gloom' scenario vanishes. We can carry on living our lives in a pretty normal way – we can drive our cars, fly our planes."" The idea that we can solve the climate crisis without having to change our lifestyles – certainly not by taking fewer Virgin flights – seemed the underlying assumption of all Branson's initiatives. In 2009, he launched the Carbon War Room, an industry group looking for ways that different sectors could lower their emissions voluntarily, and save money in the process. For many mainstream greens, Branson seemed a dream come true: a media darling out to show the world that fossil fuel-intensive companies can lead the way to a green future, using profit as the most potent tool. Bill Gates and former mayor of New York Michael Bloomberg have also used their philanthropy aggressively to shape climate solutions, the latter with large donations to green groups such as the Environmental Defense Fund, and with the supposedly enlightened climate policies he introduced as mayor. But while talking a good game about carbon bubbles and stranded assets, Bloomberg has made no discernible attempt to manage his own vast wealth in a manner that reflects these concerns. In fact, he helped set up Willett Advisors, a firm specialising in oil and gas assets, for both his personal and philanthropic holdings. Those gas assets may well have risen in value as a result of his environmental giving – what with, for example, EDF championing natural gas as a replacement for coal. Perhaps there is no connection between his philanthropic priorities and his decision to entrust his fortune to the oil and gas sector. But these investment choices raise uncomfortable questions about his status as a climate hero, as well as his 2014 appointment as a UN special envoy for cities and climate change (questions Bloomberg has not answered, despite my repeated requests). Gates has a similar firewall between mouth and money. Though he professes great concern about climate change, the Gates Foundation had at least $1.2bn invested in oil giants BP and ExxonMobil as of December 2013, and those are only the start of his fossil fuel holdings. When he had his climate change epiphany, he, too, raced to the prospect of a silver-bullet techno-fix, without pausing to consider viable – if economically challenging – responses in the here and now. In Ted talks, op-eds, interviews and in his annual letters, Gates repeats his call for governments massively to increase spending on research and development, with the goal of uncovering ""energy miracles"". By miracles, he means nuclear reactors that have yet to be invented (he is a major investor and chairman of nuclear startup TerraPower), machines to suck carbon out of the atmosphere (he is a primary investor in at least one such prototype) and direct climate manipulation (Gates has spent millions funding research into schemes to block the sun, and his name is on several hurricane-suppression patents). At the same time, he has been dismissive of the potential of existing renewable technologies, writing off energy solutions such as rooftop solar as ""cute"" and ""noneconomic"" (these cute technologies already provide 25% of Germany's electricity). Almost a decade after Branson's epiphany, it seems a good time to check in on the ""win-win"" crusade. Let's start with his ""firm commitment"" to spending $3bn over a decade developing a miracle fuel. The first tranche of money he diverted from his transport divisions launched Virgin Fuels (since replaced by private equity firm Virgin Green Fund). He began by investing in various agrofuel businesses, including making a bet of $130m on corn ethanol. Virgin has attached its name to several biofuel pilot projects – one to derive jet fuel from eucalyptus trees, another from fermented gas waste – though it has not gone in as an investor. But Branson admits the miracle fuel ""hasn't been invented yet"" and the fund has since moved its focus to a grab-bag of green-tinged products. Diversifying his holdings to get a piece of the green market would hardly seem to merit the fanfare inspired by Branson's original announcement, especially as the investments have been so unremarkable. If he is to fulfil his $3bn pledge by 2016, by this point at least $2bn should have been spent. He's not even close. According to Virgin Green Fund partner Evan Lovell, Virgin has contributed only around $100m to the pot, on top of the original ethanol investment, which brings the total Branson investment to around $230m. (Lovell confirmed that ""we are the primary vehicle"" for Branson's promise.) Branson refused to answer my direct questions about how much he had spent, writing that ""it's very hard to quantify the total amount… across the Group"". His original ""pledge"" he now refers to as a ""gesture"". In 2009, he told Wired magazine, ""in a sense, whether it's $2bn, $3bn or $4bn is not particularly relevant"". When the deadline rolls around, he told me, ""I suspect it will be less than $1bn right now"" and blamed the shortfall on everything from high oil prices to the global financial crisis: ""The world was quite different back in 2006… In the last eight years, our airlines have lost hundreds of millions of dollars."" Given these explanations for falling short, it is worth looking at some of the things for which Branson did manage to find money. In 2007, a year after seeing the climate light, he launched domestic airline Virgin America. From 40 flights a day to five destinations in its first year, it reached 177 flights a day to 23 destinations in 2013. At the same time, passengers on Virgin's Australian airlines increased from 15 million in 2007 to 19 million in 2012. In 2009, Branson launched a new long-haul airline, Virgin Australia; in April 2013 came Little Red, a British domestic airline. So this is what he has done since his climate change pledge: gone on a procurement spree that has seen his airlines' greenhouse gas emissions soar by around 40%. And it's not just planes: Branson has unveiled Virgin Racing to compete in Formula One, (he claimed he had entered the sport only because he saw opportunities to make it greener, but quickly lost interest) and invested heavily in Virgin Galactic, his dream of launching commercial flights into space, for $250,000 per passenger. According to Fortune, by early 2013 Branson had spent ""more than $200m"" on this vanity project. It can be argued – and some do – that Branson's planet-saviour persona is an elaborate attempt to avoid the kind of tough regulatory action that was on the horizon when he had his green conversion. In 2006, public concern about climate change was rising dramatically, particularly in the UK, where young activists used daring direct action to oppose new airports, as well as the proposed new runway at Heathrow. At the same time, the UK government was considering a broad bill that would hit the airline sector; Gordon Brown, then chancellor, had tried to discourage flying with a marginal rise in air passenger duty. These measures posed a significant threat to Branson's profit margins. So, was Branson's reinvention as a guilt-ridden planet-wrecker volunteering to solve the climate crisis little more than a cynical ploy? All of a sudden, you could feel good about flying again – after all, the profits from that ticket to Barbados were going to help discover a miracle green fuel. It was an even more effective conscience-cleaner than carbon offsets (though Virgin sold those, too). As for regulations and taxes, who would want to hinder an airline supporting such a good cause? This was always Branson's argument: ""If you hold industry back, we will not, as a nation, have the resources to come up with the clean-energy solutions we need."" It is noteworthy that his green talk has been less voluble since David Cameron came to power and made it clear that fossil fuel-based businesses faced no serious threat of climate regulations. There is a more charitable interpretation of what has gone wrong. This would grant Branson his love of nature (whether watching tropical birds on his private island or ballooning over the Himalayas) and credit him with genuinely trying to figure out ways to reconcile running carbon-intensive businesses with a desire to help slow species extinction and avert climate chaos. It would acknowledge, too, that he has thought up some creative mechanisms to try to channel profits into projects that could help keep the planet cool. But if we grant him these good intentions, then the fact that all these projects have failed to yield results is all the more relevant. He set out to harness the profit motive to solve the crisis, but again and again, the demands of building a successful empire trumped the climate imperative. The idea that only capitalism can save the world from a crisis it created is no longer an abstract theory; it's a hypothesis that has been tested in the real world. We can now take a hard look at the results: at the green products shunted to the back of the supermarket shelves at the first signs of recession; at the venture capitalists who were meant to bankroll a parade of innovation but have come up far short; at the fraud-infested, boom-and-bust carbon market that has failed to cut emissions. And, most of all, at the billionaires who were going to invent a new form of enlightened capitalism but decided, on second thoughts, that the old one was just too profitable to surrender. At some point about seven years ago, I realised I had become so convinced we were headed toward a grim ecological collapse that I was losing my capacity to enjoy my time in nature. The more beautiful the experience, the more I found myself grieving its loss – like someone unable to fall fully in love because she can't stop imagining the inevitable heartbreak. Looking out over British Columbia's Sunshine Coast, at an ocean bay teeming with life, I would suddenly picture it barren – the eagles, herons, seals and otters all gone. It got worse after I covered the 2010 BP spill in the Gulf of Mexico: for two years after, I couldn't look at any body of water without imagining it covered in oil. This kind of ecological despair was a big part of why I resisted having kids until my late 30s. It was around the time that I began work on my book that my attitude started to shift. Some of it, no doubt, was standard-issue denial (what does one more kid matter?). But it was also that immersing myself in the international climate movement had helped me imagine various futures that were decidedly less bleak. And I was lucky: pregnant the first month we started trying. But then, just as fast, my luck ran out. A miscarriage. An ovarian tumour. A cancer scare. Surgery. Month after month of disappointing single pink lines on pregnancy tests. Another miscarriage. It just so happened that the five years it took to write my book were the same years my personal life was occupied with failed pharmaceutical and technological interventions and, ultimately, pregnancy and new motherhood. I tried, at first, to keep these parallel journeys segregated, but it didn't always work. The worst part was the ceaseless invocation of our responsibilities to ""our children"". I knew these expressions were heartfelt and not meant to be exclusionary, yet I couldn't help feeling shut out. But along the way, that feeling changed. It's not that I got in touch with my inner Earth Mother; it's that I started to notice that if the Earth is indeed our mother, then she is a mother facing a great many fertility challenges of her own. I had no idea I was pregnant when I went to Louisiana to cover the BP spill. A few days after I got home, though, I could tell something was off and did a pregnancy test. Two lines this time, but the second strangely faint. ""You can't be just a little bit pregnant,"" the saying goes. And yet that is what I seemed to be. After more tests, my doctor told me my hormone levels were much too low and I'd probably miscarry, for the third time. My mind raced back to the Gulf – the toxic fumes I had breathed in for days and the contaminated water I had waded in. I searched on the chemicals BP was using in huge quantities, and found reams of online chatter linking them to miscarriages. Whatever was happening, I had no doubt that it was my doing. After a week of monitoring, the pregnancy was diagnosed as ectopic - the embryo had implanted itself outside the uterus, most likely in a fallopian tube. I was rushed to the emergency room. The somewhat creepy treatment is one or more injections of methotrexate, a drug used in chemotherapy to arrest cell development (and carrying many of the side-effects). Once foetal development has stopped, the pregnancy miscarries, but it can take weeks. It was a tough, drawn-out loss for my husband and me. But it was also a relief to learn that the miscarriage had nothing to do with the Gulf. Knowing that did make me think a little differently about my time covering the spill, however. As I waited for the pregnancy to ""resolve"", I thought in particular about a long day spent on the Flounder Pounder, a boat a group of us had chartered to look for evidence that the oil had entered the marshlands. Our guide was Jonathan Henderson of the Gulf Restoration Network, a heroic local organisation devoted to repairing the damage done to the wetlands by the oil and gas industry. As we navigated the narrow bayous of the Mississippi Delta, Henderson leant far over the side to get a better look at the bright green grass. What concerned him most was not what we were all seeing – fish jumping in fouled water, Roseau cane coated in oil – but something much harder to detect without a microscope and sample jars. Spring is the start of spawning season on the Gulf Coast, and Henderson knew these marshes were teeming with nearly invisible zooplankton and tiny juveniles that would develop into adult shrimp, oysters, crabs and fin fish. In these fragile weeks, the marsh grass acts as an aquatic incubator, providing nutrients and protection from predators. ""Everything is born in these wetlands,"" he said. The prospects for these microscopic creatures did not look good. Each wave brought in more oil and dispersants, sending levels of carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) soaring. And this was all happening at the worst possible moment in the biological calendar: not only shellfish, but also bluefin tuna, grouper, snapper, mackerel, marlin and swordfish were all spawning. Out in the open water, floating clouds of translucent proto-life were just waiting for one of the countless plumes of oil and dispersants to pass through them like an angel of death. Unlike the oil-coated pelicans and sea turtles, these deaths would attract no media attention, just as they would go uncounted in official assessments of the spill's damage. If a certain species of larva was in the process of being snuffed out, we would likely not find out about it for years, and then, rather than some camera-ready mass die-off, there would just be… nothing. An absence. A hole in the life cycle. As our boat rocked in that terrible place – the sky buzzing with Black Hawk helicopters and snowy white egrets – I had the distinct feeling we were suspended not in water but in amniotic fluid, immersed in a massive multi-species miscarriage. When I learned that I, too, was in the early stages of creating an ill-fated embryo, I started to think of that time in the marsh as my miscarriage inside a miscarriage. It was then that I let go of the idea that infertility made me some sort of exile from nature, and began to feel what I can only describe as a kinship of the infertile. A few months after I stopped going to the fertility clinic, a friend recommended a naturopathic doctor. This practitioner had her own theories about why so many women without an obvious medical reason were having trouble conceiving. Carrying a baby is one of the hardest physical tasks we can ask of ourselves, she said, and if our bodies decline the task, it is often a sign that they are facing too many other demands – high-stress work, or the physical stress of having to metabolise toxins, or just the stresses of modern life. Most fertility clinics use drugs and technology to override this, and they work for a lot of people. But if they do not (and they often do not), women are frequently left even more stressed, their hormones more out of whack. The naturopath proposed the opposite approach: try to figure out what might be overtaxing my system, and then remove those things. After a series of tests, I was diagnosed with a whole mess of allergies I didn't know I had, as well as adrenal insufficiency and low cortisol levels. The doctor asked me a lot of questions, including how many hours I had spent in the air over the past year. ""Why?"" I asked warily. ""Because of the radiation. There have been some studies done with flight attendants that show it might not be good for fertility."" I admit I was far from convinced that this approach would result in a pregnancy, or even that the science behind it was wholly sound. Then again, the worst that could happen was that I'd end up healthier. So I did it all. The yoga, the meditation, the dietary changes (the usual wars on wheat, gluten, dairy and sugar, as well as more esoteric odds and ends). I went to acupuncture and drank bitter Chinese herbs; my kitchen counter became a gallery of powders and supplements. I left Toronto and moved to rural British Columbia. This is the part of the world where my parents live, where my grandparents are buried. Gradually, I learned to identify a half-dozen birds by sound, and sea mammals by the ripples on the water's surface. My frequent-flyer status expired for the first time in a decade, and I was glad. For the first few months, the hardest part of the pregnancy was believing everything was normal. No matter how many tests came back with reassuring results, I stayed braced for tragedy. What helped most was hiking, and during the final anxious weeks, I would calm my nerves by walking for as long as my sore hips would let me on a trail along a pristine creek. I kept my eyes open for silvery salmon smolts making their journey to the sea after months of incubation in shallow estuaries. And I would picture the cohos, pinks and chums battling the rapids and falls, determined to reach the spawning grounds where they were born. This was my son's determination, I would tell myself. He was clearly a fighter, having managed to make his way to me despite the odds; he would find a way to be born safely, too. I don't know why this pregnancy succeeded any more than I know why earlier pregnancies failed – and neither do my doctors. Infertility is just one of the many areas in which we humans are confronted with our oceans of ignorance. So, mostly, I feel lucky. And I suppose a part of me is still in that oiled Louisiana marsh, floating in a sea of poisoned larvae and embryos, with my own ill-fated embryo inside me. It's not self-pity that keeps me returning to that sad place. It's the conviction that there is something valuable in the body-memory of slamming up against a biological limit – of running out of chances – something we all need to learn. We are built to survive, gifted with adrenaline and embedded with multiple biological redundancies that allow us the luxury of second, third and fourth chances. So are our oceans. So is the atmosphere. But surviving is not the same as thriving, not the same as living well. For a great many species, it's not the same as being able to nurture and produce new life. With proper care, we stretch and bend amazingly well. But we break, too – our individual bodies, as well as the communities and ecosystems that support us. • This is an edited extract from This Changes Everything: Capitalism v The Climate, by Naomi Klein, published next week by Allen Lane at £20.

"Disasters triggered by climate change are not blind to gender and age. They affect men and women, the old and the young, very differently. Sex and age are some of the most powerful indicators of how individuals will experience a disaster: who survives and who dies. Despite this, we have worryingly little data on the issue. When we do look at the data, the gender dimension is clear. For example, when it comes to deaths in disasters, women tend to be affected significantly more than men. A household survey carried out by Oxfam in Aceh, Indonesia, following the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami found that in the most affected areas, up to four women died for every male. In some villages, all the deceased were women. This discrepancy can largely be explained by cultural restrictions on women’s behaviour. In Aceh, women and girls are often not encouraged to learn to swim or climb trees. At the time the tsunami hit, women were also in particularly vulnerable places, clustered near the shoreline at home, mostly caring for children.  Among those who do survive a disaster, women and children also tend to face particular threats to their safety. This includes an increased risk of gender-based violence. Displacement, stress and trauma are familiar features following a disaster and tend to intensify pre-existing risk factors for domestic abuse. Many women and children end up in evacuation centres or with extended family networks, which can involve increased exposure to perpetrators of violence. Data allow us to be aware of these kinds of vulnerabilities but also to help prepare tailored assistance once a natural disaster has hit. Men and women usually have different basic needs in response and recovery periods. These are highly context-specific, as disasters tend to exacerbate pre-existing gender inequalities, which vary from community to community. Yet generally speaking, in situations where food is scarce, women are often expected to serve men and boys first, resulting in particular post-disaster nutritional risks for women. Women often also have particular needs for healthcare and sanitation, and tend to undertake specific household duties, which can impact on their ability to access humanitarian assistance. If humanitarians are unaware of these daily routines and needs, they will fail to ensure women have access that is equitable with the men in their community. Women and men also have different skillsets and areas of expertise which, if utilised correctly, can alter the effectiveness of humanitarian responses and overall community resilience. In the Pacific region, where my work is focused, women tend to be the ones who know about local food preparation and dietary preferences – information vital to inform planning for food rations. This information is available only where women are consulted and the resulting data are analysed and used to inform the design of assistance packages. Recent disasters in the Pacific have shown clear gaps in responding to the particular needs of women and girls. Despite the clear case for collecting more gendered data, the sector routinely fails to do this either at a global or regional level. By contrast, where sex and age disaggregated data are used, we see a clear trend towards more effective and sustainable humanitarian response. This was particularly apparent in the Tongan government’s response to Tropical Cyclone (TC) Ian in Ha’apai in early 2014. Sex and age disaggregated data were collected by the national and provincial authorities, and at all levels responders were reasonably aware of the specific needs of women and girls. For example, on all affected islands, the numbers of pregnant and lactating women were identified early in the response, and they were prioritised for access to health services. Local first responders collected qualitative data on where women were having problems accessing distributions, and allocated targeted resources to address these issues. Evacuation centres were set up with the particular safety and security needs of women in mind; these included gender-separated bathrooms and sleeping areas segregated along family lines. So, if the collection and analysis of sex and age disaggregated data is so vital to effective humanitarian response, why is it so routinely neglected? Perhaps this task can seem like an administrative nicety, easily sacrificed in the headlong rush to respond to a given disaster. Whatever the reasons, ultimately the responsibility lies with all humanitarian actors, not just those with explicit responsibility for gender issues, to resolve the data gaps. To provide humanitarian assistance that is responsive to the needs of all, we need to work collaboratively to put the practice of gender and generational analysis firmly at the centre of what we do.

"This Sunday marks a year since Tony Abbott was elected. The prime minister is riding low in the opinion polls as the least popular prime minister in twenty five years, with a net dissatisfaction rating of minus 19. There's little doubt that Mr Abbott's unpopularity is driven by many things; he was unpopular even before his election in 2013. The litany of broken promises could be one reason. His attempts to unravel the Australian social compact, mostly encapsulated in his first budget, could be another. Judging by the fights he has picked, Abbott has decided he needs enemies like a thirsty man needs water: the environment, unions, Russia, asylum seekers, the unemployed, and more.  A contributing factor in my view is that Tony Abbott and his government have not just failed to responsibly steward Australia's natural heritage, but has actively treated the environment as an enemy. Several of the attacks were promises that Mr Abbott decided not to break, but others are surprises that were sprung only after the election. The active, purposeful attacks by Abbott against Australia's natural heritage is not just a political issue that has contributed to his low standing with the public, but have real impacts that may last for decades. This negligence is reckless and endangers our air, water, soil now and for future generations. There have been many potentially disastrous decisions made by the Abbott government since the 2013 election on 7 September. Here's my top ten worst decisions. The repeal of the carbon price was perhaps the single biggest act of negligence and misanthropy from the Abbott government to date. It is quite simply a betrayal of current and future generations, and sets Australia back more than a decade. The globe is moving towards pricing carbon, whether through emissions trading or through shadow pricing schemes. The Clean Energy Future Act, while not perfect, had the essential elements needed to decarbonise the economy. Since the abolition of the carbon price, carbon pollution emissions has increased: In the year to August 2014, emissions were 1m tonnes higher when compared with the year to June 2014. This is equivalent to an increase of 0.8% in emissions. This disappointing but predictable increase follows reductions in carbon emissions from 2012-13. Needless to say, carbon pollution is the primary cause of dangerous global warming. Unfortunately, the replacement policy proposed by the Coalition, ""direct action"", is a sham that could only be proposed by a government that believes global warming is a hoax. Before the 2013 election, the renewable energy target was a bi-partisan policy originally introduced by the Howard government. The target would see 20 percent or 41,000 gigawatt hours of renewable energy generated by 2020. Leading up to last year's election, both Tony Abbott and environment minister Greg Hunt made clear commitments that they would keep, unchanged, the renewable energy target. On 19 June 2013, Hunt said on Sky News: We agree on the national targets to reduce our emissions by five per cent by 2020. We also agree on the renewable energy target. And one of the things we don't want to do is to become a party where there is this wild sovereign risk where you are, where businesses take steps to their detriment on the basis of a pledge and a policy of Government. The renewable energy target was responsible for increasing the amount of clean, renewable energy in our electricity grid, the creation of thousands of jobs from new energy projects, and downward competitive pressure on energy prices. Upon his election, Mr Abbott appointed a review panel chaired by climate denier Dick Warburton, who has proposed the scheme be dramatically cut back. If Abbott accepts these recommendations, it would effectively shut down Australia's renewable energy industry future. The beneficiaries of any freeze or reduction in the renewable energy target would be the fossil fuel energy producers. The Climate Commission was created to provide independent, accurate and relevant information to the public about global warming. The commission's abolition was announced just a few weeks after Abbott's election, when Greg Hunt abruptly called the commission's chief professor Tim Flannery. A major challenge facing policy reform on global warming is the virulent and hardened propaganda campaigns run by climate deniers. There is a strong need for accurate information to help better inform the Australian public about the risks of climate change, and to correct the misinformation that is given airing in mastheads like The Australian. A well informed public is inherently meritorious, even more so when it concerns an issue as complex and contested as climate change policy. It is exceptionally disappointing that the government abolished the Climate Commission, and doing so has not altered the facts of global warming or silenced the likes of Tim Flannery. Both these organisations, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and Renewable Energy Agency were created to assist in the rapid commercial development of renewable energy projects. The Renewable Energy Agency finances research and development for renewable energy projects, and currently supports around 180 projects worth $1 billion, many of which are in regional areas. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation alone has financed billions in renewable and energy efficiency investments; the Abbott government's argument is that these investments ""crowd out"" private investment and that the investments it does make are ""highly speculative"". Both criticisms have been refuted by the corporation itself, and far from crowding out private investment, it has actually spurred it, attracting ""A$2.90 from private funds for every A$1 it has invested in projects"". According to strategic management professor John Matthews: The problem facing most renewable energy projects is that financial institutions are too conservative to back their projects. But if a project is ""proofed"" by the CEFC then it becomes much more attractive to conventional finance. The Abbott government's abolition attempts for both the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and Renewable Energy Agency were blocked in the senate by Labor, the Greens and the Palmer United Party ""coalition"" (including Ricky Muir). Nevertheless, the Abbott government's ideological opposition to clean energy and the jobs it creates is openly apparent with their brutish attempts to force the finance corporation to cease its investments before legislation was even introduced to parliament to abolish it The Abbott government declared that the ""age of entitlement is over"" when Joe Hockey said that ""everyone in Australia must do the heavy lifting"". This clearly excluded fossil fuel and mining companies, the main beneficiary of enormous and unneeded subsidies. Despite the severe cuts in the federal budget targeting everyday people, the government decided to keep $10 billion per year in subsidies to fossil fuel companies. These handouts take the form of direct subsidies, cash, tax breaks and publicly funded infrastructure. The most egregious is the diesel fuel rebate, primarily used by mining companies to the tune of $2 billion per year. Highly profitable, mostly foreign-owned mining companies pay just $0.06c per litre for fuel, compared to the $0.38c per litre that everyday people pay. It's not just mining companies. The major fossil fuel companies get tax-payer funds for their oil, coal and gas projects, which over the next four years will add up to more than $4 billion. This includes exceptionally favourable depreciation laws for assets like drilling rigs, which costs Australians money and helps fossil fuel companies make their massive profits. The Great Barrier Reef is one of the truly wondrous natural wonders of the world, and the Abbott government decided to approve the expansion of a coal terminal near the reef. The reef is not only at risk of ocean acidification and extreme weather, but industrial development and shipping along the reef puts it under considerable pressure. There is a real possibility that the reef has already been irreparably damaged. While it now appears the worst elements of the Abbot Point coal terminal, which involved ""the dumping of three million cubic tonnes of dredge spoil in the marine park area"" may not proceed, the threat of climate change and environmental problems from increased shipping of coal exports remain. For a generation, Tasmania was divided between pro-logging and conservationists, with conservationists opposing logging of old-growth forests. After many years of negotiation, the major conservation groups came to an agreement with the forestry industry, ensuring World Heritage protection for large parts of Tasmania's forests, and a path for Forest Stewardship Council certification for the industry. After his election, Tony Abbott tried to have the United Nations de-list Tasmania's 74,000 hectares of World Heritage listed forest, and the recently elected Liberal state government has also committed to tearing up the forest deal. The UN rejected the Abbott government's attempts at a meeting this year in Doha, with a delegate saying ""accepting this delisting would set an unacceptable precedent"". These actions show that the Abbott government is attempting to reignite the bitter conflict between industry and conservationists. It is worth noting that the Tasmanian forest industry supports the existing deal, suggesting that Abbott's actions have been driven by anti-environmental ideology. The former Labor government significantly expanded Australia's marine national parks, growing the commendable work done under the conservative Howard government. The marine network is now being reviewed by a panel, with pro-fishing groups expecting the current marine park process to be ""suspended"". As we have seen in other places, reviews under the Abbott government are often stalking horses to provide cover for more extreme agendas, and the risk is that Australia's network of marine reserves will be weakened beyond repair. This issue has sadly received relatively little coverage by major mastheads, although Fairfax's Bianca Hall did cover the original decision in December 2013. The referral of environmental powers to the states would be a betrayal of Australia's natural heritage, under the paltry guise of removing ""green tape"". The cumbersomely named Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act creates requirements for federal approval for major projects. The referral proposal would see the federal government hand over approval powers to state governments, many of whom are hopelessly conflicted or incapable of assessing major projects adequately. In practice, the referral would leave Australia's environment at the mercy of major mining and fossil fuel interests. The furphy of ""green tape"" was dreamed up by conservative business interests to undermine legitimate protections for the environment and communities. What's more, handing these powers is an abdication of the federal government's responsibility to steward our national heritage, many of which cross state boundaries. A small network of community legal centres exists to empower local communities to protect themselves and their environment. They do public interest work, like running cases to ensure that governments abide by existing conservation laws, or protecting endangered species. These environmental defenders offices were funded through federal government grants (like most community legal centres) but upon the election of the Abbott government, George Brandis, the new attorney general, defunded them. This is disappointing because it reduces the ability of communities to hold the government and big business to account and to protect their local interests. The ""green army"" is an election promise to recruit around 15,000 volunteers to opt into working on environmental projects. In lieu of payment, participants receive an allowance. In addition to there being doubts to the merit of the environmental projects the ""green army"" will undertake, the participants of the program lack basic employment protections. The aim of the program is to provide work experience and training to volunteers aged 17-24. The program has been legislated to ensure that volunteers do not receive social security payments but instead receive an allowance, paid by the program service provider (which are companies or other organisations that are contracted by the federal government). Participants are not characterised as employees, and are therefore denied rights and protections taken for granted by other workers, including health and safety laws, workers compensation, superannuation, leave, unfair dismissal, and anti-discrimination protections. The real shame of this program is that it puts vulnerable young people in potential danger without any real rights or protections just to provide a green-wash for the federal government."
"Government-released open data is fuelling a whole new level of innovation in sustainability. Moving beyond hackathons, today’s climate data partnerships are creating unique ventures that cross boundaries between business, government and academia.  In the US, “datapaloozas” – gatherings focused on creating open data innovations in the areas of health, education, energy and safety across sectors – are popping up all over the place.  Recently, the geographic information system technology (GIS) company Esri held the Esri Climate Resilience App Challenge in conjunction with the White House’s Climate Data Initiative. The challenge’s winner, the University of Minnesota’s Minnesota Solar Suitability Analysis app, identified the best sites for solar panel installations across the state. “It’s not possible to say that because of this app challenge we reduced carbon – we cannot make concrete measurements,” said Esri’s technology evangelist, John Yaist. But the technology that came out of the challenge can have “an impact on personal behaviour and thoughts of what climate change means on an everyday basis.” Yaist points out that climate change has become a “worn out” topic to some people, but apps are a way to “personalise” the abstract concepts of climate change and disaster response. Apps can add to the realness of climate change by making “it into something they can hold in their hand,” he explained. Esri is also currently running a global disaster relief app challenge with the UN’s Making Cities Resilient campaign. Developers in the competition were asked to create apps to address food resilience and urban disaster relief. Winners will be announced later this month. Even the crowdfunding website, Kickstarter, hosts a number of climate change open data projects including the Smart Citizen Kit, a crowdsourced environmental monitoring platform and FLOAT Beijing, which uses kites with sensors to measure air quality in Beijing neighbourhoods through citizen science, grassroots mapping, and open source data visualisation. Other corporations are getting in on the open data boom, too. IBM offers free supercomputing hours on its World Community Grid for researchers who are studying climate change in support of the latest iteration of the White House’s Climate Data Initiative. One of the grid’s projects has the potential to transform the solar industry. Harvard University’s Clean Energy Project screened and publicly catalogued 2.3m compounds looking for new photovoltaic materials. The project found more than 35,000 materials that could potentially double the efficiency of current carbon-based solar cells. The findings of the Harvard Clean Energy Project Database are open to the public to help further the discovery of new materials. Dr Alan Aspuru-Guzik, Harvard’s lead researcher of the Clean Energy Project and associate professor in the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, believes it’s important to “give back” the data from his research, because “data is at the centre of scientific discovery”. Open data researchers are quick to point out that using open data can be a lot like looking for a needle in a haystack. Open data is messy and needs a certain amount of translation. Each government organisation has its own way of collecting and sorting data. The labels of data sources, like the column heads of rows of numbers in a spreadsheet, are often confusing and laced with internal jargon or acronyms. It takes time to figure out what’s what. Add to that the fact that there are no standards for open data – how it is released and in what form it is collected. Some data may be what Aspuru-Guzik calls “gray data” – data that’s half open and half closed, or partially released. Plus, there’s the question of scale. Will the data be used at the city, state, national or global level? Earlier this year, huge floods in Britain caused a stir as people struggled to get information about rising water levels. Under increasing pressure, the Environment Agency released flood data and civic hackers quickly created flood relief apps. “Having given permanent free access to our live flood warnings, flood alerts and river level data, we are expanding this commitment to make as much of our data as possible open,” said Doug Wilson, director of scientific and evidence services at the Environment Agency. Wilson said that the Environment Agency is setting up a user group of external parties to help identify which of the agency’s data is most in demand for developers, technology companies and open data enthusiasts. “The intention is that other organisations will be able to use our data to create innovative applications which will help make information about the environment more accessible,” he said. But getting data in usable formats has been a struggle, said James Smith, web developer of sustainability projects at the Open Data Institute (ODI) in London. “It’s always a battle trying to get the data released and in enough detail,” Smith said.  To help organisations understand how to release data, ODI, which supports open data projects and trains people on the potential economic, social and environmental uses of open data, has created open data certificates which are badges for best practices on how to release data. The institute also has a startup incubator programme for new open data companies and is running an open data challenge for social impact and sustainability with innovation charity Nesta.
