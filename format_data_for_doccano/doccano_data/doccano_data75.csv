"A new Great Barrier Reef conservation site has been launched by the Australian broadcaster Alan Jones, who has declared that climate change was a hoax and said the reef was “fine”.  Experts, including the federal government, agree that climate change is the biggest threat facing the reef.  “The global warming alarmists will stop at nothing,” Jones said on his radio show before launching the Citizens of the Great Barrier Reef website in Cairns. “Green groups run a very different agenda. If they can prove there’s an armageddon on the way they’ll get money. They want to talk about climate change and shut down everything.” Jones attacked WWF and Greenpeace in particular, saying they were lying about the effect of industrialisation along the Great Barrier Reef. “Like much associated with the global warming hoax, truth was the casualty,” he said. “The Barrier Reef’s fine – there are any number of reputable entities who will be looking after it and making sure it continues to be fine and looked after.” In 2016 a mass bleaching event killed almost a quarter of the coral on the Great Barrier Reef, something that scientists found would have been almost impossible if it weren’t for climate change. Jones was taken on a helicopter tour of the Great Barrier Reef as part of the launch, and after the trip, declared the reef will regenerate. “There are cycles in all of this – the reef regenerates its­elf,” he was quoted saying in the Cairns Post. “The reality is that northern section was here thousands of years ago and will be for the next thousand.” It is unknown if Jones was aware that several partners of the Citizens of the Great Barrier Reef project had put out reports stating the climate change is the biggest risk facing the Great Barrier Reef. The project lists the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) as one of its partners. GBRMPA has clearly and repeatedly stated that climate change is the most serious threat. James Cook University (JCU) is another partner. Terry Hughes, a professor at JCU and head of the national coral bleaching taskforce, told the Guardian in June that coral bleaching, caused by climate change, had “changed the Great Barrier Reef forever”.  One of the founding members of the Citizens of the Great Barrier Reef was a long-time climate change campaigner at WWF, Andy Ridley, who started Earth Hour. The Citizens of the Great Barrier Reef foundation chairman, Alex De Waal, told Guardian Australia that Jones “wasn’t engaged to launch the initiative”. But a spokeswoman for Citizens of the Great Barrier Reef said: “He said he could do a media launch for us today, which he did. “It was announcing it on his radio show basically and he did a media conference here with the local media.” A press release sent out by Citizens of the GBR said: “Australia’s leading broadcaster Alan Jones AO will launch Citizens of the Great Barrier Reef to his vast breakfast audience across Australia when he broadcasts from Cairns today and tomorrow.” De Waal said: “Anybody that comes to us and says we want to tell the community about the Citizens of the GBR program, we are very encouraging. We are very agnostic in terms of anyone who is able to drive and generate visitation to citizensofgbr.org.” Citizens of the Great Barrier Reef is a crowd-funding program that intends to allow members to vote to direct funds towards conservation and research programs of their choice. Richard Leck, WWF-Australia head of oceans said: “Any campaign that seeks to educate people around the globe about the jewel in Australia’s tourism crown is welcome.”"
"They went to Kigali to eliminate hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and take 0.5C out of future global warming, and the 170 countries who successfully negotiated an amendment to the Montreal Protocol agreed to get rid of 90% of them. Job done. Not bad for four days and three long nights’ work. In fact, the Kigali deal on HFCs, announced on Saturday morning, is fiendishly complicated and has taken years to negotiate in different technical and political forums. It was only struck by an ambitious agreement to give countries different timescales to phase them out, alongside major chemical and big food companies accepting change, the personal determination of the US secretary of state, John Kerry, to get a deal before the election and developing countries agreeing to invest heavily in new technologies.  Rich countries, including the US, Japan and nations in Europe, will now start phasing out synthetic HFCs in 2019, whereas China agreed to peak emissions in 2024, while India and less ambitious countries chose 2028. As such, the deal reflects countries’ differing levels of development. Because nearly all HFCs are made by a handful of giant northern chemical companies and are used in air-conditioning units and cooling systems made and sold in rich countries, it was relatively easy for their governments to put pressure on a single global industry. Besides, the alternatives, like hydrocarbons, ammonia and CO2, are widely available, safe, have been approved and are on the market. The deal will make little difference to rich countries. The EU had already started to phase out HFCs and since 2011 had banned them being used in cars. Many global food and drink companies, like Coca-Cola, Pepsico and Unilever, have already started to switch fluorinated greenhouse gases with climate-friendly and other natural refrigerants that are more energy-efficient and can save money. The new agreement is welcomed by many chemical and manufacturing companies because it gives them market advantage over inferior products made in poor countries, as well as green kudos. But a deal proved much harder for India, China and other developing countries to strike. Their companies have relied on old refrigeration and coolant technologies, and they will now have to invest heavily in R&D and upgrade or replace their factories and equipment. Just as in the wider climate negotiations, they accepted that they were part of the problem and possibly on track to become the main HFC users, but they insisted that, like climate change itself, this was primarily a western problem foisted on them. The deal has been widely welcomed because it keeps the Paris agreement on track and is an important step towards reducing global emissions. Coming on the heels of a new deal to cap aviation emissions, and just weeks before the shipping industry tries to clean up its act and the UN climate talks resume, it is overwhelmingly positive. In fact, the Kigali meeting need never have happened. HFCs were widely recognised as powerful climate-warming gases many years ago and governments deliberately missed the chance to eliminate them in 1987 when they agreed the Montreal Protocol to phase out CFC gases and save the ozone layer.  The ozone hole is at last slowly recovering and HFCs are now seen as just a small but important part of the growing climate-change problem. If only it took just a few long nights of negotiations to eliminate fossil fuels too."

"Back in 2014, David Cameron told the House of Commons Liaison Committee that people are “basically fed up” with wind farms. In 2015, his government then went on to not only cut subsidies for onshore wind, but also make it harder and harder to get planning permission.  But politicians are wrong to think wind power is unpopular. Again and again, polls show the UK public are pretty supportive of onshore wind. Our ComRes poll out today, for example, shows 73% of the British public back onshore wind power. Politicians can only dream of such approval ratings.   Significantly, the poll also found two thirds of people living in rural areas say they support onshore wind farms (65%). Although support for onshore wind was lower here than in urban areas (75%), it is still very high. The difference is similar to one found if you split by age - 77% of 18-24s support onshore wind compared to 66% of over 65s.  We also found support - at 80% - especially high in Scotland, the part of the country with by far the most onshore wind per capita. This reflects older, 2003 research by Mori Scotland (pdf) which talked to people who actually live near large wind sites and feel it’s had a positive impact on their area.  Something not covered in our new poll, but we which know from elsewhere, is that people are much more likely to support the building of renewable energy locally if they the profits directly benefit the community. According to research on wind farms in the Netherlands, people are even less likely to worry about the noise if they have a direct financial stake in the turbines. This is something we learnt from building a solar farm in Balcombe, and is just as true, and maybe even more so for wind: involve the local community. Let them be involved in working out where to site it and how you’re going to minimise impact on wildlife, and offer them a direct financial stake too.  What’s probably most interesting in the polling data, however, is how much we seem to underestimate support for onshore wind. Ask people if they support or oppose onshore wind and 73% will give it a thumbs up, but ask them to estimate how much of the population agree with them and only a minority (11%) think that 71% or more of people in the UK support the use of the technology. We see a similar trend, though slightly less marked, when it comes to solar farms. 80% say they support solar farms, but only 11% of people think support is that high. To help us understand this odd perception gap we also commissioned some research on how the press cover onshore wind and fracking. We looked at wind and fracking coverage from 1st Jan 2011 to the 16th Sept 2016. There was a load more news coverage of fracking - 5,398 news articles on wind and 7,393 on fracking - but when it came to comment pieces and editorials, the number was about the same for the two technologies - 250 on wind and 279 on fracking. Over half the comment pieces about onshore wind were negative - 52% rated as negative, 31% neutral and only 17% considered positive.  Wind editorials tend to frame their argument so as to emphasise the risks. We found a total of 226 risk frames and only 53 benefit frames in the wind comment pieces. Or to put this another way, for every four times a risk was raised, only one benefit was. When we came to look at fracking, the relationship was reversed. Here we found 139 risk frames and 206 benefit ones - that is, only two in five frames raised risk. When it came to the arguments made against onshore wind, aesthetic and cultural problems were the most frequently employed, followed by economic issues or technical risks. On the benefits side though, economic arguments were most often used, followed by environment ones.  What to make of all this? We seem worryingly out of touch with each other when it comes to onshore wind. And it looks like a minority of people who don’t like wind are finding a disproportionate amount of space to air those views in newspapers. I’m also worried that the pro-wind views that do get through tend to rely on economics and environmental arguments. Robust, sure, and certainly part of the debate, but maybe we need to inject some emotion as well as a sense of culture and aesthetics. It’s not like these arguments can’t be made: lots of people feel a sense of hope and delight when they see a wind turbine on the horizon - that feeling should be expressed and shared. And wind power is an established part of our culture - we started it after all.  We need a fresh debate on onshore wind in this country, and it needs to be one that reflects the importance of personal relationships between technology and the people.

This post was edited on 20th October 2016 at 9.22pm to clarify that the percentage of respondents who thought public support for solar farms was at the 80 per cent level was only 11 per cent."
"Bad news if you were planning a winter vacation to Mars: new research has shown that the 225m km trip to the Red Planet won’t just give you bad jet lag – it’ll probably fry your brain. The study, published in Scientific Reports, has found that the levels of cosmic radiation travellers to Mars would be exposed to could lead to brain damage, anxiety and chronic dementia. This is somewhat unfortunate as the US is currently fixated on getting to Mars in the next two decades. Last year, Nasa released its three-step plan for the Journey to Mars, which anticipated that America would be sending humans to Mars by the 2030s. Barack Obama reiterated this timeline in an op-ed for CNN on Tuesday, explaining that getting to Mars is a cooperative effort between the government and private corporations: “More than 1,000 companies across nearly all 50 states are working on private space initiatives.”  While the idea of a trip to space or landing on the Mars is all very exciting – though it’s -90F and covered with dust – I can’t help think that perhaps we’d all do better if we kept our feet on the ground. In September, the world passed the symbolic 400ppm carbon threshold; scientists say carbon dioxide levels are unlikely to return below this during our lifetimes. The last time there was this much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was about 3m years ago when modern humans didn’t exist. We’re living in a new and unpredictable world.  Heading to Mars might further fry the planet as well as your brain. Nobody really knows the environmental cost of space travel, but some scientists have raised concerns of a serious black carbon problem. A 2010 study found that black carbon emissions from space travel would cause warming at the poles, which is not good news for the Arctic or Antarctica. Or the world.  However, this study is not conclusive, and the industry repeatedly stresses that space travel poses little threat to the environment. Virgin Galactic has even said that a suborbital space trip is more environmentally friendly than a flight from New York to London. The bottom line, though, is that no one really knows how space travel will affect the earth at the moment. But if refrigerators pose an environmental threat, it doesn’t seem to be such a great leap to think that enormous rockets might also. It could be that with all this doom and gloom I’m missing the pros of getting to Mars. It’s one of the more slimming planets; if you weigh 150lb on Earth, you’d be a mere 57lb on Mars. So you’d be skinny, but you’d also have dementia and probably severe red dust allergies. The real point of space travel, however, is Progress! Taking science to the final frontier, expanding our horizons, etc. However, I can’t help but think that all of this is just ego dressed up as starry-eyed romanticism. In his op-ed, Obama writes: “We’ve flown by every planet in the solar system – something no other nation can say.” OK, cool. But people in Flint, Michigan, don’t have clean water to drink. Can we just calm down for a second about super galactic fly-bys and reassess our priorities? It’s not just national ego that’s playing a part in the amazing race to Mars. Billionaire tech founders are competing against each other to get to Mars first, and they’re literally comparing the size of each other’s rockets. Jeff Bezos’s latest rocket is apparently taller than Elon Musk’s. However, Musk’s rocket is reportedly more powerful, “generating 5.1m pounds of thrust”. Meanwhile, Boeing reckons its rocket is best of all. “I’m convinced the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding a Boeing rocket,” Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said recently. Then you’ve got the 1% who aren’t making rockets and simply want to be the first in their group of friends to post an Instagram of themselves relaxing on Mars – #redplanetbeachday – or taking a day trip to space. Justin Bieber, Ashton Kutcher, Leonardo DiCaprio and Katy Perry are just some of the celebrities who have already paid a $250,000 deposit and signed up for a suborbital space trip on Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic. The world is facing a very real climate crisis, and yet some of the best minds of our generation our focusing their efforts on getting to Mars. When we do eventually get there, who knows what the state of our planet will be? Our efforts to explore the universe may no longer be a giant leap for mankind, but a step back for Earth."
"In the future, the 20th century may well be regarded as the fossil fuel century. Oil, coal and natural gas powered vehicles and power plants and provided the raw materials for millions of products ranging from paints to packaging to clothing. But, as the 21st century kicked into gear, stocks of easily extracted fossil fuels began to run low, and industries resorted to increasingly dangerous – and expensive – methods for extraction, often with deadly, environmentally destructive results.  The recent rise of renewable energy has released part of oil’s grip on the economy as companies across the globe have begun producing electricity at prices far below those of coal and gas-based energy providers. But for other petrochemical related products – like paints, plastics and textiles – fossil fuels are still king. However, a growing number of companies are betting that renewable chemical sources might be able to topple petrochemicals from their throne. Jean-Francois Huc, CEO of Canadian chemical company BioAmber, believes that yeast may be the key to taking some of the petrochemical market. BioAmber uses a genetically engineered yeast to produce succinic acid, a chemical building block that can be used to make a host of products, including polyurethanes, plastics, paints and polymers. While BioAmber’s decision to use yeast as its primary manufacturing tool is impressive, its main innovation may lie in its choice of raw materials. Historically, most succinic acid has been made from fossil fuels, but BioAmber feeds the yeast sugar to produce the acid. Currently, the company uses mainly corn sugar, a precursor to high fructose corn syrup. Huc notes that the company could potentially also use a variety of agricultural products. “We use corn sugar because it’s plentiful,” Huc said, noting that there are 30 wet mills in North America that currently produce it. “Approximately 25bn pounds of corn sweetener are produced every year in North America and our needs are a tiny fraction of this production.” BioAmber isn’t the only company using yeast and sugar to replace fossil fuels. Bolt Threads, a California-based company, is developing sustainably produced high-performance fabrics that will challenge nylon, polyester and other petroleum-based fibers. For BoltThreads, the key is spider silk. Like BioAmber, the company uses a bioengineered yeast, but in its case, the microorganism is designed to mimic the silk-producing abilities of spiders. “We start with a cell that produces spider dragline – basically, the structural thread that spiders use to make their webs,” CEO Dan Widmaier said. “Then we adjust it to bring out different characteristics. In concept, adjustment is simple: it’s simply a matter of understanding the mechanism.” Having developed a yeast that produces the silk they want, Bolt Threads follows a process very similar to BioAmber’s: they feed the yeast water, corn sugar and salt, then allow it to make the protein. Afterward, they purify the protein and extrude it, making thread. In addition to avoiding the expensive fossil fuel extraction that lies at the heart of any petrochemical enterprise, BioAmber and Bolt Threads are also less energy intensive across the board. BioAmber’s fermentation process occurs at a temperature slightly below that of the human body, and its evaporation temperature is also comparatively low. “The entire process occurs at temperatures below 167F and atmospheric pressure, so we don’t have to waste a lot of energy on heating or creating pressure,” Huc said. Bolt Threads is still developing its products, so it hasn’t done a full energy analysis yet, but Widmaier is optimistic: “Our back of the envelope calculations tell us that our process will be as good or better than silk or wool,” he said. As for byproducts, the fermentation processes that lie at the heart of both companies produce little beyond water and spent yeast. The spent yeast is pasteurized, producing an inert product that can be used to make fertilizer or animal feed. For the time being, however, both companies are sending it to anaerobic digesters, which use it as a feedstock to produce energy. “We don’t use solvents or toxic chemicals, and we have no toxic byproducts or greenhouse gas emissions,” Huc said, noting that companies that make succinic acid from fossil fuels produce over seven tons of carbon dioxide for every ton of succinic acid. The company’s process is also very efficient. “Each pound of sugar we consume produces close to one pound of succinic acid,” Huc said. And, given the low cost of corn sugar, that translates to a significant saving over comparable fossil fuel products. At current corn prices, oil would have to be priced at $25 per barrel for parity. Given that oil is currently priced at just under $50 per barrel, BioAmber’s cost advantage will likely continue. This isn’t to say that BioAmber and Bolt Threads’ products are without drawbacks. One of the biggest problems with petrochemical products like plastic is their inability to biodegrade. Plastics in the waste stream pack landfills and litter the Pacific Ocean. In this regard, plastics produced from BioAmber’s succinic acid don’t represent a significant improvement over conventional ones. In fact, Huc says, his yeast-derived succinic acid is identical to succinic acid, which means that plastic made from the two compounds is identical. “If the plastic in question is biodegradable, its biodegradability will be identical,” he said. On the other hand, Bolt Threads hopes to offer a significant advantage over textiles produced from fossil fuels. “Garments made from fossil fuels can be recycled, but roughly 90% still end up in the waste stream,” Widmaier said. “And, since they’re not biodegradable, they stay there for a long time.” Research has borne this out: according to several studies, up to 90% of the plastic debris that ends up in the ocean comes from non-biodegradable fibers released by man-made fabrics during washing. By comparison, Bolt Threads’ fabrics are designed to biodegrade. Even with the waste stream concerns inherent in plastic, it’s clear that BioAmber represents a significant advantage over fossil fuel products. The company’s plant in Sarnia, Canada, which opened just over a year ago, is capable of producing 30,000 tons of succinic acid per year, making it the largest succinic acid plant in the world. Huc said it’s currently operating at 40% capacity but is ramping up as it increases its sales. And, for companies looking to green their supply chains, its products are particularly attractive: even with their bio-based feedstocks, they cost the same as conventional succinic acid. Or, as Huc puts it: “The green is free.”"
"Up to 122 million more people worldwide could be living in extreme poverty by 2030 as a result of climate change and its impacts on small-scale farmers’ incomes, a major UN report warned on Monday. Climate change is “a major and growing threat to global food security”, said the report, warning that it could increase the global population living in extreme poverty by between 35 and 122 million by 2030, with farming communities in sub-Saharan Africa among the hardest hit.   The 2016 State of Food and Agriculture report, published by the Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), calls for “deep transformations in agriculture and food systems” and for the world’s half-billion small-scale farms to receive particular support. The report warns that without “widespread adoption of sustainable land, water, fisheries and forestry practices, global poverty cannot be eradicated”.  It adds that action must also be taken to reduce farming’s own contributions to greenhouse gas emissions and global warming. The 194-page report looks at the future of farming and food security under different climate change scenarios. It also looks at possible responses to what it calls “an unprecedented double challenge” to eradicate hunger and poverty and stabilise the global climate.  There is, it says, “no doubt that climate change will affect the agriculture sectors and food security and that its negative impact will become more severe as it accelerates. In some particularly vulnerable places, such as small islands or in areas affected by large-scale extreme weather and climate events, the impact could be catastrophic.”  In a best-case scenario, slow-moving climate change would allow farming to adapt through relatively simple techniques, at least in the near future. But it warns that more abrupt changes would make adequate adaptation almost impossible. Possible consequences include major declines in crop yields and increasingly high and volatile food prices, it says. “In the longer run, unless measures are put in place to halt and reverse climate change, food production could become impossible in large areas of the world.” The report cites diversifying crop production, better integration of farming with the natural habitat, agroecology and “sustainable intensification” as strategies to help small-scale farmers adapt to a warming world. It says some current policies, including subsidies for inputs such as synthetic fertilisers and pesticides, could hinder the adoption of more sustainable techniques. “Social protection programmes will need to play an important role – in helping smallholders better manage risk, reducing vulnerability to food price volatility, and enhancing the employment prospects of rural people who leave the land,” it adds. The report comes as delegates arrive in Rome for the 43rd Committee on World Food Security meetings. On Friday, the FAO’s director general, José Graziano da Silva, warned: “Higher temperatures and erratic weather patterns are already undermining the health of soils, forests and oceans on which agricultural sectors and food security depend. We have seen an increase of pest and disease outbreaks everywhere.” In a special message on Friday, Pope Francis said the world should draw on “the wisdom of rural communities” and “a style of life that can help defend us from the logic of consumerism and production at any cost, a logic that … [is] aimed solely at the increase in profit”. Technologies including genetic modification “may give excellent results in the laboratory, may be advantageous for some, but have ruinous effects for others”, he argued. Ertharin Cousin, executive director of the World Food Programme, said: “Climate change is already stretching the international humanitarian system … more than 80% of the world’s hungry live in areas prone to natural disasters and environmental degradation. Climate change is not waiting – neither can we.”  Until 2030, says the FAO report, climate change impacts will produce both gains and losses, with crop yields increasing in colder places, for example. After 2030, negative impacts could threaten farming and food systems in every region of the world.  In September 2015, UN member states agreed to eradicate extreme poverty and end hunger by 2030 as part of the sustainable development goals. In December, world leaders signed the Paris agreement, which sets a framework for national action and international cooperation on climate change. Monday’s report argues that now is the time for these political commitments to be put into action. It notes that agriculture and related land use alone accounts for at least one-fifth of global greenhouse-gas emissions – and that this must also be addressed.  Globally, about one-third of all food produced is also lost or wasted. Reducing this figure could limit farming’s impact on natural resources and emissions, it says. “‘Business as usual’ is not an option,” stressed Graziano da Silva in a foreword to the report. “Agriculture has always been the interface between natural resources and human activity. Today it holds the key to solving the two greatest challenges facing humanity: eradicating poverty, and maintaining the stable climatic corridor in which civilisation can thrive.” "
"Traditionally, the environment and the development sectors have worked separately, but the era of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement on climate change calls for a shift in approach. In ratifying the Paris Agreement, countries have pledged to limit the increase in average global temperature to below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Meanwhile, protection of the environment features heavily in the SDGs: countries commit to creating sustainable cities and communities, promoting responsible consumption and promotion, and taking climate action – all measures that could help fulfil the Cop21 agreement.  “What’s exciting about the SDGs is the interconnectedness,” said Archana Patkar, networking and knowledge management programme manager for WSSCC, at an event organised by the Guardian alongside the UN General Assembly in September. So how can the development and environment sectors collaborate and align their efforts in achieving these interconnected goals? Where can parallels be found between the two sectors? How can efforts to improve economic growth be made without harming the environment? And which “dynamic new ways of working” can environment and development professionals adopt to achieve the SDGs?

"Carbon emissions from human activities have driven significant changes to the climate in Australia, including about 1C of warming and an increase in extreme hot days and fire weather, according to the latest State of the Climate report released by the CSIRO and Bureau of Meteorology. This year the report includes new information on the cause of extreme weather, pointing the finger clearly at carbon emissions from human activities, as well as the latest findings on warming in the oceans.  The report said record hot average daytime temperatures in 2014 were mostly caused by the extra carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Researchers found that without the greenhouse gases, the daytime temperatures would have been warm but not record-breaking. Similarly, another study discussed in the report found that record-breaking temperatures in September 2013 were 85% a result of carbon emissions, and 15% due to natural variations in temperature. Karl Braganza, from the Bureau of Meteorology, said the science attributing extreme weather events to climate change has matured in the past few years. “Two years ago, these studies were emerging in the literature. But now we’ve had a good five solid years of these studies in the international literature,” Braganza said. The report also contained new data on warming affecting the deep ocean, with warming now detected 2km below the surface. “We now know that the upper two kilometres of the oceans have stored more than 80% of the extra heat that has accumulated since 1970,” said Steven Rintoul, director of the new CSIRO climate science centre. “And if we include all of the ocean, that increases to 93%. In that sense, global warming is really ocean warming.” Most of the other findings continued to show the same concerning trends seen year after year. The report found that Australia’s surface air temperature and surrounding oceans have warmed about 1C since 1910. Monthly maximum temperatures that occurred just 2.2% of the time between 1951-1980 increased in frequency more than five-fold, occurring 11.45% of the time between 2001 and 2015. “The main point really is to summarise the state of the science, in particular with regard to observations of changes in the climate science, with a particular focus on Australia,” Rintoul said. “It further strengthens the evidence that climate change is happening now and having an impact on Australia.” Braganza said because of the climate changes that are already happening, the Bureau of Meteorology is focusing on helping to inform the country about how to adapt to those changes. “Climate change is obviously happening now,” he said. “We know there is a tangible impact now, and we know the climate system is going to warm as a response to greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere over the next few decades.  “So in some ways there is more of a focus on informing adaptation to what we know is happening, as well as mitigation. For the bureau, that’s sort of where we’re sitting in our operations: informing near-future adaptation.”"

"Australia is lagging behind other countries on tackling climate change after signing the historic Paris Agreement last year, a new report shows. The Climate Council’s new report, “Towards Morocco: tracking global climate progress since Paris,” questions Australia’s ability to meet its 2030 emissions reduction target.  It says Australia is likely to face serious pressure next week when world leaders meet in Marrakesh, Morocco, for the first time since the landmark Paris agreement was signed. Eighty-seven countries have ratified the Paris agreement, including 10 of the largest polluters. These countries cover more than 55% of global emissions. The Paris agreement will come into force on 4 November. The world’s top three emitters of carbon dioxide – China (27%), the US (15%) and India (7%) – have ratified the agreement. Australia has not yet ratified the agreement. Prof Will Steffen, a climate change expert and researcher at the Australian National University, told Guardian Australia it was “virtually certain” that 2016 would be the hottest year on record. “I think Australia will face quite a bit of pressure at the meeting, because when you look at the targets we made in Paris, they’re weak compared to other countries in the G20,” he said. “And even with those weak targets, we’re not on track to meet them. So I think there’s going to be some very direct questioning of Australia about its effort, about what its plans are and what policy instruments it plans to use in coming years to significantly reduce emissions.” The Climate Council report says Australia’s emissions reduction target of 26% to 28% by 2030 (on 2005 levels) relies on the introduction of energy productivity and vehicle efficiency measures, which the federal government has yet to bring into force. “The most recent update of Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions shows our emissions are rising,” the report says. “Countries including China and the United States have put more than 30 questions to the federal government, asking for detail about how Australia will meet its 2030 emissions reduction target and raising concerns about a lack of transparency over how the government calculates and reports emissions.” A year ago in Paris, at the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), world leaders agreed to limit global temperature rise to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels. The agreement was signed by 197 countries, including Australia. But the Climate Council says if Australia is to fairly contribute to staying below the 2C target, a “more rapid downward trend in emissions from all sectors of the economy is required, with much stronger action to reduce our emissions.” There has been widespread expert criticism of the government’s Direct Action climate policy. Experts argue the framework is not sufficient to deliver the emissions reductions Australia signed on to in Paris. There has also been a change of political emphasis in the Turnbull government over renewable energy. Greg Hunt, the then federal environment minister, at the Paris conference, gave state governments clear encouragement to develop their own renewable energy schemes. “I have encouraged the states that if they want to do something extra, [they should] apply reverse auctions to the renewable energy target (RET) in the way the Australian Capital Territory has done,” Hunt said last December in Paris. But since the election, the Turnbull government has been sharply critical of state-based renewable energy targets that will help Australia meet its Paris commitments. State governments argue the commonwealth will not be able to meet the emissions reduction targets agreed in Paris without the state-based RET schemes. Correspondence from a senior federal official to the energy regulators after an energy council meeting in August seen by Guardian Australia underscores that point, suggesting the state-based schemes will deliver just under 40% of renewables in the national electricity market by 2030. The Coalition has agreed to review the Direct Action climate policy in 2017, but the government has played down expectations that review will lead to a significant strengthening of the current policy framework, despite the widespread criticism of the current regime. The South Australian government has signalled it wants to build broad support across the states for a form of carbon trading to apply to the electricity sector."
"Neil DeGrasse Tyson, 58, is an American astrophysicist who is the director the of Hayden Planetarium in New York. A committed science communicator, he frequently appears on US television shows and has published 13 books, the latest of which is called Welcome to the Universe. This summer a rocky, potentially Earth-like planet called Proxima b was found orbiting the nearest star to our sun at a distance where liquid water could exist on its surface. Some have mooted it might be habitable. What do you think?I’d say we need to know a little bit more about nearby planets, like Mars, and some nearby moons within our solar system, like Europa around Jupiter or [Saturn’s] Enceladus. These have tantalising properties that could support life as we know it, but in its extremes – extreme cold, extreme dehydration or extreme radiation. And if we find life in our solar system, that bodes very well for life being ubiquitous. Then practically any planet we find that has been around long enough, we’d go there expecting to find life rather than simply wondering if it is there.  President Obama has reiterated the goal of sending humans to Mars by the 2030s and to bring them back. That seems ambitious, to say the least…I am critical of it in a different way. Obama is saying we will put a man on Mars in 2030, under the leadership of a president yet to be determined, on a budget line not yet established. I like that somebody is dreaming that way, but I don’t know the cost to him of making that promise. So I have my scepticism that it would actually come to pass. Should we go back to the moon first?I think we should remind ourselves how to go to the moon, but I think Mars is vastly more interesting, biologically, because it has evidence of liquid, running water – it’s had water for billions of years. I’ve always wanted to keep Mars in our sights, even if we do choose to go back to the moon. Would you go to Mars?I would, but only after the person who made the spaceship had sent their mother first! I am not an early adopter of stuff that has never been done before, but I am glad we have bold people who live and walk among us who do take those risks. We would never have left the cave were it not for folks such as that. Who is going to get to Mars first: Musk? Bezos? Nasa? Boeing? China?By my read of history, the only thing that will get to Mars first is a government-driven space programme, such as Nasa. And why? Because it has never been done before, not with people – it is expensive and it has unquantified risks. When all three of those are operating there is no business model that you can establish. I think what is much more likely to unfold is the government wants to go to Mars, SpaceX and other companies want to build the spaceship and Nasa pays them for it. Their business model is selling to the government. There is some debate around what life might look like elsewhere in the universe; there might be intelligent life in the form of artificial intelligence or microbes. What’s your bet?I like it all. If Earth is any kind of example at all, then most life you’ll find would be microbial. But consider also that if you can make a robot that knows how to make a robot from natural resources and you sent this robot off to a planet and it lands and makes three more of itself and they want to go to three other planets, you could populate the entire galaxy in a relatively short amount of time. Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking have voiced concerns about AI. How about you?I am completely relaxed. I would claim that AI will rise up, solving bits of challenges that we have put in our way and those bits in total would be a sort of stunning application of computers in the service of human need. Is a self-driving car going to stand up, wield a weapon and shoot you? No! Given how we have managed to damage the Earth, should we be looking for other places to live?If you want to ship a billion people to Mars and have them live there as they are living on Earth, you’ll have to terraform Mars – and that means turning Mars into an oasis of some kind. If you had the power of geoengineering to terraform Mars into Earth, then you have the power of geoengineering to turn Earth back into Earth. So the argument that if we trash Earth we need another planet doesn’t work. I am not convinced that escaping Earth and leaving others behind to die is the most sensible solution out there. With the Paris agreement, have climate change sceptics finally been overcome? Are we all on the same page?I tweeted a couple of weeks ago something that seemed to resonate with people. It was something like: “Personal truths are established by faith, objective truths are established by evidence and political truths are established by incessant repetition.” So you can make anything true that you want, as long as you repeat it all the time. So Trump keeps calling her “Crooked Hillary”. That’s just part of her new name now – the first bit is Crooked, her second name is Hillary. You repeat this often enough and then you go interview Trump supporters and they say: “Well, she’s crooked.” A new political truth has arisen simply by repetition. With politics, the only way you can undo what people think is true, but isn’t, is to vote them out of office. What do you think of the candidates?Again I have a slightly different view. You’ll never see me complaining about someone who is running for office. Never. The issue is not who is running, or even what their thoughts are. The issue is that your fellow citizens are thinking one way versus another in the elections. So if you don’t like Trump, your gripe is not with Trump – he’s just a person. Your gripe is with the 40% of the electorate that wants to vote for him. That’s who you should be talking to. If people think they are voting in their own interests – but are not – then they need to be trained how to think about claims made by politicians. You roasted rapper BoB over his claims about a flat Earth on Twitter...There are too many people out there to waste that kind of energy on, so why was he different? Because he has millions of Twitter followers and he invoked physics to show the Earth was flat. Well, those are fighting words, so then I looked at the tweets where he said he’d got physics and then I posted my tweets saying you need some more physics. And then I showed people how to calculate it all and where he went wrong. But I would rather train people to think straight in the first place than fix them later, when it is sometimes too late. You’ve said you are “simultaneously flattered and disturbed when, after posting various tweets, people tweet back wondering if I’m on drugs”. Is that just because your tweets reflect mind-bending thoughts about the universe?The thoughts I have every day are the kind of thoughts others might only have in a bar, in a pub after a couple of beers when they are contemplating their existence, but we do this all the time in astrophysics. In the UK, in the wake of Brexit, there has been a lot of talk of being in a “post-truth” environment. How do you feel about that?If that is how you feel, then that is the beginning of the end of an informed democracy. Watch other countries rise up as you not only lag but regress. All the growth economies will be elsewhere because innovation and science and technology and investments in what are objectively truths are the foundations of tomorrow’s economies. If you reject it then you will be forfeiting everything that such a great nation has worked so hard to obtain. My point is that if you do not embrace objective truths, just move back to the caves, that is where you’re going to be eventually.

"The good news - according to the World Energy Council (WEC) - is that, per person, our energy demand is set to peak before 2030. Of course, there will be more of us around by then too, so that total demand will only slow, rather than level out. A heady whiff of technological optimism accompanies the explanation that this will happen because of “unprecedented efficiencies created by new technologies and more stringent energy policies”.   The bad news is that under the scenarios drawn up by the WEC, even keeping to the upper target agreed in Paris of global warming no greater than 2C will require an “exceptional and enduring effort” that goes beyond any current commitments and needs a price for coal, oil and gas that is dramatically higher.  To sweeten this pill, the WEC gives its scenarios names which must appear funky in the world of energy policy. “Modern jazz” is about shiny, digitally driven markets, the slightly less enthusiastic “Unfinished symphony” is about emerging greener models for growth, while “Hard rock” is a future of both low and grubby growth. The problem with these and many other scenarios that emerge in the mainstream, is the intellectual editing that occurs before they even begin. Most share two overwhelming, linked characteristics that strictly limit any subsequent room for manoeuvre. Firstly the demand for energy itself is seen as something innate, unchallengeable and unmanageable. It must be met, and the only question is how.  Secondly, the assumption remains that the principles and practices of the economic model that has dominated for the last 30 years will remain for at least the next 30 years. There is no sign yet of the ferocious challenge to neoliberal orthodoxy happening at the margins of economics shaping mainstream visions of our possible futures. The merest glance at the history of changing ideas suggests this is short-sighted. There are reasons why we need to get a move on with tackling energy demand. Extreme weather events abound. Record flooding in North Carolina in the United States follows record flooding in Louisiana earlier in the year. While no individual event can be described a direct cause and effect relationship, increasingly heavy rainfall and flood events are consistent with climate models for a warming world. It’s nearly a year on from the wettest UK December on record in 2015. Subsequently, work by the World Weather Attribution project estimated that the odds for that rainfall event were increased by 50-75% by climate change.  Now, insurers in the UK complain that householders are failing to protect their properties from flooding, while the Environment Agency says that insurers preside over a system in which risk is simply rebuilt where flooding has already taken place. The Climate Change Committee says the UK is off track to meet its mid-century carbon reduction target, just as key decisions on aviation expansion and fracking look set to lock in emissions-intensive infrastructure.  Scenarios for industrial transition are needed that tell a bolder and more convincing tale, not just of the UK meeting its international obligations that are written into treaties, but that go further and stand a genuine chance of limiting warming to 2C. What sort of scenarios should we be looking at then? We can learn from the impoverished Brexit debate that was marred by binary choices cloaked in wilful misinformation. For the whole population to fully understand our options, and the choices and challenges embedded in them, we should be thinking as openly and broadly as possible. We can look at how far techno-fixes will get us, and at the maximum speed and scale of change that market mechanisms and the pricing of carbon are likely to deliver. In both, the different impacts on rich and poor need assessing.  But we should go further to assess the pros and cons of radical scenarios for changing how we live and work. Rarely considered but important variables come from new economics, including the shorter working week, the share economy, shifts in corporate ownership and governance, and intelligent but deliberate measures for economic localisation. Compare these to the “stumble on”, or business as usual scenario, in which we give up control of our future to a permanently destabilised climate change, but also assess seriously the consequences of the argument for planned so-called “de-growth” of the economy. At the height of the 2008 financial crisis, the UK government promised to “go beyond the conventional thinking” to put things right. It never did, but with the climate crisis there is no choice. Conventional thinking is off-course and contradictory. Without a balanced, comparative assessment of strategies to align energy use and industry with inescapable climate action, we won’t be able to choose the best possible future. I’m glad to say that work like this is beginning to happen at places such as the University of Leeds’ centre for industrial energy, materials and products. It’s going to mean telling better stories of change, rewriting rules and breaking ideological chains all around, but hey, that’s jazz …"
"Is climate change still happening? You don’t hear so much about it, do you? It’s like the Doctor Who reboot – I presume it’s still going on, but it’s struggling to stay in the headlines. These days it’s all Bake Off, Trump, Isis and Poldark. It must still be happening, because if it had stopped we would definitely have heard – you don’t hear much about Sean Connery, but it’ll be all over the news when he dies. A sudden halt in global warming would be an unmissable opportunity for climate change deniers to crow, for dark-souled petrol salesmen to denounce the scientific community as a bunch of delusional tree-huggers, for the scum of the earth to lay into the Friends of the Earth. So, I think it’s safe to say climate change is still happening and the world’s scientists aren’t facing the spectre of being wrong instead of the more familiar spectre of being doomed. What a relief.  As I understand it, then, the situation remains that human activities, particularly those that emit carbon dioxide, are elevating the planet’s temperature in a way that, if unchecked, and maybe anyway, will render most of it uninhabitable by humans. That’s still on the cards. Suddenly I’m feeling a lot more relaxed about Brexit. But is it really, definitely happening? Well, again, as I understand it, the overwhelming scientific consensus is that it is. Manmade climate change is as certain as anything can be. Of course, there are people who say it isn’t, who have fuelled much discussion (fuel is often their business), but then there are people who will deny the hands in front of their faces: there’s a school of maverick historians that claims the years AD614 to AD911 never occurred; there are people who think Elvis or Hitler still live, or that they live with each other, or that they recently split up after a row about Jeremy Corbyn. There is no assertion, no matter how self-evident, that is completely safe from contradiction. If humans are to survive, it is imperative that “Is climate change a myth?” move from the same discussion category as “Should we introduce proportional representation?” to the same one as “Is the Queen a lizard?” What brought all these Christopher Eccleston-era reflections to mind was Theresa May’s announcement last week about Heathrow airport – or rather her announcement last week that she’s going to make an announcement next week. It’s all incredibly involved and tedious: next week the government will finally say, after decades of dithering, whether Heathrow will get another runway, or a longer runway, or whether, instead, Gatwick will get another runway. But it isn’t really finally, because under a “special derogation”, ministers who are pissed off with the choice (because, say, their constituencies are near Heathrow) will be allowed to openly moan about it and then it’ll probably be 2018 before MPs vote on the issue, in order to allow lots of time for a public debate. It’s the nature of this debate that frightens me. There are plenty of people opposed to extending Heathrow: Zac Goldsmith says he’ll resign as an MP if it gets the go-ahead, a promise considerably more likely to be kept than Boris Johnson’s pledge to “lie down in front of the bulldozers”. Philip Hammond and Justine Greening have also previously declared against. For Labour, London mayor Sadiq Khan opposes it too and favours a new Gatwick runway. But all of this mainstream opposition seems to focus on the air and noise pollution (previously known as pollution and noise) it would cause in west London – hence the preference for the more rural Gatwick. Only the Greens and Lib Dems have even floated the notion of not extending an airport at all. This is bonkers. Climate change is definitely happening. Aviation contributes hugely to it. So global levels of aviation must be significantly reduced. Why is it, then, that everyone with a whisker of a chance of power agrees that London’s airport capacity should increase? It’s not one side saying “Let’s close an airport” and the other saying “Let’s not” – that would be a reasonable spread of opinion when the need to reduce air travel was accepted. Instead, it’s both sides saying “Let’s hugely extend an airport”. The only debate we’re having is over which one. You may not believe this, but I am not a very environmentally friendly person. I would much rather turn a tree into a chair, a pizza box and a roaring fire than hug it. I don’t much care about endangered species. For me, the environment, the delicate global ecosystem, is somewhere for humans to live. It’s collectively ours and I think we can do what we like with it. But it’s got to remain livable in and livable from. That’s not leftwing, it’s just obvious. And I can’t believe all those scientists are lying, much as I would genuinely like to. In this crisis, we’re suffering a potentially disastrous failure of leadership. Would Theresa May deny climate change? I doubt it. Would Sadiq Khan? No way. So why on earth, specifically on earth, do they want to extend an airport? For the sake of London’s economy. Well, excuse the cliche, but you can’t take it with you. I know I’m ignoring the political realities and the importance of seeming pro-business, but isn’t actual, physical reality a political reality too? Isn’t the habitability of the planet good for business? But politicians aren’t making these arguments. Instead, they’re acquiescing in a situation where there’s no overlap between the politically possible and the environmentally uncatastrophic. It may be too late. In which case, hey, build the runway. We might as well die prosperous. If we despair of reducing our environmental impact, if we’re convinced the international agreements don’t go far enough and won’t be observed anyway, then let’s extend away. Maybe the anti-climate change lobby is going to switch to that argument – from “It’s not happening, so we don’t need to change our ways” to “Yeah, our bad, it was always happening, but it’s unstoppable now, so there’s no point in changing our ways”. It’s a logical approach, but, if accurate, it makes me feel a bit of a heel for fathering a child. There is a ray of hope. We will undoubtedly spend billions extending one airport or another but, on Britain’s current form, that probably means global air travel actually will be reduced after all. Heathrow could be the reverse Field of Dreams: build it and they won’t come. We can use sod’s law to save the world."
"The independent commission charged with deciding whether a new runway should be built in the UK started a report last year by declaring that air links were vital for the economy, trade and investment. It went on to select Heathrow as the best site. After 15 months of deliberation, on Tuesday, the government backed this verdict.  Britain’s biggest airport has long since reached capacity, turning away airlines that would like to operate there. An enormous amount of high-value exports go through Heathrow, which carries more cargo than all other UK airports put together. Businesses have clustered around the airport and the Airports Commission, chaired by Sir Howard Davies, estimated that a third runway would provide up to 77,000 more local jobs. It would also stimulate economic growth throughout Britain, the commission said. More long-haul routes to emerging markets had been a mantra even before the UK voted for Brexit and a potential separation from its European trading partners. Heathrow has argued that only a hub airport with sufficient connections to other cities makes these routes viable. Almost three-quarters of long-haul flights out of Britain depart from Heathrow. An enlarged Heathrow could provide more connecting flights to the rest of the UK – allowing, for example, Scottish salmon fisheries to swiftly fly their produce around the world.  How true this turns out to be remains to be seen. Regional flights have a poor record at the west London hub, and airlines that pay a premium for Heathrow slots have preferred more lucrative routes than trying to grow new markets. Witness British Airways’ recent decision to ditch Chengdu in favour of New Orleans. But the overwhelming view of business groups, looking at a share of the £211bn in extra economic growth and 180,000 jobs promised by the commission, is that a third runway is long overdue. Gwyn Topham Speaking in 2008, Theresa May said: “The third runway at Heathrow would undermine our national [climate change] targets.” The prime minister, having backed a third runway, might have changed her mind, but the move remains a giant leap of faith – without a parachute. The truth is that sharp cuts in global emissions are urgently required and one-quarter of Britain’s carbon budget will need to be splurged on aviation by 2050, according to the Committee on Climate Change. Even keeping aviation emissions to this level requires increasingly efficient planes, biofuels and carbon taxes running into the hundreds of pounds per ticket. The committee has asked the government to come up with a strategy to show how these actions can be implemented.  The response has been to pass the buck. “The government believes that action at the global level is the most effective means of tackling aviation emissions,” the government said in October 2015. But global leaders are also passing the buck. The international aviation deal reached this month does not cut aircraft emissions. Instead, it offsets aviation emissions growth by paying other sectors to curb their emissions and is voluntary until 2027. If the climate friendliness of the third runway depends on huge, politically unimaginable tax rises on flights by the UK government and an end to international buck passing, what is to be done? Identifying the real reason for increased flights is key: it is not business, whatever proponents of runway expansion tell you. The proportion of flights taken for work is small and has been flat or falling for a decade, according to government data. Damian Carrington The wise politician avoids saying never. David Cameron’s “No ifs, no buts, no third runway” quote was catchy and memorable. Three years later, he set up the Airports Commission. It was merely a way of backfilling evidence behind a decision already taken, some observers believed.  Cameron has gone. May, whose anti-third runway Maidenhead constituents will liven up her surgeries over the coming years, will grow tired of being reminded that she condemned Labour’s decision to authorise the third runway in 2009 on environmental grounds. Approving the third runway now, like Hinkley, is part of May’s determination to invest in infrastructure. But she faces a torrid time from her party. The prime minister has set up some canny and innovative political arrangements to head off cabinet resignations. The decision on Heathrow was taken in a cabinet sub-committee, but the convention of collective responsibility ties all her senior ministers to the move. In a highly unusual manoeuvre, they are licensed to dissent, but not campaign against the decision. That may be a tough line to police, given the verbal dexterity of her chief opponent, the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson. The education secretary, Justine Greening, already unhappy over the grammar school decision, is another leading opponent and previously threatened to resign over the issue.  Zac Goldsmith, the MP for Richmond Park, could announce that he is standing down in protest. This would trigger a byelection in which he will almost certainly stand as an independent. Away from Westminster, Conservative councillors are manning the barricades. West and south-west London boroughs including Hillingdon, Richmond and Wandsworth are strongly opposed. So are Labour-controlled neighbours such as Hounslow. The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, could fund a legal challenge.  Theresa May will also have to face down criticism from as many as 60 hostile Tory backbenchers. But even if there is a majority against Heathrow expansion at Westminster, it is unlikely to delay the project. The only vote in the Commons, it seems, would be on the national policy statement for aviation, expected sometime in the next 18 months. However, protests against the decision are likely to be the most committed and politically challenging since the poll tax in 1990. Anne Perkins "
"It is a simple fact that climate change has a much smaller presence in contemporary literary fiction than it does even in public discussion. As proof of this, we need only glance through the pages of literary journals and book reviews. When the subject of climate change occurs, it is almost always in relation to nonfiction; novels and short stories are very rarely to be glimpsed within this horizon. Indeed, it could even be said that fiction that deals with climate change is almost by definition not of the kind that is taken seriously: the mere mention of the subject is often enough to relegate a novel or a short story to the genre of science fiction. It is as though in the literary imagination climate change were somehow akin to extraterrestrials or interplanetary travel. There is something confounding about this peculiar feedback loop. It is very difficult, surely, to imagine a conception of seriousness that is blind to potentially life-changing threats. And if the urgency of a subject were indeed a criterion of its seriousness, then, considering what climate change actually portends for the future of the Earth, it should surely follow that this would be the principal preoccupation of writers the world over – and this, I think, is very far from being the case. But why?  Why does climate change cast a much smaller shadow on literature than it does on the world? Is it perhaps too wild a stream to be navigated in the accustomed barques of narration? But the truth, as is now widely acknowledged, is that we have entered a time when the wild has become the norm: if certain literary forms are unable to negotiate these waters, then they will have failed – and their failures will have to be counted as an aspect of the broader imaginative and cultural failure that lies at the heart of the climate crisis. Clearly, the problem does not arise out of a lack of information: there are surely very few writers today who are oblivious to the current disturbances in climate systems the world over. Yet, it is a striking fact that when novelists do choose to write about climate change it is almost always outside fiction. A case in point is the work of Arundhati Roy: not only is she one of the finest prose stylists of our time, she is passionate and deeply informed about climate change. Yet all her writings on these subjects are in various forms of nonfiction. When I try to think of writers whose imaginative work has communicated a more specific sense of the accelerating changes in our environment, I find myself at a loss; of literary novelists writing in English only a handful of names come to mind: Margaret Atwood, Kurt Vonnegut Jr, Barbara Kingsolver, Doris Lessing, Cormac McCarthy, Ian McEwan and T Coraghessan Boyle. No doubt many other names could be added to this list, but even if it were to be expanded to 100, or more, it would remain true, I think, that the literary mainstream, even as it has become more engagé on many fronts, remains just as unaware of the crisis on our doorstep as the population at large. I have been preoccupied with climate change for a long time, but it is true of my own work as well, that this subject figures only obliquely in my fiction. I have come to be convinced that this discrepancy is not the result of personal predilections: it arises out of the peculiar forms of resistance that climate change presents to what is now regarded as serious fiction. ... In his seminal essay “The Climate of History”, Dipesh Chakrabarty observes that historians will have to revise many of their fundamental assumptions and procedures in this era of the Anthropocene, in which “humans have become geological agents, changing the most basic physical processes of the Earth”. I would go further and add that the Anthropocene presents a challenge not only to the arts and humanities, but also to our common sense understandings and beyond that to contemporary culture in general. There can be no doubt, of course, that this challenge arises in part from the complexities of the technical language that serves as our primary view of climate change. But neither can there be any doubt that it derives also from the practices and assumptions that guide the arts and humanities. To identify how this happens is, I think, a task of the utmost urgency: it may well be the key to understanding why today’s culture finds it so hard to deal with climate change. Indeed, this is perhaps the most important question ever to confront culture in the broadest sense – for let us make no mistake: the climate crisis is also a crisis of culture, and thus of the imagination. Culture generates desires – for vehicles and appliances, for certain kinds of gardens and dwellings – that are among the principal drivers of the carbon economy. A speedy convertible excites us neither because of any love for metal and chrome, nor because of an abstract understanding of its engineering. It excites us because it evokes an image of a road arrowing through a pristine landscape; we think of freedom and the wind in our hair; we envision James Dean and Peter Fonda racing toward the horizon; we think also of Jack Kerouac and Vladimir Nabokov. When we see an advertisement that links a picture of a tropical island to the word paradise, the longings that are kindled in us have a chain of transmission that stretches back to Daniel Defoe and Jean-Jacques Rousseau: the flight that will transport us to the island is merely an ember in that fire. When we see a green lawn that has been watered with desalinated water, in Abu Dhabi or southern California or some other environment where people had once been content to spend their water thriftily in nurturing a single vine or shrub, we are looking at an expression of a yearning that may have been sparked by the novels of Jane Austen. The artefacts and commodities that are conjured up by these desires are, in a sense, at once expressions and concealments of the cultural matrix that brought them into being. This culture is, of course, intimately linked with the wider histories of imperialism and capitalism that have shaped the world. But to know this is still to know very little about the specific ways in which the matrix interacts with different modes of cultural activity: poetry, art, architecture, theatre, prose fiction and so on. Throughout history these branches of culture have responded to war, ecological calamity and crises of many sorts: why, then, should climate change prove so peculiarly resistant to their practices? From this perspective, the questions that confront writers and artists today are not just those of the politics of the carbon economy; many of them have to do also with our own practices and the ways in which they make us complicit in the concealments of the broader culture. For instance, if contemporary trends in architecture, even in this period of accelerating carbon emissions, favour shiny, glass-and-metal-plated towers, do we not have to ask, what are the patterns of desire that are fed by these gestures? If I, as a novelist, choose to use brand names as elements in the depiction of character, do I not need to ask myself about the degree to which this makes me complicit in the manipulations of the marketplace? In the same spirit, I think it also needs to be asked, what is it about climate change that the mention of it should lead to banishment from the preserves of serious fiction? And what does this tell us about culture writ large and its patterns of evasion? In a substantially altered world, when sea-level rise has swallowed the Sundarbans and made cities such as Kolkata, New York and Bangkok uninhabitable, when readers and museum-goers turn to the art and literature of our time, will they not look, first and most urgently, for traces and portents of the altered world of their inheritance? And when they fail to find them, what can they do other than to conclude that ours was a time when most forms of art and literature were drawn into the modes of concealment that prevented people from recognising the realities of their plight? Quite possibly, then, this era, which so congratulates itself on its self-awareness, will come to be known as the time of the Great Derangement. ... On the afternoon of March 17, 1978, when I was 21, I was stuck in the middle of the first tornado to hit Delhi in recorded meteorological history. As is often the case with people who are waylaid by unpredictable events, for years afterwards my mind kept returning to my encounter with the tornado. Why had I walked down a road that I almost never took, just before it was struck by a phenomenon that was without historical precedent? To think of it in terms of chance and coincidence seemed only to impoverish the experience: it was like trying to understand a poem by counting the words. I found myself reaching instead for the opposite end of the spectrum of meaning –for the extraordinary, the inexplicable, the confounding. Yet these too did not do justice to my memory of the event. Novelists inevitably mine their own experience when they write. No less than any other writer have I dug into my own past while writing fiction. It is certainly true that storms, floods and unusual weather events do recur in my books, and this may well be a legacy of the tornado. Yet oddly enough, no tornado has ever figured in my novels. Nor is this due to any lack of effort on my part. Indeed, I have returned to the experience often over the years, hoping to put it to use in a novel, only to meet with failure at every attempt. On the face of it there is no reason why such an event should be difficult to translate into fiction; after all, many novels are filled with strange happenings. Why then did I fail, despite my best efforts, to send a character down a road that is imminently to be struck by a tornado? In reflecting on this, I find myself asking, what would I make of such a scene were I to come across it in a novel written by someone else? I suspect that my response would be one of incredulity; I would be inclined to think that the scene was a contrivance of last resort. Surely only a writer whose imaginative resources were utterly depleted would fall back on a situation of such extreme improbability? Before the birth of the modern novel, wherever stories were told, fiction delighted in the unheard-of and the unlikely. Narratives such as those of The Arabian Nights, Journey to the West and The Decameron proceed by leaping blithely from one exceptional event to another. Novels too proceed in this fashion, but what is distinctive about the form is precisely the concealment of those exceptional moments that serve as the motor of narrative. This is achieved through the insertion of what Franco Moretti, the literary theorist, calls “fillers”. According to Moretti, “fillers function very much like the good manners so important in Austen: they are both mechanisms designed to keep the ‘narrativity’ of life under control – to give a regularity, a ‘style’ to existence”. It is through this mechanism that worlds are conjured up, through everyday details, which function “as the opposite of narrative”. It is thus that the novel takes its modern form, through “the relocation of the unheard-of toward the background ... while the everyday moves into the foreground”. As Moretti puts it, “fillers are an attempt at rationalising the novelistic universe: turning it into a world of few surprises, fewer adventures, and no miracles at all”. This regime of thought imposed itself not only on the arts but also on the sciences. That is why Time’s Arrow, Time’s Cycle, Stephen Jay Gould’s brilliant study of the geological theories of gradualism and catastrophism is, in essence, a study of narrative. In Gould’s telling of the story, the catastrophist recounting of the Earth’s history is exemplified by Thomas Burnet’s Sacred Theory of the Earth (1690) in which the narrative turns on events of “unrepeatable uniqueness”. As opposed to this, the gradualist approach, championed by James Hutton (1726‑97) and Charles Lyell (1797–1875), privileges slow processes that unfold over time at even, predictable rates. The central credo in this doctrine was: “Nothing could change otherwise than the way things were seen to change in the present.” Or, to put it simply: “Nature does not make leaps.” The trouble, however, is that Nature does certainly jump, if not leap. The geological record bears witness to many fractures in time, some of which led to mass extinctions and the like: it was one such, in the form of the Chicxulub asteroid, that probably killed the dinosaurs. It is a fact that catastrophes waylay both the Earth and its individual inhabitants at unpredictable intervals and in the most improbable ways. Distinctive moments are no less important to modern novels than they are to any other forms of narrative, whether geological or historical. It could not, of course, be otherwise: if novels were not built upon a scaffolding of exceptional moments, writers would be faced with the Borgesian task of reproducing the world in its entirety. But the modern novel, unlike geology, has never been forced to confront the centrality of the improbable: the concealment of its scaffolding of events continues to be essential to its functioning. It is this that makes a certain kind of narrative a recognisably modern novel. Here, then, is the irony of the “realist” novel: the very gestures with which it conjures up reality are actually a concealment of the real. What this means in practice is that the calculus of probability that is deployed within the imaginary world of a novel is not the same as that which obtains outside it; this is why it is commonly said, “If this were in a novel, no one would believe it”. Within the pages of a novel an event that is only slightly improbable in real life – say, an unexpected encounter with a long-lost childhood friend – may seem wildly unlikely: the writer will have to work hard to make it appear persuasive. If that is true of a small fluke of chance, consider how much harder a writer would have to work to set up a scene that is wildly improbable even in real life. For example, a scene in which a character is walking down a road at the precise moment when it is hit by an unheard-of weather phenomenon? To introduce such happenings into a novel is in fact to court eviction from the mansion in which serious fiction has long been in residence; it is to risk banishment to the humbler dwellings that surround the manor house – those generic out-houses that were once known by names such as the gothic, the romance or the melodrama, and have now come to be called fantasy, horror and science fiction. ... So far as I know, climate change was not a factor in the tornado I experienced. But the thing it has in common with the freakish weather events of today is its extreme improbability. And it appears that we are now in an era that will be defined precisely by events that appear, by our current standards of normality, highly improbable: flash floods, hundred-year storms, persistent droughts, spells of unprecedented heat, sudden landslides, raging torrents pouring down from breached glacial lakes, and, yes, freakish tornadoes. This, then, is the first of the many ways in which the age of global warming defies both literary fiction and contemporary common sense: the weather events of this time have a very high degree of improbability. Indeed, it has even been proposed that this era should be named the “catastrophozoic” (others prefer such phrases as “the long emergency” and “the penumbral period”). It is certain in any case that these are not ordinary times: the events that mark them are not easily accommodated in the deliberately prosaic world of serious prose fiction. Poetry, on the other hand, has long had an intimate relationship with climatic events: as Geoffrey Parker points out, John Milton began to compose Paradise Lost during a winter of extreme cold, and “unpredictable and unforgiving changes in the climate are central to his story. Milton’s fictional world, like the real one in which he lived, was ... a ‘universe of death’ at the mercy of extremes of heat and cold.” This is a universe very different from that of the contemporary literary novel. I am, of course, painting with a very broad brush: the novel’s infancy is long past, and the form has changed in many ways over the last two centuries. Yet, to a quite remarkable degree, the literary novel has also remained true to the destiny that was charted for it at birth. Consider that the literary movements of the 20th century were almost uniformly disdainful of plot and narrative; that an ever greater emphasis was laid on style and “observation”, whether it be of everyday details, traits of character or nuances of emotion – which is why teachers of creative writing now exhort their students to “show, don’t tell”. Yet fortunately, from time to time, there have also been movements that celebrated the unheard-of and the improbable: surrealism for instance, and most significantly, magical realism, which is replete with events that have no relation to the calculus of probability. There is, however, an important difference between the weather events that we are now experiencing and those that occur in surrealist and magical realist novels: improbable though they might be, these events are neither surreal nor magical. To the contrary, these highly improbable occurrences are overwhelmingly, urgently, astoundingly real. The ethical difficulties that might arise in treating them as magical or metaphorical or allegorical are obvious. But there is another reason why, from the writer’s point of view, it would serve no purpose to approach them in that way: because to treat them as magical or surreal would be to rob them of precisely the quality that makes them so urgently compelling – which is that they are actually happening on this Earth, at this time. • Amitav Ghosh’s The Great Derangement: Climate Change and the Unthinkable is published by University of Chicago."
"Soaring mercury, sinking cities, mass extinctions. It is easy to catastrophise climate change: faced with the sheer enormity of the climate challenge, people can tend towards despair and nihilism. For others, its seeming distance (both chronologically and, for many of us in the global north in particular, geographically) can seduce us with the easy denial that it is someone else’s problem to fix.  The technology and resources to move towards a post-carbon society are essentially all there. What we lack is a broad, civic movement to get behind the urgency – and significant opportunities – of this transition. So rather than looking darkly into a dystopian future in which we are passive victims, it is vital to make climate change relevant in the here and now – the air we breathe, the food we eat, the way we travel. Human-scale things we have agency to change. We need to find new ways to narrate and envision a fairer, cleaner future in which we can actively participate.   This year’s annual Lovelock Commission Cloud Crash by artist duo HeHe, a collaboration of Cape Farewell, the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and the Museum of Science and Industry (MSI) in Manchester, is an example of how art can enable major public engagement in what former chief scientific advisor Sir David King posits as ‘the biggest challenge of all time’.  The Lovelock Commission takes inspiration from pioneering climate scientist James Lovelock’s Gaia Theory, which posits the earth as a single self-regulating organism – and this year the commission focuses on atmospherics - namely, man-made emissions. The headline event for this year’s Manchester Science Festival, Cloud Crash seeks to make pollution – and its component part, climate change – visible, and asks some uncomfortable questions of society.  The role of the scientist and that of the artist is to make the invisible visible. Gone are the pea soupers that choked London 60 years ago. Today’s pollution is largely invisible to the naked eye – and all the more insidious for it. A recent study by King’s College London revealed that 9,500 Londoners die each year due to long-term exposure to air pollution, and that levels of pollution in major cities including London, Leeds and Birmingham will exceed legal limits until at least 2030. WHO estimate exposure to the particulate matter - small particulate matter of 10 microns or less in diameter (PM10)- caused 3 million premature deaths worldwide per year in 2012 through cardiovascular and respiratory disease, and cancers. This invisible menace needs to be brought into the light so that we can understand what we are fighting. With Cloud Crash HeHe took as point of departure the air quality forecast maps produced by the (NERC funded) National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS) – that show, in hauntingly beautiful detail, levels of ozone, particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide as it sweeps across the UK.  What they have produced are three new pieces placed in-situ across the MSI site. In Airbag an ordinary car has crashed against a steel post in the courtyard. In a playful reversal of the polluting emissions of everyday cars (one of the largest contributors to lethal nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter emissions), this car has become a suspended cloud chamber, insulating a floating microclimate from the outside world. It is an object of reflection and provocation – as HeHe explain ‘there is a certain irony in admiring the beauty of such a fragile atmosphere, held inside an object which is so violently transforming our own unprotected airspace.’  Diamonds in the Sky is an immersive audio-visual experience based in the Air and Space Hall, that imagines a swarming cloud of pollution particles slamming into the side of Beetham Tower – Manchester’s landmark skyscraper which has come to symbolise the post-industrial reinvention of the city. Expanding on pollution forecast maps, this video piece highlights invisible ozone, nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter using vivid saturation colour – each particle per million represented by a pixel. Finally, Burnout asks difficult questions of the arts industry and its role in climate change. A scale-model of the Tate Modern belches out vapour clouds – as if it is simultaneously an art museum and an active energy producer. The building’s original incarnation was Bankside, London’s major fossil-fuel power station from 1952 to 1981, whereas today Tate Modern is often referred to as an ‘art powerhouse’. By so doing, Burnout confronts both the building’s past and the arts sector’s modern day collusion with the fossil industry. Despite a recent decision from Tate to drop BP sponsorship after 26 years, the sector is still overshadowed by certain partnerships. For instance, what many pressure groups such as BP or Not BP call the ‘controversial and ironic’ sponsorship of ‘Sunken Cities’ exhibition by BP (a show rebranded as ‘Sinking Cities – Flooding our World’ by Greenpeace in a publicity stunt back in May) Above and beyond, Cloud Crash explores a key issue – that to consume and create culture of all kinds is also to consume energy, however it may be sanitized. Brilliant organisations such as Julie’s Bicycles are doing vital work in helping the arts sector reduce their own environmental impacts. Without this, even the most successful public engagement activity and artworks relating to climate change could prove something of a Phyrric victory. Artists and scientists are natural collaborators, both are explorers and storytellers, seeking out new ways of understanding, communicating (and indeed, changing) the world around them. So when it comes to the dry (or simply terrifying) language of climate science, the marriage of the two can be particularly fruitful. Artists can respond to environmental data in work that provokes real engagement. By communicating these issues in lateral, innovative ways, by using humour and humanity, these sorts of works can reach us on a more animal, cellular, level – and therefore, hopefully, demand our response.  It is important to remember that the dialogue between artists with scientists is two-way. The innate creativity of artists can also inform the work of scientists. NERC’s recent call for public engagement pilot activity celebrates this dialogue, as they seek to support new work that engages members of the UK public with relevant contemporary issues of environmental science whilst also building engagement capacity in the environmental science research community - in particular providing opportunities for early career researchers and PhD students to develop skills in they way they approach, and present, their own research. The arts can come to the service of sciences as much as the other way round. When it comes to climate science it is all about finding the right language and tone for it - reframing it as an opportunity not sacrifice, making tangible the intangible and giving agency where once there was apathy. Above all, we need to make climate change relatable to us all – and in this there is a great deal more work to do. It is vital that climate-focused arts reach as wide and varied an audience as possible. Diversity is critically important in the climate battle, enabling the society-wide engagement it demands. Lucy Wood is an arts producer with a focus on climate change, food systems and migration. She is Director of international environmental arts charity Cape Farewell. She is on twitter as @lucywoodie.

"The head of a usually quiet environmental group in Australia has hit back against News Corp and coal lobby attacks after hacked emails revealed it was partly funded from overseas.  Two emails forwarded to Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta – and published by WikiLeaks – show that one of the funders of the Sunrise Project is a large US-based charitable trust, the Sandler Foundation.  The Sunrise Project, headed by the former Greenpeace activist John Hepburn, works with other environmental non-governmental organisations, local communities and Indigenous groups, supporting and helping to coordinate their actions. It has campaigned to stop Adani’s huge Carmichael coalmine in Queensland. After revealing the emails, a report in the Australian newspaper said: “Australia is a key target in a global, no-holds-barred war against coal which has set a priority of shutting Adani out of Queensland.” The paper said in an editorial: “We should decide what mining projects are opened up in this country and the circumstances in which they open. “Such authority rests with Australia’s democratically elected representatives and established government processes. It does not belong with overseas governments (including prospective US presidents or their staff), self-appointed meddling international activists or local vigilante ‘lawfare’ litigants funded by activists.” The paper also published an opinion piece by Brendan Pearson, the chief executive of the main coal lobby group, the Minerals Council of Australia. “This episode should prompt a rethink of the oversight of environmental groups that operate as charities and that have tax-deductible recipient status,” Pearson said. Hepburn told Guardian Australia he was surprised the emails were considered newsworthy and said the Australian and the Minerals Council of Australia were acting hypocritically. “They’re saying that we need to guard our sovereignty from environmental organisations, when the mining in Australia is 80% foreign-owned,” he said. “They put tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars into a massive public relations machine that is sustained and ongoing over time. They have incredible influence and revolving doors between the highest levels of politics and their lobby groups. “And international foreign-owned mining companies dropped $20m into a campaign to prevent a new tax on their industry and, in doing so, destabilised a prime minister. And that is the big issue in terms of national sovereignty.” Hepburn said it should be no surprise that people around the world were interested in Adani’s proposed mine.  He said: “It is no surprise that the ongoing expansion of coalmining in Australia is on the radar of Clinton’s most senior adviser. While the world is ratifying the Paris climate agreement in record time, Australia is becoming a global embarrassment for being the first developed country to go backwards on climate policy and fast-tracking the approval of new coalmines.” In May 2015 Hepburn sent an email to a director of the Sandler Foundation outlining attacks the then Abbott government was launching against the charitable status of environmental groups. The email was then forwarded by the founder of the Sandler Foundation, Herbert Sandler, to Podesta. Forwarding the message, Sandler said: “Astonishing and frightening actions by Australian government.” He then said: “Full disclosure. We are a funder of the Sunrise project as part of our work on climate change.” The only other published email relating to the Sunrise Project was one in which Hepburn was celebrating a federal court decision that overturned federal environmental approval for the Carmichael mine. The contents of the emails show the Sunrise Project was keen not to disclose who its funders were, or who it supported financially. Hepburn wrote: “We are seeking advice on steps we might take to avoid disclosure, challenge and limit disclosure, or to ensure that any disclosure is limited to the committee members and is not made public. “I have no concerns whatsoever about our compliance with our charitable obligations but I do have concerns about the potential PR impact of disclosure of both our funding and grantees – should that eventuate.” Hepburn told Guardian Australia the disclosure would make its donors targets of the mining industry. “The mining industry will use any possible excuse to attack the environmental movement,” he said. “We’ve seen the same thing play out in Canada and other countries too – mining industries will attack the charitable status, they will try and identify donors and publicly attack the donors, whether they are local or international philanthropists.” He said donors to any charity expect to be able to do so privately. “If you give a donation to the RSPCA or some other charity, you don’t expect them to disclose that to the media. That’s the same with us – we’re no different to any other charity. We need to protect the privacy of our members and supporters.”"

"My how far we’ve come in less than eight years. We have seen happen what those of us in the climate and energy fields knew could happen. The US has become a world leader on climate change, dramatically increased our production of clean and renewable fuels, reduced our emissions of greenhouse gases, signed major international agreements to continue progress into the future, and have done so without cost increases or power disruptions that the denial community proclaimed would occur. As we in the United States get ready to elect a new president, it is helpful to think about the impact a president can have. Particularly since we transitioned from the worst climate president ever (Bush) to the best (Obama). I am going to detail what I think are Obama’s signature accomplishments.  In my mind, the most important part of President Obama’s legacy on climate is that he changed the conversation. He showed that not only should the US play a role in reducing emissions, but we can do just that. He showed that this problem isn’t too big to solve. In fact, most of the solutions are subtle enough that we don’t even notice them. He showed that we can change our future for the better. With respect to specific actions, the Clean Power Plan is one of his biggest accomplishments. By working with the EPA, he created the first ever carbon pollution standards for the largest source of pollution – power plants. He did this in the midst of a do-nothing congress that fought him every step of the way. Under his presidency, we made huge investments in clean energy, which are paying off already. Jump starts to the wind and solar industry have led to enormous cost decreases – dirty energy isn’t cheaper anymore. It is really astonishing – wind power has tripled and solar power has increased by 30 times since he took office.  Under his presidency, we improved standards for fuel economy of our vehicles, which not only reduces pollution but also saves money. Furthermore, Obama set targets to reduce the federal government’s emissions by nearly 20% by 2025. He has worked to reduce other types of greenhouse gases such as methane and hydrofluorocarbons, not only within the US but through international agreements. And those aren’t the only international efforts. Obama made a joint plan with China that is almost unbelievably ambitious. It will reduce our emissions by approximately 27% by 2025 and puts major limits on Chinese emissions as well. He also forged an agreement with India to help low-income countries transition to modern economies that are not as polluting as current developed nations. There are many more items which would be too numerous to mention but I wanted to know how his presidency is viewed within Washington DC. I mean, among climate scientists, he is the president we’ve been waiting for, but what do legislators think? I asked representative Betty McCollum from Minnesota for her view. Ms. McCollum has a long history of focusing on the environment in general and climate change in particular – long before it was popular. She told me: President Obama has acted boldly to address the threat of climate change at home and abroad. He has demonstrated American leadership on the world stage in forging the Paris agreement and the Kigali amendment, steps that would have been unthinkable under his predecessor. And, using existing law, President Obama has helped shape a new approach to domestic carbon emissions with the Clean Power Plan. Sadly, Republicans in Congress have consistently put polluters ahead of our planet and attempted to stymie every administration initiative on climate change. That has made President Obama’s job tougher – and it makes his accomplishments on climate even more impressive. We are certainly not out of the woods yet on climate change. We cannot stop climate change entirely. But, what the last eight years have shown is that we can do really meaningful things that will reduce the impact. If the US can go from world laggard to world leader in just one presidency, imagine what else is possible."
"Exxon Mobil Corp asked a federal court on Monday to throw out a subpoena from New York state that would force the oil company to hand over decades of documents as part of a wide-ranging inquiry into whether it misled investors about climate change risks.  The filing means Exxon has now requested the US district court in Fort Worth, Texas for injunctions against two major climate subpoenas: one issued by New York and another from Massachusetts that the company challenged in June.   Exxon, which for more than a decade has acknowledged the risks of climate change, has criticised the prosecutors’ inquiries as politically motivated.  A group of state attorneys general, led by New York, said in March they would go after the world’s largest publicly traded oil company for allegedly violating securities laws by soft-pedaling the dangers of climate change and efforts to fight it.  Judge Ed Kinkeade has yet to rule on Exxon’s requests in the high-profile case.  But in a statement to the court last week, Kinkeade said he would be concerned if there was “bias or prejudgement about what the investigation of Exxon would discover” when Massachusetts attorney general Maura Healey issued her subpoena.  Her office was not immediately available for comment on Monday. Eric Soufer, spokesman for New York State’s attorney general, accused Exxon of forum-shopping.  “Exxon will do everything in its power to distract, delay, and avoid any investigation into its actions, which may have violated state securities and consumer fraud laws. Exxon’s latest claims in its stunt litigation in Texas are meritless,” he said.  On Friday, New York filed in a New York court to derail Exxon’s latest request. In its filing, Exxon said New York’s inquiry has periodically shifted focus, first by looking for misleading comments about climate change, then moving onto the value of its reserves and how they might be “stranded” in the ground by carbon regulation in the future.  Exxon said in September the US Securities & Exchange Commission is the right agency to vet how it books reserves and that it complies with accounting and securities laws.  Some legal experts have said that, regardless of Exxon’s past comments on climate change, it could not have violated securities laws because investors gather their information from a variety of entities with disparate views.  The case is 4:16-cv-00469 in US District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Fort Worth division."
"Major investors have warned the automotive industry it needs to accelerate its readiness for a low-carbon world if it is to retain their support and prosper. Vehicle makers must put climate change specialists on their boards, engage better with policy-makers, and invest more heavily in low-emission cars, says a network of 250 global investors with assets of more than $24tn (£20tn).  The demands come in a new report, Investor Expectations of Automotive Companies, published this week by the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC). “Long-term investors want to ensure that automotive companies are prepared for the challenges stemming from climate change, new technologies, changing policies and shifts in demand caused by global trends,” says Dr Hans-Christoph Hirt, co-head of investment house Hermes EOS, a member of the IGCC. “Investors expect the industry to embark upon a smoother route to future prosperity by developing and implementing long-term business strategies that are resilient to climate change and resulting regulatory shifts.” Chris Davis, senior programme director of the Ceres Investor Network on Climate Risk, another IIGCC member, agrees. “A growing number of institutional investors recognise that climate change will impact their holdings, portfolios, and asset values in the short and long-term,” he says. “To achieve sustainable returns for clients and beneficiaries, investors in the automotive sector must engage to ensure companies are prepared to thrive in a carbon-constrained environment and support robust policy action sufficient to drive the transition to clean vehicles.” The traditional car industry has gradually been increasing its output of pure electric and hybrid diesel/electric models, but in small numbers. It has failed to shrug off its image as a foot-dragger in the fight against climate change – similar to the way most big oil companies are seen. The recent Volkswagen emissions scandal, in which the German car manufacturer used “cheat devices” that underplayed pollution on its cars, has further tarnished the industry’s image over the last 12 months. And critics have long claimed that few vehicles live up to the fuel consumption levels claimed of them. Making sure the industry has “closed the gap between real world and emissions testing” is highlighted by the IIGCC as one of the key issues that must be fixed. But the finance houses also want car and truck makers to set more meaningful targets and metrics to reduce greenhouse gases in their own supply chain. And car companies need to engage more meaningfully with international policymakers and their own investors on climate change. Big investors point out that large car companies face serious threats inside their own sector from innovators such as the California-based automaker Tesla, evangelists for climate change and producers of low-carbon electric vehicles. And the finance houses say the move towards driverless vehicles, being pioneered by the likes of Google, poses a threat of even more severe potential new competition for the traditional car firms. Last year’s Paris climate change agreement has increased the urgency for the big manufacturers such as Ford, VW and Toyota to move more quickly, the report warns. They point to a recent study by the Moody’s credit agency that highlighted the potential dangers of tighter regulations for vehicles. And the new IIGCC report warns that the automotive industry is already exposed to “a plethora of CO2 and pollutant emission reduction targets in all major markets”. It says that tougher vehicle standards have already been implemented or are on their way in Australia, Brazil, China and India, as well as the US and Europe. And it stresses that governments are increasingly incentivising the use of electric vehicles in countries such as Norway and Holland."
"At first glance, it has been a bafflingly bad summer for butterflies. After a decent spring in the north-west and a dazzling late summer in the south-east, garden buddleias remained bereft. The only butterfly I’ve seen in good number is the red admiral, which thrived during the second-warmest September on record. The scientific numbers are not yet in from the UK Butterfly Monitoring scheme (a magnificent dataset collected by 2,000 volunteers each summer which celebrates its 40th birthday this year) but the Big Butterfly Count recorded its worst figures since it began – worse than the washout of 2012.  “Because the summer weather wasn’t anything like as bad as 2012, the finger is pointing at the mild, wet winter,” says Matthew Oates of the National Trust. Most of us probably don’t consider last winter an “extreme” event, but it was wet and violently mild. December 2015 was the warmest ever in the Met Office’s Central England Temperature series stretching back to 1659. It’s the most anomalous month ever recorded – 5.1C above average, more than double the ordinary monthly average. We may have barely noticed last December, but butterflies did. Caterpillars emerged from their diapause, found nothing to eat and perished. “The interesting thing is the species that did worst this summer are generally those that spend the winter as larvae,” says Oates: the purple emperor, silver-washed fritillary and white admiral all struggled this year. We need more scientific research on the impact of mild, wet winters, but such correlations are fiendishly difficult to prove. “It’s scary,” says Oates of the mysterious impact of extreme weather. Small children won’t be the only ones wishing for snow this winter. Butterfly lovers will be too.  "
"Unseasonably warm and dry conditions, which affected much of the south-east of the US in October, have continued over the past few days.  A wide area from Texas, to Mississippi, Alabama and Florida, has had day-time temperatures reaching into the high 20s and low 30s celsius, with some areas barely getting any rainfall for over a month.   The drought conditions are being caused by a deflected jet stream, carrying moisture and rain further north and allowing high pressure to persist through the south-eastern US.  A storm system accompanied by strong northerly winds brought the first significant cold spell of the season to northern Iran over the past week, particularly to the mountainous province of Ardebil. While snow is not unusual here, the rate at which it accumulated led to disruption to transport and power, and also the closure of schools and public buildings.  In some areas more than 40cm of snow was reported in a 48-hour period and some of this was delivered by thunderstorm activity, causing an unusual combination of lightning strikes and snowfall.  Violent thunderstorms and torrential rain struck parts of Egypt late last week, generating destructive floods. At least 30 people are confirmed to have been killed by the flooding, and more than 70 injured. Large-scale damage was caused to buildings and power supplies. In several settlements neighbouring the Red Sea cars were carried away from land and into the sea by the power of the flood water. The clean-up is expected to take several days. "
"The amount of electricity generated from UK coal power stations is on track to fall by two-thirds this year, a decline which analysts said was so steep and fast it was unprecedented globally. Climate change thinktank Sandbag said the drop was due to a doubling in the price of a carbon tax and the lower price of gas. The group has written to the chancellor, Philip Hammond, urging him not to water down the carbon floor price in this month’s autumn statement, which the steel industry has been lobbying the government to do. Using data up to the end of October from the Office for National Statistics and the national grid, the thinktank estimated coal generation would fall 66% by the year’s end. Coal generation fell 23% in both 2015 and 2014 on the year before, and 10% in 2013.  Energy industry sources said the forecast for 2016 appeared to be broadly in line with expectations. This year has seen a series of record lows for coal after three major plants closed, including the last remaining coal plant in Scotland. For several days in May the country’s coal plants produced no power for the first time in more than a century, and output was so low that from April to September, solar panels generated more power. “It’s on top of four years’ worth of falls,” said Dave Jones, an analyst at Sandbag. “That fall is completely unprecedented. Everyone’s talking about what they can do to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, people talk a few percentage points here or there, but 66% is completely unprecedented in any country ever.” Jones said the price of a tonne of carbon doubling from £9 to £18 in 2015 under the carbon floor price scheme was the driving force making coal plants uneconomic. Gas, which has been cheaper this year, has largely filled the gap in recent months.  The government last year pledged to phase out coal power entirely by 2025 to help meet its climate change commitments, but is yet to issue a consultation on the move. Sandbag said the decline in coal had seen emissions from the fuel go from 22% of the UK’s total carbon footprint in 2012, to just 5% now.  Official statistics show emissions dropped 4% in 2015 due to a rapid decline in coal, and the fall will almost certainly be much greater this year. “The carbon price support has driven a remarkable decarbonisation of UK electricity,” said Jones. “The UK is now on track for a coal phase-out before 2025, but the chancellor must maintain the carbon price support, or emissions will begin growing again.” UK Steel confirmed it was lobbying the government to reduce the carbon floor price to bring down energy prices."

"Cities that mimic forests, bricks made from converted carbon dioxide and highways lined with wind turbines powered by traffic. These are ideas that, for now, still belong to a distant, brighter future – when the world’s focus can be turned from halting runaway climate change to actually reversing it.  Yet these were among the innovations showcased in a two-day Commonwealth brainstorming session in London, attended by leading climatologists. As the world enters an ominous new era of “climate change reality,” the organisation is now seeking to inject them into the policy debate days before a potentially pivotal COP 22 summit in Marrakech from 7-18 November.  For an organisation that has sometimes appeared to be searching for a purpose, it may now be finding one – as a pioneer for the game-changing solutions some of its 52 members are desperately crying out for. “This is exciting. It’s possible, and for once our children are going to be proud of us,” the Commonwealth secretary general, Patricia Scotland, told the gathering. “Instead of saying we are a load of geriatric no-hopers who have ruined their world, we will be the pathfinders who can say we have repaired the building and we are really sorry for screwing up.”  US biologist Janine Benyus said: “If we can put pilot projects down on the ground in Commonwealth countries it will be like piloting the sort of regenerative world we need to create, making use of different biospheres, countries with different profiles.” Benyus is credited with popularising the theory of “biomimicry” or how nature can provide the design inspiration for solving humanity’s problems. “The normal climate-change conversation has been about large utilities solving the problem,” she said. “What’s an individual to do? They are not going to put up a large solar power utility, for example. But they do have homes and farms which, in aggregate, can make a big difference as part of a framework, and that’s where an organisation like the Commonwealth can come in.” Ideas and emerging trends exciting Benyus include carbon-absorbing concrete, ways of making ecologically destroyed landscapes flourish again by getting carbon back into the soil and new agricultural practices that mimic the ecosystems of wild, untended land.  In separate huddles at the Commonwealth’s London headquarters, thinkers envisaged buildings designed like termite mounds with the means to ventilate themselves with cool air, and groups of wind turbines that gather momentum by being arranged in tight formations, like schools of fish. Aside from technology, other suggestions took shape around more specific policy options – such as intensive investment in education of girls, which is seen as vital in mitigating the effects of climate change. Katharine Wilkinson is a climate change scholar working with environmentalist and entrepreneur Paul Hawken on a compendium of strategies designed to reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. She said: “Essentially what we see is that girls’ education has a direct line of impact [on] reproductive choices and rates of fertility. “So, while there are obvious benefits to educating girls, and the fact that [it helps] women and girls to survive the shock effects of climate change, such as natural disasters, it’s also important in that they are, for example, increasingly managing small-scale agricultural resources.”  Through high commissioners or senior diplomats representing each Commonwealth country, the organisation is aiming to promote ideas for climate-change reversal with their governments at home. Member states will also convene next year for what the organisation describes as a “climate-change reversal lab”. For some countries, the stakes are higher than others. As Lady Scotland told the workshop on Friday, some of the organisation’s island states in the Pacific and the Caribbean will be hit first and hardest. “I am offering myself as the advocate for climate regenerative change,” she told the workshop, calling on participants to come up with the solutions that could deliver a “quantum shift” in each of the Commonwealth’s member states when it came to climate change policy. “So often in the past people have said, ‘But I can’t get to speak to the politicians. I can’t get to speak to the scientists. I can’t get to speak to the money.’ So, in the Commonwealth we have a platform.” She hoped the meeting in June would create an individual roadmap for change for each of the 52 countries.  “We will start with some of the most vulnerable ones, the ones that will disappear, and we will see if we can’t drag the rest of the world with us,” she said."
"Norway is a country of contradiction. Internationally it’s seen as a green role model, what with its pledge to become climate-neutral by 2030, a reliance on hydropower and ambitious plans for electric cars. But at the same time, it’s one of the world’s largest exporters of oil and gas. It’s a paradox that has made a new generation of young Norwegians more environmentally conscious than ever. They are challenging politicians on their decisions over oil exploration – by filing a lawsuit against the government, for instance – and campaigning for a more sustainable future.  Students are also scrutinising Norwegian companies on environmental issues. “There’s definitely a push for sustainability in Norway right now,” says Lauren Guido, 21, who studies international development and environmental studies at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences. “The green movement is on people’s minds.” And students are at the heart of it. “Young people understand the urgency. We are the ones that will have to inherit the problems,” says Arnstein Vestre, 25, a student who works part time at Greenpeace Norway. Nature and Youth, a youth group with around 8,000 members aged 13-25, have filed a lawsuit against the Norwegian government, along with Greenpeace and other independent activists, over a decision to open up the Barents Sea for oil exploration. “Oil is the issue that’s most difficult to talk about in Norway,” says Ingrid Skjoldvær, 23, leader of Nature and Youth. “We’re seen as the good guy internationally, but we’re not doing what’s necessary at home. So we need to walk the walk.” The case centres around a claim that the government has violated part of the Norwegian constitution that says future generations have a right to a healthy environment. “It’s unique because this clause hasn’t been cited before, so it’s exciting,” says Skjoldvær. “Norway aspires to be a global leader on climate change and to inspire others to action,” adds Vestre. “But if we want to do that, we can’t have this kind of hypocrisy.” Younger school students also have strong views on Norway’s environmental issues. At “my city, my responsibility”, a project organised by InterBridge, a social enterprise that aims to empower citizens to participate in global issues, 19 school children were given a platform to make their demands of politicians. After four weekends of workshops and discussions, they presented their ideas in front of them, and the public, at Oslo City Hall. These included making greater use of renewable energies, reducing meat and dairy consumption, and making bicycles more easily available to the public. Amanda Anvar, 14, told politicians she worries about Norway’s global effect. “I want my children to grow up in a city where energy comes from a credible source, and where people on the other side of the world don’t have to suffer for us to use it,” she says. “Norway should focus on renewable energy, rather than our precious dirty gold, meaning our oil,” adds Michelle Ann Wurschmidt, 16. “Presenting to politicians was an emotional rollercoaster. But I want to show them that young people are capable of more than just using their parents’ money.” As school pupils take the politicians on, Norwegian university students are infiltrating corporations and challenging them to be more sustainable. As part of a project enabled by social enterprise the Innovation Effect, students are conducting research on Orkla, one of the largest companies in Norway, which sells food and home products and employs 30,000 people across more than 40 countries. The team of students has been scrutinising the company to see how it could be more environmentally friendly. Guido says that working inside an organisation, while remaining independent, puts you in a powerful position. “A lot of people think of big companies as the bad guys.” But working with business can make change happen, she adds. “We can be the bridge between them and the public.” The team of students presented their findings, which included a need for greater transparency and for more affordable sustainable products, to Orkla at Oslo Innovation Week this month. They spoke to a room full of business leaders – including Orkla – in the hope of inspiring other Norwegian businesses to take note. “Everyone says we have to save the world,” says Erlend Hjertø, 22, who studies at Kristiania University College. “And by challenging Norwegian companies, we’re giving an example of how we can do it.” This new generation of environmentally conscious students is well placed to make a difference. “When you’re young you have so many ideas and you’re not as naive as the big firms believe,” says Caroline Strømme, 25, studying at BI Norwegian Business School. “You’re not controlled by any firm because you’re not employed by them.” Guido agrees. “We have grit,” she says. “Because you can’t just go to university and get a job now. You have to be creative.” But young people need to communicate their values to older generations effectively, they say. “A lot of older people say climate change is in the distance,” says Anette Gutterød, 22, studying at Kristiania University College. “We don’t think like that. But we need to say it in a way the older generation understands.” Growing up in a country with some of the world’s best environmental policies, as well as an economy based on oil wealth, means young Norwegians have strong opinions on the environment. But even more of this generation need to raise their voices too, says Wurschmidt. “Many teenagers believe they don’t have a say in the decision-making going on in the world, but of course we have a say in the making of our future. We, the youth, need to claim the voice that is ours.” Keep up with the latest on Guardian Students: follow us on Twitter at @GdnStudents – and become a member to receive exclusive benefits and our weekly newsletter."
"In 1967, my father took me and eight of my brothers and sisters on a whitewater trip down the Colorado River through Grand Canyon National Park. We camped on its massive sandbars, swam in its silty waters and explored the ancient geology of this iconic American landscape. He wanted us to experience the river and to understand the benefits that stem from our nation’s commitment to protecting its inspiring natural treasures. I had these ideas in mind when I took my own daughter, Kick, down the Grand Canyon 40 years later, in 2007. We joined my old friend, the great anthropologist Wade Davis, and his daughter Tara. Davis was working on a book, and the four of us were guests of Imax cinematographer Greg MacGillivray, who released his film about our journey, Grand Canyon Adventure: River At Risk, in 2008.  The trip, book and film focused on the myopic water management policies that led to the construction of the two giant dams that bookend the Grand Canyon – Glen Canyon Dam and Hoover Dam – and the environmental devastation they’ve wrought. We weren’t aware, at that time, of another insidious threat facing the Canyon’s fragile ecosystems and the people who depend on them: uranium mining. As rock climbing phenom Alex Honnold pointed out here in the Guardian last May in a bold call to protect our public lands, the Grand Canyon is at once grappling with contamination from past mining and threatened by proposed new mining. Uranium’s boom-and-bust history has left hundreds of abandoned mines leaching toxic contaminants into this desert region’s vital water sources. In 2010, the US Geological Survey found that 15 springs and five wells within the Grand Canyon’s watershed had dangerous levels of uranium “related to mining processes”. The National Park Service warns hikers passing Horn Creek, within Grand Canyon National Park, not to drink the radioactive water, still poisoned by a mine that closed in 1969. Desert animals find life-sustaining moisture in collecting ponds where uranium concentrations can be 80 times greater than safe drinking water standards. On nearby Navajo lands, abandoned uranium mines have left a lethal legacy of cancer and disease among Navajo former mine workers and their families. New Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) research shows uranium in the bodies of newborn Navajo babies. Tens of millions of Americans downstream depend on the Colorado River for drinking water and crop irrigation, yet government regulators in the thrall of powerful mining companies allow uranium extraction to continue at sites near the Grand Canyon. The Canyon Mine, six miles from the South Rim, sits above an aquifer that provides the only source of water to the 700-member Havasupai Tribe. Recent surges in uranium prices prompted a rapid rise in mining claims, from about 1,000 a year in 2005 to more than 8,000 in 2009. Concerned about the impacts of a new uranium boom on this priceless American landscape, President Obama, in 2012, imposed a 20-year moratorium on new mining activity on more than one million acres of public land adjoining Grand Canyon National Park. The National Mining Association (NMA), whose membership includes many foreign companies, responded by suing to overturn the ban. Four states are supporting NMA’s suit, despite the real national security peril; this misguided litigation could allow potentially hostile foreign nations to mine nuclear material from lands owned by the American public. It is time to make President Obama’s temporary ban permanent. Last fall, Arizona Congressman Raúl Grijalva and southwestern tribal leaders collaborated on a bill that would do just that. The Greater Grand Canyon Heritage National Monument Act would establish a new national monument on 1.7m acres of public land surrounding Grand Canyon National Park. On 20 September this year, in a show of growing political will, US Representative Ann Kirkpatrick of Arizona joined Grijalva as the bill’s cosponsor. Monument status would end future uranium mining, protect grazing and recreational access, defend old-growth ponderosa pine forests and critical wildlife corridors, safeguard the human rights and cultural heritage of tribal peoples and augment the staggering economic contributions made by the nearly 6 million visitors who come to marvel at Grand Canyon National Park and its astonishing surroundings every year. The sensible piece of legislation has virtually no chance of consideration in our polarized Congress, but a poll released on 20 September shows broad support among likely American voters: 82% back monument establishment and 93% feel that the Grand Canyon is a national treasure for all Americans, not just people who live nearby. As labor and civil rights activist Dolores Huerta has pointed out, more than half a million people have submitted comments in support of Grand Canyon protection, and many organizations have endorsed the proposed monument. President Obama, who has made conservation and climate change mitigation cornerstones of his presidency, should honor that public will by employing the Antiquities Act to establish the monument. Threats to the Grand Canyon abound. Those sandbars I camped on with my family in 1967? They are gone. Three of the Grand Canyon’s eight native fish species are extinct. Glen Canyon and Hoover Dams have ended the Colorado River’s natural flush of sediment, which has backfilled and drastically reduced the storage capacity of Lakes Powell and Mead, a situation exacerbated by climate change. At the confluence of the Colorado and Little Colorado Rivers, as well as at the South Rim town of Tusayan, greedy commercial developers continue to push destructive projects. My father taught my siblings and me that these majestic landscapes, and the shared values of our constitutional democracy, were the common ground where Americans of diverse races, colors, cultures and religions became molded into a single nation. Historian Frederick Jackson Turner pointed out that our values and landscapes were intertwined; American democracy, he observed, emerged from the wilderness experience. President Obama remains in office until 19 January, 2017. He should be commended for already protecting more than 4m acres of land. For all of our daughters and sons, we must now prevail upon him to protect the Grand Canyon before we lose this historic chance.

"If you discover your favourite aromatic plants and herbs are looking chewed this autumn the culprit is almost certainly the rosemary beetle (Chrysolina Americana), an unwelcome new addition to the UK’s gardens – thanks to climate change. Despite its name, Americana, its original home is the Mediterranean and North Africa, but the increasing warmth of the British climate means it can now survive and thrive here. It was first seen London in 1994 and after a slow start it has rapidly spread in England and now reached Scotland and Northern Ireland.  While, as the name suggests, it is often found on rosemary, it also eats lavender, sage, thyme and other related aromatic herbs. These are plants which are normally pest free so this makes the beetle a doubly annoying invader. Both the rather startling metallic green and purple striped adult beetles and the more inconspicuous slug-like greyish white larvae feed on the same plants, chewing their leaves to stumps. The adults, about 6-8mm long, can be found at any time of year, but larvae that grow to the same size, are particularly active during warm autumn weather. A large infestation can reduce most of the plants in the herb garden to skeletons by spring. This has alarmed, among others, the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS), which has a helpful guide to this invader and how to control it. It also has a campaign to try and track where the beetle has now reached. The most recent map shows that it is now all over the south-east of England but elsewhere seems to do best in cities, like Manchester, where it is warmer. Large areas of countryside with frosty winters are so far still free of this pest. One of the problems with control is that many people grow the species that the beetle eats (apart from lavender) to flavour their cooking. Most pesticides which kill the beetles and their lava, also render the herbs uneatable, although the RHS suggest some brands that the makers say are not harmful to humans. However, pesticides will also kill a lot of beneficial insects including bees. Picking the adult beetles off is laborious so the RHS recommends giving the plants a good shake. On the advice site is a helpful video demonstrating how to place a big piece of white paper under a rosemary bush to catch them all. Someone else suggested an upturned umbrella. How this works for low growing thyme is not shown. In any event once captured they have to be squashed. The larvae remain active all through the winter or until they are fully-grown. By April all will have dug their way into the soil to pupate, emerging in early summer. Because the beetles live a long time they can be found on the plants all the year round. The adults do not appear to eat much in summer but in August they start munching, mate and lay eggs. The good news is that, come the spring, when the larvae disappear into the ground, most chewed plants recover, throwing out new growth to replace their lost leaves. However, the beetles have no natural predators in this country and will soon re-emerge, so control will be needed. Since the beetles are slow, and just hang about on their food plants, the summer is the best chance to fight back. "

"On a sunny October morning, our boat passes the run-down relicts of Liverpool’s maritime past and heads down the river Mersey and into the Irish Sea. As we steam offshore, I see in the distance a cluster of tall structures that soon reveal themselves to be towers of a wind turbine array. Arriving at the windfarm, six miles offshore, the turbines rise as high as 650ft, taller than the tallest church in the world. Each of the turbines’ three shiny metallic rotor blades is nearly 300ft long.  “A single rotation of an eight-megawatt turbine will cover the daily electricity consumption of an average British household,” says Benj Sykes, vice president of Dong Energy Wind Power, the company that is constructing and co-owns this wind project, as the boat rocks in five-foot swells.  Workers have been busy at the Burbo Bank extension, named for this patch of the Irish Sea, since June, using gigantic cranes to drive foundations 50ft into the sea floor. With a design capacity of eight megawatts each, the 32 turbines are the most powerful ever installed at a commercial offshore windfarm. Once the rotors start spinning later this year, the Burbo Bank windfarm will be able to power 230,000 households – enough to run Liverpool city, with its 466,000 inhabitants.  In Europe, offshore wind farms like the one at Burbo Bank are undergoing a boom. While still significantly outnumbered by windfarms on land, the importance of windfarms at sea has grown dramatically in the past several years. Until 2011, between 5 and 10% of newly installed wind energy capacity in Europe was offshore. Last year, almost every third new wind turbine went up offshore. That growth has helped boost the share of wind energy in the European Union’s electricity supply from 2% in the year 2000 to 12% today, according to WindEurope, a business advocacy group.  New investments for offshore projects totaled $15.5bn in the first half of 2016 alone, according to WindEurope, and newly installed offshore wind energy capacity will double to 3.7 gigawatts this year compared to 2015. More than 3,300 grid-connected turbines now exist in the North Sea, the Baltic Sea, and the Irish Sea, and 114 new wind turbines were linked to the grid in European waters in the first half of this year alone. This is in stark contrast to the US and Asia, where offshore wind use is only just getting started.  The offshore wind boom is part of a wider move from fossil fuels to renewable energy across the European Union. The overall share of renewable electricity sources in the EU – hydropower, wind, solar, biomass, and geothermal – has gone up from about 15% in 2004 to roughly 33% in 2014, according to data from Eurostat and Entso-E, the association of grid operators. Along with solar photovoltaic power, wind energy is driving this expansion. Newly installed wind energy capacity amounted to 13 gigawatts in 2015, twice as much as newly installed fossil fuel and nuclear capacity combined. WindEurope claims that all European wind turbines taken together can now generate enough electricity for 87m households.  This is not only a result of government subsidies and incentives, but also of dramatically reduced production costs for wind energy. The price for a megawatt hour is now between €50 and €96 for onshore wind and €73 to €140 for offshore wind, compared to around €65 to €70 for gas and coal. Electricity generated from onshore windfarms is now the cheapest among newly installed power sources in the UK and many other countries. If environmental costs are considered, the picture looks even more favorable for wind power.  Germany now meets one-third of its electricity demand with renewable energy, Denmark 42%, and Scotland as much as 58%. On some sunny or very windy days, renewables can now fully supply the electricity demand in these countries.  The picture isn’t entirely rosy, though. The European wind industry says that grid and storage infrastructure hasn’t expanded fast enough to soak up surplus wind energy, and that the fossil fuel and nuclear industries are trying to sabotage what is called Energiewende, Germany’s transition from coal and nuclear power to renewable energy. The wind energy boom, with its recurrent surges of surplus energy, has led to a dramatic decline in electricity prices in spot market trading at the European Electricity Exchange, with the price per kilowatt hour falling by as much as 50% in the last five years. With preferential treatment from EU governments, wind energy is now outcompeting coal-fired power plants, posing major challenges for utilities heavily invested in fossil fuels.  Out in the Irish Sea, however, Dong Energy’s Sykes shows no mercy for the fossil fuel industry. “Wind power on land is becoming the cheapest form of newly installed electricity capacity,” he says. “And even out here at sea, we can’t say anymore that there are technical hurdles.”  Dong Energy – co-owned by the Danish state, Goldman Sachs, shareholders, and two pension funds – is the European leader in offshore wind projects, surpassing competing companies like RWE Innogy, Iberdrola and Northland Power. Its full name – Danish Oil and Natural Gas – reflects its less-than-green history. Sykes personifies this transition. Before he joined Dong in 2012, the Cambridge University-trained geologist spent almost 20 years exploring for oil and gas reserves for large fossil fuel companies like Shell and the Hess Corporation. He says he left the fossil fuel industry and joined the wind business in part because of criticism from his environmentally minded children.  The reasons for the European offshore wind energy boom are manifold: For one, European governments and the EU as a whole have supported wind projects with favorable incentives as part of their CO2 reduction goals. In addition, the cost per megawatt hour has dropped by about 50% in the last few years alone for many projects, with a record low of $81 for Dong’s Borssele 1 and 2 projects – two soon-to-be-built wind farms off the Dutch coast. That’s compared to $155 for offshore wind installations just a few years ago.  Costs have fallen because production of wind turbines has become more industrialized and standardized and the size of turbines and generators has increased, thus harvesting wind more efficiently. In addition, offshore wind projects can reap the stronger winds found at sea, compared to land, and are far less likely to attract protests by neighbors who often object to their presence. There are also environmental concerns about how these industrial facilities affect sea birds and marine life, but so far this has not limited the expansion of offshore wind.  Sykes’ colleagues in the wind energy industry are more cautious about the future. At the WindEurope Summit in Hamburg last month, where several hundred industry representatives gathered, Giles Dickson, chief executive officer of WindEurope, said that European political and administrative leaders hadn’t come up with detailed plans of how each nation will achieve the goal to generate 27% of all energy (including transport and heat) from renewable sources by 2030, which would mean renewables would have to generate 47% of the continent’s electricity.  Maroš Šefčovič, vice president of the European commission, the union’s administrative body, said that while Europe has created 300,000 jobs in the wind industry, China, the US, and India are catching up fast.  Sigmar Gabriel, Germany’s former environment minister turned economics and energy minister, said it was time for the continent’s wind industry to rely less on subsidies and incentives and become more independent. “After years of guaranteed prices and feed-in tariffs,” Gabriel told the meeting, “the wind industry doesn’t need a puppy license any more.”  Analysts say that the main obstacle to further rapid expansion of Europe’s wind sector, offshore in particular, stems largely from political failure. European governments have yet to build up the new electricity grid infrastructure that could transport large quantities of renewable energy from often sparsely populated northern coastal areas to the industrial centers farther south. Germany, in particular, has not created favorable conditions for additional wind expansion. Despite being at the heart of Europe geographically and being a driving force in renewable advances, the country’s federal and state governments were not able so far to build long-promised north-south “power autobahns” to expand grid capacity and transport offshore wind to areas with heavy electricity consumption. Politicians have often given in to local opposition to new power lines, while putting cables underground, as is now envisaged in Germany, is costly and experiencing long delays.  This grid bottleneck means that in 2015 alone, 4,100 gigawatt hours of wind electricity – enough to power 1.2m households – could not be transported through the grid, according to the German Federal Grid Agency. “What is lacking in particular is a smooth expansion of grid connections and grid capacity to take up the electricity we produce,” Dickson said at the wind energy summit. What he got from Gabriel in response wasn’t a promise to speed up power line construction, but a policy statement on limiting newly installed capacity for offshore and onshore wind.  “In the past, our goal was maximum expansion and the motto was ‘the faster the better,’” said Gabriel. “But we have now reached limitations as the expansion of the grid system hasn’t kept pace.”  While in the past investors were able to simply add wind turbines to the grid and receive feed-in tariffs for their electricity, they now have to bid for a limited grid capacity.  A second obstacle is a lack of major storage sites for surplus wind energy. For many years now, European governments have pledged to support new storage technologies, such as large-scale batteries or using the growing network of electric cars for storage. Yet projects haven’t succeeded beyond pilot phases because of technological and economic challenges.  To long-term players in the field such as Henrik Stiesdal, a Danish wind power pioneer and former chief technology officer of Siemens Wind power, the situation is ironic: “While there were warnings in the past that wind energy would never be able to meet demands, politicians are now confronted with its abundance,” he said. Stiesdal sees storage technologies and better grid integration as opportunities, rather than problems – wind energy’s “golden bullets”.  “Once these problems are solved, wind will be able to cover the greatest part of the world’s electricity needs,” he says. The WindEurope business group says it could easily double the amount of wind electricity for EU consumption to almost 30% by the year 2030. The group argues that the recent ratification of the Paris agreement on climate change means the EU will have to pursue a more ambitious energy transition.  A visit to Dong Energy’s Burbo Bank project demonstrates the rapid progress the industry has made from its modest beginnings in the 1990s. It will take engineers and workers just a few months to assemble a facility that will provide electricity for a quarter-million households.  Like Stiesdal, Dong’s Sykes sees a bright future for offshore wind. He expects no impact from the UK’s Brexit and notes that the Burbo Bank extension is co-owned by an unlikely player in power production: the parent company of Lego, the toymaker. “Offshore is a reliable and increasingly cheap source of energy, with no lasting harm to the environment,” Sykes says. “It will soon be simply unbeatable.” "
"The amount of carbon needed to power the global economy fell to record lows in 2015, as coal consumption in major economies plummeted. PricewaterhouseCoopers’ (PwC) annual Low Carbon Economy Index report has found that the global carbon intensity (emissions per unit of GDP) fell by 2.8%.  This was more than double the average fall of 1.3% between 2000 and 2014, but far below the 6.5% required to stay within the 2C warming limit set by last year’s Paris agreement. “What we’ve seen in 2014-15 is a real step change in decarbonisation,” said Jonathan Grant, PwC director of sustainability and climate change. The result was just 0.1% lower than the previous year, but it occurred against the background of healthy growth, which usually spurs carbon emissions growth. “There was fairly reasonable economic growth in 2015, which is why we think this result is quite significant,” said Grant. The biggest driver was a decline in China’s coal consumption, which resulted a 6.4% drop the carbon intensity of the world’s second biggest economy. A centrally-led shift of the economy to a service-based industry has begun to shut down the vast coal-fuelled steel and cement sectors. For the first time, China led the rankings table for the biggest drop in intensity. The UK and US were also significant contributors, reducing by 6% and 4.7% respectively, to the overall drop as both governments introduced policies that pushed coal plants out of business. In the UK coal use dropped by 20% for the second year running. Richard Black, director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), said: “In the week in which the Paris Agreement comes into force, this is very promising news in showing that the dominant paradigm of economic growth is swiftly changing, which makes the Paris targets look more achievable. “This analysis shows once again that economic growth and carbon emissions are not inextricably linked… Climate science is unequivocal in showing that switching away from coal is an essential first step in keeping climate change within ‘safe’ limits.” But Grant said coal represented the low-hanging fruit and that economies were enjoying the benefits of relatively painless early decarbonisation. “Countries are focussing on decarbonising electricity. That means tackling coal power. I think it will get increasingly challenging. Coal is the easiest target for government policy,” he said."
"The Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF) is an anti-climate policy advocacy group in the UK that often releases misleading scientific “reports.” The group also hosts annual lectures, and this year, they booked a room at the Royal Society. Many members of the Royal Society expressed concern that the GWPF would exploit the organization’s credibility, and asked that the event be cancelled.  The Royal Society’s governing council met and decided to allow the event to proceed, for fear that cancellation would give it “an unwarranted higher profile.” As a spokesperson for the Royal Society told DeSmog UK:  The evidence shows us that the earth is warming and that recent warming is largely caused by human activities. Once that is accepted, there is scope for debate on the policy responses and that is the area that the GWPF claims to be interested in.  If the GWPF uses this opportunity to misrepresent the scientific evidence it would undermine the legitimacy of its views on policy responses to climate change. The lecture was delivered by writer Matt Ridley, and predictably, as is the norm for Ridley, the first three-quarters of his talk indeed misrepresented the scientific evidence. While Ridley doesn’t deny the most basic aspects of human-caused global warming, he is a self-prescribed “lukewarmer;” a group that falls into the category of Stage 3 climate denial. Ridley’s lecture is a 5,600-word Gish Gallop that would require a novel to fully debunk. However, he condensed his main arguments into four key points that are easily refuted: Why do I think the risk from global warming is being exaggerated? For four principal reasons. 1. All environmental predictions of doom always are; 2. the models have been consistently wrong for more than 30 years; 3. the best evidence indicates that climate sensitivity is relatively low; 4. the climate science establishment has a vested interest in alarm. Ridley’s first argument against the dangers of global warming is incredibly ironic. He claims that we have nothing to worry about because previous “environmental predictions of gloom” were wrong. But the reason his cited predictions of danger didn’t come to fruition, in most cases, is because we took action to stop them. For example, Ridley lists acid rain and cancer-causing pesticides among his purported “exaggerated” environmental concerns. Many pesticides that were widely used in the 20th century are indeed carcinogenic, and their agricultural use was banned under the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants. Acid rain caused by sulfur pollution was also a widespread problem until it was similarly addressed, for example through the Helsinki Protocol and a cap and trade system in the US whose economic benefits have outweighed its costs by a factor of roughly 100. Proposed solutions to global warming involve international agreements and cap and trade or other pollution pricing systems – the same mechanisms that successfully solved these previous environmental threats. Yet Ridley remarkably uses those threats as examples in his argument against taking similar steps to address the threats posed by climate change. It defies logic. I’ve written a book focused on the accuracy of climate model predictions, and in December I’ll be presenting a talk on the subject at the annual American Geophysical Union conference. In fact, the most recent research shows that climate models are even more accurate than previously thought. So, were I not familiar with Ridley’s long history of misrepresenting climate science, I would have been surprised that climate model accuracy is one of the main premises of his argument against climate concern. To make his case, Ridley relies on material from a few scientists like John Christy, presented not in peer-reviewed journals, but instead for example in Congressional hearings. Recently, as John Abraham wrote, climate scientists published a paper explaining the errors in those presentations. Models have also accurately predicted other key climate changes, for example in ocean heat content. There is simply no factual basis to Ridley’s argument against climate model accuracy. Joanna Haigh, Royal Society fellow and council member, told DeSmog UK of Ridley’s of third key argument: Ridley claims not to dispute the science, he then disputes climate sensitivity estimates with selective citations. This is a nice way of saying that Ridley cherry picks the evidence he prefers and ignores the rest. Cherry picking is one of the five telltale techniques of science denial. Being a self-described “lukewarmer” like Ridley generally means believing that the climate is relatively insensitive to the increased greenhouse effect, and that climate change is therefore of little concern. In his talk, Ridley claimed: recent attempts to measure the sensitivity of the climate system to carbon dioxide using real data nearly all find that it is much lower than the models assume. This claim is nonsense. There have been a few papers suggesting a relatively low climate sensitivity, and several subsequent studies have found those papers to be flawed. There have also been other studies “using real data” – for example, measurements of cloud and humidity changes – suggesting that the Earth’s climate sensitivity to the increased greenhouse effect is relatively high. It’s also important to note that were Ridley right about low climate sensitivity, it would only buy us perhaps a decade or two before the worst climate change consequences hit. In short, Ridley cherry picks the few papers that support his preferred position, neglects to mention that subsequent research has identified flaws in those studies, and ignores the vast body of research contradicting his beliefs. Ridley’s fourth key argument, and a theme throughout his talk, exemplifies another telltale sign of science denial – conspiratorial thinking. He accuses climate scientists of having “vested interests,” of delaying publication of their results (refuted by the accused scientists here), of deleting and “mysteriously…adjusting” inconvenient data, and so on. The easiest way to reject inconvenient data and expert conclusions is to declare that they’re somehow biased. It’s not unlike fellow climate contrarian Donald Trump’s claims that the presidential election is rigged against him. Whether it be an election or an argument, if the other side cheated and conspired, then you didn’t really lose. But there is no conspiracy. Ridley and GWPF want to risk humanity’s future on their belief that climate change isn’t dangerous. The problem is that their belief is premised on misleading, cherry picked, faulty, and conspiratorial arguments. As the Royal Society noted, by misrepresenting the scientific evidence, GWPF undermined the legitimacy of its policy views.  We should be have a climate debate about the best policies to solve the problem. Groups that deny the problem by misrepresenting science only serve to distract from that much-needed debate, and outside of Donald Trump’s Republican Party, they’re no longer being listened to."
"Current projections of global average sea level rise are now expected to double by 2100, which would be severely damaging – if not disastrous – for many of the world’s coastal cities, from Ho Chi Minh City and Mumbai to New Orleans and Miami. Yet the upcoming United Nations conference on sustainable urban development, Habitat III, is unlikely to create the international platform needed to tackle such a global threat, according to Dan Lewis, head of UN Habitat’s urban risk reduction unit.  “The communication of risk is something that most UN member states are not prepared to openly discuss, unless they happen to be Tuvalu or the Maldives or other South Pacific or Caribbean islands,” Lewis told the Guardian. “Massive [climate-induced] displacement is a big problem that a lot of member states have dressed up as other kinds of issues. But when it comes to the real nuts and bolts of ‘how do you accommodate 100,000 people from Kiribati in the next decade or so?’, I don’t think we are going to see much of an expression emerging about the practical aspects of a major situation like that.” Sea level rise – along with flooding, storms, heatwaves and other effects of climate change – receives only one (admittedly lengthy) mention in the 175-point New Urban Agenda which member states are due to adopt at Habitat III in Quito, Ecuador:  “We also recognise that urban centres worldwide, especially in developing countries, often have characteristics that make them and their inhabitants especially vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change and other natural and man-made hazards, including earthquakes, extreme weather events, flooding, subsidence, storms including dust and sand storms, heatwaves, water scarcity, droughts, water and air pollution, vector borne diseases, and sea level rise particularly affecting coastal areas, delta regions and small-island developing States, among others.” There are no direct references to climate-forced displacement nor potential remedies, Lewis notes. Yet he says there are an estimated 12 million people displaced worldwide because of climate events. The conference, which starts on 17 October, will also include announcements of specific commitments, such as helping local Florida authorities address sea level rise in low-lying, low-income areas. Of course, several factors that climate scientists are still working to understand – such as the fragility and likely collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet – mean questions about exactly how fast sea levels will rise, and where the effects will be most severe, must be left open. While the New Urban Agenda is a global, non-binding plan that aims to promote socially and environmentally sustainable cities, Lewis says the best option for many flood-risk cities looking to take action is to develop independent partnerships and networks to learn from each other – adding that this is the “cheapest and most effective way of doing work”. For example, the Netherlands embassy in Washington DC consults and collaborates with a number of vulnerable US cities, including Norfolk, Virginia, and New Orleans, Louisiana. According to Dale Morris, a senior economist at the embassy, some of the shared ideas follow the principle of adapting to living with water, not keeping it out. (About a third of the Netherlands is below sea level, with another third presently at sea level.) UN Habitat is gearing up to connect 20 cities, including St Petersburg and Beirut, through a “city resilience” programme that provides direct technical assistance to measure cities’ resilience and training. “There is a lot of work cities are already doing together that is going to get showcased [in Quito],” Lewis says. “There is a lot of sharing going on around specific hazards cities are facing, and there has been a kind of explosion around awareness in activities. Instead of older, historic approaches like creating levees, it will be positive to see how cities have progressed, and are adapting.” Of 533 cities, 89% recognise climate change as a significant risk, according to a recent report. But just 210 of 490 surveyed cities report an active climate adaptation plan. Individual city plans to mitigate the impacts of flooding and storm surge are often extremely expensive. They are also developed for fairly short-term timeframes – for example, in the case of Miami and its neighbouring cities – and without the support of the state or federal government. C40, a 10-year-old network of the world’s largest cities working to address climate change, provides an outlet to share both innovative solutions and the particular challenges facing the world’s poorer cities. “It’s very hard for poor cities to handle this, by and large,” says Seth Schultz, director of research and planning at C40’s New York office. “Many of them don’t have plans, and it is also just a question of the hazards they are facing in the short and long term.” “If we come in at the high end of the [sea level rise] projections, there will be many cities whose persistence will be difficult to imagine,” says Ben Strauss, director of Climate Central, a New Jersey-based independent organisation of scientists and journalists. “New Orleans can build levees higher and higher – but then they are just pearls on a necklace at some point, and everything around it could become water.” Projections of global sea level rise by 2100 range from 0.2 metres to 2.0 metres (0.66 to 6.6 feet). Strauss co-authored a recent study which found that even a sudden elimination of CO2 emissions up to the year 2100 would still leave more than six million Americans living on “endangered land”.

"This symbolic threshold (Carbon dioxide levels bring climate change into a ‘new era’, 25 October) is one of many very real tipping points the world will experience on a path of climate change due to human effects. The tipping points we should also be paying attention to are the mass extinctions, global warming, melting ice and complete habitat changes we are currently seeing worldwide. Soon we will recognise these not as symbolic thresholds but more as points of no return. The Paris and Kigali agreements are both important for slowing down the climate trend wiping out animal and plant species worldwide. But both are just bandages to the real problem of resource management and consumption practices exacerbating the problems to unsustainable limits.Caroline HernandezChevy Chase, Maryland, USA  • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com "

"China on Tuesday rejected a plan by US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to back out of a global climate change pact, saying a wise political leader should make policy in line with global trends, a rare comment on a foreign election.  The world is moving towards balancing environmental protection and economic growth, China’s top climate change negotiator told reporters, in response to a query on how China would work with a Trump administration on climate change.“If they resist this trend, I don’t think they’ll win the support of their people, and their country’s economic and social progress will also be affected,” Xie Zhenhua said.   “I believe a wise political leader should take policy stances that conform with global trends,” China’s veteran climate chief said.  Trump has threatened to reject the Paris agreement, a global accord negotiated by nearly 200 governments to battle climate change that takes effect on Friday.  Chinese officials are often hesitant to weigh in on foreign elections, although they will defend Chinese policies when attacked in candidates’ policy platforms.  Xie’s comments come as China plans to launch a national carbon trading scheme in 2017.  The scheme is on track and pilot programmes have already traded 120m carbon allowances with total transactions amounting to 3.2bn yuan ($472.29m), he added.  “It will take time for the market to be fully operational, but once it’s operational, it’ll be the largest carbon trading market in the world,” said Xie.  China’s coal consumption has declined as the world’s second-largest economy slows, but Xie said it was too early to decide if it had peaked.  China’s delegation of more than 80 negotiators will begin departing from Tuesday for global climate change talks in the Moroccan city of Marrakesh set for 7-18 November."

"They went to Kigali to eliminate hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and take 0.5C out of future global warming, and the 170 countries that successfully negotiated an amendment to the Montreal protocol treaty agreed to get rid of 90% of them. Not bad for four days and three long nights of hard work. The Kigali deal on HFCs is in fact fiendishly complicated and has taken years to negotiate in various technical and political forums. The final agreement, announced on Saturday morning caps and reduces the use of HFCs in a gradual process beginning in 2019.  More than 100 developing countries will start taking action from 2024, a date that has sparked concern from some groups that the changes will be implemented too slowly. A small group of countries, including India, Pakistan and some Gulf states, pushed for and secured a later start – 2028 – on the grounds that their economies need time to grow. But that is three years earlier than India, the world’s third-worst polluter, had first proposed. The result was achieved thanks to several factors: an ambitious scheme to give countries different time scales in which to phase out HFCs; major chemical and food companies accepting change; the determination of US secretary of state John Kerry to agree a plan before the presidential election; and developing countries agreeing to invest heavily in new technologies. Rich countries, including the US, Japan and Europe, will start phasing out synthetic HFCs in 2019, China in 2024, and India and less ambitious countries in 2028. The deal reflects countries’ differing levels of development. Because nearly all HFCs are made by a handful of giant western chemical companies and are used in air-conditioning units and cooling systems made and sold in rich countries, it was relatively easy for their governments to put pressure on a single global industry. Alternatives such as hydrocarbons, ammonia and CO2 are widely available, safe, approved and on the market. Worldwide use of HFCs has soared in the past decade as rapidly growing countries such as China and India adopted air-conditioning in homes, offices and cars. But HFC gases are thousands of times more destructive to the climate than carbon dioxide, and scientists say their growing use threatens to undermine the Paris accord, agreed last year by 195 countries. The deal will make little difference to rich countries. The EU had already started to phase out HFCs and since 2011 had banned their use in cars. Many global food and drink companies – Coca Cola, Pepsico and Unilever among them – have already started to replace fluorinated gases with climate-friendly and natural refrigerants, which are more energy-efficient and can save money. The new agreement is welcomed by many chemical and manufacturing companies because it gives them green kudos and market advantage over inferior products made in poor countries. But it was much harder for India, China and other developing countries to strike a deal. Their companies have relied on old refrigeration and coolant technologies, and will now have to invest in R&D and upgrade or replace factories and equipment. Just as in wider climate talks, they accepted that they are part of the problem and may be on track to become the main HFC users, but insisted that, like climate change itself, this is primarily a western problem foisted on them. The deal keeps the Paris agreement on track and is a vital step towards reducing global emissions. Coming on the heels of a new deal to cap aviation emissions, and just weeks before the shipping industry sets about cleaning up its act and UN climate talks resume, it is overwhelmingly positive. But the Kigali meeting need never have happened. HFCs were widely recognised as powerful greenhouse gases many years ago, and though governments deliberately missed the chance to eliminate them in 1987, they agreed in the Montreal Protocol to phase out CFCs and protect the ozone layer. The ozone hole is slowly recovering, and HFCs are now seen as just a small part of the climate change problem. If only it took just a few nights of negotiations to eliminate fossil fuels, too."
"The UK government needs to kickstart technologies to suck carbon dioxide from the air if it is to play its part in meeting the goals of the Paris climate change agreement, according to the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), the government’s official advisers. The global climate deal, which the prime minister, Theresa May, says the UK will ratify by the end of 2016, pledges net zero emissions by the second half of the century, in order to avoid the worst impacts of global warming. Given that some emissions, such as those from aviation and agriculture, will be very difficult to reduce to zero, that means removing some carbon from the atmosphere.  Planting trees is the simplest solution but is limited by the land available, meaning more radical technologies need to be developed, such as chemically scrubbing CO2 from the air and burying it. “A strategy for deployment [of new carbon-removal technologies] at scale by 2050 should start now given the timescales inherent in bringing new technologies to market,” says a new CCC report. “The UK, in cooperation with other countries around the world, needs to come up with a bigger and more concerted effort around those greenhouse gas removal technologies if the ambition of Paris is to be met,” said Matthew Bell, the CCC’s chief executive. But the CCC report says aviation and agriculture must also be tackled by “substantial biofuel use in aircraft and reduced red meat consumption”. Another CCC report published on Thursday says the UK must act urgently to cut emissions from the heating of homes and other buildings, which are largely reliant on gas and cause 20% of the nation’s carbon emissions. UK emissions have fallen 38% since 1990, but virtually all of this drop is from greener electricity.  Lord Deben, the CCC’s chairman, said a “step change” was needed in how the UK heats its homes, a problem that threatens the UK’s ability to meet its carbon targets. The CCC said the government must focus on the rollout of heat pumps and low-carbon district heating systems and the testing of hydrogen as a clean-burning replacement for natural gas. Hydrogen has the advantage of using the existing gas network, but is as yet untested. The hydrogen could be produced using spare renewable electricity, from biofuels or from fossil fuels. The latter would only be low carbon if emissions were captured and stored but ministers abruptly cancelled its flagship carbon capture and storage policy in November 2015. The CCC said hydrogen should receive similar research support to the £250m the government is already giving to small modular nuclear reactors. The CCC also criticised the government’s slowdown in home energy efficiency measures: just half the number of homes made warmer and cheaper to heat in the last parliament are due to be upgraded in this parliament, and ministers abandoned a plan to make all new homes zero-carbon. “We still have millions of homes that have not been made efficient as they could be and we are still building homes that we will have to retrofit in a very short period of time,” said Lord Deben. The CCC estimates 7m homes still have inadequate loft and wall insulation, the most basic form of energy efficiency, after the coalition government’s green deal policy failed. Deben said the new ministers in May’s government, including energy and business secretary, Greg Clark, and climate minister Nick Hurd, have long track records in backing strong climate action. “I am optimistic but I still want to keep those feet to the fire,” he said. “The fact is, crunch time is here. By law, the government have to provide a programme to reach [the CCC’s] carbon budgets.” The government’s carbon reduction plan has been delayed by the Brexit referendum but is expected by February 2017. A third CCC report addresses the climate policy implications of Brexit for the UK. It notes that the UK’s key climate targets - cutting emissions by 57% by 2030 and by at least 80% by 2050 - are already enshrined in domestic law, under the Climate Change Act. But the CCC said EU efficiency standards for vehicles and appliances would have to be replaced to avoid the risk of manufacturers dumping inefficient products on UK consumers. “Efficiency standards cut costs for consumers, reduce emissions, and create a level playing field for competition.” the CCC report says. “If the UK has weaker standards than the EU that could lead to a dumping on the UK market of inefficient products with higher running costs and emissions.” The decisions required after Brexit, such as whether agricultural subsidies are more targeted at cutting carbon emissions, could cut both ways, said Deben, who opposed leaving the EU. “Where there are opportunities, there are also the opposite: people could make things much worse,” he said. Prof Dieter Helm, at the University of Oxford said: “The uncertainties [for energy and climate policy] created by Brexit unsurprisingly leave the future as clear as mud, and the mud is likely to persist for months or even years.”"
"Species can be listed as “threatened” and receive protection based on climate change projections that stretch until the end of the century, a federal appeals court has ruled, in a decision that could have major implications for the fate of animals as their environment rapidly changes. A three-judge panel at the US ninth circuit court unanimously rejected an appeal by a coalition of oil companies, the state of Alaska and indigenous Alaskans to prevent a subspecies of the Pacific bearded seal from getting federal protection.  The federal government’s National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) decided that the Alaska-based populations of bearded seals would “almost certainly” be at risk of being wiped out due to disappearing Arctic sea ice by 2095.  Alaska, along with the oil companies, argued that listing the species as threatened wasn’t warranted because the climate predictions were speculative. The appeals court disagreed, potentially opening the way for other species to be protected due to long-range climate forecasts.  “The service need not wait until a species’ habitat is destroyed to determine that habitat loss may facilitate extinction,” the judges’ ruling states.  “The fact that climate projections for 2050 through 2100 may be volatile does not deprive those projections of value in the rule making process. All parties agree that there will be sea ice melt; the only uncertainty is the magnitude of warming, the speed with which warming will take place, and the severity of its effect.” The court noted the position taken by the “overwhelming majority” of the world’s climate scientists who warn that diminishing sea ice, caused by warming temperatures, will pose an existential threat to species such as seals that depend upon the icy environment for mating, birthing and feeding.  Observational data from 2010 showed that the bearded seals’ habitat in Alaska had 40% less summer sea ice than the long-term average. Winter sea ice in the Bering and Okhotsk seas off Alaska and Russia is expected to decline by at least 40% by 2050, with summer ice forecasted to largely disappear.  The ruling is the first to affirm the federal government’s right to protect species because of climate models stretching until the end of the century. In 2008, the polar bear was listed as threatened based on loss of sea ice, although the forecast in that case will end in 2050.  “This is a huge victory for bearded seals and shows the vital importance of the Endangered Species Act in protecting species threatened by climate change,” said Kristen Monsell, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity who argued the case.  “This decision will give bearded seals a fighting chance while we work to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions melting their sea-ice habitat and keep dirty fossil fuels in the ground.” The decision may be challenged by Alaska, which said such listings could hinder economic development in the state for little environmental benefit. “If this opinion stands, the National Marine Fisheries Service would list a species that is abundant and in good health based on the claim that climate change will impact habitat over the next 100 years and may cause harm,” said Brad Meyen, senior assistant attorney general for Alaska."
" The coal-seam-gas industry could be vastly underestimating its emissions, jeopardising Australia’s commitments made at Paris and swamping any benefits gas has over coal, according to a landmark report by the Melbourne Energy Institute, commissioned by the Australia Institute. The report found the industry’s true emissions could easily amount to twice the emissions Australia has promised to cut by 2030. While no studies in Australia have examined emissions from methane escaping directly into the atmosphere, in the US those measurements show it is often 170 times higher than that claimed by the Australian industry and 34 times higher than that what the Australian government reported to the UN. “We’re potentially not measuring the equivalent of the emissions from our entire transport sector,” said Mark Ogge, principal advisor at the Australia Institute. “If the emissions are a lot more than what is being estimated now, it could jeopardise our commitments made at Paris,” said report author Tim Forcey from the Melbourne Energy Institute. Gas has been spruiked as the lower-emissions fossil fuel since, when burned, it emits 60% less carbon dioxide than coal for each unit of energy produced. But unburned gas – mostly made up of methane – is a much more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, exerting a warming influence 84 times that of carbon dioxide over a 20-year time frame. As a result, gas accidentally released directly to the air during extraction or transportation, in what are called “fugitive emissions”, could swamp the benefits of gas over coal. According to research compiled by experts at the Melbourne Energy Institute, when fugitive emissions reach 3.2% of the overall gas produced, gas loses its edge over coal. While there have been no reliable studies of the actual fugitive emissions in the Australian coal-seam-gas industry, the industry itself claims they amount to only 0.1% of the gas produced. That figure was used in the environmental impact statements used to get approval for the huge gas liquefaction plants recently built in Gladstone. But when the government reported to the UNFCCC on Australia’s total emissions in 2014, it assumed fugitive emissions were five times higher than that suggested by the industry, at 0.5% of gas produced. However, studies of unconventional gas – shale and coal seam gas – in the US have found fugitive emissions are often as much as 17% of the gas produced. Since Australian coal seam gas is closer to the surface, the researchers said it was likely that Australian fugitive emissions are even higher. In one US region, fugitive emissions from coal seam gas were 30% – 300 times that assumed by the industry in Australia. If fugitive emissions in Australia were just 10% of the total gas produced, then in 2014, Australia’s fugitive emissions would have amounted to twice the amount of greenhouse gases Australia has committed to cut from its emissions by 2030, or the equivalent of the whole transport sector. Moreover, that figure is set to grow significantly. Between 2013 and 2017, Australia is projected to triple its gas production in the eastern states, mostly in order to service the liquefied natural gas export industry. There are currently 6,000 wells in eastern Australia servicing that industry, a figure expected to grow to at least 20-fold in the next 20 years. “Methane is a very powerful greenhouse gas, which means that controlling methane emissions is crucial to meeting climate targets and avoiding tipping points,” said Forcey. For some aspects of gas production, emissions reported to the UNFCCC were said to be zero, despite there being a likelihood of very large leaks from those sources. The report said the government relied on one study to claim several processes had no fugitive emissions, despite that report explicitly acknowledging large leaks that it wasn’t able to properly measure, because the measuring equipment was being overwhelmed by gas leaking from other sources – including sources assumed to have no emissions when Australia reports to the UNFCCC. “It would have been like being in a hurricane and being asked to measure the water coming from a leaking tap,” said Forcey. This year, the UNFCCC urged Australia to improve its measuring of fugitive emissions. In light of the growing industry, the new report called for fugitive emissions to be independently verified by a regulatory body funded by a levy on the industry. And since one of the difficulties in measuring methane emissions was a lack of baseline studies, the report called for compulsory baseline methane measurements in any area being considered for oil and gas development. Within about five years, Australia is expected to overtake Qatar as the biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas, much of which will be produced from CSG wells in the eastern states. In 2021, both Qatar and Australia will export roughly the same amount of gas. But because of generous tax breaks to the fossil fuel industry, Fairfax Media reported this month that Qatar will receive $26.6bn in tax revenue, while Australia will receive less than $1bn."

"In recent decades warmer temperatures have led to shorter winters, and in the UK the plant growing season is now a full month longer than it was in 1990. The same is true across much of the northern hemisphere, and this extra plant growth has helped to mop up atmospheric carbon dioxide and keep a lid on global warming. But no longer.  New measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide reveal that plants have reached saturation point, and that since 2006 the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by plants has been declining. “It’s the first evidence that we are tipping over the edge, potentially towards runaway or irreversible climate change,” says James Curran, former chief executive of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency. Together with his son, Sam, he analysed the ups and downs in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, recorded at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii since 1958. During the northern hemisphere summer, carbon dioxide levels dip as fresh plant growth draws down carbon dioxide. But the Currans’ analysis shows that since 2006 the size of the dip has diminished and vegetation has become poorer at soaking up carbon dioxide, contributing another China’s-worth of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere every year. Previous estimates had suggested that Earth would not reach “peak-carbon” until at least 2030. “It suggests to me that we urgently need to get to grips with declining biodiversity across the globe, and consider radical new policies such as re-wilding large areas of landscape,” says Curran, whose findings are published in the journal Weather . Quite how our weather will respond to the extra carbon dioxide remains to be seen...  "

"Nasa has all but declared this year to be the hottest yet recorded, after September narrowly turned out the warmest in modern temperature monitoring. Last month was 0.91C above the average temperature for that time of year from 1951 to 1980, the benchmark used for measuring rises. The new findings follow record-breaking monthly anomalies throughout this year, leading the agency to believe that because of the highs reported so far, 2016 will take the crown as warmest in the 136 years of modern data-keeping. Dr Gavin Schmidt, director of Nasa’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, tweeted:  With data now available through September, 2016 annual record (~1.25ºC above late 19th C) seems locked in. pic.twitter.com/Btp3Vutakn Last month was only just over the previous record, coming in at a razor-thin 0.004C above the previous high for the time of year, reached in September 2014. That tiny margin may be revised in future, as monthly temperature data can be nudged up or down retrospectively as later reports come in. For instance, June 2016 was initially reported as the warmest on record but was subsequently revised downward slightly to the third warmest. But it makes the trend for the year, and the long-term decadal trends, easier to discern. September’s high temperatures compared with the long-term average means that 11 of the last 12 consecutive months, back to October 2015, have set new records. Last year was the hottest year since modern records began, brought about in part by a strong El Niño event, a Pacific weather system that can affect sea and air temperatures around the world, but also by strong underlying trends. Schmidt said earlier this year, when 2015’s status was confirmed, that it would have been the warmest year even without the El Niño. July 2016 was the hottest single month since instruments have been reliably used to measure temperature, followed by a similar effect in August. This year’s heat has continued to be affected by the tail-end of the El Niño weather phenomenon, as although the system has now dissipated, air temperatures tend to lag behind by several months. If a new temperature record is set for 2016, it will confirm the longer term trends of climate change. This in turn will help scientists to counter claims from global warming sceptics that the rise in global temperatures has “paused” and therefore that climate change is not a threat. The monthly reports from Nasa come from publicly available data from about 6,300 meteorological stations around the world, as well as measurements taken from ships and buoys at sea, and Antarctic research stations. Other agencies, including the UK’s Met Office, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Japan’s Meteorological Agency, also publish temperature estimates. The Met Office forecast last December that this year would be the hottest ever, based on its observations. Also closely watched is the World Meteorological Organisation, which in July made a prediction that this year would be the hottest, based on data available to that date. Final confirmation of whether this year is record-breaking is likely to come early next year."

"“I’m proud of the fact that I’ve always treated the working people of this country with dignity and respect, especially our military and law enforcement personnel.”  – 11 October, interview with Fox News  Trump has not always treated members of the military and law enforcement with respect. Last year he insulted John McCain, who endured torture as a prisoner of war in Vietnam; this summer he derided the Muslim parents of a soldier who died in the Iraq war; he has called top generals “embarrassing to our country” and said they have been “reduced to rubble”; and he has repeatedly impugned the ethics of federal investigators and even public safety officers such as fire marshals.  “You look at the crime and you wonder why. And by the way, do you know, it was just announced that murder is the highest it’s been in our country in 45 years?” – 11 October, Panama City, Florida “We have the highest murder rate in this country in 45 years. More people are being murdered now than being murdered in 45 years.” – 12 October, Lakeland, Florida Trump has distorted an FBI statistic to make a false claim: in September the agency reported that murders and non-negligent manslaughter rose in the US by 10.8% in 2015, the largest single-year increase since 1971. That is not the same as saying there are more murders in the US than at any point since 1971: 15,696 murders were reported in 2015, down from 1991 and 1993 highs of 24,703 and 24,526. There were more murders in 1971 (17,780) than in 2015.   The murder rate declined 42% from 1993 to 2014, even though the population increased by a quarter. During this week’s debate Trump almost cited the statistic accurately, saying: “We have an increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in 45 years.” But the FBI figure is a national one, not restricted to cities. “Climate change. Now I want, and just so you know, do you know that I’ve won numerous environmental awards? I’m a believer in the environment. It’s gotta be within reason. I’m a believer.” – 12 October, Ocala, Florida Trump has claimed off and on to be an environmentalist since at least 2008, when he was battling with officials in Scotland to build a golf course and resort on land that had been home to a variety of wildlife. He has maintained for years that the US should drill for oil wherever possible – an opinion that falls well out of line with even the moderate environmentalism of Hillary Clinton, who has taken oil and gas exploration on a case-by-case basis.  He has claimed to have received environmental awards since 2011, though the only award that could be found seems to be a 2007 prize given to the Trump National Golf Club in New Jersey by the Metropolitan Golf Association Foundation. That award was received by the grounds director, Greg Nicoli, for preserving 45 acres of bird habitat on the property. A few years later, Trump cut down a small forest in Virginia for the sake of another golf course, and in May of 2011 New Jersey’s department of environmental protection fined him for repeated violations. He has also called for dismantling basic Environmental Protection Agency programs and rules. Trump has repeatedly said he does not believe in climate change, which is more pertinent to the environment than a New Jersey golf course. In 2014 he called it a “hoax”, and in 2012 he claimed it was invented by China to trick Americans into caring about environmental regulations.  The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. The Earth is warming at an “unprecedented rate”, Nasa reported in August, sea ice is disappearing, and more than 97% of climate scientists agree that the climate is warming dangerously. Researchers are already drawing links between such climate change and disasters such as Louisiana’s deadly flooding in September. “And by the way, ICE just gave us their endorsement, first time ever, and the border patrol, all the agents, 16,500 agents just gave us their support.” – 12 October, Lakeland, Florida Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is a government agency. It does not endorse political candidates. A union representing about 7,600 ICE officials endorsed Trump in September. A group representing 16,500 of 21,000 border patrol agents similarly endorsed Trump. This does not represent all the agents."
"Clean, green development is the sole route to future global economic growth, according to British economist Lord Nicholas Stern, with a continuation of polluting, high-carbon growth only leading to self-destruction. There is a strong argument that China is now leading the world in action on climate change, Stern said, making the country both a competitor and inspiration for other nations.  Stern, speaking ahead of two lectures to mark the 10th anniversary of the highly influential Stern report, said the cost of not acting to halt global warming had risen while the costs of doing so had fallen. The 2006 Stern report, commissioned by the UK government, found that the economic damage caused by unchecked climate change could be 5-20% of global GDP each year, but that cutting carbon emissions would cost just 1% of GDP. The report warned against delaying action, but this has not been heeded, said Stern on Thursday. “We have delayed action,” he said. “The potential damages now look bigger than I suggested then. In that sense I underplayed the consequences of not getting on with it. But the costs of action are a good deal lower than I indicated then, in that technical progress has been faster that we thought. The cost of solar power [for example] is not far off a factor of 10 less than in 2006.” Today, he said, a low-carbon future is the sole option for prosperity. “It is the only one available and it is a very exciting growth story,” Stern said. “Any attempt to follow high-carbon growth will eventually be self destructive due to the very hostile environment it creates. There was an old alleged tension between growth on the one hand and climate responsibility on the other, but it’s a completely fake horse race.” Stern said other drivers of economic growth, such as using interest rates, tax changes and structural reforms, had limited potential. “Sustainable development of infrastructure and cities is the growth story of the future,” he said. “We are winning the arguments intellectually and politically, but it has all been much too slow.” Stern foresees economies in which people travel using efficient self-driving cars, bicycles and walking, homes and businesses are powered by green energy, materials are widely recycled and ultrafast broadband supports home working. “It is a very attractive future if we just put our minds to it,” he said. “Cities where you can’t move and breathe make no sense.” Stern said China could be seen as the leader in climate action today. “You can make a strong case for that,” he said, noting Chinese coal use peaked two years ago. “You have radical change in energy and very big structural change in the economy, moving very strongly towards service sectors and high-tech.” He said a key driver is the threat to China from fossil fuel burning, both in terms of climate change impacts, particularly droughts and floods, and air pollution.  “I wish the whole world had known [in 2006] how big an issue air pollution was. We kill millions a year, so delay on that has resulted in probably the deaths of tens of millions of people,” he said. “The double gain – both reducing the risk of climate change and reducing air pollution – is now seen as a very powerful and attractive argument for action. This argument has been particularly strong in its attraction in China, which has probably moved the most in the last 10 years.” Stern said China was also driven by the desire to be the biggest player in the green economy: “If there is a race in green products, China rather fancies itself to do well.” China already leads the world in wind and solar energy installations and also has a major nuclear power programme. “The future of nuclear will be determined in China as it is the only country doing it at scale,” Stern said, suggesting 100-150 new nuclear power plants could be built there in the next 15-20 years. The UK has been a leader on climate change, he said, both in its pioneering domestic laws passed in 2008 and in international negotiations towards the global Paris climate change agreement. “But the UK wobbled in 2015 in terms of support for renewables and that has created some uncertainty,” he said. Since coming to power, the Conservative government has drastically cut or ended subsidies for wind and solar power, leading the UK to fall down league tables ranking national energy sectors and attractiveness for renewable energy investment. Stern said all low-carbon energy technologies, including nuclear, would be needed in the UK but that “solar and wind with storage is particularly promising”. "
"Southern Spain will be reduced to desert by the end of the century if the current rate of greenhouse gas emissions continue unchecked, researchers have warned. Anything less than extremely ambitious and politically unlikely carbon emissions cuts will see ecosystems in the Mediterranean change to a state unprecedented in the past 10 millennia, they said. The study, published in the journal Science, modelled what would happen to vegetation in the Mediterranean basin under four different paths of future carbon emissions, from a business-as-usual scenario at the worst end to keeping temperature rises below the Paris climate deal target of 1.5C at the other. Temperatures would rise nearly 5C globally under the worst case scenario by 2100, causing deserts to expand northwards across southern Spain and Sicily, and Mediterranean vegetation to replace deciduous forests.  Even if emissions are held to the level of pledges put forward ahead of the Paris deal, southern Europe would experience a “substantial” expansion of deserts. The level of change would be beyond anything the region’s ecosystems had experienced during the holocene, the geological epoch that started more than 10,000 years ago. “The Med is very sensitive to climatic change, maybe much more than any other region in the world,” said lead author Joel Guiot of Aix-Marseille University. “A lot of people are living at the level of the sea, it also has a lot of troubles coming from migration. If we add additional problems due to climate change, it will be worse in the future.” He said that while his study did not simulate what would happen to production of Mediterranean food staples such as olives, other research showed it was clear the changes would harm their production. Climate change has already warmed the region by more than the global average – 1.3C compared to 1C – since the industrial revolution. The real impact on Mediterranean ecosystems, which are considered a hotspot of biodiversity, could be worse because the study did not look at other human impacts, such as forests being turned over to grow food. “The effect of the human is to deforest, to replace with agriculture and so on. You change the vegetation cover, the albedo, the humidity in the soil, and you will emphasise the drought when you do that. If you have the [direct] human impact, it will be worse,” said Guiot. The researchers fed a model with 10,000 years of pollen records to build a picture of vegetation in the region, and used that to infer previous temperatures in the Mediterranean.  They then ran the model to see what would happen to the vegetation in the future, using four different scenarios of warming, three of them taken from the UN’s climate science panel, the IPCC. Only the most stringent cut in emissions – which is roughly equivalent to meeting the Paris aspiration of holding warming to 1.5C – would see ecosystems remain within the limits they experienced in the Holocene. “The main message is really to maintain at less than 1.5C,” said Guiot. “For that, we need to decrease the emissions of greenhouse gases very quickly, and start the decreasing now, and not by 2020, and to arrive at zero emissions by 2050 and not by the end of the century.” He said the main limitation of the study was the relatively simple model at its heart, but this was offset by the fact it was used consistently, to reconstruct the past and to forecast future vegetation."
"We know the world is warming – no factor can explain it aside from human emissions of greenhouse gases. Despite this, people who deny the basic facts of climate change have tried to argue that the Earth is either not warming or is only slowly heating. Well that just isn’t true anymore. The last three years are the nail in the coffin of the deniers of climate change. We have enough data this year to call 2016 as the hottest year ever record – and we have three more months left to go. So, just how hot is 2016? Well my early predictions are shown in the graph below. I have taken temperature data from NASA and superimposed my predictions for 2016 – it isn’t even close. And by the way, it doesn’t matter whose data you use (NASA, NOAA, JMA, Hadley Centre) the results are the same. 2016 is going to blow 2015 out of the water.  A few things to note. First, these temperatures are surface temperatures that are taken across the globe. But, you can measure temperatures elsewhere and see the same result. Most importantly, measurements in the oceans, where 93% of the extra heat is stored are the best proof of global warming. I recently coauthored an open-access paper on this very topic which interested readers can get here. You can measure sea level rise as the heated water expands, you can measure ice loss across the globe, you can measure temperatures in the lower part of the atmosphere. It doesn’t matter where; the story is the same. What is the big deal? Well first of all, 2016 blows away 2015 which was previously the hottest year ever and that had beaten 2014 as the hottest year ever – call this a three-peat. Three records in a row and the last two are by large margins. Does this mean global warming all of a sudden has gotten worse?  No, surface temperatures fluctuate a lot – you can see that in the figure. Temperatures will go up or down from year to year without apparent reason. This is why we are interested in the long term trends. This is also why we are interested in looking at other measures of warming (especially in the oceans). All of our measurements agree with each other – we know the Earth was warming long before this set of records began falling in 2014. One thing these temperatures can do is enable us to compare computer models with measurements. We’ve seen that models have done an excellent job of correctly predicting the rate of heating of the Earth. My own research shows that in the oceans, the models are slightly under-predicting the rate of heating.  To compare models and measurements at the Earth’s surface, I’ve borrowed a figure from Dr. Gavin Schmidt of Nasa and I’ve overlaid the 2016 surface temperatures. A star shows where 2016 will be. The star should be compared to the three heavy dashed lines in the figure. The upper and lower dashed lines show the uncertainty in the models and the middle dashed line shows the average.  Is the 2016 data within the upper and lower lines? Yes it is.  Is the 2016 data close to the middle dashed line? Yes again. In fact, the 2016 temperatures are above the average which means the models under-predicted the temperature of 2016.  Before we get too anxious, it is almost certain that 2017 will be cooler than 2016. In fact, we may not set another record for a few years. But just as a few hot years doesn’t prove global warming, a few cooler years wont disprove it. The long-term trend is clearer upwards through and the models are spot on. All this aside, there are still things we can do to bend the arc of this curve. There are actions we can take as individuals and as collectives to reduce our emissions and our dependence on polluting fuels. That message is, and continues to be, the most important one.  But one thing we cannot do is deny facts."
"Climate change’s impacts on extreme weather and society are becoming increasingly clear and undeniable. While we are making progress in solving the problem, we’re still moving too slowly, and one of the two political parties governing the world’s strongest superpower continues to deny the science. This led astrophysicist Katie Mack to make the following suggestion, related to a common refrain from Donald Trump and Republican Party leaders: Maybe governments will actually listen if we stop saying ""extreme weather"" & ""climate change"" & just say the atmosphere is being radicalized  Hurricane Matthew set a number of records. Its record-breaking rainfall and storm surge caused historic flooding and destructive winds along the coasts of Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas, and Virginia. Hillary Clinton touched upon the science linking global warming and hurricane impacts in a recent speech in Florida: At Climate Progress, Joe Romm summarized the various ways in which global warming makes hurricanes like Matthew more intense: In short, global warming made Hurricane Matthew and its impacts more severe, and will lead to more such devastating hurricanes in the future. According to the National Snow and Ice Data Center, 2016 tied for the second-lowest annual Arctic sea ice minimum extent. However, that only accounts for the amount of ice on the surface of the ocean. The ice has also become thinner due to the warming oceans. As a result, we’ve lost about three-quarters of the volume of sea ice in the Arctic ocean in less than four decades, as this video created by Andy Lee Robinson illustrates: That decline is well outside the range of natural variability over the past 1,500 years, and several studies have found that human-caused global warming is the primary driver of the disappearing Arctic sea ice. 2014 was the hottest year since our measurements began, breaking the record set in 2010, which had broken the record set in 2005. A year later we saw the temperature record shattered once again in 2015, by more than a tenth of a degree Celsius. This year we’ll see the record broken once again, likely by an even larger margin. Every month in 2016 except June has been the hottest ever recorded. That has never happened before, nor have we ever seen three consecutive record-breaking hot years. It’s simply unprecedented. California is in the midst of a 5-year drought; its worst in over a millennium. 100% of the state is currently experiencing drought conditions, with over 20% of the state in “exceptional” drought – the most severe category. The drought has created conditions ripe for severe wildfire seasons. Over the past 5 years, California has seen an average of more than 4,000 wildfires burning over 160,000 acres per year. A new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that global warming is the main culprit increasing the size of forest fires in the western US: We demonstrate that human-caused climate change caused over half of the documented increases in fuel aridity since the 1970s and doubled the cumulative forest fire area since 1984. This analysis suggests that anthropogenic climate change will continue to chronically enhance the potential for western US forest fire activity while fuels are not limiting. These are but a few recent examples of climate extremes amplified by human-caused global warming. These extreme events will only come with greater frequency and intensity as the planet continues to heat up. The only way to curb these impacts is to cut the carbon pollution that’s intensifying them. As any member of Alcoholics Anonymous knows, denying a problem doesn’t make it go away. Only by admitting we have a problem and taking steps to address it can we avoid a catastrophic outcome."
"At first, Yury Scherbakov thought the cracks appearing in a wall he had installed in his two-room flat were caused by shoddy workmanship. But then other walls started cracking, and then the floor started to incline. “We sat on the couch and could feel it tilt,” says his wife, Nadezhda, as they carry furniture out of the flat. Yury wasn’t a poor craftsman, and Nadezhda wasn’t crazy: one corner of their five-storey building at 59 Talnakhskaya Street in the northern Russian city of Norilsk was sinking as the permafrost underneath it thawed and the foundation slowly disintegrated. In March 2015, local authorities posted notices in the stairwells that the building was condemned. Cracking and collapsing structures are a growing problem in cities like Norilsk – a nickel-producing centre of 177,000 people located 180 miles above the Arctic Circle – as climate change thaws the perennially frozen soil and increases precipitation. Valery Tereshkov, deputy head of the emergencies ministry in the Krasnoyarsk region, wrote in an article this year that almost 60% of all buildings in Norilsk have been deformed as a result of climate change shrinking the permafrost zone. Local engineers said more than 100 residential buildings, or one-tenth of the housing fund, have been vacated here due to damage from thawing permafrost. In most cases, these are slow-motion wrecks that can be patched up or prevented by engineering solutions. But if a foundation shifts suddenly it can put lives at risk: cement slabs broke a doctor’s legs when the front steps and overhanging roof of a Norilsk blood bank collapsed in June 2015. Building and maintenance costs will have to be ramped up to keep cities in Russia’s resource-rich north running. Engineers and geologists are careful to note that “technogenic factors” like sewer and building heat and chemical pollution are also warming the permafrost in places like Norilsk, the most polluted city in Russia. But climate change is deepening the thaw and speeding up the destruction, at the very same time that Russia is establishing new military bases and oil-drilling infrastructure across the Arctic. Greenpeace has warned that permafrost thawing has caused thousands of oil and gas pipeline breaks. “There were problems there before, but climate change exacerbates them,” says Ali Kerimov, an engineer at Foundation Research and Production in Norilsk. “We need to study each case separately to understand what awaits us with climate change.” Global warming has been tied to more frequent forest fires and flooding across Russia, but its impact on permafrost, which covers two-thirds of the country’s territory, is also beginning to be felt. At least seven giant craters have been discovered in Siberia – reportedly caused by thawing permafrost allowing methane to explode out of the ground – and a 12-year-old boy in Salekhard died from anthrax in August after thawing released bacteria.  Arctic islands and the northern coastline – and scientific outposts there – are disappearing into the sea as permafrost thaws, sea ice melts and wave action increases. Valery Grebenets of Moscow State University’s department of cryolithology and glaciology teaches his students 13 “horror stories” about thawing permafrost, including buckling roads and railways, soil runoff killing fish and the release of toxic and radioactive pollutants contained by frozen dams. Flying into Norilsk at the end of August, when the vegetation of the treeless tundra was already turning orange and spots of snow were on the ground from an early storm, it’s hard to picture this warming. Built by gulag prisoners starting in 1935, the city gets more than six weeks of polar night and up to 2m tonnes of snow each winter, when the temperature can drop below -51C (-60F). But average annual temperatures in the Arctic are rising faster than anywhere else – more than 2C since 1900, and a 2015 study found increases in soil temperatures across Russia’s permafrost regions over the last 50 years. Soil temperatures in Norilsk increased by almost 1C between 1999 and 2013. The term permafrost is somewhat a misnomer: while deeper soil remains frozen year-round, the “active layer” of soil extending several feet below the surface thaws each summer. It thaws unevenly, contorting and warping buildings. To avoid this, in the 1960s builders of apartment blocks in Norilsk began drilling holes up to 100-ft deep and pouring reinforced concrete piles that stuck into the permanently frozen soil below. The piles also lifted each building off the ground, allowing air circulation to cool the soil and preventing further thawing. More than 100,000 people are living in buildings in “critical condition” across Russia’s far north Engineers didn’t think the soil could start warming so much, however. Data from a Norilsk monitoring station showed the active layer has been thawing earlier and its thickness has increased from three feet to five feet. In addition, climate change has increased precipitation, adding more moisture to the soil that freezes and expands, gradually crumbling the concrete piles. More snow covers the ground and further warms the permafrost. “In most cases the effect of climate change was not accounted for properly or at all, so the story is not about one building falling, even though there are examples of that, but about thousands of people living in buildings which have the potential to fall,” says Dmitry Streletskiy, an assistant professor of geography at George Washington University. The problem also threatens Alaska, Canada and other northern territories, but only Russia has cities so far north. Forty percent of buildings in the coal mining city Vorkuta have been damaged, the emergencies ministry’s Tereshkov says. Salekhard, Nadym and Dudinka, the port on the Yenisei River through which Norilsk Nickel ships its products, have also seen deformations, among others. More than 100,000 people are living in buildings in “critical condition” across Russia’s far north, Streletskiy estimates. At 59 Talnakhskaya Street, an 80-apartment building dating to the 1960s, the sinking corner became visible when a giant crack appeared on the side. Workers cemented it over and propped up the corner with logs, but the deformation continued. Tatiana, a fire protection engineer who lives in the building with her son and husband, says she found out it was condemned from the TV news, although they had seen cracks and tears in the wallpaper. “When I saw the television report, I thought they were talking about the building next door. You don’t think that you could be relocated,” she says. “We’ve lived in the building for 15 years, and nothing suggested this would happen.” The city has been offering residents replacement homes elsewhere. Even the front doors have been removed from many vacated flats, leaving only the occasional ratty chair, empty vodka bottle or Iron Maiden poster. The slight tilt to the worst-hit stairwell creates the same disorienting sensation as the shifting floors of a carnival funhouse. But a handful of flats are still occupied; Tatiana is waiting for an appraisal so her family can receive compensation. I think the problem [of climate change] is exaggerated. Our icebreakers won’t be out of work for the next 100 years It’s a story that has repeated itself again and again in Norilsk; buildings have been partially or fully torn down, leaving only drooping foundations. Demolitions often have to be done by hand and cost 15 to 20 million roubles (£195,000-260,000) each, Kerimov says. Norilsk city hall referred requests for commentary to the construction company NorilskStroiRekonstruktsiya, which says it has done work to strengthen the foundations of “almost all the buildings in Norilsk”. At least nine unsalvageable buildings have been torn down in the past decade, according to manager Vladislav Petrovsky. If temperature monitoring or visible deformations tip maintenance workers off in time, structures can be saved. Thermosyphons were installed to cool the soil under the apartment block at 36 Nansen Street when temperature probes showed warming there, for instance. But sometimes changes come too suddenly. A brick office building on Komsomolskaya street cracked like an egg one September morning in 2009 and stands empty to this day. A top corner of the building pitched forward 70cm, sending jagged fissures up the middle of its facade and squashing windows. Zoya Yanchenko, a botanist at the Institute of Arctic Agriculture and Environment, went into the building the next day to retrieve her equipment. “When we saw what had happened, it was terrifying,” she said. “It made my head spin, because the floor was at an angle. It wasn’t for the weak-nerved.” “Happily there weren’t any human casualties in 2009 because it was 3am and the building was empty,” Kerimov said. But things could have been very different had it been daytime. Norilsk mayor Oleg Kurilov created a “permafrost council” of Kerimov and other experts in 2014 to try to preserve building foundations. Kerimov has been campaigning for stricter building codes to be drafted for the far north and has presented ideas to deputy prime minister Dmitry Rogozin. But it’s questionable whether the political will is there to address the challenge, since many local officials and residents like those at 59 Talnakhskaya have doubts about climate change. “I think the problem is exaggerated. Our icebreakers won’t be out of work for the next 100 years,” says Alexei Novakov, director of the port in Dudinka, when asked about climate change, which he argues is part of a “natural cycle”. Although Grebenets warns that as permafrost retreats from the river bank, piers and other structures there could be compromised, Novakov says he didn’t “see any trend that piers have suddenly started to be destroyed”. This skepticism goes all the way to the top: president Vladimir Putin has in the past voiced doubt that human activity is behind climate change and suggested warmer temperatures will benefit the country. Russian media rarely mentions the issue. Adapting northern cities to climate change is also a difficult sell due to the price tag: costs typically increase by 30 to 40% to build a structure able to withstand more volatile permafrost conditions, Kerimov says. Residents of 59 Talnakhskaya have already called for the city to spend more money on keeping up buildings and monitoring soil conditions – but recession and sanctions make funds hard to find. “Many climate change problems are solved by investment, spending on engineering. Where will we get this investment? Will local budgets find this money?” asks Oleg Anisimov, head of the climatology department at the State Hydrological Institute in St Petersburg. “With the dollar at 70 roubles, the budget in the north won’t be enough.” “The peasant won’t cross himself until the thunder crashes,” Kerimov says, using a Russian folk saying. “As long as there’s no catastrophe with human casualties, nobody will do anything.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook and join the discussion"
"Here is a heartfelt, decent, educational documentary about the most important issue of our time – climate change – presented by A-lister Leonardo DiCaprio, who proves his own commitment to the cause. His own interest began with an encounter with Al Gore in 2000 and has been a genuine passion with him since. DiCaprio concedes that his own celebrity status is a double-edged sword. It draws attention to the topic, but allows the naysayers to say that he is a shallow, chuckle-headed movie star and this whole issue must therefore be a fad. There are brutal Fox TV news clips to this effect.   DiCaprio travels the globe (while cautiously conceding the carbon footprint issue – it is avowedly “offset” with a voluntary carbon tax payment) examining our fossil-fuel addiction, including emerging powerhouses such as India who now resent the idea of being denied the energy-consumption prosperity that the US has already enjoyed. The answer seems to be, of course, enforcing the 2015 Paris agreement, developing wind and solar power – although revisionist arguments for nuclear are not touched upon – and also a carbon tax. A shift in public opinion has to be achieved to change the political classes’ opinion: DiCaprio concludes with a ruminative walk-and-talk interview with President Obama himself, more interesting than his apparently wordless photo-op with the Pope. A serious, substantial piece of work. "
"Climate change has been the elephant in the room during the past two US presidential debates. Ignoring this issue would be more understandable if this metaphorical pachyderm weren’t about to rampage through the lives of Americans, causing upheaval on a scale not seen since the start of human civilization. “I’ve been shocked at the lack of questions on climate change. It really is fiddling while the world burns,” said Kerry Emanuel, a leading climate scientist. “This is the great issue of our time and we are skirting around it. I’m just baffled by it.”  Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have yet to face a moderator question on climate change during two debates in which time was found to grill Clinton repeatedly over her use of emails and to ask Trump about a series of late-night tweets he sent about a former Miss Universe’s sex tape. Lester Holt, the moderator of the first debate, was reportedly set to ask a climate question but ran out of time.  Wednesday’s final debate is set to retread the same ground, with the debate referee, Chris Wallace of Fox News, planning to prod the candidates on immigration, the economy and “fitness to be president”. Wallace has also decided to ask about “foreign hot spots”, but it appears unlikely that it will segue into talking about the diabolical heat suffered in Kuwait and India this year.  “It’s like a sort of collective cowardice,” said Emanuel of the omission. Michael Mann, another prominent climate scientist, added: “One has to wonder if television networks are compromised by the millions of advertising dollars they take from fossil fuel interests.” Republican Donald Trump has ​consistently ​denied climate change exists and would withdraw the US from the Paris agreement ​– a landmark treaty signed by almost 200 nations to clamp down (cut all that in bold)​on global warming. He wants to scrap the EPA’s Clean Power Plan, which tries to limit carbon emissions by power plants and increase the use of renewable energy. He plans to end a moratorium on coal leasing, while also stopping oil imports from Opec countries. However, he supports exploring renewable energy sources.  Democrat Hillary Clinton has praised the Paris agreement and wants to cut energy waste and methane emissions, reduce oil consumption and invest in clean energy. She wants to create a $60bn Clean Energy Challenge that gives incentives to states to fight carbon pollution. She has announced benefits for coal miners such as health and retirement security. She opposes Arctic drilling and the Keystone XL pipeline, and supports fracking under strict conditions. Should the final debate also neglect climate, the only question related to the issue across four-and-a-half hours of TV will have come from Ken Bone, he of red sweater and short-lived internet fame, who asked about coal mining policy as the credits were preparing to roll on last week’s debate. Climate campaigners have been unable to contain their exasperation.  “Let’s be clear: a last minute question about energy doesn’t do justice to the threat of the climate crisis,” said May Boeve, executive director of climate group 350 Action, shortly after the debate. “This crisis threatens our communities, our economy, and the future for our children – we saw that threat with Hurricane Matthew just this week – yet climate change doesn’t get a single direct question in the debate.” Hurricane Matthew, which resulted in more than 20 deaths, is just the latest example of the type of extreme event, from flooding in Louisiana to a historic drought in California, that will become more common as the world warms. This year hasn’t exactly been short of climate conversation topics – 2016 is on track to be the warmest on record, beating a mark set just in 2015. The Paris climate accord has been ratified by countries around the world while the Obama administration has attempted to implement its Clean Power Plan in the teeth of fierce opposition from 27 states. Alaska barely had a winter this year while some American communities are already having to relocate due to rising seas. Nearly two-thirds of Americans say that climate change is at least somewhat important to them personally, according to the Yale Program on Climate Communication, although few people talk about the issue with family or friends.  Americans are broadly in favor of developing clean sources of energy but there’s a clear political divide about how to approach climate change. Polling by the Pew Research Center shows half of Clinton’s supporters care about climate change a great deal, compared with 15% of Trump supporters.  This division is most starkly demonstrated by the candidates themselves. Clinton has talked about installing half a billion solar panels, halting oil drilling in the Arctic and, in sobering evidence of this election’s debasement, proudly told the Democratic national convention: “I believe in science.”  While some liberal Democrats are suspicious of Clinton’s climate credentials – fears were exacerbated by recent leaked emails that show she said those who wanted to shut down fossil fuels should “get a life” – the former secretary of state’s plan cannot be compared meaningfully with Trump’s. The Republican nominee has called climate change a Chinese hoax and “bullshit”. He has promised to withdraw the US from the Paris climate deal, revive the coal industry while also expanding oil and gas drilling. He has darkly hinted at scrapping the Environmental Protection Agency and resurrecting the controversial Keystone oil pipeline.  “I wish there was a proper battle of ideas that we could judge accordingly,” said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club. Green groups have supported Clinton almost as a default position because she’s the only major party candidate who accepts climate science.  While Clinton and Trump differ on issues such as police shootings, immigration and the economy, both candidates at least accept that these things actually exist. It’s tricky to have a debate on a topic that a participant doesn’t think is real.  Trump’s denial is shared by many members of Congress, who have been lavished with $29.6m in contributions from fossil fuel companies in the 2016 election cycle, according to figures compiled by ClimateTruth.org Action.  Regardless, here are three germane, and pressing, climate change questions that Wallace could ask:  An overwhelming majority of climate scientists say that climate change is real, caused by humans and a growing threat to our way of life. What would you do as president to tackle this clear and present danger? All of the top 10 hottest years on record have occurred since 1998, the year when many climate skeptics claim that global warming somehow stopped. The world’s top scientific institutions are unequivocal that the burning of fossil fuels is the cause of this warming, with recent research showing this brings punishing drought, extreme weather events, poverty and economic stagnation.  The Pentagon has said that climate change is a national security risk due to the destruction caused by rising seas and displacement of people. What would you do to prepare the US for this? Millions of people are set to become climate refugees as crops fail and drinking water supplies are sullied by seawater, potentially putting the current refugee crisis in the shade. The Pentagon has warned of the potential for conflict and the need for humanitarian mobilization but the two main presidential candidates have yet to talk about this. Rising sea levels are already causing Americans to be uprooted and whole cities to be put at long-term risk. What national plan will you put in place to ensure that areas such as New York, Virginia and Florida aren’t inundated? Incidents of nuisance flooding have more than trebled along US coasts since the 1960s, with most coastal areas set to be inundated 30 days or more a year by 2050. Miami Beach is spending $400m on a system of pumps to ward off the sea for just a few decades, according to its mayor. Climate change is far from an abstract concept for people in towns in Louisiana and Alaska who are being relocated due to the rising seas."
"A new study has just appeared in the Journal of Climate which deals with an issue commonly raised by those who deny that human-caused climate change is a serious risk. As I have written many times, we know humans are causing the Earth’s climate to change. We know this for many reasons.  First, we know that certain gases trap heat; this fact is indisputable. Second, we know that humans have significantly increased the amount of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere. Again, this is indisputable. Third, we know the Earth is warming (again indisputable). We know the Earth warms because we are actually measuring the warming rate in multiple different ways. Those measurements are in good agreement with each other.  Of course there is other evidence too. For instance, ice loss across the globe is widespread: in the Arctic, the Antarctic ice shelves, Greenland, and from land glaciers. Sea levels are rising as warm water expands in volume and as melt waters flow into the ocean. We are also seeing changes of weather patterns and climatic zones shift. The point is, there is a whole body of evidence that proves the climate is changing and the change is caused largely by human emissions of greenhouse gases.  Over the years, contrarians have looked for evidence that the climate either isn’t changing or the change is not as fast as predicted. Their findings have often been used in the media to suggest that human-caused climate change was not something to worry about. But we’ve seen, over and over and over again, that these contrarian arguments don’t hold up.  Repeatedly, mainstream scientists have taken these claims seriously and discovered they were just plain wrong. In some cases, the contrarians have made simple arithmetic errors (like mixing up a negative and positive sign in their equations), while in others, they have made more fundamental errors. But regardless, they have been wrong time after time. But whenever they are found to be wrong, they just go and find some new piece of evidence that once again calls into doubt our understanding of the human-climate link.  One contrarian argument has appeared repeatedly over the past few years, even at a hearing before the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce held by Ted Cruz in 2015. The claim was by well-known contrarian John Christy. Christy claimed that the mid-troposphere temperatures (temperatures in approximately the middle of the atmosphere) are rising three times faster in climate models when compared with measurements. Another related claim is that there has been no statistically significant warming in the troposphere (lower part of the atmosphere) for 18 years.  Now, both of these facts, even if they were true, would not prove much. We know the Earth is warming because of measurements in oceans, underground, and at the Earth’s surface. But it would open a question as to why the atmosphere is behaving differently. The recent paper just published looked at these two claims. The authors found errors in the analysis that, when corrected, debunked the contrarian claims. Let me explain some of the science.  First, these atmospheric temperatures are measured by satellites which can “see” the temperature of gases in the atmosphere. It works differently from a thermometer but regardless, such measurements are possible. These measurements have a lot of uncertainty.  First of all, as the Earth warms from greenhouse gases, the upper part of the atmosphere should cool down. A simplistic but appropriate description is that greenhouse gases hold the heat down toward the Earth, making the upper atmosphere cooler. Since the satellites see both the upper and lower parts of the atmosphere, the cooling upper region may contaminate the measurements of the warming lower part of the atmosphere. A second source of uncertainty is that the satellites themselves are not perfect. When satellites are launched, they orbit the Earth for a number of years until they are replaced by new satellites. The data, which goes back to 1979, is actually stitched together from multiple satellites in sequence. No two satellites are completely identical – sort of like no two thermometers will give exactly the same temperature. These differences have to be rectified and are another source of error. Additionally, the satellites change while they are in orbit, in particular they lose altitude and their orbiting time drifts (the time they pass certain global locations drifts later and later in the day). Both of these facts contaminate the measurements and must be accounted for. There are other accuracy issues as well that space doesn’t permit discussion, but you get the point. So, this recent paper did a few things. First, they took the contrarian argument that the mid-troposphere temperatures have been rising at only 1/3 the rate predicted by models. They found that Christy’s team neglected the contamination of the cooling in the upper stratosphere. When they applied this correction, they found that Christy’s claim was incorrect. Differences between modeled and observed warming rates were much smaller, and had known explanations.  Next, the authors asked whether it is true that there has been no warming in the lower atmosphere (troposphere) in the past 18 years. They found that for five of the six groups that provide satellite temperature analysis, this claim was also incorrect. Finally, they asked whether it is true that the temperature changes in different layers of the atmosphere are in disagreement in models and measurements. Their result is that when temperature changes in different layers of the atmosphere are compared, one of three satellite records is in close agreement with the climate models.  While this paper largely debunks the most current contrarian mainstay, it doesn’t answer all of our questions. For instance, exactly how accurate are these satellite measurements and how can they be made better? Do the models capture all of the thermal processes which are occurring, especially in the middle and upper layer of the atmosphere? Why does there appear to be a small difference in the satellites and the model predictions in the middle of the atmosphere? Is this difference important?  These questions can be answered, but a prerequisite is a continuation of high-quality data from satellites. This means a continued commitment to launching new measurement satellites as the current fleet ages."
"It is a sign of the British political world’s current priorities that Theresa May has finally made the decision to opt for a third runway at Heathrow. She promised it was a decision for “jobs and growth”, both of which may be scarcer in the post-Brexit era in which the new runway will come into service. Pumping hope into the economy is now considered worth alienating every Conservative council and MP whose voters live under the flightpath of planes using the new runway, including Mrs May’s own Maidenhead constituents. It is worth at least one backbench resignation (and maybe a lost byelection) and a novel reinterpretation of the convention about cabinet responsibility in order to accommodate public dissent from at least two ministers. It is worth what will probably be millions of pounds fighting legal challenges over air and noise pollution. Most of all, the decision puts old-fashioned economics firmly ahead of tackling climate change, which turned out not to be worth a single mention in transport secretary Chris Grayling’s opening statement to MPs. The decision, which has now to be incorporated into a national policy statement on aviation that MPs will vote on some time in the next 18 months, comes heavily gilded with incentives to local residents to take the money and keep quiet. About 750 homes will be subject to compulsory purchase: £1.5bn has been set aside to pay compensation at the market rate for the unblighted value of each home and for the resettlement costs of the residents. At least another £1bn will be paid out for noise insulation in schools and improvements in public facilities. There will be a new community resource fund. Mr Grayling promised MPs that there would be a 50% increase in travellers arriving at Heathrow by public transport, and the cost of improving road access would fall not to the taxpayer but to the developers. The £17bn bill for development is to be picked up by the developers and not passed on to air passengers. A senior retired judge has been appointed to oversee the consultation period. “This is not expansion at any cost, but the right scheme at the right price,” Mr Grayling declared.  There are many flaws in the government case which a determined opposition will unpick between now and the next general election in 2020. Campaigners, including the foreign secretary Boris Johnson, already plan to make it a central issue. This is the decision of a government that is not prepared to think boldly about the implications of its commitment to reduce carbon emissions by 80% over the next 35 years. Instead, a huge investment will be made in promoting leisure travel (which already accounts for almost two-thirds of journeys in and out of Heathrow) in the name of facilitating business connections. Thousands of jobs will be created – but they will mainly be for baggage handlers and baristas. Mr Grayling made a commitment to at least six new domestic destinations to enhance UK-wide connectivity, a questionable decision if the government review of HS2, the high speed train that will one day link Glasgow and Edinburgh to London, gives the project the go-ahead. If, on the other hand, HS2 is vetoed, the pressure for more highly polluting short-haul flights will only grow. Expanding air travel will make it harder than ever to cut carbon emissions to meet the targets set out in the newly ratified Paris agreement. Air pollution has an even more immediate effect on the health of the local population. The area around Heathrow already regularly breaches safe levels of nitrogen dioxide and, with expansion, will continue to do so up until 2030. Local councils are threatening a legal challenge on those grounds alone. The lobbying organisation ClientEarth has just taken the government back to court for failing to obey an earlier injunction to produce a national plan for tackling pollution. The scale of an opposition that has been years in preparation may be enough to stall plans altogether. Zac Goldsmith, the Conservative MP for Richmond Park who has resigned over the go-ahead, warned Mr Grayling that his plan was doomed. He ought to be right. This is a short-sighted investment that may provide a boost to the economy – a mere £60bn over 60 years – at the cost of long-term harm to globally critical climate change objectives. This is no way to run an economy that works for everyone: more flights and greater connectivity will benefit only those who can afford to travel. Those who can’t will gain nothing, not so much as a single airline meal."
"Ever since the Met Office was derided for predicting a barbecue summer, long-range weather forecasting for the season ahead has been avoided. The most that is attempted is 30 days, and the current forecast contains so many ifs, buts and possibilities that almost any weather might occur in November and no one could complain. That does not mean that predicting the weather for the coming season is not the ambition of every meteorologist and scientist, especially as climate change makes extreme weather both more likely and economically important.  In Britain the track of depressions across the country that turn into winter storms and bring the threat of flooding are of increasing concern. The warmer atmosphere out in the Atlantic means more water in the clouds has to be deposited as rain. The second threat, extreme cold, is posed by changes in the Arctic. According to the latest research, the jet stream, that is responsible for pushing the depressions towards us across the Atlantic, is developing a wavy habit. This has led to the current dry spell as long lasting high-pressure systems block the path of the lows that would normally bring autumn rain. If the weather pattern persists, or returns in the winter, the weather will turn cold and could remain bleak for days and possibly weeks. Researchers say this has already happened in the past in the UK, and brought the winters that the Eastern United States has suffered recently with record snowfalls. And it may soon happen again.  On the other hand, as the Met Office would be careful to say, it might just rain a lot."
"Howard J Curtis of Liverpool asks why the shale gas and oil under the South Downs national park is not being exploited (Letters, 17 October). He needs to check his facts. Oil is being extracted from under the South Downs (in Lidsey, Markwells Wood, Singleton and Storrington, for example), there are applications for four wells, including horizontal drilling at Markwells Wood, and there is a site at Broadford Bridge that was prepared by one company, and which is now on the action list by another to bring in a drill. The issues haven’t gone away from Balcombe either. And I do object to such activity taking place, not only here in West Sussex but also elsewhere, including Lancashire and North Yorkshire, when the climate change issues need to be addressed, and quickly.  Why are we going after the most difficult fossil fuels to obtain, when they need to stay in the ground and when the economic return on investment is so low? When drills leak and materials can contaminate water supplies? When the Weald area has so many faults that chemicals can easily move towards streams, and when there are no facilities in the south (unlike the five in the north) to deal with the issues of waste water involving large amounts of contaminated materials that cannot be dealt with by sewage treatment works. A workshop held in the US last November to look at fracking, and attended by some 50 of the top US and UK scientists, found more than 140 questions that needed to be answered.Dr Jill SutcliffeWisborough Green, West Sussex • The South Downs has several small oilfields, including Singleton, in the middle of the national park, quietly producing oil. While natural gas was used to light Heathfield, East Sussex, after it was discovered in water wells in 1896, an initial assessment by the British Geological Survey suggests the Weald has only limited potential for shale oil. The Jurassic clays contain around 4.4 billion barrels of oil, compared with 37.6 trillion cubic metres of shale gas, which may be trapped within the Bowland shales, equivalent to 2,210 billion barrels of oil. Though only a small fraction of this can ever be recovered, it is simply selfish to continue importing hydrocarbons from laxly regulated countries, which are left to suffer from the resulting pollution. What worries me most in the planning applications is the absence of detailed geological mapping – even when at Wisborough Green in West Sussex 1:10,560 maps existed to help to assess the surface impact of such sites. Even if we cut back drastically on consumption, we cannot afford to reject cleaner forms of transitional carbon technologies, including coalbed methane and carbon capture. Given that the UK has a dire balance of payments, these savings are needed to pay for the alternative energy we desperately need.David NowellFellow of the Geological Society • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com"
"Every winter, it seems, we see pictures in the press and on TV of St Mark’s Square looking like a lake. People wading through thigh-high water. Boats bobbing outside the famous cafes. Venice is sinking rapidly, these images imply. The pictures are misleading, however. St Mark’s Square does indeed get flooded, dozens of times every year, but in all except the worst floods more than 90% of the rest of the city remains above water. And though many buildings in Venice are subsiding, the city as a whole isn’t sinking – rather, parts of it are becoming submerged.  The major floods are destructive, of course. Whenever water breaks through the stone damp-courses that protect most Venetian buildings, it seeps into the porous brickwork. All over Venice, walls are dissolving. And if, with global warming, sea levels rise as they are projected to, the situation is going to get a lot worse. Having an average depth of little over one metre, the Venetian lagoon is particularly vulnerable to the vagaries of the climate. Which is why the construction of a movable barrier across the entrances to the lagoon seems to many people the obvious way of averting calamity. Mose, as Venice’s flood barrier is known, consists of 80 huge steel flaps that lie on the bed of the lagoon, forming a submerged barrage that will be raised whenever the water rises dangerously. It might appear to be an obvious solution to the crisis. Yet Mose is a project that makes many Venetians despair, for various reasons. For one thing, it’s way behind schedule. Work began in 2003, more than 20 years after the scheme was submitted to central government, and is still incomplete. Corruption, inevitably, is partly to blame. Many opponents of Mose alleged from the start that the scheme would be a gigantic palm-greasing exercise, and so it has proved. In 2014, Giorgio Orsoni, the incumbent mayor of Venice, was arrested in connection with investigations into the funding of the barrier. It appears that as much as €1bn has gone astray in a labyrinth of shady deals. We are now told that Mose will finally be functional next year. Many locals are not so sure. In 2014, the Nuova Venezia newspaper published photos that showed that the steel flaps had already suffered more corrosion than the builders had anticipated. In August this year, a test-run of the floodgates was a fiasco. But let’s assume that, eventually, Mose will work as intended. Will it be Venice’s salvation? To answer that question, we need to look at why the water spills into the city’s streets so often. The acqua alta, as the seasonal flooding is known, is caused by a combination of high tides, fluctuations in atmospheric pressure and southeasterly winds. It’s always been a feature of Venetian life. But the frequency and severity of flooding has increased markedly since the middle of the 20th century. Between 2000 and 2013 there were eight highest-category floods recorded – more than in the preceding 50 years. This phenomenon is not explained by subsidence or any rise in sea level. It’s the result of changes in the way the lagoon has been managed. One factor has been the reclamation of large areas of land, for Marco Polo airport and the industrial sites of Marghera, and in central Venice itself – notably around the docks and the Tronchetto car parks. The marshes and mudflats of the lagoon play a crucial role in dissipating the energy of the incoming water, so their reduction has led to an increase in the destructiveness of the tides. Even worse has been the impact of shipping. When the refineries and factories of Marghera were developed in the interwar years, deep channels were carved out of the lagoon bed to allow tankers to get into the port. The result: too much sea water gets into the lagoon, and it’s moving too quickly. All over the city, foundations are being scoured out by the quick-flowing tides. And disruption of the lagoon’s long-established equilibrium has resulted in an increase in the number of extremely low tides as well as the number of floods. Most buildings in Venice are built on wooden pilings driven deep into the mudbanks. They’ll last for centuries as long as they stay underwater, but now the water level sometimes drops so far that air gets at the pilings, causing them to rot. And there’s another source of erosion. In the past two decades, the volume of motor-powered traffic on Venice’s canals has doubled. The foundations of more than 60% of the buildings on the Grand Canal have been damaged by the wash from the waterbuses and barges, and the situation has worsened since Venice became one of the Mediterranean’s biggest ports for cruise ships. These monstrous vessels – most of which plough right through the Giudecca canal, past the Doge’s Palace, on their way to the docks – are the most contentious issue in the city at the moment. So far, there has been no serious assessment of the damage they are causing, though it’s known that the turbulence the ships create goes on for hours after they have passed. In 2015 the biggest ships were banned from the Giudecca canal. This was widely hailed as good news, but there was an under-reported catch: the ruling applied only to vessels of more than 95,000 tonnes. To put this in perspective, the Titanic was nowhere near that size. And the ban was soon overturned anyway. Depressingly, Luigi Brugnaro, the businessman who became Venice’s mayor in June 2015, does not see much of a problem here. He’s in favour of a scheme that will divert the mega-cruisers to the docks via the southern lagoon. This would entail large-scale redredging that critics say will damage the ecosystem even more than the cruise ships do at the moment. So it seems that the mega-cruisers will continue to bring in tens of thousands of people who spend very little time – or cash – in the city itself. Which brings us to the other issue that’s giving rise to increasingly vehement protests in Venice: mass tourism. The population of central Venice and the lagoon islands has now dropped below 55,000. The number of visitors, annually, is approaching 7 million. Around half of those don’t even stay for one night, and thus contribute almost nothing to the local economy. Venice’s financial situation is dire: the town hall has a shortfall of tens of millions of euros in its operating budget, and its debts exceed €400m. In effect, the place is bankrupt. And with nearly all of Venice’s special funding for maintenance of the historic centre having been diverted into the money pit of the flood barrier, much of the city’s fabric is in need of urgent repair. That said, the churches and palazzi should continue to stand for many more decades. Long before the water overwhelms Venice, however, it could die of tourism. As short-stay rentals push the cost of living in Venice higher with every passing year, the native population is being driven out. Venice is becoming a ghost-city, a high-culture holiday resort. It’s in that sense that it’s really sinking – and fast."
"The world is in a new era of “climate change reality”, with carbon dioxide in the atmosphere reaching a symbolic threshold which it will not fall below for many generations, scientists have said. In 2015, for the first time, carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere were at 400 parts per million (ppm) on average across the year as a whole, the World Meteorological Organisation’s (WMO) annual greenhouse gas bulletin reveals.  The longest established greenhouse gas monitoring station in the world, at Mauna Loa in Hawaii, predicts carbon dioxide concentrations will stay above the symbolic 400ppm for the whole of 2016 and reach new highs. It will not dip below the 400ppm mark again for many generations, the experts said. The growth spurt in carbon dioxide levels, which saw a bigger-than-average increase in the greenhouse gas in the atmosphere between 2014 and 2015, was fuelled by the El Niño weather phenomenon in the Pacific. The strong El Niño, which started in 2015 and continued into this year, triggered droughts in tropical regions and reduced the ability of forests, vegetation and oceans to absorb carbon dioxide, leaving more in the atmosphere. But over the longer term it is the increase of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide from human activity including industry and agriculture which caused a 37% increase in the warming effect on the planet between 1990 and 2015. Around two-thirds of the warming effect, known as radiative forcing, by long-lived greenhouse gases comes from carbon dioxide. Levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere stood at around 278ppm before the industrial revolution, a concentration which the WMO said represented a natural balance on Earth. Human activities have altered the natural balance and in 2015 global average levels of carbon dioxide were 44% above pre-industrial levels. The greenhouse gas bulletin was released ahead of the next round of climate talks, which will mark the early entry into force of the Paris agreement, the world’s first comprehensive deal to tackle climate change agreed in the French capital last year. WMO secretary-general, Petteri Taalas, said: “The year 2015 ushered in a new era of optimism and climate action with the Paris climate change agreement. “But it will also make history as marking a new era of climate change reality with record high greenhouse gas concentrations.” He added: “The El Niño event has disappeared. Climate change has not.” And he said: “Without tackling carbon dioxide emissions, we cannot tackle climate change and keep temperature increases to below 2C above the pre-industrial era. “It is therefore of the utmost importance that the that the Paris agreement does indeed enter into force well ahead of schedule on 4 November and that we fast-track its implementation.” The Paris agreement commits countries to keeping temperature rises to “well below” 2C and to pursue efforts to limit increases to 1.5C, by cutting greenhouse gas emissions to net zero in the second half of the century."
"Sir David Attenborough has hailed the start of construction of a polar research ship, which shot to fame amid calls to name it Boaty McBoatface, as a “marvellous occasion”. It was eventually decided to name the ship after the naturalist and TV presenter, and he will lay the first block of the keel on Monday. This is a traditional maritime ceremony to bring good luck to a vessel during its construction and its captain and crew during its working life. Attenborough said: “It is a marvellous occasion. I have sailed on British Antarctic Survey (BAS) ships before and been on a BAS station in the Antarctic, so I know what sort of thing that ship is going to go through. “I am very flattered to be asked to lay the keel.” The £200m vessel has been commissioned by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and is being built in the UK on Merseyside in the largest commercial shipbuilding project in the country in 30 years. Once it sets sail in 2019, the RRS Sir David Attenborough will provide the UK with the most advanced floating research fleet in the world and will carry out work into the world’s oceans and tackling climate change, the NERC said. It first grabbed headlines after a “name our ship” competition, in which the suggestion Boaty McBoatface topped the public poll with more than 124,000 votes, more than three times its nearest rival. Commenting on the name, Attenborough told ITV’s Good Morning Britain: “The name is actually going to be preserved on one of the submersibles which are going to be operating from the research ship when it’s built. “So there will be a BAS, or whatever the correct initials are, Boatface or Boaty, or something of that sort.” The final decision on the name was made by Jo Johnson, the science minister, and the announcement that the vessel would be called after Attenborough was made just days before his 90th birthday. Asked about the importance of the work likely to be carried out by the ship, Attenborough added: “It is the research that comes from the sort of vessel which this is that is important, and you might not think that way down in the Antarctic has got that much to do with us, but in point of fact a lot of weather is generated from down there and it was research that was done down there in the Antarctic which was responsible for discovering the hole in the ozone layer. “And it was that research that brought the world’s attention to the danger, and brought scientists together to figure out how to fix it, and nations together to fix it as we have done now.” About 1,000 people will attend the keel-laying ceremony, including guests from the spheres of science, technology and engineering as well as the shipyard workforce. Johnson said: “The RRS Sir David Attenborough, with Boaty McBoatface operated from her as a robotic underwater vehicle, will be one of the most advanced research ships in the world. “It will help inspire the next generation of scientists in the UK and build on our status as one of the world’s leading nations in polar science, engineering and technology. “With Merseyside’s proud history and expertise in ship building, this project will support over 460 local jobs and apprenticeships, and provide a boost to the region and the whole ‘northern powerhouse’.”"
"Scientists in Rio de Janeiro have warned that the city’s sea defences may not be able to cope with the effects of climate change after a record storm surge swamped beaches, dumping hundreds of tonnes of sand across nearby roads and buildings. Waves of almost four metres in the weekend storm left beach flags fluttering in tatters, forced the closure of deckchair-rental gazebos, and inundated coconut-and-beer kiosks with grit and sea water.  Tourists who had expected to bask in the glorious sunshine that is normal at the start of the southern hemisphere summer walked ponderously along a shoreline that is only slowly recovering from the unseasonal buffeting, while local traders lamented the collapse in business. “This is the worst I have seen in the 20 years since I started working here,” said Dominique Souza as he surveyed the aftermath of the storm surge at Post 11 in Leblon: giant heaps of sand, cracked pavements and deluged public toilets. He estimated a more than 80% fall in sales over the past few days at his baraca (beach stall) that sells cold drinks and rents parasols. Although he expects business to pick up as soon as the weather improves, climate scientists are debating whether wave-slamming on this scale poses an increasing threat to Rio’s beach economy, which is estimated to be worth 2bn reais (£509m/$622m) a year and directly and indirectly employs more than 230,000 people.  In the 1990s, storm surge disruptions occurred roughly once a year, but since 2010 they have hit Rio four or five times as frequently. There have already been four this year, including two of the biggest ever seen. In April, two people were killed when a 50-metre stretch of the Tim Maia bike path was washed away just months after it was built.  This time what was left of the bike path was temporarily shut down – along with the Delfim Moreira Avenue – to prevent further fatalities and damage. One pedestrian area was also closed off due to subsidence risks, and a wooden deck area – the Mirante do Leblon – was damaged.  David Zee, oceanography professor at the State University of Rio de Janeiro, said the immediate cause of the swell was a cyclone off the coast of Uruguay combined with the high tide of a new moon. But he said the timing and scale of the extreme weather event posed longer-term climate concerns. “This storm surge is not normal at this time of the year. The surges usually happen in August or September at the latest and they are not so big. This indicates that, without a doubt, the climate is altering.” The increasing frequency of the storms is hindering Rio’s beaches’ ability to recuperate, leading to erosion along stretches of the shoreline at Copacabana, Arproador and Macumba, and accumulation elsewhere, such as Leblon. Vitor Zanetti, of the Technological Institute of Aeronautics, called on the government and local businesses to respond to what he predicted would become a growing trend. “This was an extreme climate event,” he said. “The one thing all climate scientists agree on is that we will see more storms and droughts.” With the latest wave dumping sand and water in buildings across the street from the beach, he suggested hotels relocate their lobbies to higher floors. We need to start thinking about adaptation,” he said.  But there is no consensus on the causes.  Alfredo Silveira, an associate professor of synoptic meteorology at Rio’s Federal University, said the size of the surge was within the predictable patterns of wave behaviour rather than the result of climate change. “There is no mystery in its definition or origin. It was predicted and well documented. But it was a bit outside of the usual time frame, a bit late.” Others meteorologists blamed El Niño, though its impact faded earlier this year. Hugo Abi Karam, a meteorologist from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, was more inclined to blame the surge on local factors, such as silt accumulation, poor drainage, seafront construction But there is little doubt that Rio – like much of south-east Brazil – is suffering more storm surges, extreme rainfall and protracted droughts. Given these long-term trends, Carlos Rittl, executive secretary of the Climate Observatory coalition of NGOs, said the recent wave damage was the latest sign that Brazil must fulfil its responsibilities to reduce carbon emissions, when it joins other countries in United Nations climate talks later this week.  “This shows the high degree of vulnerability to climate change in Brazil, which has 7,400km of shoreline and 25% of its population living on the coast,” he said. “This extreme weather event must at least draw attention to the need for the country to be consistent on its climate policy – and not invest in more fossil fuels thinking that it has already done a lot to curb emissions.” "
"The pope’s call for action on climate change has fallen on closed ears, research suggests. A study by researchers in the US has found that right-leaning Catholics who had heard of the pope’s message were less concerned about climate change and its effects on the poor than those who had not, and had a dimmer view of the pope’s credibility.   “The pope and his papal letter failed to rally any broad support on climate change among the US Catholics and non-Catholics,” said Nan Li, first author of the research from Texas Tech University.  “The conservative Catholics who are cross-pressured by the inconsistency between the viewpoints of their political allies and their religious authority would tend to devalue the pope’s credibility on this issue in order to resolve the cognitive dissonance that they experience,” she added. Issued in June 2015, Pope Francis’s encyclical, called Laudato Si’, warned of an “unprecedented destruction of ecosystems” if climate change continues unchecked and cited the scientific consensus that human activity is behind global warming.  Research conducted on the eve of the announcement found that 68% of Americans and 71% of US Catholics believe in climate change, with Democrats more likely than Republicans to believe in the issue, put it down to human causes and rate it as a serious problem. The pontiff’s comments were seen by many as a significant call for action in the battle against climate change, focusing on the moral need to address the impact of humans on the planet. “Pope Francis is personally committed to this [climate] issue like no other pope before him. The encyclical will have a major impact,” said Christiana Figueres, the UN’s climate chief, at the time. But new research published in the journal Climatic Change suggests that the encyclical might not have had the anticipated rallying effect on public opinion. In a nationally representative survey of 2,755 individuals across the US, including more than 700 Catholics, researchers quizzed individuals on their attitudes towards climate change, its effects on the poor and papal credibility on the issue, together with questions on their political views and demographics such as age, sex and ethnicity. The team found that 22.5% of respondents said they had either heard of the pope’s message or his plans for the letter.  Overall, the team found that members of the public who identified as politically liberal, whether Catholic or not, were more likely to be concerned about climate change and perceive climate change as disproportionately affecting the poor than those who identified as conservative.  But knowledge of the papal letter did not overall appear to be linked to higher levels of concern regarding climate change.  Instead, the researchers found that the effects of awareness of the letter were small, although awareness was linked to more polarised views. For both Catholics and non-Catholics, conservatives who were aware of the letter were less likely to be concerned about climate change and its risk to the poor, compared to those who had not. The opposite trend was seen among liberals. But, the authors say, among both conservative Catholics and non-Catholics who had heard of the encyclical, the pontiff’s perceived credibility decreased as political leaning veered to the right.  “For people who are most conservative, the Catholics who are aware of the encyclical give the pope 0.5 less than Catholics who aren’t aware of the encyclical on a one to five scale,” said Li. The researchers say it is not clear if the increased polarisation is caused by hearing about the encyclical or, for example, if more politically engaged individuals were simply more likely to be aware of the papal letter.  “In sum, while [the] pope’s environmental call may have increased some individuals’ concerns about climate change, it backfired with conservative Catholics and non-Catholics, who not only resisted the message but defended their pre-existing beliefs by devaluing the pope’s credibility on climate change,” the authors write. The results chime with the reaction to the papal stance by conservative media and a number of prominent individuals, including former presidential candidate Jeb Bush who rebuffed the pope’s message, saying: “I don’t get economic policy from my bishops or my cardinal or my pope.” Neil Thorns, director of advocacy at the Catholic aid agency Cafod, said: “Laudato Si’ was a wake-up call on how we’re treating our planet and its people which unsurprisingly – although disappointingly - some climate deniers and those with vested interests were not willing to hear.”   "
"Scientists and conservationists have called for a purportedly pro-environmental group supporting the Great Barrier Reef to distance itself from climate deniers, after the broadcaster Alan Jones launched the group and said the reef was “fine” and that climate change was a “hoax”. The calls come as details emerged regarding links between the group, called Citizens of the Great Barrier Reef, and the former environment minister Greg Hunt, whose department sought to minimise publicity about the danger climate change posed to the reef. Citizens of the Great Barrier Reef describes itself as an educational and crowdfunding website, where members can contribute money and vote to direct funds to particular research projects. But launching Citizens of the Great Barrier Reef this week, Jones took a swipe at groups that have campaigned to save the reef, including the Climate Council, WWF and Greenpeace, for “climate alarmism”. “The global warming alarmists will stop at nothing,” Jones said on his radio in a special broadcast from Cairns, after taking a helicopter ride over the reef. “Like much associated with the global warming hoax, truth was the casualty.” Jones said the reef was fine, and that it would regenerate. The chief executive of the Climate Council, Amanda McKenzie, told Guardian Australia the group must set the record straight. “They need to immediately come out and distance themselves from those comments and make clear what their approach is to climate change and the reef and what their attitudes will be to educating people about the reef – because that’s one of their main aims.” Terry Hughes, head of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University took to twitter, also calling for the group to distance itself from climate deniers. #GreatBarrierTourism industry needs to dissociate from #climatechange denialists https://t.co/QAgkmwUw6T McKenzie said the group needed to make clear what the attitude was on climate change. “If you’re going to educate people on the reef, it’s not just educating people about its beauty and tourism opportunities, you’ve also got to talk about the threats and it’s in grave danger from climate change.” Alex de Waal, chairman of the Citizens for the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, initially told Guardian Australia that “Alan Jones hasn’t been engaged to launch the initiative”. “Anybody that comes to us that says we want to tell the community about the Citizens for the Great Barrier Reef program, we are very encouraging,” he said. But a spokesperson for Citizens of the Great Barrier Reef said Jones had been invited to launch the initiative, and the group put out a press release announcing his involvement. De Waal said the group had not decided what criteria it would use to choose which educational and research projects would be highlighted on its $1m website, but that the board would make those decisions. Asked directly whether they would allow projects that highlighted climate change, a spokeswoman for the project said: “The board has not yet met to discuss the objectives, but the directors will consider any project that will have a positive impact on the Reef.” De Waal is also chief executive of Tourism Tropical North Queensland, the lobby group for the region’s tourism industry. In April the Cairns Post reported de Waal saying that reports of bleaching needed to be tempered by reports about what is happening to parts of the reef that weren’t being bleached. And in June, de Waal told the Guardian that reporting of the bleaching was affecting tourist numbers in Queensland. Also in June, de Waal said on the Tourism Tropical North Queensland website that the then-environment minister Greg Hunt had worked with the local Coalition member, Warren Entsch, to secure $1.3m in funding for Citizens of the Great Barrier Reef. In return, de Waal said Tourism Tropical North Queensland endorsed Entsch in the election. That announcement came one month after the Guardian revealed that Hunt’s department had moved to have every reference to the Great Barrier Reef, and Australia, scrubbed from a United Nations report on climate change. An environment department spokesperson told Guardian Australia at the time that it did that because such a report could hurt tourism. Within hours of the Guardian’s revelation, Hunt went on The Project and applauded the department for its actions. Others in the tourism industry, like Col McKenzie, the chief executive of the Association of Marine Park Tourism Operators, were also concerned about reports linking climate change to the Great Barrier Reef. McKenzie said reports were exaggerated and was a “great white lie”. Citizens of the Great Barrier Reef lists a number of partners, most of which are tourism bodies. But James Cook University and the Great Barrier Reef marine park authority (GBRMPA) are also listed. A spokesman for James Cook University said it would be providing educational materials for people who sign up to the initiative, and directed further enquiries to de Waal. A spokeswoman for GBRMPA said it would be “looking for opportunities to work together on projects that encourage actions to improve the health of the reef”. “Along with other parties, we provided initial advice to Citizens of the Great Barrier Reef on potential methodology for deciding which research and conservation projects are detailed on their website,” she said. Asked whether GBRMPA was concerned about Jones’ comments at the initiative’s launch, the spokeswoman said: “We reiterate the findings of our 2009 and 2014 Outlook Reports — both of which stated that climate change is the most serious threat to the health of the Great Barrier Reef.” She continued: “Preliminary findings from this year’s coral bleaching indicate 22 per cent of coral died as a direct result of unusually high sea temperatures brought about by climate change, a strong El Niño and local conditions. Reducing global greenhouse gas emissions represents the single biggest action we can take as a community to protect the reef for current and future generations.”"
"Mid-morning in the Luquillo experimental forest in north-west Puerto Rico, and the thermometer already reads 26C. Tana Wood, an ecologist employed by the US Forest Service, pulls on a pair of heavy gloves for insulating against electrical shock.  Over two years, her team here has laid out hexagonal plots four metres across, each about the size of a backyard trampoline. Industrial-strength heaters suspended several metres above the ground from metal scaffolding on the perimeter of three plots will heat the soil and undergrowth to 4C above the forest’s ambient temperature.   Wood is about to start up an experiment that may help climate scientists to figure out how jungles in the Amazon, the Congo and elsewhere will reacting to rising temperatures. Earth’s equatorial band of forests might either slow down or speed up global warming, scientists say, depending on how it responds to higher temperatures. Each year fossil fuel exhaust adds about 30bn tonnes of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Half of it remains aloft. The rest is absorbed quickly — in about equal parts — by ocean water and plants on land, buffering the rate at which the insulating gas builds up. “Nature has done us a fantastic favour,” says Scott Denning, an atmospheric scientist at Colorado State University, Fort Collins.  But nature might not be so generous on a hotter planet, Denning says. While researchers expect little change in what the ocean does, vegetation on land, especially in the tropics, might soak up less or even convert into CO2 the vast stockpiles of carbon now locked up in their soils into CO2.  Jerry Melillo, a scientist at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, said that increased atmospheric warming caused by CO2 emanating from tropical soil could further raise soil temperatures. The warmer soil could, in turn, release even more carbon dioxide, heating up the atmosphere even further. “So that warming will beget more warming.” Some researchers say the mutually reinforcing feedback might be impossible to halt once set in motion. What happens in tropical jungles depends on how they respond to several anticipated changes: increased concentrations of CO2 in the air, warmer temperatures and changes in precipitation. Experiments have warmed up ecosystems elsewhere. Melillo has been heating a New England forest with buried cables since 1991. He says that for decades he’s urging other scientists to run a similar experiment in the tropics. Wood’s research in Puerto Rico will be world’s first attempt to do so. Palm, cedar and soaring teak trees cast deep shade in the Luquillo forest, which was once cleared for pasture. Little wind penetrates the dense foliage. A green frond flutters to the ground and settles alongside a leaf, and a lizard darts up a trunk  Wood and Aura Alonso-Rodriguez, the experiment’s project manger, follow an elaborate protocol to avoid electrocution from the high-voltage cabling and equipment or a fire. In addition to shockproof gloves, they wear high-voltage boots. They sweep sticks and leaves that might burst into flames off the heaters, which will use as much electricity as 15 average US homes. Satisfied that the apparatus is ready, they turn to the last remaining detail: a finicky instrument for measuring CO2 released from soil has malfunctioned.  The researchers had hoped to turn on the power over the summer but suffered a series of setbacks and delays. The custom circuit board that controls the heaters burned out. A fire in one of Puerto Rico’s power plants shut down most of the island’s grid. Now, in late September, the automated CO2 monitoring device is giving meaningless results. “I can take troubleshooting for a year, but not more than that,” says Alonso-Rodriguez.  Following detailed instructions sent by email, Wood and Alonso-Rodriguez dismantle the broken instrument. To their amazement and delight they get it to work again by mid-afternoon. “Let’s start it up,” says Wood. They’ve set up a control room in an air conditioned closet. With the click of a mouse, Alonso-Rodriguez turns the heaters on. Wood slouches in an office chair and stares at the laptop screen. On a graph, a red line indicating temperature in the plots makes a slow, jagged ascent. The experiment has begun."
"A well-funded international campaign to counter the influence of Rupert Murdoch’s media empire on climate change has been planned, emails to Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman reveal. The plan to use “guerilla tactics”, civil disobedience and targeted advertising appears to have been hatched by David Fenton, founder of Fenton Communications, a US public relations agency.   The proposal aimed to “make Murdoch’s climate denial a major issue,” and “bring the scientific facts on climate change to his audiences directly in print and on television”. It would involve adverts in his and other publications, and the creation of websites that disseminated facts about climate change, and directly challenged the reporting in Murdoch media. The goal was to put Murdoch “on the defensive on climate change,” and make it possible for conservative politicians to support action on climate change. Part of the plan involved “public shaming” of Murdoch so that his children, who have more progressive views on climate change, would have “leverage with their father”. On 19 February 2015, David Fenton thanked Clinton’s chairman, John Podesta, for a meeting earlier that day, and sent him two emails. WikiLeaks has published a series of emails hacked from Podesta’s account, and Clinton’s campaign has neither confirmed or denied their authenticity but has attacked what it said were Russian state actors involved in obtaining them. One email said: “Here is the plan to go after [the Wall Street Journal] and Fox [the TV network] on climate. I have 500,000 [dollars] of this pledged if I can raise another million. It’s a real pledge from Graeme Wood in Australia. I sure hope something like this can happen it’s long overdue.” Graeme Wood is the founder of travel website Wotif and an internet entrepreneur who provided a loan to help launch Guardian Australia. Wood told the Guardian: “It sounded like a good idea at the time but in the end I didn’t proceed with any funding.” Some of the strategies discussed in the plan in 2015 went ahead this year, with an ad campaign designed and written by Fenton’s company. A group called Partnership for Responsible Growth ran ads in the Wall Street Journal and Fox in June and July this year. They were created by Fenton’s agency and contain many of the same messages outlined in the email to Podesta. It is unclear who funded the campaign.  The plan, attached to the email and dated 1 December 2015 said: “Unless and until Murdoch is put on the defensive on climate change, opening political space for conservatives to come forward, it is unlikely that bipartisan efforts on climate change will be achieved in time.” “Fox News is the biggest single factor keeping almost 40% of Americans from believing humans are changing the climate, while only 10% know that 97% of climate scientists agree we are warming the earth at our peril.” “In some ways, the effect of the Wall Street Journal is even worse, as it sows regular confusion among its 3 million daily subscribers – business leaders and investors among the most influential people in the country.” The plan also mentioned the role Murdoch papers played in Australia and the UK. It outlined and costed a $2m plan with six main steps and 12 “campaign elements”.  According to the plan, $600,000 would be spent advertisements in the Wall Street Journal and $350,000 would be given to other groups including Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace to conduct “grassroots and social media activism”. Plans for a campaign outside the US were not costed but Fenton said: “We would be happy to work with counterparts in Australia and the UK to create proportional budgets for similar campaigns there, adapted to local conditions.” Fenton concluded: “We have let Rupert Murdoch get away with this atrocious behavior for too long. It’s time to make his endangerment of national and economic security a prominent, inescapable issue.” • This article was amended on 27 October 2016 to report that advertisements for the campaign were published in the Wall Street Journal and on Fox. The original story stated that it was understood that the campaign did not go ahead."
"The Paris Agreement on Climate Change has been a big surprise to many. All countries agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, keeping the world “well below” 2°C or even at 1.5°C of warming. By including the 1.5°C target, the Agreement has become more ambitious than many observers had expected. And the party is still not over: against the odds, countries required less than a year for the Agreement to enter into force. This seems a triumph for climate diplomacy. However, there is to date not a good understanding of how the world could swiftly enter into a period of substantial and sustained emission reductions. Therefore, the adoption of the 1.5°C target went along with an invitation to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to map out the state of the scientific knowledge on the 1.5°C goal in a report due in autumn 2018. A scoping meeting in Geneva in August of this year convened more than 60 experts and government officials to determine the outline of such an assessment.  While the IPCC had a pivotal role in generating a shared understanding of the nature and risks of climate change, it now needs to be more focused on responses to climate change. The costs, benefits and risks of political decisions need more systematic analysis and evaluation. The science so far suggests enormous challenges: the remaining net amount of CO2 that can still be released to the atmosphere in order to keep temperature rise below 1.5°C is at best 200 Gigatons of CO2. With yearly emissions at around 40 Gt CO2, this leaves no more than five years at current rates of emissions. After this point, every single ton of carbon released by households, factories or cars would need to be taken back out of the atmosphere. Furthermore, countries’ pledges to reduce emissions in the short-term - the intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs) - are insufficient. In fact, the new energy infrastructure that is already in the pipeline for the coming years – most importantly coal-fired power plants - will quickly eat up the remaining budget.  The suggested outline for the IPCC Special Report on the 1.5°C goal, which is currently under discussion at the IPCC’s plenary in Bangkok, includes a separate chapter that deals with the matter of how we can address these challenges. This would mean that finally the dissonance between ambition and action would be tackled. This dissonance is especially prevalent in three areas: First, achievement of the 1.5°C target is fundamentally dependent on our ability to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at large-scale: the available science suggests that 10 to 25 years of current emissions will need to be stored under the Earth’s crust. If possible at all, this will require a range of CO2 removal technologies. Despite agreeing on highly ambitious climate targets, policymakers and negotiators show limited awareness of this technological dependence: none of the INDCs mentions negative emissions or carbon removal and very few have plans for advancing carbon capture and storage (CCS). So far, science has not come forward with systematic explorations of the role of carbon dioxide removal technology portfolios in climate change mitigation. How much carbon dioxide removal we need depending on alternative policy packages is still largely unexplored. For example, slower decarbonization in key sectors like transport, industry and agriculture will likely lead to a larger dependence on CO2 removal. Second, negative emissions technologies such as carbon capture and storage and other large-scale climate change mitigation strategies have been subject to intense criticism, mostly due to the pressure on land that is needed for food and shelter for a growing world population.  Above all, however, the IPCC will need to make progress in evaluating climate and energy policies. The entire focus of the climate debate is now shifting towards the question of how the required emission reductions can be achieved quickly enough. A precondition for supporting short-term action with robust science is to learn fast what policies work well and what policies do not. Unless the IPCC manages to put a new emphasis on solving the climate change challenge right at the core of its assessments, it risks becoming increasingly irrelevant. Given the immense, almost inconceivable challenges imposed by the 1.5°C, the Special Report is the ideal starting point for this shift. The risk is that the report will be business-as-usual, shedding little light on policy performance: the short-term features of mitigation and development pathways are present in the suggested outline, but are not prominent. It is therefore critical for the approval of the report outline to keep in mind that the Special Report does not only cover what would be needed in the second half of the century, but also takes into account the short term, including the amount of carbon-intensive infrastructure currently planned or under construction.  For the IPCC - a hybrid organization that brings together scientists and policymakers in a well-formalized dialogue - conducting insightful policy assessments will bring new challenges. Rather than deepening conflict between scientists and policymakers, finding ways to synthesise knowledge without blaming and shaming countries needs to be the focus now. The IPCC Special Report on 1.5°C is an opportunity for the scientific community to deliver the insight needed by negotiators. An adoption of the suggested outline in Bangkok will already send the right signals to scientists and negotiators at when they meet next month in Marrakech. The time has come to bridge the gap between ambitions and action."
"The Ontario government has proposed a two-year moratorium on the creation or expansion of bottled water operations fed by groundwater in the Canadian province, in a bid to strike a balance between a burgeoning bottled water industry, a growing population and the effects of climate change. The province vowed to take action earlier this year after a severe drought prompted questions over regulations that allowed bottled water to draw millions of litres a day of water from the province.  “Water bottling is a different kind of industry and we need to treat it differently,” Kathleen Wynne, Ontario’s premier, said as she promised to update the government’s policies. “Thirty years ago, we wouldn’t have envisioned an industry that took water and put it in plastic bottles so that people could carry it around.”  On Monday, officials said the proposed moratorium would offer them time to gain a better grasp on the current state of groundwater supplies in Ontario and ensure the province has the resources needed to meet the dual challenges of climate change and increasing population.  “With a changing climate, and specifically with the impacts from drought and increasing population growth, we want to work with the people of Ontario to make sure we are properly protecting this vital resource,” said Glen Murray, Ontario’s minister of the environment and climate change.  The regulations also seek stricter controls on existing bottled water operations, including shortening the duration of permits that are handed out, from 10 years to five years, and imposing mandatory reductions during times of drought.  The suggested changes, which are open to public comment for the next 45 days, will be paired with an evaluation of the prices currently being charged to bottled water companies. Right now the province charges C$3.71 for every million litres of water, along with a permit fee of up to C$3,000 depending on the risk of environmental impact.  The growing tension between bottled water companies and local communities seeking to shore up their water supply was laid bare last month after authorities in a small, fast-growing southern Ontario township said Nestlé, the food and drinks multinational, had purchased a spring water well the township had been eyeing.  Monday’s proposed changes mean Nestlé will have to wait until 2019 to test the quality and quantity of the water in its newly acquired spring water well. On its website, the company noted that the well was purchased to supplement other operations in the region, as well as support future business growth. Nestlé Canada currently has permits that allow it to extract up to 4.7m litres of water a day from sources in Ontario.  On Monday, Nestlé said it welcomed the proposed regulations. “We as a company – and our hundreds of employees in south-western Ontario – are pleased with the direction the government is taking,” the company said in a statement. “We will continue to work with local and provincial governments, environmental agencies and community groups, our employees, as well as local residents on a thorough approach to water resource management to ensure the community’s needs come first.” The government’s proposal was also welcomed by Environmental Defence, one of the many groups that has been calling for stricter regulation of the bottled water industry. “Climate change and population growth mean that Ontario’s water is going to be under increasing stress in the years ahead,” said Keith Brooks of the group. “The government is right to single out water bottlers and to take action to protect water.”  The group was hopeful that the changes would help ensure the community, agricultural and ecosystem needs were prioritised over those of water bottlers and suggested the government could also introduce measures to address the up to one billion plastic bottles that end up in Ontario landfills, streets and rivers each year. The group also highlighted the government’s willingness to evaluate its pricing for the bottled water industry. “We look forward to the discussion on the low fees charged to water bottlers,” said Brooks. “The C$3.71 per million litres currently paid by water bottling companies is laughable.”"
"I’ve been a supporter of Leonard, a Native American who has been wrongly imprisoned for 35 years, for a long time. He writes me letters that I eventually reply to. “Dear Leonard, so sorry for not writing to you earlier. I have been rushed off my feet doing yoga, going to dinner in Paris and working on my 20-page manifesto called Get a Life. I think it could really revolutionise the way people interact with their sleeping patterns.” I love art, me. I try to go to as many exhibitions as possible because the art-lover is a freedom-fighter. Caravaggio was a painter whom I admire. Here’s a blurry photo of one of his pictures that all mean a lot to me.  Yoga. I am rewriting my manifesto as I have inexplicably left out a section on Gaia. At yoga, I suddenly had the stunning revelation that Alice in Wonderland, a book written by Lewis Carroll, actually proves Einstein’s theory of relativity. Andreas thinks I might be on to something and says: “Wow, everything is connected.” Yoga. After calling my friend Shami Chakrabati to talk about how climate change is destroying the world, I fly to Rome to have a tofu salad with Pamela Anderson. I tell her the financial crisis is the exact mirror of the ecological disaster. She agrees. Pamela is one of the smartest people I know. The next day, I start working on my Gold Label collection. I decide on two ribbons and a hat. Hats add gravitas. Fashion can be so demanding sometimes. In a normal day, I start work at 10 in the morning and end at 10.36. Yoga. Andreas suggests we go to visit Velasquez. Unfortunately when we get to Madrid, we find he is dead. It would have been helpful if someone had pointed this out. I wrote a letter to James Lovelock telling him I have a plan to save the world. What we need to do is to end capitalism. I then fly to New York to meet Jerry Hall who wants to buy one of my frocks. I’m not sure whether she can afford it. Yoga. Feel low on inspiration so I fly to Lucca. At last, I feel I have grasped the identity of my next collection. It is a gold button. Andreas buys me a book by a writer called Charles Dickens, who was an English novelist of the 19thcentury. It was very interesting. In the evening, we fly to Morocco for a private party hosted by Naomi Campbell and Sarah Ferguson. Spending time with your friends is the best way of realigning your chi. Yoga. My vinyasa flow is interrupted by Lady Gaga inviting me to LA to discuss my Cool Earth project. Later that evening, I have dinner with the Dalai Lama who asks me about my meeting with Ban Ki-moon. I tell him we have to act now if we are to stop capitalism and create a green economy. He nods in agreement and I fly back to London for a yoga lesson. Yoga. I remember I haven’t contacted Leonard for a while. Ah well. Busy, busy. I go to the Manet exhibition and am disappointed there are no works of his for sale. Monday night was a full moon. Now I know why I was feeling sluggish. Fly to Seattle to speak at a climate change convention. Unless we act now the planet is going to literally die. I decided to donate some money to the Green party, but now they are thinking of giving it back, having discovered I have a Luxembourg company that minimises my tax liabilities. We really do need to end capitalism now. Yoga. Then lunch with Tomahawk, Chrissie Hynde and Skylark in Toronto. In the evening off to see Hamlet, a play by an English writer called William Shakespeare. Have nearly finished my latest collection so am exhausted. We go to a Watteau exhibition. Andreas says he thinks Watteau probably invented the truth. This insight could kickstart the climate revolution. I call Björk and we agree to meet in Venice. When we both get there, neither of us can remember why we agreed to meet. So I fly home only to find Juergen Teller waiting to take my photograph. I tell him to leave. Everyone needs a little me time now and again. Digested read, digested: Viv needs to get out less."

"A global deal to limit the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in the battle to combat climate change is a “monumental step forward”, John Kerry, the US secretary of state, has said. The agreement, announced on Saturday morning after all-night negotiations in Kigali, Rwanda, caps and reduces the use of HFCs – a key contributor to greenhouse gases – in a gradual process beginning in 2019, with action by developed countries including the US, the world’s second worst polluter. More than 100 developing countries, including China, the world’s top carbon dioxide emitter, will start taking action in 2024, sparking concern from some groups that the action would be implemented too slowly to make a difference. A small group of countries, including India, Pakistan and some Gulf states, also pushed for and secured a later start in 2028, saying their economies need more time to grow. That is three years earlier than India, the world’s third worst polluter, had first proposed. Worldwide use of HFCs has soared in the past decade as rapidly growing countries like China and India have widely adopted air conditioning in homes, offices and cars. But HFC gases are thousands of times more destructive to the climate than carbon dioxide, and scientists say their growing use threatens to undermine the Paris accord by 195 countries, an agreement last year to reduce climate emissions. President Barack Obama praised the deal on Saturday morning, calling the agreement “an ambitious and far reaching solution” to a “rapidly growing threat to the health of our planet”.  “In addition to today’s amendment, countries last week crossed the threshold for the Paris Agreement to enter into force and reached a deal to constrain international aviation emissions,” he said in a statement. “Together, these steps show that, while diplomacy is never easy, we can work together to leave our children a planet that is safer, more prosperous, more secure, and more free than the one that was left for us.” Kerry said on Saturday: “It’s a monumental step forward that addresses the needs of individual nations but it will give us the opportunity to reduce the warming of the planet by an entire half a degree centigrade. Agreeing a deal to phase down the use of HFCs is the single most important step we can take to limit the warming of the planet. We all know that the window of time that we have to prevent the worst climate impacts from happening is in fact narrowing, and it is closing fast.” Environmental groups had hoped the deal could reduce global warming by a half a degree celsius by the end of this century. This agreement gets about 90% of the way there, said Durwood Zaelke, president of the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development. Zaelke’s group said this would mean the “largest temperature reduction ever achieved by a single agreement”.  The new agreement is “equal to stopping the entire world’s fossil-fuel CO2 emissions for more than two years,” said David Doniger, climate and clean air programme director with the Natural Resources Defense Council. Experts said they hoped market forces would help speed up the limits agreed to in the deal. “Compromises had to be made, but 85% of developing countries have committed to the early schedule starting 2024, which is a very significant achievement,” Clare Perry of the Environmental Investigation Agency said. HFCs were introduced in the 1980s as a substitute for ozone-depleting gases but are now considered a uniquely dangerous threat to the climate. According to the Berkeley National Laboratory, about 1.6bn new air-conditioning units are expected to be switched on by 2050, with the potential of raising global temperatures significantly. Air conditioning is largest cause of HFC growth, but the gases are also used in fire suppressants, insulating foams, inhalers and data centre cooling systems. Major economies have debated how fast to phase out HFCs. The US and other western countries want quick action. Nations such as India want to give their industries more time to adjust. Small island states and many African countries had pushed for quick action, saying they face the biggest threat from climate change. “It may not be entirely what the islands wanted, but it is a good deal,” the minister-in-assistance to the president of the Marshall Islands, Mattlan Zackhras, said. “We all know we must go further, and we will go further.” HFCs are less plentiful than CO2, but Kerry said last month that they currently emit as much pollution as 300 coal-fired power plants each year.  HFCs do not harm the ozone layer like chlorofluorocarbons and similar gases that were eliminated under the 1987 Montreal Protocol. The entire world ratified that agreement, helping to repair holes in the ozone that help shield the planet from the harmful rays of the sun. The aim of this meeting was to attach an amendment to that treaty dealing specifically with HFCs."
"You might have noticed that all of a sudden, Australians are supposed to be appalled by foreign interests getting in the way of us digging up as much coal as we want, thanks very much. Last weekend the Australian newspaper started running stories based on a “revelation” from the inbox of John Podesta, the chairman of Democratic nominee for president Hillary Clinton’s election campaign.  One email forwarded to Podesta showed the philanthropic group the Sandler Foundation, based in San Francisco, was a funder of Australian group the Sunrise Project. The emails were published by WikiLeaks. Sunrise, run by the former Greenpeace campaigner John Hepburn, has been involved in supporting some of the court cases brought against proposed coal projects – chiefly, the massive Adani coalmine in Queensland.  According to an editorial in the Australian, “thinking Australians” should be “appalled” by this news. On the back of these stories, there have been shouts for more transparency, while Turnbull government ministers have used the coverage as a pivot to call for environment groups to be stripped of their charitable status. The climate change impacts of burning coal, meanwhile, have been summarily discounted or ignored. So let us count the ways that Australians should not be “appalled” and, on the way, examine some of the bald hypocrisy that has been on display this week. We should start with the way that while the “foreign influence” of a US philanthropic organisation concerned about the impacts of climate change counts as “appalling”, apparently the “foreign influence” exerted by the Indian-owned mining company Adani doesn’t.  This, despite the way Adani has cajoled, wined, dined and lobbied the Queensland government. Both the Minerals Council of Australia and its regional counterpart the Queensland Resources Council have also been “appalled” at the foreign influence, despite both groups having a board with directors from foreign-owned mining companies and taking annual membership fees from foreign-owned companies. The Queensland Liberal National party MP George Christensen said he found it “concerning” that Sunrise was getting funding from a foreign source. “What are their motives? I just think something stinks about this,” he told the Daily Mercury in Mackay. So Christensen is concerned about foreign funding to support environment groups fighting fossil fuel expansion but is more than happy to have the US-based Heartland Institute pay for his flights and hotel so that he can hang around with climate science deniers in Las Vegas? Brendan Pearson, the chief executive of the MCA, wrote in the Australian that: “This episode should prompt a rethink of the oversight of environmental groups that operate as charities and that have tax-deductible recipient status.”  Why only “environment groups”? Why not take a look at the tax-deductible recipient status of all charities, such as the Institute of Public Affairs? I’m picking on that particular Melbourne-based “thinktank”, because it has been producing reports of questionable quality about the “life-saving potential of coal” and, this week, released research claiming legal challenges brought under the Federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Act had cost “up to $1.2bn” since 2000.  If we want to pick reports from thinktanks to bolster arguments, then we could point to the Australia Institute’s Great Barrier Bleached report suggesting that about $1bn in tourism income could be lost every year in Queensland if severe bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef continues in the years ahead – bleaching clearly linked to the burning of fossil fuels including coal.  None of the Adani cheerleaders seem bothered about where the IPA’s funding comes from, or how it uses its charitable status.  Like the Australia Institute and most other thinktanks, the IPA does not reveal its funders (because it doesn’t have to) but one supporter is reportedly Gina Rinehart, who holds a stake in another proposed Galilee basin coal project.  Foreign interests? Bad. Potential vested interest? Nah. Meanwhile, the IPA is using its tax-deductibility status to raise cash for a third edition of its climate science denial book Climate Change: The Facts, with contributions from US-based and UK-based contrarian scientists, alongside the likes of Clive James and Bjørn Lomborg. Tax breaks for climate science denial? Sure. Tax breaks for fighting the causes of climate change? No way. One of the fundamental things about climate change and an aspect that makes it such a diabolical bugger is that it does not discriminate.  Once you’ve burned the gas, oil or coal, the waste carbon dioxide mixes in the atmosphere and hangs around for a century or more, impacting people around the globe in all sorts of generally unsavoury ways.  In short, it’s a global problem. That means that “foreign interests” have a legitimate concern if Australian governments want to support the rapid expansion of fossil fuel exports, as they clearly do. The very existence of United Nations conventions on climate change, to which Australia is a signatory, is the most obvious example of this global interest. Either the coal boosters really do want to turn Australia into some sort of North Korea that cuts itself off from the rest of the world, or we find ourselves agreeing with the words of George Christensen. Something really does stink, and it’s appalling. "
"The stomachs of cattle, fermentation in rice fields, fracking for natural gas, coal mines, festering bogs, burning forests — they all produce methane, the second most important greenhouse gas, after carbon dioxide. But how much? And how can we best cut these emissions? And is fracking frying the planet, or are bovine emissions more to blame?  Until now, the world has not had a definitive answer to these questions. But in recent months, researchers believe they have finally begun to crack the problem — and the results are surprising.   The amount of methane in the atmosphere has more than doubled in the past 250 years. It has been responsible for about a fifth of global warming. But it has a confusing recent history. The steady rise of emissions stopped in the 1990s. Emissions were stable for almost a decade until 2007, but then abruptly resumed their rise.  What has been going on? Fracking of natural gas in the U.S. and elsewhere has frequently been blamed for the resumed rise in emissions. But new studies are raising serious questions about that.  Researchers are now saying say that, globally at least, the increase in recent years is due to the activities of microbes in wetlands, rice paddies, and the guts of ruminants. “Despite the large increase in natural gas production, there has not been an upward trend in industrial emissions,” says Stefan Schwietzke, of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Boulder, Colo., who is the lead author of one of the new studies.  “Since 2007, atmospheric methane has been rising rapidly,” notes Euan Nisbet of Royal Holloway, University of London. But he says his research shows that the increase is dominated by microbial emissions, particularly from the tropics. Yet that hardly exonerates gas fracking. It turns out that, all along, natural gas and other fossil fuels have been a bigger source of methane emissions than the industry has declared in submissions to governments and the UN. The companies may not have been deliberately lying; but the new studies prove that they were certainly and comprehensively wrong.  The new data come from combining two approaches to unraveling the methane riddle. First is a new database of isotopic analyses of methane in the air. This analysis can distinguish between methane coming from the three main categories of sources: the output of microbes living in anoxic environments such as wetlands, landfills, and the stomachs and butts of ruminants; fossil methane in gas, coal, and other underground fuel reserves that is released as those reserves are exploited; and the burning of vegetation like forests, bush, and crop residues.  Methane molecules from each of these sources have a characteristic ratio of two carbon isotopes, carbon-12 and carbon-13. Microbes fractionate the isotopes, increasing the proportion of carbon-12 compared to fossil methane. Yet methane from burning trees or crop residues has a higher proportion of carbon-13, because photosynthesis favors that isotope.  Second, satellite observations of methane concentrations in the air are allowing researchers to accurately identify the regions of the world from which increases in emissions are occurring. As the two approaches are combined, a previously fuzzy image of methane sources is becoming dramatically clearer.  The most detailed isotopic analysis was published earlier this month by NOAA’s Schwietzke in the journal Nature. He developed a global database of isotopic measurements taken all over the world in the past three decades and analyzed the trends. Two surprising discoveries emerge from Schwietzke’s study. First, the recent methane surge into the atmosphere is due not to the rising fossil-fuel emissions, but rather to an unexpected surge in microbial sources. Second, fossil-fuel sources are — and have been for at least some decades — almost twice as big as previous estimates, whereas microbial sources are about a quarter less.  Microbial methane still accounts for the majority of emissions, totalling almost 400 million tons a year, but fossil-fuel emissions are much more significant than previously thought, at about 200 million tons. Methane lasts in the atmosphere only for about 12 years, much less than CO2; but while there, it packs a punch. Measured over a century, a molecule of methane warms the planet roughly 30 times more than CO2. The findings from the latest methane studies have caught scientists by surprise. But they are backed up by other recent research.  In a separate paper published less than two weeks before Schwietzke’s, Nisbet combined a smaller set of isotopic data with a detailed analysis of the geographical sources of recent methane emissions. And he reached a similar conclusion. “Our results go against conventional thinking, but the analysis clearly points to increased emissions from microbial sources,” he said.  Do these trends matter?  For more than two centuries, rising methane emissions have resulted in steady increases in the concentration of the gas in the atmosphere. In fact, while CO2 concentrations have so far risen by only about 40 percent since pre-industrial times, methane levels have more than doubled, rising from 700 parts per billion to almost 1,800 ppb.  But the rise slowed in the 1990s, then showed a brief surge in 1997 when the large El Niño that year triggered a surge in emissions from burning forests, and then came to a complete halt from 1999 to 2006. Before scientists had figured out why the rise ended, it resumed. Now, finally, they are catching up with events.  A study published earlier this year by Hinrich Schaefer, of New Zealand’s National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, using isotopic data concluded that the cause of the decade-long hiatus in rising methane emissions was the fallout from the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991.  Soviet gas production had long been suspected of being extremely leaky, because of both poor production technology and heavy leaks from its long pipelines carrying huge quantities of natural gas from Siberian fields to Europe. The collapse of the Soviet Union both reduced production and brought in Western technology that helped cut the leaks. Now it is becoming clear that the resumption in the rise in emissions after 2007 is a result of a surge in activity by methane-producing microbes. And geographical data from Nisbet and others show that the main zones of new emissions are the tropics. So what has happened to get the microbes there so excited?  Some researchers are blaming farmers. Schaefer argues that most of the post-2006 increase in methane emissions emanated from China, India, and Southeast Asia. In these growing and densely populated countries, which have only small areas of natural ecosystems, it seems that increased production from flooded rice fields and a growing number of livestock have been the likely culprits. But Nisbet thinks the weather, acting to enhance microbial activity in both natural wetlands and flooded rice paddies, is more likely to blame. He says since 2007, rising temperatures and changes in rainfall have created ideal conditions for microbial methane production. For example, many wetlands have been enlarged by heavy rains. He says the tropics have seen a long run of wet years, topped off with an exceptionally warm 2014, which coincided with the biggest surge in methane emissions so far. It may not all be occurring in the tropics, he concedes. There was a local spike in Arctic emissions in 2007 during exceptionally warm conditions that summer, during which methane may have been released from melting permafrost. But his analysis suggests that spike was not repeated in subsequent years.  In any case, whether the source is the Arctic or the tropics, Nisbet warns that there is a real danger that climate change is starting to accelerate the processes that release methane into the atmosphere, potentially triggering a troubling positive feedback in which further warming could produce more methane and yet more warming. He calls the warmer and wetter conditions of the past decade, and their apparent impact on methane production across the tropics, “a troubling harbinger of more severe climate change.”  Where do we go from here? Now that the world has a strategy — agreed to in Paris last December — for combating CO2 emissions, it badly needs a similar plan for climate enemy No. 2: methane. The Paris agreement to keep warming “well below two degrees C” will be unachievable without it.  So if microbial emissions are behind the recent rise, what can be done to reduce them? Agriculture may be able to help. Research suggests that a reduction in the amount of time that paddies are flooded can reduce methane emissions without sacrificing productivity, and animal breeders are working on producing cattle with guts that produce less methane.  But the fossil fuel industry is likely to face even more pressure to act. The industry will of course point out that the new evidence shows that natural gas producers in particular have been reducing their emissions while increasing production. Schwietzke reckons that natural gas production was probably responsible for about 8 percent of total methane emissions in 1985, but that this figure, including fracking, could now be as little as 2 percent. The discovery that the industry has been systematically underestimating its contribution to climate change for decades — and that national methane inventories submitted to UN climate negotiators are plain wrong — is bound to increase pressure for action. And with good reason. The extent of how much could still be achieved was underlined two years ago by David Allen at the University of Texas at Austin, who gained unusual access to U.S. fracking wells to assess where their leaks were coming from. He found that “a small subset of natural gas wells are responsible for the majority of methane emissions.” A fifth of wells accounted for more than three-quarters of the venting of methane to the atmosphere.  “Much more can be done to reduce fossil fuel emissions,” says Nisbet. “This is one of the quickest and most cost-effective ways of cutting greenhouse gas warming.” "
"The Montreal protocol is the most successful environmental treaty in history, and arguably one of the most successful of any international pact. It phased out the gases that were destroying the ozone layer, averting potential catastrophe and healing the hole that human activities had opened in our protective layer. Unfortunately, it had a side-effect overlooked when it was signed in the 1980s: some of the chemicals substituted for the ozone-destroyers had an effect on the climate thousands of times higher than carbon dioxide. This month, world governments agreed to address that by eliminating the substitute chemicals – called HFCs – potentially reducing rising temperatures by as much as 0.5C in a relatively short time. Scientists put the safe limit on future rises at 2C above pre-industrial levels by the middle of this century: beyond that, catastrophic and irreversible climate changes are judged likely. So the reduction agreed under the Montreal protocol could have an enormous, and swift, impact. This is just the beginning of the good news. The International Civil Aviation Organisation agreed this month to measures to combat the impact of flying. Planes are not only a rising source of greenhouse gases, but also contribute through the vapour they produce, which – coming at such high altitudes – has a greater warming effect. This week, international shipping will debate similar rules to cut its impacts. This is a trillion-dollar business, and ships use particularly dirty fuel. Governments should take the simple measures needed. Altering the fuel to be less polluting, preventing outflow during shipping and harbourage, and improving monitoring to reduce emissions need not be costly and will be invaluable in the fight against marine and air pollution as well as climate change.  These progressive moves, though belated and insufficient, must be welcomed. They represent an unprecedented run of helpful measures set out internationally since the Paris accord on climate change was signed last December. In further good news, the Paris accord itself has now been ratified, making it harder for future governments in any nation, and of any stripe, to unpick it. Supporters said Paris would unleash a slew of contributory measures that would help reverse the rising trend in greenhouse gases. Based on these conclusions, it looks as if they were right. Now the bad news. Last Tuesday, Nasa confirmed that September was the hottest on record, albeit by a small margin, making 11 out of the last 12 months record-breakers. This year is expected to set a new record – as last year did, and 2014 before it. These results give the lie to climate sceptics’ claim that global warming has “paused”. The biggest obstacle to action on climate remains, as it has been for more than 20 years, the US political system. The US has led the world on other environmental reforms, but the Senate is, incredibly, threatening to block the improvements to the Montreal protocol, apparently from partisan spite, industry lobbying and climate denialism rather than any rational basis. And if Donald Trump were to win the White House, though polls now indicate that is unlikely, all bets on action on global warming would be off. He has declared himself a climate change denier and vowed to renege on the Paris agreement. Scientists say we have a rapidly closing window to reorient the world’s economies to a low-carbon future, just a few years before we are locked into dangerous levels of warming. In 1987, the Montreal protocol was agreed despite clamour from industry that phasing out these destructive gases would be technically impossible or economically catastrophic. Those voices were wrong: the change happened ahead of schedule, with no discernible economic effect. Multiple studies, not least the landmark 2006 Stern review, have shown that reducing greenhouse gases will have an economically beneficial effect. Industries such as coal can be compensated while others flourish, creating jobs and economic opportunity. To achieve what is needed before the window closes, we must recapture the sense of urgency that motivated the Montreal protocol. Then, a clear and imminent danger – based on only two decades of scientific research, compared with more than 100 years of global warming – led nations, even during the cold war, to come together to protect our planet. Climate change may be slow-burning compared with the ozone layer’s destruction, but it is no less threatening. Montreal should provide the template by which we tackle it."
"A dozen international poverty and development organizations published a report last week on the impact of building new coal power plants in countries where a large percentage of the population lacks access to electricity. The report’s conclusions are strikingly counter-intuitive: on the whole, building coal power plants does little to help the poor, and often it can actually make them poorer. Delivering electricity to those in energy poverty is certainly important. For example, household air pollution killed 4.3 million people globally in 2012; many of those lives could be saved and health improved with the use of electric stoves to replace burning wood or charcoal. However, the question remains whether coal is the best way to deliver that electricity.  The report notes that approximately 15% of people in energy poverty live close to existing electric grids, but there are a variety of barriers blocking their connection. For example, the poor consume relatively little electricity, so the costs of connecting them may exceed the resulting profits. The power lines used to connect them also result in high energy losses and power system instability. The poor also have little political influence in many developing countries. As the report concludes: This means that for energy-poor families living close to the grid, building new power generation capacity – coalfired or otherwise – will not help them get connected. Instead, access will require financing the upfront costs of new connections, and rationalising tariffs to reflect the true costs of supplying power. Approximately 84% of energy-poor households live in rural areas further away from the grid. For this group, decentralized stand-alone and mini-grid solutions are much quicker than waiting to build a new centralized power plant and distribution lines. A single power plant can take a decade between planning and ultimate completion, while distributed wind turbines or solar panels can be deployed much more rapidly, as Elon Musk explained in ‘Before the Flood’: In fact, most planned coal development isn’t aimed at delivering electricity to the poor. It’s mostly targeted toward industrialized areas in China, which already have high levels of access to electricity. In India, many areas with the densest concentration of coal plants also have the lowest rates of electricity access.  New coal plants aren’t built for the poor because it’s not profitable. There’s a common misconception that China’s coal power expansion lifted much of its population out of poverty. For example, according to Bjorn Lomborg: Over the last 30 years, China moved an estimated 680 million people out of poverty by giving them access to modern energy, mostly powered by coal. However, as this new report notes, about two-thirds of China’s reduction in extreme poverty occurred in the 1980s, before its dramatic expansion of coal power starting in the 1990s. More importantly, China enacted agricultural reform, which helped the profitability of small farms. China’s hard push towards industrialization did rely on coal power, but it only happened after the agricultural reforms had lifted most of its population out of extreme poverty. China’s air pollution problems are an example of the consequences of relying too heavily on burning coal for generating electricity. The report notes that sickness and death caused by air pollution currently costs China an estimated 9.7% to 13.2% of its GDP annually. It currently causes some 670,000 premature deaths a year in China and 100,000 in India. Coal also requires substantial amounts of freshwater for operation: The coal industry withdraws, consumes and pollutes substantial quantities of freshwater, often competing for limited water resources with other sectors, such as smallholder agriculture, that are crucial for poverty reduction. Roughly 44% of existing and planned coal plants are located in areas with high to extremely high water stress.  A quarter are located in ‘red-listed’ areas, where surface and groundwater resources are at risk of drying up because water is being withdrawn faster than it can be replenished … Coal plants’ direct competition with poor farmers for scarce water resources has already led to political tensions and social unrest. And of course the more coal we burn, the more global warming will result. Poorer countries tend to be the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. As the report notes: By 2050, climate change impacts could draw an estimated 720 million people into extreme poverty (Granoff et al., 2015). This is about the same number lifted out of extreme poverty in the last two decades and would thus cancel out much of the progress made in poverty eradication to date … Coal expansion as currently planned is enough to push climate change to catastrophic levels. A changing climate already disproportionately hits the poorest people with least resources to enable them to adapt. Not only are wind and solar better for the poor in terms of ease of deployment, clean air, and slowing climate change, they’ve also become cost-competitive.  South Africa, for example, is the cheapest place in Africa to generate coal-fired power, yet electricity from its new 4.7 gigawatt Medupi advanced coal plant will cost ... 17% more than the electricity generated from South Africa’s 2 gigawatt of new onshore wind power.  In India, the minister responsible for power development recently stated: ‘I think a new coal plant would give you costlier power than a solar plant’ (Climate Home, 2016). The statement is supported by the extremely low bid prices for recent solar procurements in India (Kenning, 2015).  Renewable energy investment in the emerging world now outpaces that in developed countries (McGrath, 2016). Renewable energy also has low operating cost and zero fuel cost, while fossil fuel costs are variable and susceptible to price spikes. And renewable energy creates more (and safer) jobs than coal. Coal companies and their allies often argue that we need to burn their products to lift the poor out of poverty. For example, Matt Ridley has claimed: those who advocate no support for coal are effectively saying that the adoption of renewable energy is more important than alleviating African poverty In reality, there are better, faster, cleaner alternatives to help deliver electricity to the energy-poor. Those who argue to the contrary often do so to advance their own agendas. "
"The Queensland government is now slamming its foot down on the accelerator to help a private company build the biggest coalmine Australia has ever seen. “We can see the end of the tunnel and now we are accelerating towards it,” the state’s mining minister, Anthony Lynham, said.  The massive Adani Carmichael coal project in the state’s Galilee basin has been given “critical” status by the government, in the hope that removing a few bureaucratic hurdles might speed things up a little bit.  What’s at the end of Lynham’s tunnel one can only imagine, but given the climate-changing gases that will come from burning all that coal, we can make a couple of guesses.  Are we being driven headlong, for example, into a concrete wall several metres thick?  Is there a precipitous cliff edge at the end of this dark tunnel, at the bottom of which is a hellish mix of dead coral, flooded cities and discarded soft porn tapes starring Donald Trump?  Lynham’s choice of analogy (or cliché – I’m not sure) works on so many levels to illustrate the attitude of state and federal governments to supporting the further exploitation of coal. Where would this tunnel lead us, if the rest of the world took the same high speed attitude to liberating fossil fuels as the Queensland government? The government’s announcement came just days after it was confirmed that the Paris climate agreement to keep global warming “well below 2C” would now enter into force.  By the time representatives from more than 190 countries gather in Marrakech next month for the next major United Nations climate talks, the Paris deal will be active. Approving massive coalmines is not part of the plan.  First, let’s just consider the scale of the Adani project.  In court cases brought to challenge the mine, both Adani and environmental groups have agreed on a set of numbers. The mining, transportation and burning of the coal will emit the equivalent of 4.7 gigatonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere over the life of the mine. That’s 4,729,988,241 tonnes, to be exact. Once those gases are in the atmosphere, they remain there for a century or more, helping to increase temperatures, raise sea levels and acidify the oceans. Adani has successfully argued in court that its mine doesn’t contribute directly to global emissions because the power plants in India would just get their fossil fuel from somewhere else. In the latest federal court finding, a judge also accepted an argument that international agreements like the one made in Paris would mitigate any greenhouse gas emissions from the mine. The judge wrote:  I found that direct and consequential greenhouse gas emissions associated with the [Carmichael mine] will be managed and mitigated through national and international emissions control frameworks operating in Australia and within countries that are the import market for coal from the project. So, the existence of an international agreement designed to get countries around the world to use less fossil fuels is somehow being used as an excuse for them to use more?  That case, brought by the Australian Conservation Foundation, is being appealed. Adani has been granted its mining leases and environment approvals on the assumption that the mine will be operating for about 60 years.  Given that we can expect a whole unsavoury suite of climate change impacts in the coming decades, you have to wonder how a coalmine might be viewed in the year 2050, especially one with a license to keep digging for another 20 years. The Queensland government needs to be pulling on the handbrake and reversing out of this long dark tunnel, for everyone’s sake."
"Priti Patel, the international development secretary, demands better “value for money” and greater accountability and transparency in UK aid spending (Report, 26 October). It’s time to start applying these principles to the full extent of the UK’s role in global poverty. Whether through enabling tax-dodging, the actions of our corporations, or our contributions to climate change, the UK causes far more poverty in the world than its aid budget can ever compensate for. In 2013, over $1tn in illicit financial flows was stolen from poor countries; 55% of illicit flows are estimated to end up in rich countries, 45% in tax havens. With 10 tax havens under our jurisdiction, the UK is at the heart of this theft.  Giving money to alleviate poverty, while at the same time enabling it, is not transparent, not accountable, and does not provide value for money. Aid is, at best, meagre compensation towards the damage caused. Transparency and accountability in aid spending is reasonable; it’s time we start applying these principles to the full extent of our relationship with the world.Martin DrewryDirector, Health Poverty Action  • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com"

"The jubilation and relief that flowed from United Nations climate talks in Rwanda over the weekend may be short-lived in the U.S., where legal experts say the agreement risks being blocked by Republican senators. Weary U.N. diplomats finalized a deal Saturday to phase out the use of most HFCs, which are chemicals used in refrigerators and air conditioners and by other industries. The agreement was designed to accelerate a shift to safer substitutes for some of the world’s fastest growing and worst greenhouse gases.  “We’re seeing an unparalleled momentum to tackle climate change,” said Harjeet Singh, a Delhi-based climate change expert with the nonprofit ActionAid. “The willingness to act has resulted in an enthusiastic plucking of low hanging fruits. But in order to keep people and the planet safe, we need to reach much further.” The agreement was struck weeks before a more all-encompassing global climate deal, the Paris agreement takes legal force, following its hurried ratification in recent months by President Obama and other world leaders. Global temperatures have risen about 1C since the 1800s, with heat-trapping air pollution making heat waves, floods and destructive storms more likely and more severe. The Paris agreement calls on countries to voluntarily reduce their overall climate impacts, focusing heavily on electricity, clean transportation and land clearing. The voluntary nature of the agreement was accepted by other countries in part to help Obama avoid the need for lawmaker approval prior to U.S. ratification of the pact. But American experts on international environmental law say ratifying the new HFC agreement would almost certainly require a two-thirds vote from the Senate. If enough countries formally agree to join, the new agreement could take effect in 2019. “This is different from Paris, in that it requires ratification — and that’s concerning to me,” said Michael Wara, and expert on energy and environmental law at Stanford. “This is going to require getting Republicans to vote for it.” Although past generations of Republican leaders, including presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George Bush Sr., championed environmental laws, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and most Republican senators today oppose efforts to slow global warming. Republicans currently control both chambers of Congress and they have been steadfast in their opposition to nearly all legislation involving climate change. If Trump wins next month’s election, his campaign statements on environmental issues strongly suggest he would not pursue American ratification of the HFC agreement. But even if Hillary Clinton wins, Republicans may yet be able to block America from entering into the agreement. “I worry about her ability to have enough cocktails with enough Republican senators to get this over the hump,” Wara said. “That’s a heavy lift.” The U.S. State Department, which helped negotiate the HFC deal, is saying publicly that it hasn’t figured out whether the new agreement will require Senate ratification. If America failed to ratify the agreement, it’s hard to predict how the global use of HFCs would be affected, though it may cause the leaders of other countries to balk at the idea of joining the pact, slowing momentum on climate action. “We will need to examine the content and the form of the agreed amendment, as well as relevant practice, in order to determine the appropriate approval process,” State Department spokeswoman Emily White said in an email on Monday. The agreement reached in the Rwandan city of Kigali on Saturday would expand the kinds of gases covered by theMontreal Protocol. That was a 1987 agreement that helped save the ozone layer by nearly eradicating the use of chemicals called CFCs. Countries and companies often complied with the agreement by switching to HFCs, which are safe for the ozone layer but contribute to global warming. As demand for air conditioners and fridges has been growing, including in rapidly developing countries, HFCs have been escaping into the atmosphere. The HFC pollution has been helping to heat the planet — further increasing demand for air conditioning. By limiting the use of HFCs, the new Montreal Protocol amendments could reduce global warming by 1°F by 2100. They could also drive investments in research and development, making alternative products more affordable. “Prices are going to be dropping faster than people expect,” said Durwood Zaelke of the nonprofit Institute for Governance & Sustainable Development. The EPA is working to force American manufacturers to find climate-friendly alternatives to HFCs. The White House has been pressuring world leaders to update the Montreal Protocol to cover climate-changing gases since early in Obama’s presidency. In 2014, India dropped its opposition to using the Montreal Protocol for climate protections, formally embracing America’s proposal, allowing the HFC deal to be struck over the weekend. Under the terms of the new agreement, developing countries like India and Pakistan could take longer to phase out their uses of HFCs than developed countries. If America fails to join the new agreement, developing countries may also be dissuaded from joining, threatening to scuttle its potential success. “The amendment would, in fact, require a two-thirds vote of the Senate for the U.S. to join,” said University of Virginia professor John Setear, pointing to provisions in the Vienna Convention, a 1961 agreement dealing with treaties that underpins the Montreal Protocol. “The president is going to have to go to the Senate or face a lot of political heat,” Setear said. “This amendment has been sold as a climate change measure, not an ozone layer measure. The Senate hates climate change measures.”"
"Prince Charles urged governments, individuals and businesses to take greater care of the world’s soils as part of an initiative aimed at keeping carbon locked in soil, rather than escaping into the atmosphere and causing global warming. The “4 per 1000” project is a pledge to reduce the amount of carbon leaked from soils by 0.4% a year, which would be enough to halt the rise of carbon dioxide levels in the air. Nearly 180 countries have signed up to the initiative that was set up by the French government as part of its efforts to make the Paris agreement on climate change, signed last year, a success.  At a ceremony this week to celebrate the initiative, the prince said that the preservation of farmland, forests and soils were of “absolutely critical importance - for, in my experience, the fertility and health of the soil is at the heart of everything”. Drawing on his own work as an organic farmer, he contrasted organic methods with the “previously conventional” farming systems which he called “toxic”. The 4 per 1000 initiative does not require farmers to adopt organic methods, but does encourage more attention to farming techniques, which are currently contributing to the erosion of soils around the world. The prince said this project could “make a remarkable contribution to the wellbeing, livelihoods, food security and resilience of farmers, to the health of the planet and to addressing climate change”. He said: “It is clear that doing the right thing by our soils, our forests and our peatlands would make a remarkable contribution to the fulfilment of the Paris agreement.” But he challenged governments and businesses to espouse the goals: “At the end of the day, will we be able to take the necessary urgent steps - or will there be the usual procrastination, argument and denial that have so bedevilled any meaningful progress in addressing ever more dangerous climate change?” The French agriculture minister, Stéphane Le Foll, said the prince’s involvement was important because “at the end of the day, ministers change but the prince always remains”. Le Foll added that farming and forestry alone could be huge contributors to the reductions in greenhouse gases necessary to halt climate change, and small changes to farming methods – such as covering slurry pits, collecting or flaring methane emissions from slurry, more precise use of fertiliser, and working the soil less intensively - could save tens of millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide. Better farming methods could also improve food production, he said, showing that “food security and combating climate change are complementary”. The French government plans to hold an event at the forthcoming UN meeting on climate next month in Marakech, at which it hopes ministers will sign a formal letter of their intention to make good on the 4 per 1000 goal. Recent research found that using soil to soak up carbon from the atmosphere could take more than a century to have the effects needed. However, preserving existing soils and the carbon stored in them could have a quicker beneficial effect, as losing that carbon to the air through poor farming methods adds immediately to the stock of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere."
"Sometime in the early summer when the Sacred Stone Camp was just a handful of tents and the Dakota Access machines had not yet come to our side of the Missouri river, I got an email from a woman who said her husband was Cliven Bundy and that she wanted to bring her daughters to stand with us. I knew little of this gun-toting militia, but enough that I told her no, we are a non-violent encampment, you cannot come here.  When I began to look into the Bundy’s standoff at the Malheur Refuge, I became angry. That place is a locus of ancestral heritage of the Burns Paiute Tribe, which the Bundys knowingly desecrated. They reportedly dug latrines through recognized cultural sites. As a tribal historic preservation officer, my heart broke when I heard they allegedly rifled through some 4,000 cultural items that had been kept in the museum. Some of the sacred objects they destroyed were hundreds of years old. The Bundys did not reclaim that land. It was never theirs. It is Paiute land. From the beginning, we at Standing Rock gathered in a spirit of prayer and non-violent resistance to the destruction of our homeland and culture. We came together with our ceremonies, songs and drums. Weapons are not allowed into our camps. The Bundys’ occupation began with threats and guns. It was violent from the outset, and the people they pretended to represent did not even condone it. Last week we saw how justice works in this country: armed ranchers are treated with compassion and their charges are dropped, while indigenous people are physically attacked and charged with trespassing on our own ancestral lands.  While we stand in prayer, we have assault rifles aimed at us, we are attacked by dogs, pushed from our sacred sites with pepper spray, shot with rubber bullets and bean bag rounds and Tasers, beaten with sticks, handcuffed and thrown in dog kennels. Our horses have been shot and killed. Our elders have been dragged out of ceremonies, our sacred bundles seized, our sacred eagle staff pulled from our hands. My daughter was stripped naked in jail and left overnight for a traffic violation. An arsonist set the hills across from our camp afire, and for hours Morton County did nothing but prevent tribal authorities from responding. Our resistance has not been met with handshakes. Both the Bundys and the water protectors at Standing Rock stand for our convictions on what is claimed to be federal land. But that is where reasonable comparisons end. The land they claimed to take back was cleared of our relatives and the buffalo nation so that white ranchers like the Bundys could graze their cattle there.  The Bundys assert a property right which was only made possible through the genocide of indigenous peoples and the continued occupation of our lands by the same government they claim to fight. Their white supremacist ideology is the foundation of the settler state, and their ranching would not be possible without it. Their racist fear blinds them to the fact that they are actually supporting their enemy and fighting themselves. The Bundy militia were fighting for their right to make money, while we are fighting our children’s rights to clean drinking water. A human can only live a few days without water. How long can one live with a government grazing fee? Our camp reclaims land stolen by the US government in direct violation of the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851, which affirmed it as sovereign unceded territory of the Great Sioux Nation. Right in the path of the Dakota Access pipeline are Sundance grounds and village sites, held sacred not only by the Sioux Nations, but also the Arikara, the Mandan, and the Northern Cheyenne. The day after the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe filed papers identifying the burial places of our ancestors, Dakota Access intentionally destroyed them to avoid federal regulation. Would you stand by as bulldozers drove through the National Cemetery at Arlington?  Erasing our footprint from the world erases us as a people. These sites must be protected, or our world will end; it is that simple. If we allow an oil company to dig through and destroy our histories, our ancestors, our hearts and souls as a people, is that not genocide? As indigenous people, we know these attempts to erase us very well, and one of the ways it works is through environmental racism. Indigenous lands across the country are the sites of nuclear waste dumping, toxic mining operations, oil and gas drilling and a long list of other harmful environmental practices, but see very little benefit from these projects. We live in the sacrifice zones. And that is the story here too – the Dakota Access pipeline was rerouted from north of Bismarck, a mostly white community, out of concerns for their drinking water, but then redirected to ours. They consider our community “expendable”. The national guard and state police have been reinforced by forces from seven other states, to push corporate interests through our home, but together with our relatives, we stand up. We are still here. We have always welcomed everyone to come stand with us against the injustices of the federal government. Joining forces would be a source of great power – if we stand together to confront racism and destruction of the land. But we will do that with prayer, not guns. We are the people of this land. We have the roots growing out of our feet. We stand with compassion and prayer. They cannot break us."
"In 19 years, Ramu Gaviti’s six acres of land have gone from barren, dry and sparsely vegetated to fertile, moist and thick with biomass. Peacocks, wild pigs and rabbits have reappeared and in rejuvenated rivers, boys trap fish in baskets.  Gaviti once scratched $29 (£23) worth of millet and grass per acre per year. In bad years he left his smallholding in Jawhar, in the hills to the north-east of Mumbai, and went to mine sand at the coast for construction. “Sometimes you feel as if you can go in the river and drown,” said the farmer, who has heard of 50 men who never returned. Now he has more than 1,000 fruit, nut and forest trees, paddy rice, a tractor, a brick house, and an income the equivalent of $1,200 (£975) a year.   Gaviti’s life has been transformed by a model of agroforestry pioneered by an Indian NGO. “If the organisation had not come, we would have had no guiding person,” he says. The NGO BAIF, who specialise in supporting climate-resilient agriculture, arrived in 1997 and worked closely with local people until 2004. “It was a wasteland virtually,” says agriculturalist Sudhir Wagle, who led the effort. “We began by suggesting 40-60 mango and cashew trees per acre and a boundary of indigenous trees. Including costs such as development of common water sources, we calculate that each acre cost us $130 [£105] a year to improve and that it took us and the farmers five years. But we saw families getting $225 [£180] per acre a year after five years and $670 [£545] per acre a year after ten.”  Gaviti and his fellow farmers are more than an economic success, however. They are a climate success too. Agriculture is the world’s second largest emitter of gases such as CO2 that cause climate change. But the villagers’ trees have been drawing carbon from the atmosphere for years. This represents one of the greatest hopes for India, which has committed to capture 2.5 to 3bn tonnes of carbon through new tree and forest cover by 2030, to deliver on the Paris accord. “The vast majority of India is agricultural land,” says World Agroforestry Centre’s Dr Ravi Prabhu. “We can deliver from this landscape and help people at the same time. Agriculture finds no mention in the accord. The focus is forests. But agriculture accounts for 10-12% of emissions and 70% of biodiversity loss and fresh water use. We cannot afford to segregate or we will be left with islands of biodiversity surrounded by deserts.”  Turning agriculture into a carbon sink is not a dream. Scientists from the World Agroforestry Centre, Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, and elsewhere found that agricultural land can hold four times as much carbon as previously estimated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The US Environmental Protection Agency states that, while fossil fuel use is the primary source of CO2: “The way in which people use land is also an important source, especially when it involves deforestation.” Likewise, land can remove CO2 from the atmosphere through reforestation and improvement of soils.  Scaling up what Gaviti and the other villagers are doing could be one of India’s greatest hopes for delivering on its commitments to the Paris agreement on climate change.  India’s government recognised the value of trees on farms in 2014 with the world’s first national agroforestry policy (pdf), which aims to help increase forest or tree cover to 33% from the present 21%. A key impetus was timber; farm trees meet 65% of India’s demand. The policy could put India leagues ahead on climate change and save land from ruination: 50% of India’s land is degraded and 86% of the degraded land is agricultural, says World Resources Institute’s Dr Nitin Pandit.  Rakesh Sinha, joint secretary in the Ministry of Agriculture, is in charge of rolling out the plan. “Trees have always been part and parcel of Indian agriculture but now we are considering paying farmers for ecological services from agroforestry.” Back in Jawhar, Gaviti tends his trees, among the many fruits of which have also been a change in social status. “When I go to town, they don’t disrespect me for being a labourer“. Bowing his head and putting his hands together, he says: “They now say Namaskar.”     Cathy Watson is chief of programme development at the World Agroforestry Centre."
"“Try to have a conversation with anyone about climate change and people just tune out,” says Leonardo DiCaprio in his new film. “If the UN really knew how I feel, how pessimistic I am about our future, I mean to be honest they may have picked the wrong guy,” he says in Before the Flood, which shows him urging world leaders at the UN to act on fossil fuels. But after touring the world to see global warming’s impact first-hand, from Canada’s tar sands and Greenland’s ice to China’s coal belt and Miami’s flood problems, the actor came away more upbeat.  “When we started he was much more pessimistic than I was,” says Fisher Stevens, the documentary’s director. “But by the end of the film he became a little bit more optimistic after meeting Obama, the Pope, Elon [Musk, of Tesla]. I didn’t get any more optimistic … but I still do believe we can turn it around.” Stevens and DiCaprio’s documentary is one of a pair of films out this week in the UK that hope to galvanise action on climate change. Before the Flood’s UK premiere on Friday follows the premiere on Tuesday of How to Let Go of the World and Love All the Things Climate Can’t Change, a documentary by Josh Fox, best known for his fracking film, Gasland. “I’m hoping this will energise a whole new generation,” says Stevens. “We want to get people inspired to start thinking about this in a different way. With Leo it’s taking it to the next level.” As well as DiCaprio’s huge fanbase, the actor brings more than two decades of his passion and experience of campaigning on climate change. The film features the star addressing a rally for Earth Day back in 2000 and calling for the world to cut emissions. That ardour hasn’t cooled as the world has got hotter. “I get an email a day from Leo sending me an article, sending me something we should be doing [on climate change],” Stevens says. “He gets very emotional and angry [on the issue].” But the actor is not an angry person, the director says, and it was vital that he did not come across as preaching to viewers in the film. For Stevens, the two most visceral and shocking experiences making the film were visiting huge deforested areas of Canada’s arboreal forests and Indonesia’s rainforests, cleared for tar sands and palm oil developments respectively.  “Those two places … you feel like – that’s when you just get dark, when you think fuck, how are we going to stop this, human beings are horrible. But then you’re with a woman risking her life to stop it [a conservationist in Indonesia] and then you have hope.” Speaking during an interview with the Guardian just a few feet from the newly-enlarged Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, which Theresa May folded the Department for Energy and Climate Change into when she abolished it in July, Stevens is critical of the new UK government’s stance on the issue. “It’s terrifying [the abolition]. Cameron started out very promising but to me the one thing that freaked me out was he was cutting subsidies for solar, and that was a bad situation and the antithesis of the Paris climate talks. What she’s doing seems to me even more dangerous, sending a statement to the world that ‘we don’t need an environmental minister’.” Josh Fox is no fan of May’s administration either, and is currently touring the UK screening his film and berating the government for recently overturning Lancashire’s rejection of fracking.  His film is a journey around the world meeting people who Fox believes embody human values such as courage and resilience that climate change cannot destroy. “I felt ashamed I’d wanted to stay at home and do nothing,” he says as he wells up on the Great Wall of China, having earlier admitted to wanting to hide at home in Delaware feeling paralysed by the scale of the problem.  “The very first step to know you’re on the right track of climate change action is: leave your house. If you’ve left your house you’re on the right track. People think of activism as something you can click through, share or post. That’s not true,” Fox tells the Guardian."
"The government’s decision to back a third runway at Heathrow has been informed by a mishmash of misinformation and missing information. To take just one example, business flights are in decline. They’ve been in decline for years. And yet the debate is conducted as though they were not only increasing, but increasing at a rate that our current infrastructure is unable to cater for, and our economy is suffering as a result. But they’re not, they’re declining. Here’s another. Heathrow can’t afford to expand with its own money. Surface access costs for Heathrow are only affordable with a huge subsidy from the taxpayer. Heathrow will only pay £1bn for the additional road and rail links required to get the extra passengers to and from Heathrow. Transport for London say it will cost £18bn. Anyone see a small discrepancy?  There may be general, underlying sociological trends which explain why the big issues of our time are decided on the basis of incomplete and misleading information, but with the runway argument there is an additional reason. We privatised the decision. By turning it into a competition between Heathrow and Gatwick lobbyists, we allowed the debate to be conducted by two parties that both firmly agreed that building a new runway in the south-east should be the nation’s top priority. They were both happy to point out the relative flaws in their rival’s plans, but are equally content to ignore any flaws which affect both. The media accepted the framing, and so despite extensive coverage, the biggest, most important flaw has been missing from the debate. The BBC has covered Heathrow on all of its flagship news and politics shows – Newsnight, the Daily Politics, the Today Programme – without even touching on the main issue. It’s easy to miss something that’s invisible, silent, odourless and tasteless. Particularly when you have a strong financial incentive to do so. And the entire aviation industry has a very strong financial incentive to ignore CO2. They’ve been successfully ignoring it for decades, and last month’s UN-affiliated international aviation conference made it abundantly clear that it is content to continue with its current approach. Unfortunately, there are no imminent technologies that, in the short to medium term, will make aviation a low-carbon industry. The only feasible way to significantly reduce aviation’s impact on the climate is to significantly reduce aviation. The Climate Change Act requires the UK economy to reduce its emissions by 80% from 1990 levels, by 2050. Aviation is allowed to increase its emissions by 120% from 1990 levels. They are on course to exceed that 120% without any new runways. So how will building a new runway in the south-east reduce the number of flights down to a level consistent with that target? Unsurprisingly, it won’t. In fact, entirely predictably, it will hugely increase flights and emissions. Or so a naive observer might think. The serious players in this debate have a different answer to that question. The Davies commission, that entirely independent and impartial inquiry into what colour Heathrow’s third runway should be, has said that it will fit within the UK’s carbon budget. So that’s that, issue resolved. Except, it won’t explain how. This reluctance encompasses the majority who don’t understand how Sir Howard Davies came to such a counterintuitive conclusion, and the small minority who understand all too well. Davies’ “solution” exists as fragments scattered through his 600-page multi-volume report in an as obscure and obfuscatory manner as he could manage. It’s designed, very effectively, not to be understood. It consists primarily of demand-control measures, primarily carbon taxes. Davies is saying (or rather whispering in pig Latin with a paper bag on his head) that we can build a new runway that has the specific purpose of increasing flights so long as we increase the price of those flights so much that demand drops to a level that reduces the number of flights overall. There are two ways to interpret this “solution”. One is to accept that everyone is on the level. The new runway will be built, flights will increase, the emissions from aviation will soar ever higher above their target level, and then the government will introduce a carbon tax or similar instrument which will be so punitive, adding hundreds of pounds to every ticket, that demand will drop dramatically back to levels not seen for 40 years. The consequence would be a severe scaling back, or perhaps even closure of airports, in poorer regions of Britain, but not, perhaps, in west London. According to this interpretation, the new runway is not an attempt to increase capacity at all, but to move existing capacity south. And this is in some way a good and useful thing that we should spend billions of public money to support. The other plausible interpretation is that Davies’ plan for hitting aviation’s carbon targets isn’t really serious. So, the plan for demand-control measures was seen as a necessary thing to have for legal purposes, in order to get the runway built, but was always known to be just as daft as it sounds, and that’s why it was effectively hidden from view. I’m not certain which is more cynical, the idea that the government is willing to spend taxpayers’ money to redistribute mobility from the poor to the rich, or the idea that Davies’ report is designed to be a black box that allows aviation to expand so long as no one looks inside, an invisible solution to an invisible problem. Unfortunately, the invisible problem is real."
"A lawsuit has been filed against the Norwegian government over a decision to open up the Barents Sea for oil exploration which campaigners say violates the country’s constitution and threatens the Paris climate agreement. The case is being brought by an alliance including Greenpeace, indigenous activists, youth groups, and the former director of Nasa’s Goddard institute for space studies, James Hansen.  Norway is seen internationally as a green role model by many for its pledge of climate neutrality by 2030, its reliance on hydropower and ambitious plans for electric cars. But Conservative prime minister, Erna Solberg, could now be forced to appear before an Oslo city court on charges of violating Article 112 of the country’s constitution, which guarantees every citizen’s right to a healthy, diverse and productive environment. Truls Gulowsen, the director of Greenpeace Norway, said: “Signing an international climate agreement while throwing open the door to Arctic oil drilling is a dangerous act of hypocrisy. By allowing oil companies to drill in the Arctic, Norway risks undermining global efforts to address climate change.”  The case hinges on licences handed out to 13 oil companies - including Statoil, Chevron and Aker BP - allowing oil exploration in the Barents Sea, the most northerly point yet prospected. Several exploratory wells are planned to open in 2017, and these could help wreck the Paris climate agreement’s ambition of holding global warming to 1.5C, the plaintiffs say. In a letter to the prime minister seen by the Guardian, Hansen compares Norway’s behaviour to that of a “climate rogue state”. “I will not mince words, Mrs Solberg,” he says. “Your government’s actions are utterly at odds with the scientific consensus that underpins the Paris agreement. Norway appears hell-bent on sabotaging the treaty before it has even come into effect.” Speaking to the Guardian from Oslo, Hansen added: “Norway is not all that green. It is burning 70% more fossil fuels per person than Sweden, and mining 20 times more fossil fuels than it needs for its own use. It is using that to create wealth but it is going to have to decide: does it want to be a rogue state or does it want to obey the rule of law?” Next month, a ruling is expected in a similar civil rights-style class action that Hansen and his grand-daughter, Sophie, filed against the US government, along with 20 other young people. Shifting the climate fight towards the courts is a new strategy for campaigners, with high-profile legal actions being heard in the Netherlands and the Philippines in the last two years. Several more lawsuits are being prepared around the world, although campaigners will not yet share details. The Norwegian case focuses on a constitutional amendment – Article 112 – passed in 2014 that has never been tested in a court of law. This stipulates that “every person has a right to an environment that is conducive to health and to a natural environment whose productivity and diversity are maintained. Natural resources should be managed on the basis of comprehensive long-term considerations whereby this right will be safeguarded for future generations as well.” Gulowsen said: “The constitutional passage is unexplored territory but our lawyers believe we have a very strong case. The factual basis [of the claim] is there. The question is how the court will deal with the facts.” Another litigant, Ingrid Skjoldværfrom the Nature and Youth group, added: “We will argue in court that the Norwegian government has an obligation to keep its climate promises and will invoke the people’s right to a healthy environment for ours and future generations. This is the People vs Arctic oil!” One firm which is not participating in the new Arctic oil rush is Shell, which pulled out of a drilling project in Alaska’s Chukchi Sea last year, privately conceding reputational damage. Publicly, Shell blames low oil prices for its retreat from the Barents this time. Tor Arnesen, the director of A/S Norske Shell, said: “Despite knowing we could have explored safely, both environmentally and technically, the current conditions are such that we globally have to prioritise activities with a shorter return on investment.”"
"For years now geologists have been politely but forcefully arguing over the existence or otherwise of a new epoch – one that might have started decades ago. Some of the world’s most respected geologists and scientists reckon humans have had such a profound impact on the Earth that we’ve now moved out of the Holocene and into the Anthropocene.  It’s not official. But it’s close. Dropping nuclear bombs and burning billions of tonnes of fossil fuels will do that to a planet, as will clearing swaths of forests to make way for food production and supermarket car parks and the like. That’s all in the real world though, and sometimes you might get the horrible, chilling idea that when it comes to the production of our thoughts and ideas, that’s not the place a lot of us live anymore.  So I’d like to also propose the idea of an impending new epoch – the Trumpocene – that in the spirit of the era itself is based solely on a few thoughts held loosely together with hyperlinks and a general feeling of malaise. In the Trumpocene, the epoch-defining impacts of climate change are nothing more than a conspiracy. Even if these impacts are real, then they’re probably good for us.  The era is named, of course, for the phenomenon that is Donald Trump, the Republican pick for US president whose candidacy has been defined by a loose grasp of facts, jingoistic posturing, populist rhetoric, his amazing hair and his treatment of women.  So what are the things that might define the Trumpocene?  Is it the point at which large numbers of people started to reject the views of large groups of actual experts – people with university qualifications and things – in exchange for the views of anyone who agrees with them? (Brexit, anyone?) How about that point when a critical mass of people have become convinced that they can Google their way out of the laws of physics?  Let’s go and dig for evidence of the Trumpocene. A few months ago, Trump gave an interview to polemicist and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who could be the angriest person on the internet.  Jones has a regular online radio and TV show called Infowars that has expanded beyond being a vehicle for Jones’s cult personality to include regular news bulletins and a line in “alternative” health therapies. Jones thinks that climate change is a scam being forced on us by the United Nations, which, in turn, is a totalitarian regime and kingpin of a new world order.  The a fervent Trump supporter has told his viewers that the both US president, Barack Obama, and the Democrat nominee, Hilary Clinton, were “literal demons” who smelt of sulphur. I kid you not.  In Australia, we have a senator who similarly sees climate change as a thing made up by the UN. Our top-rating radio host, Alan Jones (no relation), has said climate science is “witchcraft”.  Now, before I go on, there’s a prevailing view (often expressed in the comments of this blog) that climate science deniers and oddballs like Alex Jones should be ignored. In some ways, those commenters are right. But then you look at the popularity of people like Jones and see that, to increasing numbers of people, they are not people to be ignored, but are paragons of fearless truth-telling. There’s a demographic to which rhetoric from people like Jones and, more broadly, Trump, appeals.  Jones’s YouTube account has about 1.6 million subscribers and is growing. He has 1.2m likes on his Facebook account. His website, according to SimilarWeb, was getting 27m pageviews a month back in February. Now it’s at 36m. Earlier this year Jones snagged a rare interview with the conservative blogger Matt Drudge. Jones and Drudge expressed mutual admiration.  Drudge’s news and opinion aggregator website, the Drudge Report, is a genuine web phenomenon and considered hugely influential. With about 1.37bn page views a month, the Drudge Report is the second-ranked media site in the United States — 600m views behind msn.com but 300m ahead of Google’s news page.  The Drudge Report also tends to link to news items that disparage any action to cut greenhouse gas emissions.  There’s now a whole media ecosystem that climate science denialism can exist inside, where there’s little scrutiny of the views of deniers. US-based sites like the Drudge Report, Infowars, Breitbart and Daily Caller are part of that ecosystem. As the Guardian’s Roy Greenslade notes, Breitbart “has the dubious honour of challenging Fox News’s status as America’s most influential conservative media outlet”. Not only is the outlet having influence, but its executive chairman, Stephen Bannon, is running Trump’s campaign.  Breitbart too is growing its audience, according to those SimilarWeb statistics. In February 2016 the site registered 89m page views. In August, it was up to 143m. Another characteristic of the Trumpocene might be the heightened levels of hubris combined with triumphant rhetoric and the tendency towards insults.  The Breitbart writer James Delingpole, for example, rejects the evidence of human-caused climate change. Last week he described a Royal Society fellow and climate scientist as a “puffed-up missy”. “What a bunch of disgraceful, money-grubbing, charlatans the climate alarmists are,” wrote Delingpole, before then trying to link “climate alarmists” with child abusers. For a while, maybe the Trumpocene and the Anthropocene can coexist.  But even though they exist on separate plains, can we really afford to dismiss the impact of either of them?"
"Sectoral thinking is partly what will hinder us from meeting the sustainable development goals. The question is not how these sectors can collaborate, but how they can become increasingly intertwined to reflect the joined-up nature of the goals. A good example is the transformation from marine governance to ecosystem governance that took place in some countries when fisheries and environment ministries were reformed. Tim Daw, researcher – ecosystem services and poverty, Stockholm Resilience Centre, @sthlmresilience  Traditionally, we have often seen these two sectors as competing – with the notion that you had to sacrifice environmental quality for development. There has also been some scepticism from those within these two communities about the intentions or approaches of others. Economists have not always been welcomed in environmental circles and there is mistrust when it comes to issues that are important to so many. But we are seeing a more enlightened view. Both sides are working together and appreciating that by doing this we can achieve more than we could by working against each other. Oren Ahoobim, associate partner, Dalberg, @orenahoobim, @DalbergTweet We all recognise that we need a holistic approach, so perhaps industrial projects (eg dams and mining) could use the SDGs as a design checklist to ensure they do not cause negative impacts elsewhere and are a positive force for good. We use our One Planet Living framework in this way, which could really work for the SDGs. Sue Riddlestone, CEO and co-founder, Bioregional, @sueriddlestone, @bioregional There are now 20 million artisanal and small-scale miners worldwide. They are responsible for about a tenth of all gold production, but they also do great environmental damage, accounting for the biggest single use of mercury that poisons land and drinking water supplies. The activity is hard to control as miners are widely dispersed, often operating illegally and in remote places. Last week, the GEF council approved a programme that will design and deploy ways in which miners in eight countries can get loans to switch from mercury. Robert Bisset, head of communications, Global Environment Facility, @robbiebisset, @theGEF We need business models where development aid and environmental grants are used to get things started, and then they need to stand on their own two feet as some sort of service or business. Social entrepreneurs are entering the development space with initiatives like this, for example, projects bringing solar power to villages in remote areas help development and address environmental issues. Sue Riddlestone We need all children and students to know not to support unsustainable solutions, so that when they grow up – perhaps to be engineers or designers – they will discourage solutions that are unsustainable. The rest of us need to adopt this mindset; we can’t think we can have a growing business in a failing planet. Livia Bizikova, director – SDG Knowledge Programme, IISD, @LiviaBizik, @IISD_news As well as the traditional tools used in environmental impact assessments, there is a key need for trustworthy oversight. A factory or mine may be designed to minimise environmental harm but unless someone is there to monitor emissions, standards might slip. This process of safeguarding and achieving the best development outcomes is set out in various documents (such as the African Development Bank’s Safeguard Policy). The key is to ensure they are implemented during and after construction as, unfortunately, when these major projects are operational, development practitioners have little or no influence. There is a key role for environmental NGOs here. Mike Webster, director, WasteAid UK, @michaelgwebster, @WasteAidUK I got to know some development NGOs at the UN general assembly and during the SDG process, but now the goals are being implementing, where do we meet up? Maybe the environment and development sectors need to have opportunities to get together more often. Sue Riddlestone Virunga National Park authorities have acknowledged that the four million people who live outside the park will not stop entering it to cut down trees (for charcoal), hunt wildlife and graze cattle. The Virunga Alliance has helped install three hydroelectric dams that generate electricity for villages outside the park. Children can now study and women can walk with greater safety at night, and businesses are arriving in the region. The project has begun to promote better relations between the park’s rangers and the local people, while building peace, stability and hope in North Kivu province. By harnessing the natural power of the park, the authorities have made great inroads to protecting its exceptionally rich biodiversity. Alex Jones In the Maasai village where I live, we now have solar energy installed for lights and charging points, and a solar water pump means children have time to do homework and women can take literacy classes. We have switched to clean cook stoves, using cow dung as fuel, and are about to install proper waste treatment because the wind blows in plastics from across the Mara. We have done this at a village scale, which is now being repeated across the Maasai, while keeping all the cultural elements of pastoralism and a semi-nomadic life. The Maasai may live in a world of no money and little food, but it is a world where the best technology can help ensure the future of an important indigenous people. Jacqueline McGlade, chief scientist, UN environment programme, @UNEP  The environment and development sectors will need to build on the objectives of each other to attract critical funding. This will require them to rethink and expand their work, but will present the opportunity to leverage each other in developing a larger value proposition. We are working with The Nature Conservancy to develop an insurance product to protect reefs facing the damaging impacts of storms. While the traditional approach to reef protection has been to seek public or donor funding to support biodiversity, there is a big opportunity to increase funding to this critical natural infrastructure by layering in development objectives. The reefs provide crucial protection and tourism for the communities and businesses behind them. Adam Connaker, program associate – innovative finance, The Rockefeller Foundation, @RockefellerFdn Early on, development was focused solely on economic growth, which was often achieved by extracting natural capital. Now there is growing recognition that nature serves as the foundation for development over the long term because natural systems support our food production, clean our water, regulate our climate, and safeguard the Earth’s biodiversity. The SDGs do a good job of integrating the economic, social and environmental dimensions of development.

"Australia’s “Direct Action” policy aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions is paying polluters millions of dollars to avoid pollution they probably would not have emitted anyway, according to in-depth analysis. The centrepiece of the government’s Direct Action scheme, introduced by the former prime minister Tony Abbott, is the emissions reduction fund (ERF). Through a reverse auction, it pays polluters to pollute less – mostly paying farmers not to clear their land. So far about $1.7bn has been spent through the ERF.  The analysis for the Green Institute, a not-for-profit organisation supporting green policies, says much of that clearing wouldn’t have happened anyway, so shouldn’t count as real abatement. The authors, Margaret Blakers and Margaret Considine, looked at each of the projects funded and found 75% of the fund’s vegetation projects were paying to stop clearing in regions dominated by mulga plants. Assuming those projects were paid the average price per hectare, the government paid about $360 per hectare for avoided deforestation and about $205 per hectare for regeneration. But the researchers found sales of mulga regions sold for as little as $58 per hectare in 2015 and as little as $4.31 per hectare in 2002. Calling it the “mulga bonanza”, the report said: “Vegetation projects are cheap but on a per hectare basis the prices being paid for carbon credits are extraordinary compared with land values.” Many of the contracts were for avoided land clearing that only last for 25 years. But according to the Green Institute report, mulga lands are usually not cleared for at least 15 years, since they are allowed to regenerate before being harvested for cattle fodder. “Twenty-five year ‘permanence’ may represent little more than the deferral of one clearing cycle,” the report found. And since for the first 15 years it is unlikely to have been cleared, it only defers that clearing for 10 years. The report echoes but goes further than the government’s own Climate Change Authority report from 2014, which found “some credits issued are likely to have been non-additional”. “The problem is that it can be virtually impossible for governments, regulators or indeed anyone outside the firm concerned, to quantify what would have otherwise happened,” the Climate Change Authority report found. In addition, with no limit on the clearing that is possible on most land, and with policies in some states potentially triggering an expansion of land clearing, any gains from the policy could be completely subverted, the report said. Tim Hollo, the Green Institute’s executive director, said: “We are doing nothing more than paying some people to reduce clearing with one hand while allowing a whole lot more to be cleared with the other.” The Climate Change Authority and several other groups have called for the Direct Action policy to be strengthened and expanded by setting a cap for emissions in industries not covered by the ERF (the “safeguards mechanism”), and allowing them to then buy carbon credits from projects that are covered if they go over that cap. That would allow heavy industries to continue to pollute, so long as they bought offsets, paying for farmers to not clear their land. The report found such an outcome would be of little or no benefit to the climate, and the scheme cannot be strengthened and expanded to other industries without a major redesign.  “If the ERF is opened up to trading by tightening safeguards on industry emissions but leaving access to offsets in the land sector more or less unlimited, the land sector will turn into a credit-generating tool for companies choosing to buy credits rather than reduce pollution, while little or nothing is done to benefit the climate,” the report concludes. Hollo said: “The only way Direct Action can be turned into an effective and viable scheme would be to completely separate industrial emissions from land sector abatement. And that would be a completely different scheme. We’d be better off designing an effective model from the outset.”"
"For many people, Google is simply the gateway to a vast archive of facts and memories. For those who pay closer attention to its business dealings, the company also invests billions to find new ways to use the power of computers: it’s developing robots, virtual reality gear and self-driving cars. Remember all the hubbub about Google Glass? Google has been using the same approach in sustainability – spreading its wealth in a variety of projects to cut its waste and carbon footprint, initiatives which may one day generate profits. During the SXSW Eco conference this week, I caught up with Google’s sustainability officer, Kate Brandt, to find out more. Brandt joined the company in July last year after serving as the nation’s chief sustainability officer in the Obama administration.  During her keynote at SXSW Eco in Austin, Texas, Brandt hit all the key environmental initiatives that Google had undertaken over the past decade – at least those that have been announced. Some of the projects involve collecting and analyzing data that enable Google and other businesses to use more sustainable materials, reduce their environmental impact and cut emissions. “When we think about the Third Industrial Revolution and the role Google played in it, we also think about the Fourth Industrial Revolution where this digital backbone could transform our relationship to the material world. We would like to be a player,” she said during her keynote. The Fourth Industrial Revolution is the buzzterm for describing the deepening role that technology plays in our lives. Understandably, Google is big on reducing energy use at its data centers. Another often-cited effort: the company is a big wind and solar energy investor, having signed 2.5 gigawatts worth of contracts around the world and, additionally, committed to investing $2.5bn in renewable energy, including owning stakes in power plants. That makes the company the largest corporate renewable energy buyer if you don’t count utilities, Brandt said. Brandt wouldn’t tell me whether the company plans to put money into energy storage, which is seen as a complementary, if not must-have, technology for renewable energy in overtaking fossil fuels. Energy storage, such as batteries, makes it possible to use renewable energy at a time when solar or wind farms can’t produce electricity. The energy storage market is fairly new, with lots of experiments with a variety of technologies and ways to reduce costs. Brandt said one of the surprising things she learned when she first arrived at Google was the company’s project to create a database of the composition and environmental impact of building materials, something she didn’t know about before. The company had been using the database, called Portico, for its own construction projects, but released a web app last week to make the data more publicly available. Brandt isn’t the first hire at Google to work on sustainability. The tech giant has a decentralized approach: there have been teams embedded in different business units that look at ways to reduce energy use, emissions and waste and to boost productivity and revenues. For instance, there’s a team called Geo for Good that investigates the use of maps, data and machine learning to solve environmental problems, such as creating databases and software to monitor the health of tropical forests around the world or track illegal fishing. There’s also a team that works on serving sustainably grown food within the company. But Brandt appears to have been hired to come up with big picture strategies and make more efficient use of all these disparate sustainability initiatives. That means a lot of cajoling and negotiations with people who don’t necessarily have to answer to her. This is where her experience working as the country’s chief sustainability officer comes in handy, she said. “My current role [is to work] across a lot of different teams. These challenges are so big that it requires partnership,” she told me. What Google does internally is fascinating. At a sustainability conference in June, I attended a panel of three Google employees who recounted their effort to promote reusable menstrual cups, which help to reduce the amount of pads and tampons that end up in landfills. The discussion provided an interesting look into the skepticism and struggle the three women faced in persuading their fellow Googlers to try something new. And, of course, data played a big role: numbers to show the growing public interest in menstrual cups and the large expenses that Google spends on pads and tampons. They ran a pilot project at the company’s headquarters in Mountain View that saw all 250 cups being used in half of the expected time frame and received an overwhelming amount of positive feedback. So the Googlers began looking to do another pilot at a different Google office. I also learned that reducing meat consumption is a touchy subject at Google, where engineers are pampered and cloistered to maximize their productivity. “When we did ‘Meatless Monday’, there was a group that set up a barbecue just outside of the café,” said one of the Google employees at the June conference. So what does Brandt do personally to set a good example? “I take our shuttle to work,” she said, before switching to “we” and her talking points from her keynote. “We are focused on composting, recycling and reusing our water bottles,” she said, pointing to a water bottle on the table in front of her. “We have a bin that’s green for composting, blue for recycling and a little bit of [space] hanging off to the side that’s for landfill waste.”"
"Devastating hurricane? More than 1,000 lives lost? It must be climate change! Almost inevitably, Hurricane Matthew’s recent rampage across the Caribbean and south-eastern US has been fingered by some as a backlash of global warming driven by humanity’s polluting activities, but does this really stack up? The short answer is no. Blame for a single storm cannot be laid at climate change’s door, as reinforced by the bigger picture. The current hurricane season is by no means extraordinary, and the last few seasons have actually been very tame. The 2013 season saw no major hurricanes at all and tied with 1982 for the fewest hurricanes since 1930. This, in turn, is no big deal as there is great year-on-year variability in the level of hurricane activity, which responds to various natural factors such as El Niño and the so-called Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, as well as the progressive warming of the oceans as climate change bites harder.  The current consensus holds that while a warmer world will not necessarily mean more hurricanes, it will see a rise in the frequency of the most powerful, and therefore more destructive, variety. This view was supported recently by Kerry Emanuel, a hurricane scientist at MIT, who pointed to Matthew as a likely sign of things to come. Debate within the hurricane science community has in recent decades been almost as hostile as the storms themselves, with researchers, on occasion, even refusing to sit on the same panels at conferences. At the heart of this sometimes acrimonious dispute has been the validity of the Atlantic hurricane record and the robustness of the idea that hurricane activity had been broadly ratcheting up since the 1980s. Now, the weight of evidence looks to have come down on the side of a broad and significant increase in hurricane activity that is primarily driven by progressive warming of the climate. For many, the bottom line is the sea surface temperature, which is a major driver of hurricane activity and storm intensification. Last year saw the warmest sea temperatures on record, so it should not be a surprise. As Michael Mann, an atmospheric scientist at Penn State University, says: “It isn’t a coincidence that we’ve seen the strongest hurricane in both hemispheres [western and eastern] within the last year.” As the Atlantic continues to heat up, the trend is widely expected to be towards more powerful and wetter storms, so that Matthew might seem like pretty small beer when looked back on from the mid-century. As with hurricanes, Pacific typhoons and the mid-latitude storms that periodically batter the UK and Europe are forecast to follow a similar pattern in an anthropogenically warmed world. Storm numbers may not rise, but there is likely to be an escalation in the frequency of the bigger storm systems, which tend to be the most destructive. An additional concern is that mid-latitude storms may become clustered, bringing the prospect of extended periods of damaging and disruptive winds. The jury is out on whether climate change will drive up the number of smaller, but potentially ruinous vortices of solid wind that make up tornadoes, although an apparent trend in the US towards more powerful storms has been blamed by some on a warming atmosphere. Tornadoes, typhoons, hurricanes and mid-latitude storms – along with heatwaves and floods – are widely regarded as climate change’s shock troops; forecast to accelerate the destruction, loss of life and financial pain as planet Earth continues to heat up. It would be wrong to imagine, however, that climate change and the extreme events it drives are all about higher temperatures and a bit more wind and rain. The atmosphere is far from isolated and interacts with other elements of the so-called “Earth system”, such as the oceans, ice caps and even the ground beneath our feet, in complex and often unexpected ways capable of making our world more dangerous. We are pretty familiar with the idea that the oceans swell as a consequence of the plunging atmospheric pressure at the heart of powerful storms, building surges driven onshore by high winds that can be massively destructive. Similarly, it does not stretch the imagination to appreciate that a warmer atmosphere promotes greater melting of the polar ice caps, thereby raising sea levels and increasing the risk of coastal flooding. But, more extraordinarily, the thin layer of gases that hosts the weather and fosters global warming really does interact with the solid Earth – the so-called geosphere — in such a way as to make climate change an even bigger threat. This relationship is marvellously illustrated by a piece of research published in the journal Nature in 2009 by Chi-Ching Liu of the Institute of Earth Sciences at Taipei’s Academia Sinica. In the paper, Liu and his colleagues provided convincing evidence for a link between typhoons barrelling across Taiwan and the timing of small earthquakes beneath the island. Their take on the connection is that the reduced atmospheric pressure that characterises these powerful Pacific equivalents of hurricanes is sufficient to allow earthquake faults deep within the crust to move more easily and release accumulated strain. This may sound far fetched, but an earthquake fault that is primed and ready to go is like a coiled spring, and as geophysicist John McCloskey of the University of Ulster is fond of pointing out, all that is needed to set it off is – quite literally – “the pressure of a handshake”. Perhaps even more astonishingly, Liu and his team proposed that storms might act as safety valves, repeatedly short-circuiting the buildup of dangerous levels of strain that otherwise could eventually instigate large, destructive earthquakes. This might explain, the researchers say, why the contact between the Eurasian and Philippine Sea tectonic plates, in the vicinity of Taiwan, has far less in the way of major quakes than further north where the plate boundary swings past Japan. In a similar vein, it seems that the huge volume of rain dumped by tropical cyclones, leading to severe flooding, may also be linked to earthquakes. The University of Miami’s Shimon Wdowinski has noticed that in some parts of the tropics – Taiwan included – large earthquakes have a tendency to follow exceptionally wet hurricanes or typhoons, most notably the devastating quake that took up to 220,000 lives in Haiti in 2010. It is possible that floodwaters are lubricating fault planes, but Wdowinski has another explanation. He thinks that the erosion of landslides caused by the torrential rains acts to reduce the weight on any fault below, allowing it to move more easily. It has been known for some time that rainfall also influences the pattern of earthquake activity in the Himalayas, where the 2015 Nepal earthquake took close to 9,000 lives, and where the threat of future devastating quakes is very high. During the summer monsoon season, prodigious quantities of rain soak into the lowlands of the Indo-Gangetic plain, immediately to the south of the mountain range, which then slowly drains away over the next few months. This annual rainwater loading and unloading of the crust is mirrored by the level of earthquake activity, which is significantly lower during the summer months than during the winter. And it isn’t only earthquake faults that today’s storms and torrential rains are capable of shaking up. Volcanoes seem to be susceptible too. On the Caribbean island of Montserrat, heavy rains have been implicated in triggering eruptions of the active lava dome that dominates the Soufrière Hills volcano. Stranger still, Alaska’s Pavlof volcano appears to respond not to wind or rain, but to tiny seasonal changes in sea level. The volcano seems to prefer to erupt in the late autumn and winter, when weather patterns are such that water levels adjacent to this coastal volcano climb by a few tens of centimetres. This is enough to bend the crust beneath the volcano, allowing magma to be squeezed out, according to geophysicist Steve McNutt of the University of South Florida, “like toothpaste out of a tube”. If today’s weather can bring forth earthquakes and magma from the Earth’s crust, it doesn’t take much to imagine how the solid Earth is likely to respond to the large-scale environmental adjustments that accompany rapid climate change. In fact, we don’t have to imagine at all. The last time our world experienced serious warming was at the end of the last ice age when, between about 20,000 and 10,000 years ago, temperatures rose by six degrees centigrade, melting the great continental ice sheets and pushing up sea levels by more than 120m. These huge changes triggered geological mayhem. As the kilometres-thick Scandinavian ice sheet vanished, the faults beneath released the accumulated strain of tens of millennia, spawning massive magnitude eight earthquakes. Quakes of this scale are taken for granted today around the Pacific Ocean’s “Ring of Fire”, but they are completely out of place in Santa’s Lapland. Across the Norwegian Sea, in Iceland, the volcanoes long buried beneath a kilometre of ice were also rejuvenated as the suffocating ice load melted away, prompting a “volcano storm” about 12,000 years ago that saw the level of activity increase by up to 50 times. Now, global average temperatures are shooting up again and are already more than one degree centigrade higher than during preindustrial times. It should come as no surprise that the solid Earth is starting to respond once more. In southern Alaska, which has in places lost a vertical kilometre of ice cover, the reduced load on the crust is already increasing the level of seismic activity. In high mountain ranges across the world from the Caucasus in the north to New Zealand’s southern Alps, longer and more intense heatwaves are melting the ice and thawing the permafrost that keeps mountain faces intact, leading to a rise in major landslides. Does this all mean that we are in for a more geologically active future as well as a hotter and meteorologically more violent one? Well, no one is suggesting that we will see a great surge in the number of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. As always, these will be controlled largely by local geological conditions. Where an earthquake fault or volcano is primed and ready to go, however, climate change may provide that extra helping hand that brings forward the timing of a quake or eruption that would eventually have happened anyway. As the world continues to heat up, any geological response is likely to be most obvious where climate change is driving the biggest environmental changes – for example, in areas where ice and permafrost are vanishing fast, or in coastal regions where rising sea levels will play an increasing role. Freysteinn Sigmundsson of the Nordic Volcanological Centre observes that the centre of Iceland is now rising by more than three centimetres a year in response to shrinking glaciers. Studies undertaken by Sigmundsson and his colleagues forecast that the reduced pressures that result will lead to the formation of significant volumes of new magma deep under Iceland. Whether this will translate into more or bigger eruptions remains uncertain, but the aviation chaos that arose from the Eyjafjallajökull eruption in 2010 provides a salutary warning of the disruption that any future increase in Icelandic volcanic activity may cause across the North Atlantic region. Volcanologist Hugh Tuffen, of Lancaster University, is worried about the stability of the more than 10% of active volcanoes that are ice-covered. He says that “climate change is driving rapid melting of ice on many volcanoes worldwide, triggering unloading as ice is removed. As well as encouraging magma to rise to the surface, leading to increased volcanic activity, removal of ice can also destabilise steep volcano flanks, making hazardous landslides more likely.” The potential for more landslides is also likely to be a problem in high mountain ranges as the ice cover that stabilises rock faces vanishes. Christian Huggel of the University of Zurich has warned that “in densely populated and developed regions such as the European Alps, serious consequences have to be considered from [future] large slope failures”. Looking ahead, one of the key places to watch will be Greenland, where recent findings by a research team led by Shfaqat Khan of Denmark’s Technical University reveal a staggering loss of 272bn tonnes of ice a year over the last decade. GPS measurements show that, like Scandinavia at the end of the last ice age, Greenland and the whole of the surrounding region is already rising in response to the removal of this ice load. Andrea Hampel of the University of Hannover’s Geological Institute, who with colleagues has been studying this behaviour, is concerned that “future ice loss may trigger earthquakes of intermediate to large magnitude if the crust underneath the modern ice cap contains faults prone to failure”. More earthquakes in Greenland might not seem like a big deal, but this could have far wider ramifications. About 8,200 years ago, an earthquake linked to the uplift of Scandinavia, triggered the Storegga Slide; a gigantic undersea sediment slide that sent a tsunami racing across the North Atlantic. Run-up heights were more than 20m in the Shetlands and six metres along the east coast of Scotland, and the event has been blamed for the flooding of Doggerland; the inhabited Mesolithic landmass that occupied what is now the southern North Sea. The submerged margins of Greenland are currently not very well mapped, so the likelihood of a future earthquake triggering a landslide capable of generating a major tsunami in the North Atlantic is unknown. Dave Tappin, a tsunami expert at the British Geological Survey, points out that one large, undersea landslide has been identified off the coast of Greenland, but suspects that there may not be sufficient sediment to generate landslides as large as Storegga. Nonetheless, the seismic revival of Greenland is certainly a geological response to climate change that we need to keep an eye on. The bottom line in all of this is that as climate change tightens its grip, we should certainly contemplate more and bigger Hurricane Matthews. However, when it comes to the manifold hazardous by-blows of an overheating planet, and especially those involving the ground we stand on, we must also be prepared to expect the unexpected.

"The lights had not even come back on in South Australia after the freak storm that blacked out the state last month when the latest front in the climate wars was breaking out. The pushback against the state’s 41% reliance on renewables, notably wind farms, has attracted a gumbo of opportunists seeking to push their particular carbon barrows. There was the federal energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, attempting to justify his less-than ambitious renewable energy target, there was the king of South Australian populism, Nick Xenophon, jumping on the nearest bandwagon and there was the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, who just hates wind farms. Close behind them and was the peak industry group, ACCI, calling for an independent review of the state’s energy mix while rightwing shock jocks across the nation took up the opportunity to move beyond the increasingly settled debate on climate science to find a new target for their vitriol. And presiding over it all was a prime minister who appears to have ceased to even realise when he is trashing his own political integrity. If it all looked like a pre-prepared and coordinated campaign by the Coal Club, that’s because it probably was. Essential has been following the issue over recent weeks to monitor whether the SA blackouts have the capacity to spark another climate panic, not so much the Big New Tax On Everything, as much as the Big Black Out. The short answer is that the public isn’t buying the renewable panic. Yes, a quarter of Coalition voters reject the experts and see a causal relationship that even the prime minister and his energy minister didn’t really assert. But the 60% figure who don’t represents a significant rebuff.  And those findings are reflected in broader attitudes towards renewables – when asked to choose between threat or solution, the signals are clear if not unanimous. So if renewables are popular with the public, have not been blamed for the blackout by any authoritative source and, by definition are better for the environment, where is all the vitriol coming from? Early every year, the commonwealth publishes the Energy in Australia report giving a snapshot of the industry. The numbers provide a compelling context to this debate. It’s hardly a surprise then that the owners and other beneficiaries of those future earnings – that’s the corporates and the government – are seeking to defend these future earnings. Clean energy threatens their international markets for electricity fuel and production and also for transport where the substitution of clean electricity for liquid fuels is only constrained by fast-evolving battery technology. Any serious view on de-carbonisation implies a massive downgrade in expectations of future earnings and thus market value for these players. That’s where South Australia is one of the world’s biggest challenges to the market value of those bedrock Australian industries because it has moved fastest in shifting its energy mix. But while it is an early adapter it is not an outlier. According to Navigant research for US industry association Advanced Energy Economy (AEE), global “advanced energy” revenues went from $1.08tn in 2011 to $1.35tn in 2015. That’s up 25% in four years. Quoting the World Bank, Navigant says that from 2014 to 2015, advanced energy revenue grew at more than three times the rate of the world economy overall. That’s a global market of $2tn by 2020 or soon after. Even if you discount for some debatable AEE inclusions such as nuclear, that’s a massive global market. The size and speed of the national and state renewable energy targets are key drivers of Australia building its own “advanced energy” market, albeit at the cost of the existing Australian energy players. The difference in ambition is becoming one of the fault lines of the major political parties, with Labor’s national 50% target more than double the current Coalition position. Again our figures show the public is backing a fundamental energy transition.  But there’s a caution to these numbers. There was a time when support for a market response to climate change seemed almost as universal. Through the final term of the Howard government, the consensus developed until support for an emissions trading scheme was bi-partisan. The rest is history. Rudd spends too long designing the mechanism, fails to steward a global deal. Turnbull loses his base and his job, Rudd drops the “great moral challenge of the time” and his job too. Then Gillard spills the drinks. “The big new tax on everything” becomes political poison, the exaggerated price is too high and the consensus collapses along with faith in the science, leaving Tony Abbott to sup on the spoils. The lesson of climate politics of the past decade has been never to under-estimate self interest. While the mood may be right for Labor and Australia’s emerging clean energy industry, they would be foolish to under-estimate the fossil fuel industry’s capacity to slow down what seems inevitable. "

"The correct question is not where, it is whether. And the correct answer is no. The prime minister has just announced that her cabinet will recommend where a new runway should be built. Then there will be a consultation on the decision. There is only one answer that doesn’t involve abandoning our climate change commitments and our moral scruples: nowhere. The inexorable logic that should rule out new sources of oil, gas and coal also applies to the expansion of airports. In a world seeking to prevent climate breakdown, there is no remaining scope for extending infrastructure that depends on fossil fuels. The prime minister cannot uphold the Paris agreement on climate change, which comes into force next month, and permit the runway to be built.  While most sectors can replace fossil fuels with other sources, this is not the case for aviation. The airline companies seek to divert us with a series of mumbo-jumbo jets, mythical technologies never destined for life beyond the press release. Solar passenger planes, blended wing bodies, hydrogen jets, algal oils, other biofuels: all are either technically impossible, commercially infeasible, worse than fossil fuels or capable of making scarcely a dent in emissions. Aviation means kerosene. Using kerosene to hoist human bodies into the air means massive impacts. Improvements in the fuel economy of aircraft have declined to 1% a year or less, greatly outstripped by the growth in aviation. So other means must be found of trying to make it fit. The government’s decision will be based on the findings of the Airports Commission, which reported last year. It favours a new runway at Heathrow, and proposes two means of ensuring that the extra flights will not conflict with Britain’s climate pledges. Neither is either fair or workable. The first is that the rest of the economy should make extra cuts in greenhouse gases to accommodate aviation. Already the Climate Change Act imposes a legal target of 80% reductions by 2050. But if flights are to keep growing as the commission expects, those cuts would have to rise to 85%. This is fundamentally unjust. Three-quarters of  international passengers at the UK’s biggest airports travel for leisure, and they are disproportionately rich: at Heathrow their mean income is £57,000. Just 15% of people in the UK take 70% of international flights. So everyone must pay for the holidays taken by the better off. The alternative strategy is a carbon tax. The commission is remarkably evasive about what this entails, and its reckonings are opaque, contradictory and buried in remote annexes. Perhaps that’s unsurprising. An analysis by the Campaign for Better Transport suggests that the tax required to reconcile a new runway with our carbon commitments is somewhere between £270 and £850 for a return flight for a family of four to New York. In other words, the Airports Commission plan amounts to increasing airport capacity then pricing people out. Where’s the sense in that? As the commission doubtless knows, no government would impose such charges, or shut down northern airports to allow Heathrow to grow. Having approved the extra capacity, the government will discover that it’s incompatible with our commitments under the Climate Change Act, mull the consequences for a minute or two, then quietly abandon the commitments. It’s this simple: a third runway at Heathrow means that the UK will not meet its carbon targets. Hold me to that in 2050. But that’s not the half of it. The Airports Commission based its projections on the work of another government body: the Committee on Climate Change. Last week the committee announced that to meet our commitments under the Paris agreement the UK will need to go much further than the 80% cut envisaged by the Climate Change Act. The Paris deal implies reductions of “at least 90%” by 2050. This is tough under any scenario, simply impossible if airport capacity grows. It knocks the Airports Commission’s calculations out of court. If the government uses the commission’s figures to justify its decision, it will be relying on estimates that are out of date, invalid and incompatible with its international commitments. Don’t expect help from the opposition. On Sunday Labour’s shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, argued that we should pay the environmental consequences of building a new runway “full and proper heed”, then go ahead. The people of future drought zones will feel so much better when they hear about that full and proper heed. As for the international framework, forget it. Two weeks ago 191 nations struck the world’s only agreement to regulate aviation emissions. It’s voluntary, it’s pathetic, and it relies on planting trees to offset aircraft emissions, which means replacing a highly stable form of carbon storage (leaving oil in the ground) with a highly unstable one vulnerable to loggers, fires and droughts. The meeting at which the deal was done probably caused more emissions than it will save. For years there has been a lively debate about the noise, local pollution and disruption caused by building a new runway at Heathrow, all of which are valid concerns. But almost everyone ignores the issue that dwarfs all others. Climate change means no new runway. If our airports are full, there’s an immediate solution. Fly less. The Free Ride campaign has proposed a just means of achieving this: curb demand by taxing frequent flyers but not those who seldom fly. (In case you’re wondering, I limit my flying to once every three years). Is this beyond contemplation? Are we incapable of making such changes for the sake of others? If so, our ethics are weaker than those of 1791, when 300,000 British people, to dissociate themselves from slavery, stopped using sugar, reducing sales by one-third. They understood the moral implications of an act that carried no ill intent, that seemed sweetly innocent. The perceptual gulf between us and the distant and future victims of climate change is no wider than the ocean that lay between the people of Britain and the Caribbean. If we do not make the leap of imagination that connects our actions with their consequences, it is not because we can’t, but because we won’t. But reason has taken flight. The moral compass spins, greed and desire soar towards the stratosphere, and our conscience vanishes in the clouds. Will anyone confront this injustice? • Twitter: @GeorgeMonbiot.

"The world’s leading shipping organisation has been condemned by environmental campaigners and MEPs for its failure to urgently tackle the industry’s impact on climate change, after it agreed only to a partial reduction in harmful emissions from ships. The International Maritime Organisation (IMO), meeting in London, agreed to cap emissions of sulphur from ships, which are a cause of air and sea pollution, but on greenhouse gases agreed only to some further monitoring and a fresh round of negotiations. Potential measures to reduce greenhouse gases have been delayed to 2023, which campaigners said was too late.  Sulphur will be capped at 0.5% of shipping fuel content from 2020, not 2025 as some companies and countries had urged. Current levels of sulphur in maritime fuels can be as high as 3.5%. Bill Hemmings, of the campaigning group Transport and Environment, welcomed the move: “The decision reduces the contribution of shipping to the world’s air pollution from about 5% to 1.5% and will save millions of lives in the coming decades. Now the focus should shift towards implementing this decision.” It is not clear how the sulphur cap will be implemented or policed. No agreement was reached on capping carbon dioxide emissions. Shipping is a fast-growing source of greenhouse gases, projected to account for 17% of global emissions by 2050, though the industry has long been omitted from international agreements on climate change, including the UN’s Paris accord signed last year and due to come into force next month. Instead, IMO members agreed to further monitoring of greenhouse gas emissions data from international shipping, with a view to drawing up an action plan to reduce them. But that plan is not likely to be implemented before 2023. The IMO first began to make plans to reduce emissions in 2003, yet little action has been taken. Shipowners and shipping companies want to guard any data they collect on fuel consumption, seeing it as a competitive issue. Sotiris Raptis, shipping officer at Transport and Environment, said: “This can in no way be seen as a proper response to the challenge laid down by the Paris climate agreement. The International Maritime Organisation is proposing to stall any action until 2023. The decision to delay by at least a further seven years any agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions from shipping constitutes an abject failure by national governments and the shipping industry.” Jytte Guteland, a Socialist MEP, said the agreement was not enough: “The shipping sector must play its role in Europe’s transition to a low-carbon society. Time is of the essence, and in the absence of IMO action, the EU must include ships’ emissions in its 2030 climate target. By setting up a climate fund for shipping, Europe can help industry cut carbon in a cost-effective way.” Bas Eickhout, a Green MEP, added his support for unilateral action from the EU: “International shipping is the only transport sector not contributing to climate goals in Europe. Since the IMO will not be considering, let alone proposing, any emissions reduction measures for many years to come, our duty is to make sure that Europe takes action.” Both shipping and aviation have been excluded from international negotiations on climate change, partly due to the difficulty in allocating their emissions to a particular country, but also because of the reluctance of both industries – which continue to grow strongly as globalised trade increases – to submit to the international monitoring that climate change regulation requires. The aviation industry this month took its first steps toward reducing the impact of aircraft on the climate. The International Civil Aviation Organisation agreed that airlines would have to offset some of their emissions by buying carbon credits, which require investment in carbon-reduction schemes such as growing new forests and installing new renewable energy. The shipping industry has been slower to adopt such measures. Shipping fuel is much heavier and thicker than aircraft fuel, and produces more greenhouse gases. Airlines have an economic incentive to use the lightest fuel possible, which can include biofuels derived from plants. But ships are capable of carrying the heavier, more polluting – and, crucially, cheaper – fuel on long voyages, so there is little economic incentive for the industry to change its practices."
