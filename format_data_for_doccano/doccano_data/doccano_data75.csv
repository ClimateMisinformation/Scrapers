Green Party top honcho Claudia Roth left an astonishing message at Facebook where she comments about the 2-year anniversary of the mega earthquake and tsunami that rattled northeastern Japan in March, 2011. Here’s a shot of her Facebook message (before it disappears):

Today two years ago occurred the devastating atomic catastrophe of Fukushima, which after Chernobyl once again has left an entire region and with it the entire world looking down an atomic precipice. In the catastrophe in Japan a total of 16,000 people died, more than 2700 are still considered missing. Hundreds of thousands are living away from the irradiated homes. Today our thoughts are with the victims and their families. The Fukushima catastrophe has once again shown us just how uncontrollable and deadly the high risk atomic technology is. Therefore we have to make every conceivable effort in Germany, and also in Europe and worldwide, to bring about the transformation to renewable energy as rapidly as possible instead of pushing it off, as the CDU-FDP are trying to do again. Fukushima is warning us.”
Claudia Roth is a highly influential politcian in Germany. She is not some uninformed twit off the street. In her comment she is communicating that it wasn’t the tsunami that caused all the deaths in Japan – rather it was the Fukushima accident, through man’s negligence. This is as grotesque of a revision of history and hideous lie as you’ll ever find.
The fact is that not a single death has been attributed to the Fukushima accident to this day. Surely some will likely get ill and may die later on, but name one product that isn’t capable of killing.
This tells us just how desperate the greens have gotten and the means they’ll resort to in salvaging their green project of renewable energy. Now they have to shamelessly lie and fabricate an entirely new historical record that fits their agenda.
Can we believe them on climate science?
Now at Bild.
And at NTV.

"Hundreds of climate crisis experts have urged Theresa May to confront Donald Trump over his approach to the issue during his state visit this week. A letter signed by 250 academics from universities and research bodies across the UK states the US president’s “refusal” to tackle global heating is “increasing risks for lives and livelihoods” around the world.  The experts praise the UK’s international role in tackling the climate crisis but say Trump’s visit is “incompatible” with it while he is “undermining” US domestic and international efforts to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. It reads: “The president’s refusal to tackle climate change, and particularly his initiation of the withdrawal of the US from the Paris Agreement, is increasing risks for lives and livelihoods in the United States, the United Kingdom and around the world.” They urge the prime minister to tell Trump to accept the scientific evidence of the threat of the man-made climate crisis; support policies in the US to reduce greenhouse gases to zero by 2050; and collaborate with international efforts to combat the climate crisis. The president has previously called the climate crisis a “Chinese hoax” and “bullshit”. Bob Ward, director of policy for the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science, coordinated the letter. He said: “President Trump’s refusal to accept and address global climate change is putting at risk lives and livelihoods of current and future generations in the UK. “The state visit is an opportunity for the prime minister to challenge the president’s reckless approach and advance the UK’s reputation as an international leader on climate change before she steps down as prime minister. “The special relationship between the UK and USA is meaningless if the government does not use it to confront the actions of a president that are a threat to UK citizens.”"

“The Earth has a fever,” we were told. “The science is settled and the debate is over. Scientists are unanimous – 97% of them agree: climate change is real, and is happening now, and we’ve got to act quickly.”
Over more than two decades we were told again and again that everywhere was warming faster than everywhere else – especially winters were warming up quickly. Snow was becoming a thing of the past and children soon weren’t going to know what it is.  “The warm winters that we are seeing are just a harbinger of what’s to come,” the media declared just a couple of years ago. The scientists were cock-sure.
Today we are finding that precisely the exact opposite is happening. Winters in Europe have turned colder and more severe. Central Europe has seen its 5th consecutive colder than normal winter in a row – a record since measurements began in the 19th century.
Climate scientists first reacted by claiming, “One winter does not make a trend“. Then they said that the cold winters were a local phenomenon. Finally they were forced to recently claim, “Cold winters now fit the picture of global warming!”
List of failed predictions
What follows are dozens of predictions for warmer winters made not long ago during the 2000s, many by leading scientists. What started as a simple Google search, turned into a list of false winter predictions for Central Europe, particularly Germany. By sheer coincidence reader Jimbo sent over his own list of false wintertime predictions made by “experts” in the US and Great Britain. I’ve combined the two lists and present one long list to you. Of course we still have to wait (90 years in some cases) to see how some of the predictions inevitably turn out, but current trends do not bode well for them.
Unfortunately, many of these predictions were passed on as reliable predictions to various sectors of industry, so that they could prepare for the new future that awaited. Many of these industries, like tourism, skiing, agriculture, highway maintenance, etc. based their investment decisions in part on these forecasts. As we now know, they turned out to be false – completely false – and the costs will be billions. Readers are welcome to suggest other false wintertime predictions, which we will gladly add to the list.
Failed winter climate predictions
(The first 33 concern mostly Germany and Central Europe)
1. “Due to global warming, the coming winters in the local regions will become milder.”
Stefan Rahmstorf, Potsdam Institute of Climate Impact Research, University of Potsdam, 8 Feb 2006
***
2. “Milder winters, drier summers: Climate study shows a need to adapt in Saxony Anhalt.”
Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, Press Release, 10 Jan 2010.
****
3. “More heat waves, no snow in the winter“ … “Climate models… over 20 times more precise than the UN IPCC global models. In no other country do we have more precise calculations of climate consequences. They should form the basis for political planning. … Temperatures in the wintertime will rise the most … there will be less cold air coming to Central Europe from the east. …In the Alps winters will be 2°C warmer already between 2021 and 2050.”
Max Planck Institute for Meteorology, Hamburg, 2 Sept 2008.
****

4. “The new Germany will be characterized by dry-hot summers and warm-wet winters.“
Wilhelm Gerstengarbe and Peter Werner, Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), 2 March 2007
****
5. “Clear climate trends are seen from the computer simulations. Foremost the winter months will be warmer all over Germany. Depending of CO2 emissions, temperatures will rise by up to 4°C, in the Alps by up to 5°C.”Max Planck Institute for Meteorology, Hamburg, 7 Dec 2009.
****
6. “In summer under certain conditions the scientists reckon with a complete melting of the Arctic sea ice. For Europe we expect an increase in drier and warmer summers. Winters on the other hand will be warmer and wetter.”
Erich Roeckner, Max Planck Institute, Hamburg, 29 Sept 2005.
****
7. “The more than ‘unusually‘ warm January weather is yet ‘another extreme event’, ‘a harbinger of the winters that are ahead of us’. … The global temperature will ‘increase every year by 0.2°C'”
Michael Müller, Socialist, State Secretary in the Federal Ministry of Environment, in Die Zeit, 15 Jan 2007
****
8. “Harsh winters likely will be more seldom and precipitation in the wintertime will be heavier everywhere. However, due to the milder temperatures, it’ll fall more often as rain than as snow.”
Online-Atlas of the Helmholtz-Gemeinschaft, 2010
9. “We’ve mostly had mild winters in which only a few cold months were scattered about, like January 2009. This winter is a cold outlier, but that doesn’t change the picture as a whole. Generally it’s going to get warmer, also in the wintertime.”
Gerhard Müller-Westermeier, German Weather Service (DWD), 26 Jan 2010
****
10. “Winters with strong frost and lots of snow like we had 20 years ago will cease to exist at our latitudes.”
Mojib Latif, Max Planck Institute for Meteorology, Hamburg, 1 April 2000
****
11. “Good bye winter. Never again snow?”
Spiegel, 1 April 2000
****
12. “In the northern part of the continent there likely will be some benefits in the form of reduced cold periods and higher agricultural yields. But the continued increase in temperatures will cancel off these benefits. In some regions up to 60 percent of the species could die off by 2080.”
3Sat, 26 June 2003
****
13. “Although the magnitude of the trends shows large variation among different models, Miller et al. (2006) find that none of the 14 models exhibits a trend towards a lower NAM index and higher arctic SLP.”
IPCC 2007 4AR, (quoted by Georg Hoffmann)
****
14. “Based on the rising temperature, less snow will be expected regionally. While currently 1/3 of the precipitation in the Alps falls as snow, the snow-share of precipitation by the end of the century could end up being just one sixth.”
Germanwatch, Page 7, Feb 2007
****
15. “Assuming there will be a doubling of CO2 in the atmosphere, as is projected by the year 2030. The consequences could be hotter and drier summers, and winters warmer and wetter. Such a warming will be proportionately higher at higher elevations – and especially will have a powerful impact on the glaciers of the Firn regions.”
and
” The ski areas that reliably have snow will shift from 1200 meters to 1500 meters elevation by the year 2050; because of the climate prognoses warmer winters have to be anticipated.”
Scinexx Wissenschaft Magazin, 26 Mar 2002
****
16. “Yesterday’s snow … Because temperatures in the Alps are rising quickly, there will be more precipitation in many places. But because it will rain more often then it snows, this will be bad news for tourists. For many skilifts this means the end of business.”
Daniela Jacob, Max Planck Institute for Meteorology, Hamburg, 8 Aug 2006
****
17. “Spring will begin in January starting in 2030.”
Die Welt, 30 Sept 2010

18. “Ice, snow, and frost will disappear, i.e. milder winters” … “Unusually warm winters without snow and ice are now being viewed by many as signs of climate change.” Schleswig Holstein NABU, 10 Feb 2007
****
19. “Good bye winter… In the northern hemisphere the deviations are much greater according to NOAA calculations, in some areas up to 5°C. That has consequences says DWD meteorologist Müller-Westermeier: When the snowline rises over large areas, the bare ground is warmed up even more by sunlight. This amplifies global warming. A process that is uncontrollable – and for this reason understandably arouses old childhood fears: First the snow disappears, and then winter.”
Die Zeit, 16 Mar 2007
****
20. “Warm in the winter, dry in the summer … Long, hard winters in Germany remain rare: By 2085 large areas of the Alps and Central German Maountains will be almost free of snow. Because air temperatures in winter will rise more quickly than in summer, there will be more precipitation. ‘However, much of it will fall as rain,’ says Daniela Jacob of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology.”
FOCUS, 24 May 2006

23. “The climate model prognoses currently indicate that the following climate changes will occur: Increase in minimum temperatures in the winter.”
Chamber of Agriculture of Lower Saxony Date: 6 July 2009
****
24. “Both the prognoses for global climate development and the prognoses for the climatic development of the Fichtel Mountains clearly show a warming of the average temperature, whereby especially the winter months will be greatly impacted.”
Willi Seifert, University of Bayreuth, diploma thesis, p. 203, 7 July 2004
****
25. “Already in the year 2025 the conditions for winter sports in the Fichtel Mountains will develop negatively, especially with regards to ‘natural’ snow conditions and for so-called snow-making potential. A financially viable ski business operation after about the year 2025 appears under these conditions to be extremely improbable (Seifert, 2004)”.
Andreas Matzarakis, University of Freiburg Meteorological Institute, 26 July 2006
****
26. “Skiing among palm trees? … For this reason I would advise no one in the Berchtesgadener Land to invest in a ski-lift. The probability of earning money with the global warming is getting less and less.”
Hartmut Graßl, Director Emeritus, Max Planck-Institute for Meteorology, Hamburg, page 3, 4 Mar 2006
****
27. “Climate warming leads to an increasingly higher snow line. The number of future ski resorts that can be expected to have snow is reducing. […] Climate change does not only lead to higher temperatures, but also to changes in the precipitation ratios in summer and winter. […] In the wintertime more precipitation is to be anticipated. However, it will fall more often as rain, and less often as snow, in the future.”
Hans Elsasser, Director of the Geographical Institute of the University of Zurich, 4 Mar 2006
****
28. “All climate simulations – global and regional – were carried out at the Deutschen Klimarechenzentrum [German Climate Simulation Center]. […] In the winter months the temperature rise is from 1.5°C to 2°C and stretches from Scandinavia to the Mediterranean Sea. Only in regions that are directly influenced by the Atlantic (Great Britain, Portugal, parts of Spain) will the winter temperature increase be less (Fig. 1).”

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerd Heidecke of the online WAZ daily reports on a new survey conducted by polling institute Forsa, commissioned by the Ruhr Region Initiative. The pollsters asked over 1000 people about energy in the industrial heartland of North Rhine Westphalia, Germany. Hat-tip Benny Peiser at Achse des Guten.
The title of the WAZ report is: “People in the Ruhr Region having doubts about the transition to renewable energy“.
For German standards, the poll produced some shocking results. Heidecke writes:
Among the people, skepticism about the transition to renewable energy is growing. According to a poll […] especially in the Ruhr Region, only a few believe in a rapid transformation of the energy sector. Many are worried about the energy costs.”

Heidecke also writes “that there’s great doubt the energy transition will succeed as planned” and that the abrupt change of course in the energy policy in the wake of Fukushima “does not correspond to the wishes of the citizens“.

In Germany only 9% of the population believe it will be possible to cover Germany ‘s energy demands with only renewable energy sources (only 6% in the Ruhr Region). In a nutshell: Germans no longer believe in the pipe dream and have already given up on it. In 2011, that figure was 39%.
Only hardcore greens still believe it’s possible (like the reality-detached Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Reserch – PIK).

Forsa concludes that a majority of citizens are more worried about energy being affordable and less so about it being green. Heidecke writes that the Ruhr Region Initiative moderator Bodo Hombach, who commissioned the poll, “was surprised by the great skepticism among the citizens concerning the transition to green energy“. Hombach said:
There’s a need for argumentation on all sides. Without the necessary acceptance, things will turn awry.”
The survey’s summary concludes:
The euphoria of politicians with regards to the transition to renewable energies is not spreading to the citizens. For the majority it is more important to have enough affordable energy available than it is to have ‘green’ energy.”
With only 9% of the German population believing it’ll work, proponents of green energy really have their work cut out for them.
Reading between the lines of the poll, people being more concerned about affordability tells us there is no longer much alarmism left. Being green to save the climate is not that important anymore. Five cold winters in a row does tend to refocus perceptions and bring people back to their senses.
The greens should recall what Winston Churchill once said: “With success, there are two kinds – initial success, and ultimate success.” Renewable energy had a lot of initial success, but ultimate success will be extremely elusive.

"Noga Levy-Rapoport, 17, led the London climate strike march on 15 February and has since become a core organiser at UK Student Climate Network I first got involved in the February school strike in London. I saw something about it online and I wanted an opportunity to say that I, as a young person, am angry about what is going on. I’m afraid, and I feel that there is great injustice. I felt like for the first time in a long time, we had actually taken a stand. After that I contacted Youth Strike 4 Climate and said I wanted to be involved, full-time.  We are told that we’re jumping on this bandwagon of adolescent insolence, but that is just not true. We’re marching on the streets because we are furious – we are full of rage and terror – and those together have taught me that young people have the real power in our society. Our empowerment as individuals is key to change, and it has been the way that protests have brought change about over centuries. We need a fundamental change to our system – we need to fulfil the principles of the Green New Deal, and we need to listen to everyone. Activism for me is a part of my life and will remain that way, but that doesn’t mean I’m going to go on and become an MP. I want to be an opera singer. Activism shouldn’t change who you are, it should come from who you are, and your beliefs, and how you want the world to see other people. Mugdha Mokashi, 22, is president elect of Medical Students for Choice and grew up in Alabama I’m in my first year at Harvard Medical School. I was born in India but I consider Alabama my home, and I intend to return to provide abortion services when my studies are finished. I became interested in reproductive justice when I was 19. I started volunteering at a rape crisis centre. From there I started working in an organisation called URGE (Unite for Reproductive and Gender Equity). They primarily work in states where the government and legislation is typically conservative or Republican. I brought a chapter to my campus. We held something called the Abortion Positive Tour in 2017, spending a week on campus, talking and distributing information about abortion, then we would hold a rally at the end. We got quite a bit of feedback and criticism – lots of yelling, lots of people saying we were going to hell – but it wasn’t as dramatic as it could have been. There was no threat of physical violence. When Donald Trump was elected we felt a sense of urgency and we marched. I’ve learned that activism is most effective when the voices of the people who are being oppressed or targeted are elevated and centred. Nothing really does that better than protest. It’s a very accessible form of engagement you really can’t beat how persuasive visceral emotion and passion are. An important tenet of activism is doing work both “inside” and “outside the building”. Outside are the traditional forms of protest, rallying and grassroots action, but you have to establish change inside, too. My interest is in reforming the medical institution and the policy-making sphere to match what people are marching about. The power of being disruptive and visible is a salient part of protest that I have been using in my day‑to-day work – the idea that to bring about change, people need to feel uncomfortable, and that to shift the window of discourse, you need something really powerful.  Dallas Goldtooth, 35, is based in Chicago. He is the Keep It in the Ground campaigner for the Indigenous Environmental Network As cliched as it sounds, I was born into activism. My dad has been an organiser since as far back as I can remember. My own experience of organising started about six years ago in the fight against the Keystone XL pipeline, a tar sands pipeline that was supposed to cross the traditional territories of my people – the Great Sioux Nation. We brought to the doors of the White House a march of 10,000 people, led by Native American and non-Native farmers and ranchers, and we set up a tipi camp on the National Mall for six days. I’m pretty proud to say we won that campaign. We were able to convince the Obama administration not to approve that pipeline. That’s the goal of any good organiser – to work themselves out of a job. There are many different forms of protest, but they should all be tactics for a greater strategy. There is a lot of political turmoil right now and people are justifiably angry about the attacks on their self-determination, their land, their bodies. We want to march, and that’s powerful because we’re acting on the moment, and people have a right to express their anger and frustrations. But we have to challenge ourselves to look at the bigger picture of what we’re building towards. The change that we wish to see, that we’re trying to create in this world, has to be about addressing and challenging power. If our conversations, if our work, if our lives don’t challenge the systems of power, then we’re not really working towards the just society that we want. We have to reimagine our relationships to the greater world, to the land and to the ecosystem in which we live. That’s a very strong indigenous framework: if you innately believe that the Earth is your mother and the animals and plants around you are brothers and sisters, then you have a responsibility to care for them in a different manner than if you just see them as natural resources to be managed. Yang Porter, 24, is a campaigner for women’s rights in Saudi Arabia It was against the law for women to drive in Saudi Arabia, but in the early 2010s there was a Facebook campaign calling on Saudi women to go out and drive at a certain time, and a few women responded and went out and drove cars together. Many of them were put in jail and made to sign documents saying they would not drive again. When the new crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, came to power, he decided it was time to give women the right to drive [in May 2018], but the authorities cracked down on the women who had protested before and jailed them again. I’m speaking on behalf of these women. I haven’t suffered the consequences personally but I’ve seen them suffer the consequences, and that’s really what’s moving me now to make these efforts to expose what’s happening. Women’s freedom has a long way to go in Saudi Arabia; women can now drive, but still need permission from their male guardians to travel and to marry. I want to make people aware that there is still a human rights crisis going on there. What protest is happening now in Saudi Arabia is down to the scattered efforts of individuals. People are too afraid to act collectively. I can’t really think of a Saudi collective group that has achieved anything in the last 100 years. We’re not really familiar with collective effort, but it’s possible, if this situation gets worse, that it might happen. I really hope it does. Demanding rights comes at a price. Everyone who has spoken out has suffered consequences. People reap the benefits from the accumulated efforts of others. That’s how the history machine works, with individual sacrifice as its engine. Ancient civilisations used to believe that human sacrifices were necessary for their society to survive and prosper; this principle still applies. The only thing that has changed is that people now are willing to pay the price – to give up themselves, their lives and their time for a prosperous future for the collective. It’s how you make the world a better place: sacrifice. Agnes Chow, 22, is a Hong Kong pro‑democracy campaigner for Demosistō I started getting involved in social movements in Hong Kong in 2012, when I was 15. I was just an ordinary schoolgirl focusing on my studies and working hard to enter university, but one day I discovered the Facebook page of Scholarism [Hong Kong’s student pro-democracy movement] and saw a picture of a group of students, including Joshua Wong, out on the streets voicing their opposition to the “patriotic” national education curriculum at that time. So I did some research and decided to join them. My current organisation, Demosistō, which grew out of Scholarism, is no longer a political party as we were disqualified from the elections, but I would say there is a big difference between fighting for change through elections and through social movements. Social movements, including protest, are a direct way to get involved and to change people’s minds. People might have thought the “umbrella movement” in 2014 was a violent way to show your anger to the government but it turned out to be very peaceful, even though we occupied many of the main roads in Hong Kong. So it is not only a way for people to voice their opinions, it’s also a channel for changing people’s minds. Many thought that Hong Kong people were just concerned with how to earn more money and live in bigger apartments, but people are also very concerned about our human rights, our freedom, our political system. And some of them, like Joshua, have even sacrificed their personal freedom. They want to use their sacrifice to fight for something better for the city. It is very important not to give up. After the umbrella movement, a lot of people have maybe given up their dream that Hong Kong should have a democratic political system, because nothing changed. But when we look at the history of social change in other areas – such as gender or race equality – we see how people have needed to fight for 20 or 30 or even 100 years. I’m 22 years old; perhaps I’ll have to fight for Hong Kong’s democracy until I’m 70. Many people in other countries have sacrificed much more than us: their lives, years of personal freedom, so I don’t think I have done a lot for Hong Kong, yet. Dan Wilson Craw, 35, lives in Newcastle. He is a housing activist and director of Generation Rent I worked in London during my 20s and I found that housing seemed to be a completely insurmountable problem for members of my generation, who were sold this idea that if you work hard, you shouldn’t need to worry about your housing. That was not happening, and I realised we could be doing something about this. Over the past five years we’ve been a national body getting private renters heard in the policy-making process and urging for reform of the housing system. We have recently been part of campaigns to scrap Section 21 and end unfair evictions, and to get letting fees banned. We’ve picketed branches of NatWest bank, which was revealed to be effectively preventing landlords from letting to tenants on low incomes. We’ve also been involved in wider protests of the housing movement, such as the 2015 March for Homes, and marches and demonstrations since the Grenfell Tower fire tragedy. There were a lot of vested interests in the property industry trying to resist all this, but there was a lot of anger out there from renters. Equally important was the fact that we had credible alternatives we could point to: places such as Germany and Scotland that had already been implementing these reforms, and being able to demonstrate there is no reason why we should have such an unfair system. It was about having those convictions and making sure we stuck by them. The reason I’m a housing activist is because I know just how much of a difference having a stable home makes to people’s quality of life. One of the words that keeps coming up when I talk to others in the movement is “autonomy” – just having that ability to be in control of your life. Private renting doesn’t offer that at the moment. That has a knock-on effect on your health because if your landlord can bully you into not complaining about things, you end up with an unsafe home. The threat of eviction hanging over you affects your mental health as well. So fixing the housing system can help all of those things. Saida Dahir, 18, went to the US as a refugee from Somalia, aged three. She gave a spoken word performance at a March for Our Lives protest in Salt Lake City, Utah The day of the shooting in Parkland, Florida, I was very distraught. I’ve written poetry since I was about seven years old, about things that I want to see change in the world, things happening around me, in my family, on the news or in my community. So I wrote a poem that day, and then 15 months later [in March 2018] I helped organise the March for Our Lives in my town, Salt Lake City, and I read that poem in front of the crowd as a tribute. I started doing activism when I was around 12 years old. The first protest I ever went to was a Free Palestine protest in downtown Salt Lake City. It was very liberating to see so many people moving towards something they wanted to achieve as a collective. From there I got really involved with Black Lives Matter. I was a representative for my chapter and I held a bunch of different protests for prominent black men shot and killed by the police. I’ve always been ready to speak up about things that I think need changing, things I think are crucial to our society and are not progressing us in the direction of unity. In the beginning it was very scary being a part of the March for Our Lives organisation. There was a lot of hostility and lack of understanding between the two sides. Before we held our 2018 march, there was a “March Before Our Lives” that was all about pro-gun people. The Utah Gun Exchange had flyers and posters, and they were very aggressive towards us kids who were just speaking up for ourselves. But when we started doing things like town hall meetings and community dialogues, that really opened up the conversation. People saw that the stereotypes of activists all over the news and social media were not true, and they were willing to have a conversation about things that needed to change. There are still so many things that need to be fixed around gun control, but we can make the world a better place by educating ourselves. And teaching our children. Our generation has moved and pushed so much that the next generation’s going to do tenfold what we are doing. Neha Shah, 21, is the former chair of Oxford Student Union’s Campaign for Racial Awareness and Equality I come from a politically engaged family and I’ve been quite heavily involved in refugee solidarity work, anti-deportations activism, Palestine solidarity and anti-fascist activism. When I first came to Oxford University I got involved in the Rhodes Must Fall protest movement. While the campaign was portrayed in the media as being about individual racist colonialists, it was really about something much bigger: effecting structural change. It exposed how the active legacies of British colonialism form an integral part of both British national and university policies, and render so many members of black and migrant communities invisible. I’m currently involved in a coalition of student and city groups seeking to boycott the Oxford Union, which hosts openly fascist and racist speakers in order to essentially amuse their elite membership. This has become remarkably worse recently, as the global far right has been rising. The founder of the English Defence League, Tommy Robinson, spoke there in 2014; Alice Weidel, leader of the German AfD party, was invited but pulled out after massive opposition from students and residents. In November 2018 the former Trump adviser and co-founder of Breitbart Steve Bannon spoke, and during the 1,000-strong protest against this, neo-Nazis were filmed performing Hitler salutes outside the Oxford Union, emboldened by Bannon’s words. The same people physically attacked me and another student protester – I was not badly hurt. The dominant narrative in the media is about “no platforming” but it’s not that at all; it’s about doing our bit to try and stop the rise of the far right. We have to open the road behind us. That involves learning from the history of those who have struggled for freedom in the past. If you look at these movements in a narrow and defeatist way, you might come to the conclusion that they failed, because the basic power relations that they sought to change – be they colonialism, imperialism, patriarchy, capitalism – remain in place. But in these different visions of freedom, every new generation and every new activist can find the lessons and the inspiration to keep struggling • Interviews by Steve Rose."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German media report that only a totally lame climate treaty compromise was reached in Doha: Kyoto I will be extended until 2020.

Sun sets on Doha. Minimal compromise reached. Source: www.cop18.qa
For those calling for rapid reductions in CO2 emissions, the result in Doha can only be described as an utter disaster. The Doha agreement will do absolutely nothing to curb CO2 growth, let alone cut net CO2 emissions.
One reason is that few countries are left taking part. Online FOCUS magazine reports only a few countries have signed on to extending Kyoto I, which FOCUS calls a “minimal compromise”. Only 37 of 194 countries signed on. That means the treaty is internationally non-binding.
The only thing that is certain is that there are going to be many more climate junkets in the future, wasting more taxpayer money.
The left wing TAZ reports that these 37 countries are “responsible for about 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions. And it still remains open how high the planned reductions will be.” Those that signed on to make reductions couldn’t even tell us how much.
The conservative FAZ  reports on financial assistance to developing countries: “…there were lots of declarations of intent – and voluntary commitments from a few European countries.” But nothing binding here either.

The green activist Die Zeit also comments on aid to developing countries, writing: “there were only vague promises in the agreement. Indeed it says that ‘beginning in 2020 at least 100 billion dollars a year will flow from public, private and other sources’. But there is no agreement on where the money will come from or how much will be made available in the years leading up to 2020.” Here, too, lots of empty promises.
Finally Spiegel writes that USA has never signed the treaty and that Canada has dropped out. Spiegel didn’t even bother putting the news of the Doha result on its online front page.
If you’re among those who are very serious about curbing CO2, then this agreement can be considered only one thing: PATHETIC!
But if you think the whole CO2 issue is nothing but a huge scam, then you can breath out yet another sigh of relief. Saved again from another dumb treaty. Better yet, it is becoming increasingly clear that most of the planet no longer takes the issue seriously – a mindset that will only increase as time goes by.
Other reactions:
Friends of the Earth on BBC: “It’s an empty deal.”
Klimaretter.de: “We are on the path to a 4°C world…Doha is a flop. […] International diplomacy still has not recovered from the disaster of the Copenhagen Summit 2009. […] It’s like the self-delusion of an alcoholic who says: Next week I’m going to quit drinking. But then every week he means next week.”

"Pension schemes should be supported for moving people’s money out of fossil fuels and into renewables because the financial risks from the climate crisis are “too important to ignore”, a government minister will say on Monday. The pensions minister, Guy Opperman, is due to tell a conference that pension and investment managers must “do the right thing” and take their environmental and social responsibilities seriously to help combat the climate emergency. During the last few years a number of pension schemes have taken action to protect their members from the risks associated with climate breakdown by reducing their exposure to companies with reserves of coal, oil and gas. Some have pulled all of their funds out of these companies, while others have chosen to apply a positive “tilt” that increases support for businesses identified as vital to combating the climate crisis, such as those working on renewable energy, while at the same time reducing investment in firms that are heavy carbon emitters, have fossil fuel reserves or are not making the sorts of changes needed to meet emission reduction targets. In April, the Guardian revealed that parliament’s pension fund trustees were to reconsider the rules of their investments to take account of the risks posed by the climate emergency. Meanwhile, rules taking effect in October will require UK pension fund trustees to set out how they take account of “financially material considerations, including … climate change”. Ministers have previously stated that it was government policy not to direct the investment decisions or strategies of pension scheme trustees. However, Opperman is due to tell an Association of British Insurers conference on long-term saving: “The financial risks from climate change are too important to ignore.” He will also say: “Many pension schemes are doing the right thing by tilting portfolios towards renewables or away from fossil fuels and by engaging much more forcefully with investment firms who fail to take environmental and social issues seriously.” The minister will welcome the “excellent work” done by many schemes in this area but will underline more can be achieved: “Pension schemes can identify investment opportunities which will make market-beating returns for members as we move to a low-carbon economy. “They ought to be thinking about the assets which help drive new investment in important sectors of the economy: smaller and medium firms, housing, green energy projects and other infrastructure which deliver the sustainable employment, communities and environments which all of us wish to enjoy.”"
"I’m surprised I can still be shocked at the incompetence and shortsightedness of this government. But then along comes the chancellor, Philip Hammond, expressing his inane and irresponsible view that we can’t afford to tackle the climate crisis. He has warned that Theresa May’s distant target of 2050 to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions will cost the UK over £1tn and starve schools, police and hospitals of funds, while making the UK “economically uncompetitive”. I’m inclined to respond: it’s not the economy, stupid. It’s the science; it’s literally a matter of life and death. This is a planetary emergency which requires us to look well beyond the business-as-usual approach of the past 100 years – and think outside of the box.  And the public seems to agree. A recent poll shows that concerns over the climate crisis and the collapse of wildlife rank above concerns about the economy. It is, of course, Greta Thunberg’s generation that will be most affected by climate breakdown rather than Hammond’s. One can only wonder where the chancellor was when the now world-famous teenage climate activist addressed parliament and told MPs that the UK’s response to climate change was “beyond absurd”. Hammond really should spend some time with the climate strikers who refuse to go to school on the basis that, unless people like him invest in the policies we need to reduce carbon emissions, they have no future to be educated for. Even so, I am sure he must have noticed the now ubiquitous placard on such marches saying that “If the planet were a bank they would have saved it by now”. As for the idea that reducing our carbon emissions will starve schools, police and hospitals of funds, Hammond’s government have managed to do that effectively enough already through ideologically driven austerity. It’s been clear ever since the Stern review that the benefits of strong action on the climate emergency far outweigh the costs of not acting – and that investing in policies to reduce carbon emissions are the most cost-effective policies that governments can adopt. And, since the cost of dealing with the impacts of the climate crisis, as well as reducing its potential severity, increase every year, the sooner we invest, the bigger the return. Conversely, the longer we leave it the more likely that costs will increase through extreme climatic events such as severe floods and droughts, mass migration and social breakdown. This is why when it comes to the economics of climate change, Greens believe the way forward is the Green New Deal. This programme will create high skilled, well-paid jobs and improve welfare while addressing the climate emergency. For example, a huge national home insulation programme would create jobs in every community across the country, reduce fuel bills and stop old people dying in cold homes. Investing in cycle lanes and other active travel infrastructure in our cities would also create thousands of jobs and cut the costs of ill health by encouraging people to be more active. Up to now, the climate crisis negotiating strategy has started from the status quo, revolving around incremental, percentage reductions in emissions or increases in renewables. This approach has failed and every year we stick to this approach we reduce our ability to effectively address the climate emergency. But Thunberg, the school strikes and Extinction Rebellion have entirely transformed the framing of this debate. They are right to say that the starting point is what the science tells us must be done to prevent the destruction of human civilisation. What is existentially necessary must be made politically possible. Within this frame, Hammond’s argument that we cannot afford to save ourselves comes across as exactly what it is: crass, ignorant and immoral. It simply makes no sense to allow something you can control – money – to be a limit on your ambition to deal with something that your future existence depends on, like the climate crisis. If an enemy army was assembling on the French coast, money would be found to bolster our defences, which is why climate activists say we should treat the climate emergency as if it were a war. Our very existence is at stake. • Molly Scott Cato is the Green MEP for the South West of England"

Share this...FacebookTwitterCan we trust the media?
Germany’s massive public funded radio and television demonstrates to us that the answer is: not always. Yesterday many media outlets reported on the 2-year anniversary of Japan’s “earthquake/tsunami/Fukushima” disaster. The way some German public television and radio outlets are presenting the disaster 2 years later would probably make even North Korean state media officials blush.
For example, (hat-tip EIKE) flagship German public television ARD presented the story yesterday, claiming:
Japan remembers the victims of the devastating earthquake and tsunami catastrophe of 2 years ago. A scale 9 earthquake had shaken the northeast of the country and caused a tsunami. This caused a reactor accident at the Fukushima nuclear power plant. Almost 16,000 people died. Thousands are still missing.”
I heard the very same deception earlier yesterday morning on German public NDR DisInfo radio. The reality, of course, is that so far not a single death has been attributed to the Fukushima accident. But that’s the last thing Germany’s manipulative public media want their audiences to believe.

“Good morning ladies and gentlemen. Today Japan is remembering the victims of the devastating earthquake and tsunami catastrophe of two years ago. A powerful earthquake of 9 had shaken the northeast part of the country and unleashed an up to 20-meter tsunami. A reactor accident resulted at the Fukushima nuclear power plant. Thereby 16,000 people were killed. Thousands are still missing.”
Even bolder and misleading about it was anchor Thorsten Schröder (see video and quote above) of the ARD Tagesschau, early yesterday morning.
In a functioning democracy, a good public media editor would make sure that the facts are presented clearly and accurately. But a slimey, manipulative editor might take the chance to intentionally mislead the people, and later defend his action by saying: well, you can’t prove it! and that “there is no reason to be talking about a blatantly false report or the like“.
German reporting by ARD and ZDF public television and radio on climate change is no less manipulative. Climate change is real and is happening right now. Never mind the all the cold winters we’ve been having, they keep telling us, ignoring the real data.
Germany’s green public media have long been on a mission to upbring citizens on responsible energy use, climate, and environmentalism. So we suspect here they just couldn’t pass up the opportunity to remind viewers and listeners that nuclear is bad and kills thousands.
Germany’s now famous Energiewende – energy transition from fossil and nuclear energy to renewables – is coming under increasing fire from the public due to its trillion-euro and still rising price tag, and the media are desperate for a story to convince the public that it is still “the right thing to do”. Fukushima was an opportunity to help do just that.

"The number of Swedes taking the train for domestic journeys has risen as plane journeys inside the country have fallen, reflecting rapidly growing public concern about the climate crisis. “Flygskam”, or flight shame, the feeling of being embarrassed or ashamed to take the plane because of the environmental impact, has become a social media buzzword along with the hashtag #jagstannarpåmarken, which translates as #stayontheground.  Echoing the schoolgirl climate activist Greta Thunberg’s refusal to fly because of the harm to the environment, a survey published last week by Swedish Railways (SJ) found 37% of respondents chose to travel by rail instead of air, compared with 26% last autumn and 20% in early 2018. SJ said the shift was evident in its passenger numbers: the total number of journeys on its network rose by 5% last year to 31.8m, but then by a further 8% in the first quarter of this year, with business trips surging 12%. The trend was also apparent in recent figures from Swedavia, which operates Sweden’s 10 busiest airports. The company said domestic passenger numbers fell by 8% from January to April, following a 3% fall in the whole of 2018. For the first time, climate impact tops travellers’ reasons for choosing the train. “Rail travel is soaring thanks to climate fears,” said an SJ spokesman, Tobbe Lundell, adding that the operator was boosting capacity, particularly on longer routes such as between Stockholm, Malmö and Gothenburg. According to SJ, a single flight between Sweden’s two biggest cities, Stockholm and Gothenburg, generates as much CO2 as 40,000 train journeys – a fact that has plainly struck a chord with Swedes, previously a nation of frequent flyers that last year experienced a record heatwave and wildfires in the Arctic. According to a report commissioned by the Swedish environmental protection agency, in 2017 the country’s aviation sector was responsible for producing 1.1 tonnes of emissions per head of the population, five times more than the global average. But while Swedish tour operators are starting to offer inclusive trips abroad by train, it may take some time for climate concerns to influence most Swedes’ foreign travel plans. Rail trips abroad from Sweden can be long: the average flight from Stockholm to Paris is two hours 35 minutes; the same journey by train can take 24 hours."
"Prince Charles spent 75 minutes longer than scheduled trying to convince Donald Trump of the dangers of global heating, but the president still insisted the US was “clean” and blamed other nations for the crisis. Trump told ITV’s Good Morning Britain on Wednesday he had been due to meet the Prince of Wales for 15 minutes during his state visit, but the discussion went on for 90 minutes – during which the prince did “most of the talking”. Trump said: “He is really into climate change and I think that’s great. What he really wants and what he really feels warmly about is the future. He wants to make sure future generations have climate that is good climate, as opposed to a disaster, and I agree.” But Trump said he pushed back at the suggestion the US should do more. He said: “I did say, ‘Well, the United States right now has among the cleanest climates there are based on all statistics.’ And it’s even getting better because I agree with that we want the best water, the cleanest water. It’s crystal clean, has to be crystal clean clear.” Trump added: “China, India, Russia, many other nations, they have not very good air, not very good water, and the sense of pollution. If you go to certain cities … you can’t even breathe, and now that air is going up … They don’t do the responsibility.” Does the US President believe in climate change?Trump says he discussed climate change with Prince Charles, who he believes is 'a very good person' who 'wants to have a world that's good for future generations'. pic.twitter.com/QNlXhiS1mO Asked by Piers Morgan if he accepted the science on climate change, Trump said: “I believe there’s a change in weather, and I think it changes both ways. Don’t forget, it used to be called global warming, that wasn’t working, then it was called climate change. Now it’s actually called extreme weather, because with extreme weather you can’t miss.” Morgan did not ask Trump about his decision to withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement. And Trump swerved a question about whether the Prince of Wales had persuaded him to move his stance on the climate crisis. “I’ll tell you what moved me is his passion for future generations,” Trump said. During the interview – Trump’s third with Morgan since his inauguration – the president said he had not called the Duchess of Sussex “nasty” in an interview with the Sun before his visit. But he added: “What she said was nasty based on what they told me.” Trump also appeared to backtrack on his earlier claim that the NHS was “on the table” in a post-Brexit trade deal, telling Morgan he did not see the cherished institution as “part of trade”. “I don’t see it being on the table. Somebody asked me a question today and I said everything’s up for negotiation because everything is, but I don’t see it being on the table. That’s something I wouldn’t consider part of trade, that’s not trade,” he said. On Tuesday, the president sparked uproar after telling reporters at a press conference alongside Theresa May that US companies should have market access to every sector of the British economy as part of any post-Brexit trade deal, including the NHS. Trump’s statement drew immediate condemnation from several Conservative leadership hopefuls as well as senior Labour politicians. There are widespread concerns in the UK about US firms promising to provide cost-cutting health services and wanting to sell food produced to lower environmental and animal welfare standards, such as chlorine-washed chicken. In his interview, Trump also softened his stance towards Jeremy Corbyn after telling Tuesday’s press conference he had rejected a request to meet the Labour leader, whom he called a “negative force”. Trump said a future meeting with Corbyn was “always possible”. He said: “He wanted to meet. It was very tough to meet and probably inappropriate to meet, to be honest with you.” And Trump said the chance of Corbyn winning the next election was a “long shot”. Trump also gave some further views on the Conservative leadership candidates, repeating that he did not know Michael Gove despite the fact Gove interviewed Trump for the Times in 2017. He said: “I don’t know him. I met him last night at the dinner for the first time. I thought he was very good. You have a lot of good people running. I was saying to the Queen last night, the choice of your next prime minister is very important.” He went on to lavish more praise on Boris Johnson, whom he has previously described as a friend, and Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, who has reportedly become close to Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner. He said of Johnson: “I do think he’s a good person. I think it’s going to be a very interesting … But they’re good people. They’re good people, and Jeremy’s very good. I’ve gotten to know Jeremy.”"

===============================
Extreme weather & superstition
Superstorm Sandy. Parching drought across North America. A scorching midsummer heat wave in the Midwest. All these weather extremes are telltale signs that CO2 causes climate change, according to global warmists.
Indeed, the global climate-change nomenklatura gathered last week in Doha, Qatar eagerly (if grimly) cited Typhoon Bopha, which had just wreaked carnage in the Philippines, as the latest proof.
But it’s not. The link between extreme weather and global warming has as much scientific basis as the pagan rite of human sacrifice to ensure a good harvest.

“The field is corrupt, without any question. I would say most scientists don’t believe this and didn’t believe it 20 years ago. But the young scientists know they have trouble if they say it, and so they don’t.”
Nothing has changed in 3 years. Still corrupt as hell.

"On a vast stretch of lawn beneath the Eiffel tower, a paint-splattered figure in a baseball cap is kneeling down, carefully planting small wooden stakes into the grass, checking each is aligned with a tape-measure. It’s an odd sight in the park beneath Paris’s main tourist attraction, but in the morning rush, few people pause to wonder what he is doing. They simply continue trampling over the grass, or let their dogs bound over it. “I’m used to all kinds of hazards to my work,” shrugs the artist Saype. “If it’s not the weather, it’s cows walking over it, or moles popping up, and here it’s dogs. I take it as a lesson in humility.”  Saype — real-name Guillaume Legros — is one of France’s newest street art sensations, a rural graffiti artist who, instead of working in urban settings, creates his own brand of land art: massive biodegradable paintings on enormous stretches of grass on mountainsides. Where land art was traditionally about building epic works from rocks and natural materials on the ground or mowing and carving shapes into the landscape, Saype instead spray-paints ultra-realist, street-art images of local people on to the grass itself. His scale is gigantic – covering huge swathes of fields and mountains using his own recipe of homemade biodegradable paint. From a woman’s face on fields in the French Alps to a giant grandad in braces on a Swiss mountainside or a child in a Russian clearing, his works are visible from the air — a new artform for the era of drones — and don’t last long, soon disappearing again into the landscape. But now Saype is returning to cities, transforming parks into huge portraits visible from the sky that comment on the climate emergency or the refugee crisis. The 30-year-old is the first artist ever allowed to take over the hallowed Champs de Mars lawns under the Eiffel Tower. His vast new project, Beyond Walls, will see him spray-paint a series of interlocked hands across the lawns here this month, stretching over hundreds of square metres. They will make little sense close up on the ground, but will be visible from the top of the tower. To him, it’s a “human chain” and “a symbol of togetherness at a time when people are more and more turning in on themselves”. He will paint similar images of hands and arms clinging to each other in cities across the world over the next three years, aiming for locations from Nairobi to Belfast. For him it’s about “living together”, moving beyond borders and remembering history. His great-grandparents, French Resistance fighters in rural eastern France during the second world war, died after they were deported. “Right now, it seems like we’ve all got short memories, that we’re living in a kind of negative, prewar atmosphere with economic crisis and people putting up barriers,” he says. Beyond Walls is also the first time he has ever worked on a project with a newspaper. He has produced three images of interlaced hands which will be printed from this Saturday on the Guardian’s new biodegradable, potato starch wraps that package the weekend print supplements. Saype sees the groundbreaking eco-friendly packaging as a way to bring his images “from the mountainside into people’s homes”. If his transitory art on grass is destined ultimately to fade away, he liked the notion of making art that would be composted into oblivion in Guardian readers’ bins. “I love the idea that nothing is left of it,” he smiles. “And what really interests me is how people will interact with it – how will they rip open this bag? I find that act really symbolically interesting. The art will be on the compost heap, but the image will stay in the mind.” The images themselves carry their own mystery. The hands gripping each other could be an act of rescue, survival or friendship. The work comes from photographs he has taken, but exactly whose hands are pictured we will never know. Saype deliberately chose not to know himself. His inspiration was the humanitarian group, SOS Méditerranée, and their rescue work pulling people in distress from the Mediterranean, the world’s most deadly migration route. Last year, in central Geneva Saype created a vast grass fresco of a girl with her hand outstretched towards a paper boat on the lake in support of their rescue work. For Beyond Walls, he set up a camera at an SOS Méditerannée gala night and took pictures of anyone who would have their arms and hands photographed. Among them were rescue workers, sailors, refugees themselves – many who had survived the crossing from Libya – but also politicians and footballers as well as the fashion designer Agnès B. He took around 2,000 photos – cut off at the elbow – and selected a few without knowing who they were. “Hands always tell a story, you have tattoos, bracelets, the hands of those who have done manual labour and those who have not,” he says. “Each of these hands will tell a story but we won’t know where from.” Many European street-artists grew up on housing estates in the hinterlands of capital cities, including Saype’s heroes: the acclaimed Paris photographer JR, who pastes monumental images on building across the world and the celebrated Portuguese artist Vhils, who uses hammers and drills to carve vast faces into walls. But unlike them, Saype comes from a tiny village in eastern France and worked for years as a nurse. His spray-paint art in fields with cows deliberately conveys a rural innocence. Saype grew up in Évette-Salbert, near the Swiss border. His mother operated x-ray equipment at a hospital, his father worked in IT. “I never went to a museum or a single exhibition as a child,” he says. He started graffiting and spray-painting aged 13 “as a kind of adrenalin kick and a way of existing in society”. Countryside graffiti didn’t always have obvious locations. “At the start, all there was was the wall of a tennis court or an abandoned house.” Gradually he moved to graffitiing the nearest town, “under bridges or trains”. At 18, he was sitting in the back of his high-school philosophy class doodling the letter-shapes he most like to graffiti. He realised those letters made the English word “say” and added the first two letters of “peace”. That word, Saype, became his nom de guerre. Soon he progressed to ultra-realist portraits, travelling to Paris to photograph people on the Métro and then painting them in black and white. For years he combined street art with full-time work as a nurse. He says a nurse’s “daily confrontation with human suffering, ageing and illness” pushed him to keep painting people. Until now, in his land art he has painted either young children or the elderly, the elderly “because normally you don’t see that in street art.” He shifted gradually from urban walls to spray-painting country landscapes. “I felt urban art had lost some of its meaning — there was so much visual pollution in cities that no one really saw graffiti any more,” Saype says. “So I wanted to find another way to get people’s attention.” It was also about the climate emergency. “I’d read a scientific article saying that if we didn’t drastically change our approach to nature before 2020 we’d reach a point of no return in terms of climate, and here we are now,” he adds. But it was also because drones had become available to the public, opening up view points from above. “You could have another view of the world very easily.” It was crucial that his paint on grass left no negative impact. Saype spent a year experimenting in his parents’ garden making biodegradable paints, first cooking up a kind of flour and water paste, which would both stick to the grass and prove briefly waterproof. Currently he uses a recipe of chalk for white, charcoal for black mixed with casein milk protein and pigments, while he searches for a totally plant-based option. His works, aided by two schoolfriends from his village, as well as SOS Méditerranée volunteers for the Paris project, are massive logistical operations. Designed to be seen from a distance, the work can barely be made out close-up, hence the need for wooden markers. “When I paint, I can’t see what I’m doing. It’s very philosophical – if you’re emotionally too close to something, you see nothing. It’s only when you step back that reality hits you.” The Paris project will take over 1,300 litres of paint, weeks of work and yet he estimates that once it is unveiled on 15 June, it will only last two days after people walk all over it. That’s all part of the “artistic performance” as he calls it. “I always set out to have an impact on people’s minds and memories, without leaving much of a trace. For people to reappropriate my work by walking all over it, that’s no problem to me. I paint on something impermanent, which is constantly changing,” he says. “I paint, I come back the next day and it’s different. People say it’s ephemeral, short-lived. But that’s my point – isn’t everything?” Saype’s Beyond Walls project opens at the Champs de Mars, Paris, on 15 June. His work will be printed on bags holding the Guardian on 8, 15 and 22 June. "

By Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt and Dr. Sebastian Lüning
(Translated with permission by P Gosselin)
The geological factual basis is clear: Fluctuations in solar activity significantly influenced the development of the climate throughout the history of the Earth.
 

Figure 1: Solar activity (red) in sync with the North Pole-equator temperature gradient (blue). Chart from Soon and Legates 2013.
Today’s IPCC is clueless. With its simplistic approach, the IPCC is not able to reproduce the documented climate fluctuations of the past. The gross fundamental errors aren’t of any help at all for the most powerful computers. In the search for additional links in the sun-climate-impact, Willie Soon of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and David Legates of the College of Earth, Ocean, and Environment at the University of Delaware came across an exciting relationship. In a mutual study that appeared in the February 2013 Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics, the scientists were able to show a relationship between solar activity fluctuations and the temperature gradient between the North Pole and the equator over a timescale of multiple decades.
This means that the craft of modelling has got lots of homework to do. Up to now the models have not been able to simulate this effect. Now they are forced to check over, sort out, supplement, and improve their formulas. It’s back to the drawing board!

"A report by experts from 27 national science academies has set out the widespread damage global heating is already causing to people’s health and the increasingly serious impacts expected in future. Scorching heatwaves and floods will claim more victims as extreme weather increases but there are serious indirect effects too, from spreading mosquito-borne diseases to worsening mental health.  “There are impacts occurring now [and], over the coming century, climate change has to be ranked as one of the most serious threats to health,” said Prof Sir Andrew Haines, a co-chair of the report for the European Academies’ Science Advisory Council (Easac). However, there were also great benefits from action to cut carbon emissions, the report found, most notably cutting the 350,000 early deaths from air pollution every year in Europe caused by burning fossil fuels. “The economic benefits of action to address the current and prospective health effects of climate change are likely to be substantial,” the report concluded. The World Health Organization director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, warned in November that climate breakdown was already a health crisis. “We cannot delay action on climate change,” he said. “We cannot sleepwalk through this health emergency any longer.” In December, a WHO report said tackling the climate crisis would save at least a million lives a year, making it a moral imperative to act. The new Easeac report, The Imperative of Climate Action to Protect Human Health in Europe, assessed the scientific evidence of the effects of global heating on health. Extreme weather such as heatwaves, floods and droughts have direct short-term impacts but also affect people in the longer term. “Mental health effects include post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, substance abuse and depression,” the report said. The scientists were also concerned by the effect of extreme weather on food production, with studies showing a 5-25% cut in staple crop yields across the Mediterranean region in coming decades. But the report said even small cuts in meat eating could lead to significant cuts in carbon emissions, as well as benefits to health. The report anticipates the spread of infectious diseases in Europe as temperatures rise and increase the range of mosquitoes that transmit dengue fever and ticks that cause Lyme disease. Food poisoning could also rise, as salmonella bacteria thrived in warmer conditions, the report said. It even found research suggesting antibiotic resistance in E coli increases in hotter conditions. “We are exposing the whole of the world population to changes in climate, and this is clearly very concerning as we are moving to some extent into uncharted territory,” said Haines, professor of environmental change and public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “We are subjecting young people and future generations to these increasing [health] risks for many hundreds of years to come, if not millennia,” he said. “We have to try to minimise the effects and move towards a low-carbon economy. “We think reframing climate change as a health issue can help to engage the public because most people are not just concerned about their own health, but about the health of their nearest and dearest and their descendants. “We think this is a way of mobilising the public and raising concern in a constructive way and increasing the momentum for change.” Global carbon emissions are still rising but scientists say rapid and deep cuts are needed to limit temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels and avoid the worst impacts."

It’s official. Hans-Joachim (John) Schellnhuber is effectively Germany’s latest comic action hero. His mission: to save the planet from the villains causing catastrophic global warming. Hat-tip: www.kaltesonne.de/.
Publishers Jacoby & Stuart, in cooperation with the German Ministry for Education and Research, headed by Dr. Annette Schavan (who is currently being stripped of her doctorate title because of plagiarism) will be releasing a 140-page comic book titled: “The Great Transformation – Environment – This Is How We Take The Curve”.
The book is targeted at children 14 years old and up, and can be pre-ordered at Amazon.de here. Here’s Amazon’s short description:
Top-class science in an easy to understand way! Climate change can not be denied any longer, and if our society is to still function in 50 years, then we have to learn sustainable and living and working. To do this, science, politics, and citizens have to learn to work together. A council of high-ranking scientists advises policymakers on how to do this. And in order for us to be involved, our book presents the scientific core principles in comic form in an easy-to-understand manner. With regards to climate change, species extinctions and shortage of natural resources, the view that we are no longer able to simply continue living as we are is become clear. We have to drastically reduce our consumption of fossil fuels and learn to do business sustainably. How this can be done is shown by nine independent scientists who make up the German government’s German Advisory Council on Global Change (WBGU). In the form of comic interviews with each of them, it is depicted what is fact and what needs to be done. Geoscience, climate science, business and technology, politics and everyday culture must work with each other in order to achieve the essential Great Transformation.”
The book features the nine catastrophe-obsessed Germans sitting on the WBGU, which is calling for the Great Transformation of our society, as the planet saving heroes.
Yes, it seems they’ve gone absolutely bloody mad. Nine hand-wringing German academics are sure and convinced of what the rest of the world needs. And the government is actually stupid (dangerous) enough to believe them.
Excerpts of the book can be seen here in German. For example, on page 14, high-priest Schellnhuber tells readers what’s causing the global warming: agriculture and fossil fuels:

 
Page 15 depicts Schellnhuber standing at the PIK (Einstein’s Tower), where he works, telling us:
Many areas of the environment are already showing crisis developments. Soil and fresh water resources, forests and seas are being overused or destroyed. Biological diversity is dwindling dramatically.”

Page 19 shows Schellnhuber telling us that the temperature must not rise more than 2°C. President Obama is on the phone saying:
I’m really worried that we haven’t made the international progress that is necessary.”
Squandering your first four years didn’t help.
The next frame shows patient earth in bed with a fever. Dr. Schellnhuber says:
As a comparison when your body temperature rises just 2°C, the we are talking about a fever. When the temperature climbs over 40°C (104°F), then the organs fail one after the other, and eventually the entire human body collapses.”

Page 20 depicts Schellnhuber comparing our current course with that of the Titanic, and thus it is absolutely necessary to decarbonize while there’s still a chance.
And so go the book’s 140 pages. It probably would be funny were it not to be read and believed by Germany’s children. It’s a meisterwerk of propaganda, aimed at shaping the the minds of children.
This is not a cynical joke written solely by some fringe scientists – rather it was written in cooperation with the German federal government. The book is totally absent of any balance.
It will be officially presented by the WBGU, which in the book portrays itself as the redeemers of the planet, on March 1st.
I’d have to buy the book to find out more about who the rest of the bad guys are. So far the available excerpts show the fossil fuel industry, their customers and agriculture as the villains.

The alarmists at the German Potsdam Climate Institute now claim global warming leads to colder and snowier winters, which lead to accelerated ice melt in Antarctica. In their latest blog article, Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt say this is like claiming eating more makes you lose weight.
===================================================
New PIK logic from Potsdam: Heavier snowfalls causing glacier shrinkage (and when you eat more, you lose weight
Ricarda Winkelmann is standing on the ice, blond hair in the wind, the German Polarstern ice-breaking research vessel is clearly visible in the background. She’s beaming because she has finally arrived on the 7th continent, which holds a multitude of secrets. Her red parka keeps her warm and protects her. Luckily there are no polar bears here, and so there is no danger to the penguins.
That’s how one could interpret the attractive photo that the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) included with its press release of 12 December 2012. The title: More ice loss through snowfall on Antarctica.  This is how the fight against climate change gets a nice look, and is fresh wind for the PIK climate machinery.
Let’s look more closely at the title: “More ice loss through snowfall on Antarctica“. Now the ice in Antarctica is suppsedly melting faster than ever. The blame for this is heavier snowfall? How intersting. But that just doesn’t seem very logical. Didn’t we learn at school that glaciers grow when it snows more? And when it snows less, then they shrink. Now suddenly this is supposed to no longer apply? Very peculiar. That’s like saying global warming leads to colder winters.
Let’s look at the PIK press release:
Stronger snowfall increases future ice discharge from Antarctica. Global warming leads to more precipitation as warmer air holds more moisture – hence earlier research suggested the Antarctic ice sheet might grow under climate change. Now a study published in Nature shows that a lot of the ice gain due to increased snowfall is countered by an acceleration of ice-flow to the ocean. […] Between 30 and 65 percent of the ice gain due to enhanced snowfall in Antarctica is countervailed by enhanced ice loss along the coastline,” says lead-author Ricarda Winkelmann.”
There’s a lot in the lines above. These mysterious claims are repeated elsewhere in other words, which we now examine.
First they explain why it is going to snow more in Antarctica in the future, namely because the air will become more humid because of the warming. That sounds plausible enough. And then a rather unusual claim pops up: Are the previous studies showing that growth of the Antarctic ice sheet suddenly wrong? This is what their unfortunate formulation suggests.
The last sentence of that part, however, finally brings clarification: “30 and 65 percent of the ice gain due to enhanced snowfall in Antarctica is countervailed by enhanced ice loss along the coastline”. Conversely, that means that 70 to 35% remains and thus causes the Antarctic ice sheet to grow. And this Antarctic sheet growth directly contradicts what the title of the study suggests: “more ice loss”.

Here we get the impression that this was poorly formulated on purpose in order to mislead the reader. This is deceptive to the highest degree. A correct title could have been, for example: “Antarctic ice sheet will continue to grow, but more slowly than previously expected.” Why wasn’t the title formulated clearly? Is the latest literature on the subject still not available in Potsdam? New ice measurements show that the Antarctic ice sheet is indeed growing (See our blog article “New ICEsat-Satellite data are in: Antarctic ice sheet has grown in mass“). Instead we read the following statement in the PIK press release, which completely misleads the layperson:
During the last decade, the Antarctic ice-sheet has lost volume at a rate comparable to that of Greenland.”
That has got to be a joke because it’s wrong from front to back.
In a recent study, Dutch scientists investigated the Antarctic ice sheet for the period 1979 – 2010. Here the entire value was examined for Western and Eastern Antarctica. The scientists were not able to find any significant trend. Ice mass as a whole hardly changed. The scientists led by Jan Lenaerts of the University of Utrecht published their results in the Geophysical Research Letters in February 2012. In Januar 2012 the Dutch team had already published a paper on melt in Antarctica for the period 1979-2010 in the Geophysical Research Letters. Here as well no trend was found.
So what could have possibly led to this deficient press release? What’s behind the poor formulation, omissions, and erroneous information?
Was it the irresistable urge to spread more fear about the climate danger? Could the fact that the study’s co-author Anders Levermannn is also a lead author on the sea level chapter in the next IPCC report also have something to do with it? Could it be that the study is a part of Ricarda Winkelmann’s doctoral thesis, which was supervised by Stefan Rahmstorf?
And let’s look to see if the German media bothered to take a close look at the press release. The Handelsblatt certainly did not (“Heavier snowfalls can lead to greater ice loss in Antarctica”). German prestige weekly Der Spiegel also chose a misleading title: (“Snowfall increases ice melt”).
And Die Welt was quite enraptured by the computer simulations that looked all the way to the year 2500. Unfortunately, however, the very same models could not even predict the global warming stop of the last 15 years.

"Claims by the energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, that Australia’s liquefied natural gas exports are reducing global emissions are “grossly exaggerated”, one of Australia’s most renowned climate scientists has said. Bill Hare, who has worked in climate science for 30 years, including on UN negotiations, has questioned Taylor’s statement that Australia’s LNG exports cut global emissions by up to 148m tonnes because they replace higher-emission alternatives such as coal. “Government claims that Australia’s LNG exports are reducing emissions globally are grossly exaggerated and, depending on the real level of methane leakages, reservoir CO2 venting and losses, and where the LNG is coming from in Australia, likely to be wrong,” Hare said. It is unclear what data the government has to support its claim, but it received advice on the 148m tonne figure from the department. Guardian Australia sought clarification from the Department of Environment and Energy, and received the following response: “The Department based the estimate on data for the year to December 2018 from the Department of Industry’s March 2019 Resources and Energy Quarterly; the Department of Environment and Energy’s Australian Energy Statistics - Guide to Australian Energy Statistic 2017 and factors from the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (Measurement) Determination 2008. “The Department compared the emissions that would be produced from the combustion of Australia’s LNG exports for the year to December 2018 against the emissions generated from the combustion of an equivalent amount of energy of black coal. “Under this comparison, the combustion of LNG exports would generate 197.1 Mt CO2-e, which is around 148 Mt CO2-e less than the emissions generated by the combustion of the same amount of energy of black coal (345.1 Mt CO2-e).” Taylor’s comments followed the delayed release of the government’s quarterly emissions data for December 2018, which show that Australia’s emissions continue to rise, driven in part by the country’s LNG industry. The minister defended the increase by saying that Australia’s exports were contributing to emissions reductions in countries that made use of Australia’s LNG in place of coal. “Australia’s total LNG exports have the potential to lower emissions in importing countries by around 148 Mt CO2-e in 2018 by displacing coal consumption in those countries,” he said in a statement. He repeated those remarks in an interview with the ABC’s RN Breakfast on Friday, saying there were “148m tonnes of lower emissions as a result of our exports”. “That is something to be proud of.” But Hare said any advantage LNG had over coal once it was burnt would be rapidly reduced if the emissions of methane – a much more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide – during production were higher than what was currently estimated. “Many experts believe that Australia is under-reporting methane losses from natural gas production, with only about 0.5% loss estimated, whereas the IEA [International Energy Agency’] estimates globally over 1%, and in other countries scientific work indicates losses of up to several per cent,” he said. “This matters because methane, the main gas in natural gas, is much more powerful than CO2, and so loss rates of a few per cent could annul any benefits from displacing coal in the power sector. “In Western Australia a number of the reservoirs have very high levels of CO2 in the gasfields, which, if emitted, reduces or eliminates the benefits of displacing coal with LNG.” The director of the Australia Institute’s climate and energy program, Richie Merzian, spent more than nine years as an Australian government climate negotiator to the UN. He said there was no clear evidence that Australia’s increasing LNG exports were reducing global emissions. “I’m not sure where he got those numbers,” Merzian said. “Take Japan, one of our major export recipients in terms of gas. It’s still in the process of shifting from nuclear post-Fukushima, so it’s therefore going from a low greenhouse gas emissions fuel source to a high one. “Furthermore, the increase in gas exports might lock in gas infrastructure that will make it even harder to transition away from fossil fuels, which is what the Paris agreement is calling for.” Merzian said if Australia was now trying to argue it should get credit for reducing emissions overseas, it should also take responsibility for fueling the climate crisis as the world’s largest exporter of coal. “Most countries are very clear about the delineation between domestic emissions and scope three – or emissions that take place overseas from exports,” he said. “That reflects the UN framework. By blurring the line, as Minister Taylor has done, he’s not only reshaping UN conventions, but he seems to be trying to champion the growth of natural gas exports.” A spokeswoman for Taylor repeated the government’s position that Australia would meet its emissions reduction target of 26% to 28% on 2005 levels by 2030. “We will do this while growing the economy, creating jobs, protecting our environment and keeping power prices down,” she said. "
"Almost halfway through 2019, it has felt, sometimes, like a breakthrough year for climate action. Given the rapid emergence of social movements across the world calling for climate justice, this often previously sidelined issue has become a international conversation. But the harsh reality of the challenge at hand re-emerged as the “leader of the free world” attempted to position the United States – one of the largest greenhouse gas emitters – as clean on climate, in an extended exchange with Prince Charles during his state visit to the UK. To contextualise, this comes in the wake of an Orwellian rebranding of hydrocarbons as “freedom molecules” and “freedom gas” by the US energy department ahead of a major export drive. Battlelines have been drawn around climate action in the US, with the Democratic primary campaign defined by candidates declaring their support for Green New Deal-style policies. Such is the strength of feeling that the issue has become a litmus test of contenders’ viability for the presidential nomination for 2020. With polling on such legislation indicating majority support among both Democrat and Republican voters, it’s clear that climate action can become a unifying issue as ordinary people seek solutions to the crisis, even as politicians of the right complain.  Here in the UK, there’s also potential for climate action to unite people, regardless of party allegiances. The year 2020 could see the debut of the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26), the decision-making body of the UN framework convention on climate change, on home soil.  Recent polling suggests about three-quarters of adults in the UK see climate change as the biggest crisis facing humanity today, yet only 5% feel ready to tackle it. The UK’s bid to host COP26, the largest since Paris 2015, provides a unique opportunity to tackle the crisis and drive forward a progressive and radical climate agenda – but it will require real climate leadership from the UK government. COP26 could be a defining moment for the UK – we could establish a national identity through leadership on the climate crisis, bringing unity out of our confused and divided politics. The potential for COP26 to act as a unifying event should not be understated. Whichever side you fall on in the Brexit debate, the issue has become so divisive that it has seemingly shattered Britain’s two-party electoral dominance and drawn divisions right across the country. The EU elections were seen by many as a de facto referendum on Brexit, yet a strong current of concern around climate breakdown was evident among voters in the UK, and across the continent. This was evidenced by a surge in support for candidates taking a strong stance on climate; policies and antidotes to the crisis such as a green new deal have rapidly emerged at the top of the agenda. The movement for a green new deal in the UK – driven from across the political spectrum – is pushing for widespread change to restructure the economy along environmental and social principles. These include the promise of secure and meaningful work in renewable industries as part of a “just transition”, massive investment in economically disenfranchised areas and communities that have suffered from oppression, and protection of the natural world. After years of financial hardship and an economic model failing to work in the interests of the majority, the principles behind a green new deal have widespread support. When asked whether they supported the concept, 68% of those polled by YouGov viewed it favourably. In 2008, the Climate Change Act cemented the UK’s place as an international climate leader. Since then that narrative has stuck, though arguably undeservedly so. Recent accusations of creative accounting in carbon data and the unearthing of vast sums used to fund offshore high-emissions industries are testament to that. It’s about time we stepped up and earned our reputation. Breaking from our colonial, self-serving legacy, the UK has a chance to be a positive catalyst for climate justice across the globe, by pushing for ambitious, radical, legally binding measures to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions. We must take this opportunity to become true climate leaders and use our influence to push for the kind of targets that place equal value on the lives of those in the global south as those in the north. The principles of a green new deal could be just the uniting force the country needs to achieve something truly remarkable. • Jake Woodier is a climate campaigner and organiser with the UK Student Climate Network"
"Grass fires and burning haystacks have always been a feature of British summers when between the rains the UK had occasional heat waves. But now the threat to the British Isles of large-scale wildfires has moved us into a different league. It is not just southern Europe that can expect serious forest fires. Along with Sweden, Latvia and Germany the UK has been added to the high-risk areas included in the European Forest Fire Information System. Observations show that more intense wildfires are happening over a longer period across Europe. In the first four months of this year the service recorded 1,233 fires above 30 hectares in extent, more than for the whole of 2018. Some of them were in Scotland where large areas have been particularly dry.  Most fires are started by people and because of climate heating rapidly grow out of control. Scientists from the Commission are working out how best to reduce the fire risk to people and property and are particularly concerned about the dangers of abandoned farmland on the edge of residential areas. These unmanaged wilder areas with tinder dry undergrowth are a serious fire risk. The EU Civil Protection organisation is also establishing a fleet of fire fighting planes and helicopters to help in serious emergencies. "

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt took them 15 years to notice it: CO2 is not driving the climate.
German online daily Hamburger Abendblatt here has a story titled: Global Warming Takes A Break, citing the leaked copy of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, which is due to be released in September, 2013. The Hamburger Abendblatt writes (emphasis aded):
The preliminary text is very clear that the global temperature increase does not follow the continuous rise of CO2 emissions. That’s water on the water-wheel of climate skeptics, who argue that it is more the impacts of the sun that warm the Earth, and greenhouse gases, mainly CO2, less so.”
The Hamburger Abendblatt asks:
Just how reliable are computer simulations that, although they correctly predicted the CO2 increase of the last 15 years, were completely off with the temperature development?”
Global temperatures have stagnated since the new millennium began. To answer that question, the German daily asks (alarmist) professor Jochem Marotzke, Director of the Max Planck Institute für Meteorology in Hamburg. He told the Abendblatt: “Such plateaus also show up in our models. In such periods heat is absorbed more by the depths of the oceans. We can’t explain why this is so.”

Maybe plateaus do show up in the models here and there. But none of the models showed a plateau for the last 15 years.
Marotzke then insists that the record low Arctic sea ice extent measured last summer shows that things are heating up. Yet, strangely, he develops amnesia when it come to the Antarctic record high sea ice extent recorded last fall.
The Abendblatt also writes that Marotzke is also annoyed that the IPCC AR5 draft was released prematurely, claiming that “it didn’t belong in public” and that “It is like stealing an unfinished car from the factory and then complaining that it is not complete.”
Marotzke adds:
Anyone who signs up via the Internet and says he is an expert participates in the process. He only has to name 5 publications, which however are not assessed by the IPCC. We simply expect the information to be true. This openness makes us vulnerable.”
Concerning his “unfinished car” analogy, I think here Marotzke is saying that they forgot to put on the hood to hide the fact that the car doesn’t have, and never will have, a CO2 engine.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDr. Hans H.J. Labohm has written an overview, soon to appear in Energy and Environment Journal titled: Climate Scepticism in Europe.

Dr. Hans Labohm says climate science scepticism is “very much alive and kicking” in Europe.
The opening sentences set the tone in no uncertain terms. He calls the notion of dangerous manmade global warming a “delusion”, a science that has been plagued by “cherry–picking, spin-doctoring and scare–mongering by the United Nations’ IPCC and other climate alarmists.”
In his analysis, Dr. Labohm analyzes the sceptic movement in various European countries and believes that “the tide seems to be turning” and that it has “gained considerable ground”. But the obstacles in Europe are still huge, as almost “all political parties are toeing the global warming line”.  Labohm writes that “sceptical views – even from well-known scientists with impeccable credentials – tend to be ignored and/or actively suppressed by governments, academia and the media.” However, it appears that the obstacles can be overcome. Labohm adds, citing a variety of recent public opinion surveys:
Over the last few years a disconnect has been growing between public opinion and official climate policy. Despite massive climate change propaganda, less and less people seem to be concerned about the putative threat of an imminent climate catastrophe.”
Labohm begins his look at Europe by first focusing on Russia, where he says Russian scientists aren’t at all timid about expressing their scepticism. Some Russian scientists openly say that a little ice age is imminent in the coming decades, and adds that “it was no surprise that the Russians have announced to drop out of Kyoto”.
Sweden also has a small but very vocal group of sceptics including: Göran Ahlgren, Jonny Fagerström, Per Welander, Tage Andersson, Per-Olof, Eriksson, Sten Kaijser, Wibjörn Karlén, Ingemar Nordin, Åke Ortmark, Carl-Gustaf Ribbing, Peter Stilbs, Maggie Thauersköld and Fred Goldberg. Another harsh critic of global warming science is Axel Mörner. In Denmark there are renowned researchers Bjørn Lomborg, Henrik Svensmark and Eigil Friis-Christensen.
Labohm then looks at the German speaking part of Europe, where he writes that in Switzerland two associations are active in opposing AGW. One association is the Swiss branch of the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change, NIPCC Suisse, which makes use of the research work of the NIPCC and its associates under Fred Singer.” Other influential associations in the German speaking area include the Initiative Against the Climate Scam, IKLIS.8, the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE), which “plays a central role” and “runs an excellent website and has organised successful climate conferences”.

Labohm’s report also looks at the development of Germany’s two most prominent and visible sceptics: Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt (green activist) and Dr. Sebastian Lüning (geologist) who published their “bombshell book ‘Die Kalte Sonne’ (The Cold Sun’)”, which was extensively covered by renowned media such as Bild, Die Welt, and Der Spiegel.
Moreover, the warmists recently took one to the chin, as Stefan Rahmstorf, who lavishly uses “ad hominem attacks and insinuations that his opponents lack qualifications and/or are being paid by industry”, lost a court case against science journalist Irene Meichsner, who had sued Rahmstorf “for spreading false accusations of inaccurate reporting”.
France also has vocal skeptics with Claude Allègre (former minister of education), Vincent Courtillot and Jean-Louis Le Mouël. Labohm also writes that in Great Britain “climate scepticism is very much alive and kicking”, thanks to the massive efforts of Lord Monckton, Benny Peiser, Martin Durkin and Andrew Montford, to name a few.
Fortunately, the climate science debate is not hopelessly polarized everywhere. Take the Netherlands for example. Labohm writes:
In my own country, The Netherlands, the relationship between protagonists and antagonists of the AGW hypothesis has markedly improved over the last few years. In line with the Dutch tradition of consensus-seeking (‘polder culture’), it has been possible to establish something close to a real dialogue between the two camps, which is pretty unique in the world. Climate scepticism has even received official recognition, thus undermining the information monopoly of climate alarmists.”
At the end of the analysis, Labohm tells us why European diplomacy is creating “a convenient alibi to pull out of the Kyoto process at some point in the future, without losing face”. You’ll have to read his overview when it is published to find out why. So don’t expect much out of Doha.
Finally, Labohm also calls Europe’s emissions trading system (ETS) a failure: “Europe’s experience with ETS is dismal. The system is expensive and prone to massive fraud. Moreover it did not stop the increase in Europe’s CO2 emissions”.
Overall, the Energy and Environment report by Labohm is 7 pages chock-full with analyses of the skeptic movement in Europe. Best of all, it provides vast encouragement and motivation to those seeking to continue pushing the debate on climate science. The battle is definitely downhill.

"Faith institutions must show strong moral leadership to heal people’s “collective trauma” and fill the void left by international political failure, according to the UN’s deputy head and the leader of one of the UK’s major NGOs. Amina Mohammed, the UN’s deputy secretary general, who is a Muslim, and Amanda Khozi Mukwashi, the chief executive of Christian Aid, have called for faith-based organisations to take a lead in facing up to global challenges such as poverty, inequality, migration and the climate emergency.  “The world has experienced a level of collective trauma, as a result of many different things – conflicts, extreme poverty and hunger, loss of home and shelter, climate impact. Even here in the UK we have a country that is divided on many fronts,” Mukwashi said. There was “a need for a collective healing”, she said. “As faith institutions, we have to be really bold and brave, and we need to bring all the tools, the skills that we have to try to help the world to heal. We can come up with economic solutions but when people are so hurt and divided, they need something extraordinary that touches the humanity in us. Nobody can stand on the sidelines, it’s a moral imperative.” Faith institutions had been “at the heart of horrific things in the past, but they have also been instrumental in the civil rights movement, the anti-apartheid movement, at the heart of providing education and healthcare services in developing countries”. Mohammed, who was appointed second in command at the UN in 2016, said faith leaders had to “get back to basics. Congregations will follow, but they’ll only follow a narrative that calls for core values of tolerance, peace, respect, dignity to be adhered to. This is not going to be an easy journey because we have fallen behind considerably.” But faith organisations had the potential to “break across silos”, she said, adding that countries were no longer just dealing with issues within their borders. She said leaders from different religions and different parts of the world needed to find common ground and work from there. Mohammed later told a meeting at Christian Aid’s London headquarters: “With a rise in xenophobic rhetoric, antisemitism and anti-Muslim hatred, there is a growing global interest in engaging religious actors as peace mediators and as builders of inclusive and peaceful societies. “Time and time again, faith-based organisations have stood in the face of rising tensions and conflict. They have provided space for open and constructive dialogue.” Speaking to the Guardian, she acknowledged “legitimate” criticism of the UN as overly bureaucratic and top-heavy. “A lot of the time, with good intention, we thought we knew best – we prescribed a lot and didn’t listen enough. And we weren’t able to bring the resources on the scale needed to deal with the issues.” But she added: “There is a need for that space where all voices come together, 193 countries, to discuss challenges that can only be resolved in that kind of a space.” Changes begun in the past two years needed to speed up, Mohammed said: “The challenges [we face] are not waiting for a reform that is going to take a decade.” "

Share this...FacebookTwitterSpiegel June 2006: “For the Baltic ringed seal climate change could mean its demise warned a team of scientists at the Baltic Sea Experiment (Baltex) conference in Goteborg. This is because the warming leads to the ice on the Baltic Sea to melt earlier and earlier every year.”
Seven years later, in 2013, The Local reports: “Late-season freeze sets Baltic ice record”
Hat-tip: pekke/a>.
Gee how could this happen? Some German scientists are claiming that this winter hasn’t been that cold. For example Prof. Peter Lemke of the Alfred Wegener Institute says:
In the typical winter months of December and January it was in Germany a bit too warm. In February the mean temperature on the other hand was a bit below normal. That means at the end of the 3-month period it was pretty much evened out, and looking back we had a completely normal winter.”
Prof. Mojib Latif has been appearing in the media confirming the same basic message. One has to wonder if the two scientists have become totally detached from reality.
The Baltic Sea and other scientists do not appear to agree with the global-warming-obsessed Lemke and Latif. The Local writes:

Ice breakers navigating the Gulf of Bothnia have been astounded at the record spread of ice on the Baltic Sea, while scientists say they have never seen anything like it.
‘Since record keeping began in the sixties, we’ve never encountered anything like this before,’ ice breaker Ulf Gulldne told the local newspaper Örnsköldsviks Allehanda.
On March 29th, 176,000 square kilometers of the Baltic Sea was covered in ice, a record for the time of year.”
To blame is the long protracted winter with its unusually cold temperatures. The Local quotes a captain of an ice-breaker:
I’ve never seen this much ice this late in the season,” said Karl Herlin, captain of the icebreaker Atle.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA major Swedish online daily has an article about what one of Sweden’s leading climate scientists, Lennart Bengtsson, has to say about the global warming hysteria.
Blogsite Dave’s Musings here has excerpts in English. Here are a few:
We Are Creating Great Anxiety Without It Being Justified…there are no indications that the warming is so severe that we need to panic.
‘The warming we have had the last a 100 years is so small that if we didn’t have had meteorologists and climatologists to measure it we wouldn’t have noticed it at all.’
The Earth appears to have cooling properties that exceeds the previous thought ones, and that computer models are inadequate to try to foretell a chaotic object like the climate, where actual observations is the only way to go.”
More and more we are seeing the alarmists being increasingly marginalized. As the data pours in, their science is looking more and more preposterous.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIs CO2 the main driver behind climate?
Warmist scientists would have us believe it is. One recent European study claims that CO2 and temperature rose simultaneously at the end of the last ice age, implying CO2 is a real driver. However, one prominent German meteorologist dismissed it and bluntly called the Laboratoire de Glaciologie et Géophysique de l’Environnement study by Parrenin et al “the latest gag“.
Now yet another new study published at Quaternary Science Reviews shows in no uncertain terms that the sun, the source of almost all of the Earth’s thermal energy, drives the climate and that the climate naturally swings in cycles.
The paper looks at the relationship between climatic variations, vegetation dynamics and early human activity between c. 4150–2860 BC reconstructed from a high-resolution pollen and geochemical record obtained from a small lake located in County Sligo, Ireland.
The study shows that human activity responded to changing climate conditions over the period. No surprise there. For example the abstract writes: “A nearly century-long climatic amelioration between c. 3460–3370 BC facilitated a revival of human activity on a small scale around the lake. Abandonment of the area and full woodland recovery occurred after a period of particularly wet and cool conditions ranging from c. 3360–3290 BC.”
Over the period that was studied, the climate in the region fluctuated between cool/wet periods and warmer/drier periods, each having an impact on human activity. Scientists found greater activity during warm periods.
3990 BC episode of increased rainfall
3970 – 3820 BC: period of warming and drying.
3830 – 3800 BC: episode of high precipitation
3740 – 3630 BC: dry, Templevanny Lough lowest level during Neolithic.
3670 – 3460 BC: wetter, cooler conditions, substantial rainfall
3460 – 3370 BC: warmer, drier
3360 – 3290 BC: particularly wet and cool
3110 – 3050 BC:  warmer, drier
3060 – 3030 BC: high rainfall
2940 – 2900 BC: high rainfall
The study reveals that the periods of climatic fluctuation were not isolated to just Ireland, but indeed are “in agreement with those of moisture/precipitation and temperature reconstructions from northern and western Europe and the Alps, suggesting that the studied period was characterised by a high-frequency climate variability“.
More importantly, what exactly was behind these climatic fluctuations? Human activity? Not at all. The scientists write:
These climatic shifts correspond to variations in solar activity, suggesting a solar forcing on climate.
Oh my, who would have ever thought it? After all, there are only hundreds of other similar studies from all over the world showing precisely the same thing.
CO2 is driving nothing

CO2 is hardly more a thermostat for global temperature than a thermometer is in your home. The following graphic is snipped from Petit et al 1999 here and shows the real (im)potency of CO2 in driving global temperature.

The blue curve above is the mean temperature and the red curve is CO2 concentration. From 130,000 to about 112,000 years CO2 was more or less steady at about 260 ppm. But look what happens to the temperature during this time. It dropped 9°C! You mean mighty “heat-trapping” Co2 wasn’t able to keep the planet warm?
Also note the lag. The same is clear for the other interglacials. Clearly the scientists of the Parrenin et al Paper made some gross scientific errors, or the study is just a sham.
Let’s take a look at temperature vs CO2 from 1943 to 1970. During this time we know that atmospheric CO2 was rising. Yet look at what happened to temperature during that period:

Before-tampering temperature data. Source: National Center For Atmospheric Research, published in 1975 in Newsweek.
The temperature dropped more than 0.6°F. The same is happening today: even though atmospheric CO2 concentration is on the rise, temperatures globally haven’t risen in 15 years.

"The rural electorate of Indi will make history next week when Independent Dr Helen Haines is officially elected to replace fellow independent Cathy McGowan. Part of the reason she won was a climate platform founded on energy democracy. Indi is a regional electorate in Victoria. It stretches all the way from the peri urban fringes of Melbourne to the Murray River. It is an electorate of mountains, valleys and plains. Until Cathy McGowan won in 2013, Indi had been a safe Liberal seat, delivering some of the largest margins in the country for conservative members.  Back to back independents have never been elected in Australian history. Popular independent MPs, like Tony Windsor or Rob Oakeshott have both seen their seats revert back to the Coalition. There is a good reason for that. Once elected, independent members are popular, but most are elected on a protest vote from the former sitting member. It is very hard to run as an independent and win against a popular or at least “not-unpopular” major party candidate. Indi is home to Australia’s most vibrant community energy network and this built the foundation for Helen Haines’ victory. The network includes 13 groups across the electorate, from the major population centres of Wodonga and Wangaratta in the north all the way to the smaller towns of Euroa and Alexandra in the south. This has changed the politics of this regional seat and allowed a candidate like Helen to put forward a winning bold vision for tackling climate change. Community energy is a powerful way for regional communities to take control of their energy future. It also helps revitalise regional communities by ensuring that the energy dollars spent in the region stay in the region. Of course, community energy is not unique to Indi. Across Australia there are now more than 100 communities developing community-owned clean energy projects and working to transition their communities to 100% renewables. About 80% of these groups are located across regional Australia. Helen’s success can be attributed to working with these groups and putting communities at the front of climate solutions. The strong community energy movement in Indi, meant people were already seeing and feeling the local benefits of clean energy. At the forefront of this transition in Indi is the town of Yackandandah, which is committed to being powered by 100% renewable energy by 2022. Thanks to the work of community group Totally Renewable Yackandandah (TRY), 55% of all households already have solar on their roofs, way above the Victorian average. TRY assisted the local hospital to install solar – with money saved on electricity redirected to employ more doctors and nurses. The town’s next target is to have solar panels on all community buildings. This year TRY has installed solar panels and a battery on the local CFA shed, ensuring that during bushfires or natural disasters it will still have power. Yackandandah is also leading the country with new energy solutions, including “micro-grids”, which allow householders with solar panels to share electricity with other households. Yackandandah is not alone, with 12 other groups also working on climate solutions in their respective communities. Because community energy groups work in their local communities, their solutions are targeted to deal with on the ground issues. In Wodonga, which has the highest electricity disconnection rate in the state due to rising power prices, the local community energy group is installing solar on low-income households to help with power prices. To help these communities reach their renewable energy goals and keep money circling locally, a locally owned community energy retailer called Indigo Power has recently been set up. Indigo Power will work with the local community energy groups – like TRY – to help them reach their 100% renewable energy targets. Helen Haines was a founding board member of Indigo Power and brought her knowledge of community energy to her successful election campaign. From Tallangatta to Tunamah and Yackandandah to Yea, community energy groups are part of the fabric of the electorate. It can work in other electorates. Projects such as a community-owned solar or wind farm activates latent support for the broader transition to clean energy and, in-turn, for those parties putting forward policies for ambitious climate action. There is also a growing recognition that renewable energy can bring significant economic benefits. From generating jobs on community-owned wind or solar farms to saving money on electricity prices. Modelling shows that for every government dollar spent in community energy, it unlocks $15 of local investment. Renewables are booming across Australia, including in Queensland. That means much-needed money and jobs flowing to the regions. Community energy projects, rooted in local action, show that regions can take action on climate change and see real benefits at the same time. Across Indi our focus has been on energy democracy. This means people coming together to use new energy technology, like solar panels, to build stronger communities and create tangible benefits. We can do the same across the country and create mass grassroots support for locally-driven climate solutions that put people front and centre.

Share this...FacebookTwitterUPDATE: Yesterday I left 2 regular comments at Kemfert’s Facebook site, but they have both since disappeared. Obviously she is not open to other views – we’re so surprised.
Paul Hockenos at the European Energy Review (EER) reports that “energy expert” Dr. Claudia_Kemfert, Director of the Energy, Transportation, and Environment Unit at the prestigious Deutsche Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung (German Institute for Economic Research) in Berlin “has had enough of the ‘Energiewende-bashing’ that she feels has stymied the progress of the country’s energy transition and sullied its reputation.”

Dr. Claudia Kemfert of the German Institute for Economic Research frets over exposed ills of “green” energies. Photo source: Facebook/Claudia-Kemfert.
Energiewende is the German term coined for the country’s transition away from nuclear and fossil fuels and over to renewable energies.
Over the last months the gruesome details of the reality of green energies have surfaced. Environment Minister Peter Altmaier, for example, recently informed the public that the transformation over to green energy would cost Germany 1 trillion euros by 2039 (all for a theoretical global warming prevention of a few hundredths of a degree Celsius by the year 2100).

Moreover, renewable energies such as wind and sun have proven to be wildly fluctuating, unreliable sources whose lifetimes are estimated to be only half of what manufacturers had promised.
Kemfert, however, remains obstinate and closed-minded, and doesn’t want to hear any of it. EER writes that she “has set out to explode the myths and lies that are being spread by Energiewende-sceptics“. Kemfert is quoted saying (my emphasis):
When these myths are repeated again and again, they sink in. Not so long ago Germans were extremely concerned about climate change and the dangers of nuclear power. Now they’re scared of the Energiewende.”
As Germany suffers through a record fifth colder-than-normal winter in a row and global mean temperature stalling for 15 years, Germans are having serious doubts about catastrophic warming.
Also 600,000 poor families having their power turned off every year because they can no longer pay skyrocketing electric bills represents a real present danger, and not some year 2100 computer scenario.
Kemfert, unfortunately, appears unaware of these realities, and insists we deny them and simply have faith that wind and sun are the way to go.

"Your extremely informative long read article (Is the Anthropocene upon us?, 30 May) sums up the complicated story of how the Anthropocene has morphed from a technical term of geological stratigraphy (about rocks) to a vehicle for practitioners in other branches of the Earth sciences, social sciences, environmental humanities and creative arts to generate ideas on human impacts on the planet (about us). What it does not do, however, is give any indication of what the potential catastrophic consequences of the Anthropocene might be for the survival of the human species on the planet (though the links Nicola Davison provides do deal with this to some extent). It is quite possible that the assumption is that everyone who reads the Guardian and similar quality newspapers and magazines already knows about these “doom and gloom” predictions, but a research project I am coordinating, on how media all over the world in all the major languages report the Anthropocene, strongly suggests that the dominant Anthropocene narratives tend to neutralise the risks or to reassure us that science and technology will find ways to avert the worst, the so-called “good” Anthropocene. Even the Guardian, whose extensive coverage of the Anthropocene is cited and reproduced all over the world, generally relays these reassuring messages.Leslie SklairEmeritus professor of sociology, London School of Economics "
"Donald Trump believes the US has a “clean climate”, telling the interviewer Piers Morgan on ITV’s Good Morning Britain that he had informed Prince Charles in a 90-minute conversation that the US “right now has among the cleanest climates there are based on all statistics, and it’s even getting better because I agree with that we want the best water, the cleanest water”. There are a few important details the president may have overlooked in presenting a clean bill of health for the US environment, so here is a handy reminder. The US is still the world’s second biggest emitter of greenhouse gas emissions, having been overtaken by China more than a decade ago. In per capita terms, however, the US far outstrips China, though it comes below some Middle Eastern states with tiny populations and vast fossil fuel industries. While carbon emissions have been falling, in part because of the switch from coal to gas, Climate Tracker estimates that the US will fail to meet its carbon reduction targets set by Barack Obama, to cut emissions by 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2025. The US is now one of the world’s biggest gas producers, thanks to fracking, and about half of its oil now comes from the production method, which requires the blasting of dense shale rock with water, sand and chemicals to release the tiny bubbles of fossil fuel trapped inside. This boom has come at a cost, as the vast water requirements are draining some areas dry, and pollutants found near fracking sites include heavy metals, chemicals that disrupt hormones, and particulates. The effects range from memory, learning and IQ deficits to behavioural problems. Leaks of “fugitive” methane are an additional contributor to climate change. Not content with the US’s existing conventional oil reserves, and the expansion of the oil and gas industries through fracking, the US fossil fuel industry is seeking new grounds for exploration – among them, the pristine Alaskan wilderness. Drilling in the Alaskan wildlife reserve is a key Trump policy. The Trump administration has moved to loosen regulations on fuel efficiency for cars and vans, which were already less stringent than in many other countries. Opponents fear this will increase greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement of 2015 cannot legally take effect until after the next presidential election, in an irony of timing. However, the effect can already be seen, in the emboldening of other nations considering a withdrawal, such as Brazil, formerly a strong proponent of action at the UN talks, and the increasing influence of fossil fuel lobbyists. With the president claiming climate change to be a “Chinese hoax”, it is perhaps not surprising that the US has some of the highest rates of climate denial in the world, according to polling by YouGov in collaboration with the Guardian. Despite this, a sizeable majority of the US public – nearly six in 10 people – still agree with the science on climate change, and support action to stave off the worst consequences. Despite Trump’s claim to Morgan that “we want the best water, the cleanest water – it’s crystal clean, has to be crystal clean clear”, his recent actions on water have been an attempt to roll back decades of progress on cleaning up the US water supply. Last December, he announced plans to undo or weaken federal rules that protect millions of acres of wetlands and thousands of miles of streams from pesticide run-off and other pollutants. By rolling back Obama-era measures intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, the Trump administration is also threatening to increase air pollution, as coal-fired power stations will be able to spew out toxins once more, according to 14 states who last year opposed the Environmental Protection Agency’s plans. This is in contrast with China and India, cited by Trump – along with Russia – as having polluted air. Those nations are trying to clean up their pollution with stricter limits on what power plants and other industries can produce."

Share this...FacebookTwitterA couple of days ago we saw how wind power in Britain at one point had fallen to just a fraction of one percent in supplying national demand. The situation was hardly better in Germany.
The following chart provided by Wilfried Heck here shows Germany’s electric power consumption and the energy fed in by wind and sun for the period of 24 February to March 3rd.

Chart by Wilfried Heck. Date and time shown by horizontal axis, power by vertical axis.
The chart above shows the time period broken down into 656 fifteen-minute time intervals. The mean value of the total consumption (blue) is 57,595 MW. The total electrical energy consumed for the period depicted was 9,445,650 MW-hrs. However, wind and sun were only able to supply 6.22 % and 2.12 % respectively, thus yielding a total contribution of 8.34% over the entire period.
Peak demand for 2013 was 73.283 MW occurring on 24 January 2013 at 7 p.m. But at that time, the sun had long been below the horizon and was not able to contribute anything. Heck writes: “And the wind? With 31,300 MW of installed capacity, it was able to only feed in 1479.1 MW into the German grid, thus contributing a measly 2% share of the electric power supply.”
The chart clearly shows times when wind and sun energy were practical doing nothing. So when the sun doesn’t shine (which is more often than not in Germany) and when the wind isn’t blowing strongly, the country needs all the old power plants back on line. 200% capacity is needed to assure 100% supply, and this in relatively windy regions.
Moreover, when the sun does shine and/or the wind blows, conventional power plants end up operating at levels well below their optimum efficiency, and thus do very little to cut back on emissions.

"Thousands of heat-related deaths in major US cities could be avoided if rising global temperatures are curbed, new research has found. On current global heating trends, thousands of people are set to perish due to the heat in some extreme years across 15 major US cities, in an analysis by a team of British and American researchers. Once the average worldwide temperature rises to 3C (5.4F) above the pre-industrial period nearly 5,800 people are expected to die in New York City during particularly hot years, more than 2,500 are forecast to die in Los Angeles and more than 2,300 lives will be lost in Miami, all during years of extreme heat. These deaths are predicted for any year that was the warmest for 30 years. This dire scenario would probably be avoided if the world was able to keep to its commitments made in the Paris climate agreement, where governments pledged to limit the global temperature rise to 2C, with an aspiration to keep the increase to 1.5C. If global heating was limited to 1.5C, a total of 2,716 lives would be saved each year from heat mortality in New York City, the researchers found. Thousands of lives across other US cities would also be saved, right down to San Francisco, where 114 people a year would avoid dying due to the the heat, compared to a 3C world. “Reducing emissions would lead to a smaller increase in heat-related deaths, assuming no additional actions to adapt to higher temperatures,” said Kristie Ebi, a study co-author and public health expert at the University of Washington. “Climate change, driven by greenhouse gas emissions, is affecting our health, our economy and our ecosystems. This study adds to the body of evidence of the harms that could come without rapid and significant reductions in our greenhouse gas emissions.” Overall, New York, Los Angeles, Miami, Chicago and Philadelphia are set to experience the largest number of heat-related deaths, while places such as Boston and San Francisco will suffer lower death tolls. Researchers projected this by looking at previous records on the relationship between high temperatures and mortality. The planet has already warmed by around 1C since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, due to the release of heat-trapping gases from human activity such as power generation, transportation and deforestation. Even if current Paris agreement pledges are met, the world is on course to heat by around 3C. Scientists have warned the world is now dangerously close to breaching the 1.5C limit, which would push societies to a new reality of severe droughts, coastal flooding, wildfires and the loss of key ecosystems such as coral reefs. But even keeping global temperatures at a 2C increase would save lives compared with the warmer alternative according to the new paper, published in Science Advances. Researchers found that 1,980 New Yorkers would be saved from a heat-related death at a 2C increase compared with 3C heating. In Los Angeles, 759 people would avoid this same fate. “We are no longer counting the impact of climate in change in terms of degrees of global warming, but rather in terms of number of lives lost,” said the report’s co-author Dann Mitchell, from the University of Bristol’s Cabot Institute. Mitchell said the looming deaths mean he would “strongly encourage” Americans to hold elected leaders to account over the climate crisis. Donald Trump has vowed to remove the US from the Paris agreement, dismantled many of the policies designed to cut greenhouse gases and has opened up vast areas of federal land and waters to oil, gas and coal extraction. Following a period of gradual decline, US greenhouse gas emissions rose last year. This “energy dominance” agenda is aimed at turning the US into a major exporter of oil and gas, while propping up the fading coal industry. But a series of disastrous hurricanes and wildfires, influenced by the changing climate, along with a slew of stark warnings from scientists, has provoked record levels of concern among Americans over the climate emergency. A major US government climate assessment released last year warned that heat-related health problems, particularly among the sick and elderly, are already a problem in parts of the country. Research released earlier this week highlighted the health challenges posed by climate change, including extreme weather events, the spread of mosquito-borne diseases and air pollution. The World Health Organization has previously stated that tackling the climate crisis would save at least a million lives a year globally, making it a moral imperative to act. “Strengthened climate actions are needed as they would substantially benefit public health in the United States,” said Eunice Lo, from the University of Bristol’s Cabot Institute and lead author of the heat study. This article was amended on 13 June 2019 to clarify that the deaths are what would occur from a one-in-30-year heat wave occurrence, and are not expected to occur every year."

Share this...FacebookTwitterJoe Bastardi tweeted an interesting graphic (Figure 2), indicating this year’s spring melt up in the Arctic could be off to a slow start – if one looks only at the temperature factor. There are of course lots of factors impacting sea ice melt: winds, weather, ocean currents, soot, to name a few. Here’s the sea ice extent at the moment:

Figure 1: Source:www.ijis.iarc.uaf.edu/htm.
Figure 1 above shows that we are pretty much at average Arctic sea ice extent for this time of the year, despite “the all-time record low” set last autumn. Figure 2 is the chart Joe Bastardi tweeted yesterday – a global temperature forecast for the next 6 weeks.

Figure 2: NCEP forecast for period 6 April to 21 May 2013. Source: NCEP.
Figure 2 shows lots of blue and green up in the Arctic and so the break-up of Bering, Chukchi and Beaufort sea ice could be delayed weeks. Using the popular warmist global warming albedo theory, that would mean lots of sunlight getting reflected back out into space, thus the dark ocean beneath would absorb less heat, and so lead to even less ice melt. Eventually, at the end of the long complicated chain, all the extra ice may lead to a warm winter at the middle latitudes next year, which then would be a clear sign of global warming. Just believe it!

Over the long-term, the Arctic is a sort of climate barometer, but one that lags the overall northern hemisphere mean temperature trend. What we saw last fall in the Arctic is in part only a consequence of the warm 2000s decade. By the end of the current decade, chances are good that we will see the Arctic recovering strongly, in response to an overall cooling of the northern hemisphere.
Spring minimum reaches a 10-year high!
Also, this year’s global spring minimum reached a 10-year high: just under 16 million sq km (Figure 3), and was thus about 1.5 million sq. km. more than 2 years ago.

Figure 3: Global sea ice bottomed out at just under 16 million sq. km. This is the highest in 10 years and is the same as 1981! See chart: arctic.atmos.uiuc.edu.area.jpg
Right now overall global sea ice anomaly is almost plus one million sq. km., the highest it’s been in 4 years. That’s bad news for the albedo theorists. The upper curve of Figure 3 shows that the minimum global sea ice (reached every spring) was at the highest level in 10 years. This flies in the face of the claims that global sea ice is melting rapidly.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDoubts over climate science are snowballing among the elite media in Europe.
A wave of “climate science skepticism” in the media and other institutions is sweeping across Europe (see below).
The latest to shock the warmists is Switzerland’s leading daily Neue Züricher Zeitung (New Zurich Newspaper – NZZ), which obviously has noticed that things aren’t warming up like they were once projected. In its latest report the NZZ has declared the science as: very much in dispute. H/t: Tomislav Rus at Facebook.
The title of the NZZ’s latest piece: The Missing «Hotspot» In The Sky.
The NZZ writes that according to climate models, the air in the middle troposphere was supposed to warm up strongly, “however measurements show that the temperature has risen much less than previously forecast. More and more scientists are admitting that there is problem. […] gradually the impression that the climate models for the region of the equator have a problem is growing.”
The NZZ looks at the model prognoses of the troposphere, which projected a warming at an altitude of 8 to 12 km. It’s not showing up, it writes, and now scientists are scratching their heads.
The NZZ adds:
On average the CMIP5 models have over-estimated the warming of the troposphere, writes a team led by California scientist Benjamin Santer recently wrote in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Also in a draft for the first part of the UN IPCC assessment report, which will be published this year, the authors admitted a discrepancy for almost all models.”
It is dawning on the NZZ that the models are just nowhere near properly describing the Earth’s atmosphere and climate development. The Swiss daily is finally realizing that there is perhaps far more to the climate than just trace gas CO2:
In the climate system there are so many feedback mechanisms at work that today no scientist knows what would come out of the corrected models – first one has to know what the correction will look like.”
NZZ sums up the dilemma scientists now face:
To start with, when it comes to the ‘hotspot’, the scientists are dealing with a nut that is still too hard for them to crack.”
The Swiss NZZ is hardly the only flagship daily that has skepticism beginning to pour out of its media pages. What follows are some recent examples of reports that are sending quakes and tremors throughout Europe’s climate institutes, and causing pillars to crack.
Europe’s leading media casting serious doubt:
Spiegel here and here:
Global warming has stalled for 15 years. Experts thus are having doubts on the reliability of their prognoses.”
Denmark’s Jyllands-Posten:
Nothing indicates that climate here is running amok in global warming. […]  The fact is that we can’t see a link between the warming and the increased sea level. The global warming has until now been totally harmless.”
Die Welt here:

Scientists warn of ice age“
Bild here and here,
Russian scientist sees next ice age approaching. Starting in 2014 it will start getting colder and colder. […] it was the fifth winter in a row that has been colder than normal, which is in complete contradiction to the climate prognoses of 13 years ago. Back then winters with snow and ice in Germany were viewed as an obsolete model.”
And the Telegraph in the UK:
Global warming: time to rein back on doom and gloom?”
Moreover, leading European meteorologists have been outing:
Sweden’s renowned Lennart Bengtsson:
…lower tropical troposphere, 20°S –20°N, has only got about a third of the warming compared to what is predicted by present climate models.”
Germany’s Dominik Jung here:
In the year 2000 the climate experts prophesied that winters with ice and snow in Germany would no longer exist. That this claim is false is shown by current facts, and in many regions with just a glance out the window!”
Dr. Karsten Brandt:
…it is also a fact that the horror scenarios produced for Germany are without any scientific merit.”
Warmist scientists have great doubts
Also leading warmist scientists like Hans von Storch and Fritz Vahrenholt have released best-selling books, expressing serious doubts on the computer projected climate catastrophe and aiming sharp criticism at the attempted political coup by the over zealously activist scientists at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.
Chasm between models and observations undeniable
So what’s behind the overall movement? Is skepticism just the latest hip trend?  Warming after all, is old and people are just sick of hearing about it – especially when shoveling snow during Easter.
It’s much more than just a trend. The real rocket fuel behind the media skepticism is the widening chasm between model projections and actually observed data. Each year the chasm grows wider, and now has reached such dimensions that even diehard warmist media are not even able to deny it. Time to fold.
Now they are hacking out a back door escape.

"Scale it up and it’s revolution; scale it down and it’s individual non-cooperation that may be seen as nothing more than obstinacy or malingering or not seen at all. What we call protest identifies one aspect of popular power and resistance, a force so woven into history and everyday life that you miss a lot of its impact if you focus only on groups of people taking stands in public places. But people taking such stands have changed the world over and over, toppled regimes, won rights, terrified tyrants, stopped pipelines and deforestation and dams. They go far further back than the Peterloo protests and massacre 200 years ago, to the great revolutions of France and then of Haiti against France and back before that to peasant uprisings and indigenous resistance in Africa and the Americas to colonisation and enslavement and to countless acts of resistance on all scales that were never recorded. They will go far forward from this moment. And at this moment, with organisations addressing the climate crisis, reinvigorated feminism in many parts of the world, antiracist and human rights campaigns focused on specific groups and issues, protest is a force running through everything – and running against a lot of things, since this is also an age of authoritarianism and a consolidation of wealth among a global superelite.  Right now, for example, Florida’s Coalition of Immokalee Workers is forming another alliance with students to pursue rights for farmworkers by targeting nationwide US burger chain Wendy’s. They can stand as one of the great examples of the power of the supposedly powerless, which could be more fruitfully thought of as exercisers of other kinds of power than institutional, military, or financial power, the kind less seldom recognised, cultivated, studied or valued. This alliance of labour organisers and immigrant farm workers from the Caribbean, Central America and Mexico began co-ordinating human rights and workers’ rights campaigns almost two decades ago, from a base in the tomato-growing region around the town of Immokalee in Florida. It would be easy to call immigrant farm workers powerless, and indeed modern-day slavery was one of the issues they addressed. But they understood the nature of power: to get a living wage, they needed to get a few cents more per box of tomatoes, and pressuring the farmers wasn’t going to work, so they went after the buyers, the big supermarkets and fast-food chains, targeting one at a time, building coalitions, media campaigns, holding marches and other public events. And winning. They conquered Taco Bell in 2005. Then McDonald’s. Then Burger King, Whole Foods Market, and Subway by 2008, and they kept going. They fought modern-day slavery, sent the enslaving farmers to jail and established workplace standards that recently expanded to address the epidemic of sexual harassment and abuse in the fields. “Todos somos líderes” (We are all leaders) is one of their sayings, insisting that power is everywhere and everyone can exercise it as they do. The people who first and last resist slavery, then and now, are the enslaved, and the history of 18th-century England and Scotland includes lawsuits and other tactics to free individual slaves. Olaudah Equiano, who was kidnapped from his Igbo village in what is now south-eastern Nigeria and sold into slavery, purchased his own freedom and became an anti-slavery activist in England. In 1789 he published a widely read autobiography that deepened and broadened knowledge of the brutalities of slavery. Part of the danger of imagining change as a process forced by violence and brute power is that it overlooks the great power of nonviolent uprisings and those other moments when individuals become a civil society on its feet. It also ignores how the most important battle is often in the collective imagination, and it is won in part by books, ideas, songs, speeches, even new words and frameworks for old evils. The second US president, John Adams, said the American Revolution took place “in the minds and hearts of the people” before hostilities commenced. What makes something long tolerated intolerable, what makes people not directly affected care, what sways public opinion, what tips the balance, what makes politicians recognise that the dangers of not acting have come to outweigh those of acting? Another thing to remember about the great public moments, whether it’s the uprisings against the World Trade Organization in Seattle and elsewhere in 1999, or the global protest against the Iraq war in 2003, or the 2017 women’s marches in hundreds of places across the globe, is that they are not the planting but the harvest of a change in public imagination. People cared; something made them care; people were ready to act; something made them ready; people joined; someone or many someones issued the call and orchestrated the action. One metaphor that has worked for me is: the mushrooms that spring up after rain are only the fruiting body of a far larger underground fungus we do not see; the rain causes the mushrooms to rise out of the earth, but the fungus was alive and well (and invisible) beforehand; the rain can be an event. Think of Donald Trump’s immigration ban on seven predominantly Muslim countries that caused Americans to go to airports all over the country in January 2017, or how the lack of adequate action on the climate crisis prompted Extinction Rebellion to take over key sites in London in April. And then these public actions often have consequences of their own; that the UK parliament declared a climate emergency at the beginning of last month is undoubtedly in part a response to this action, but of course the official powers – let’s call them the aboveground powers – do not like to acknowledge the underground powers, and so they generally dismiss, ignore, or demonise them. But we do not have to. In these great collective moments people showed up because they cared; when they showed up they often found a new sense of solidarity and power, which generated yet more possibilities. The seeds of a great public anti-slavery campaign in the western world were planted on 22 May 1787. That day, a group of 12 Quaker men gathered in a printing shop in London to launch a campaign that, as Adam Hochschild relates in his magnificent book Bury the Chains, would take almost 50 years to succeed, and only one of them would survive to see the end of, a campaign to end slavery throughout the British empire. Among the tactics the movement deployed, as the years passed, were a sugar boycott, the now famous engraving of how Africans were packed into the hulls of slave ships, letter writing and lobbying parliament, engaging the public in the campaign. These are now common tactics for social change. In 1807, buying and selling slaves became illegal across the empire; owning slaves became illegal by a process beginning in 1833. It was a process more considerate of slave owners than slaves, compensating the former rather than the latter, but it freed slaves and outlawed slavery. Liberation is contagious, as an idea and as a process. One of the most extraordinary chains of events of the 19th century was the response of American women active in the US abolitionist movement, who were excluded from even being seated, let alone speaking, at the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London, in June 1840. It prompted women already involved in trying to end slavery to begin looking at their own lack of rights, freedoms and equalities. The result was the suffrage movement, which made the antislavery movement look speedy; it took 80 years to ratify the 19th amendment to the US constitution, declaring no one would be denied the right to vote “on account of sex” (and we’re still fighting in the US for the right to vote regardless of race). It prompted suffrage movements in other countries around the world. I don’t know exactly how the black civil rights movement triggered the other racial justice movements around the US for Latinx, Asian American and Native American rights, but I know that 50 years ago the Native American occupation of Alcatraz Island had a huge impact. As with the Standing Rock protests against the Dakota Access pipeline three years ago, the campaign went far beyond its boundaries and official goals. I described these great public actions as harvests of the seeds planted before them; the ripe crop generates more seeds. The great gathering of resistance at Standing Rock inspired Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to run for office, and her success and subsequent actions have been extraordinary in their dedication to tackling the climate crisis, notably with the Green New Deal. Standing Rock, I have been told, inculcated pride and hope and a sense of power, as well as bringing about new alliances and healing old conflicts, for many Native American participants. It also raised awareness of indigenous rights and land issues for a lot of non-native people. Like the long campaign against the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline from Alberta, Canada, to Nebraska in the midwest, it served as an education for people around the continent and beyond about the role of pipelines in making fossil fuel extraction profitable, the dangers and impacts and politics. There is nothing more direct than an encampment of several hundred people or a march of tens of thousands, but that does not mean the consequences will be direct, or that only the direct and measurable ones matter. Every action shifts the world’s balance, sometimes those shifts will never be noted or will have their impact long after or far away. At Peterloo, unarmed people were massacred by armed cavalry; it’s easy to portray this as a defeat, but it is said to have shifted the balance in such a way that the issue of universal male suffrage became urgent and led 13 years later to the Reform Act of 1832. This newspaper was established in the aftermath of Peterloo, to “warmly advocate the cause of Reform”, and so this publication is an unforeseen consequence of that massacre. Violence did not win, if it meant doing more than killing, dispersing and terrifying protesters; it did not kill an idea of justice and it may have hastened its advancement. At Standing Rock, hired thugs and government agents attacked protesters, often brutally, but they did not stop the beliefs, the hopes, the ideas, or the awareness. Violence can intimidate more than it can convert. “You can cut all the flowers, but you can’t stop the spring,” Pablo Neruda once wrote. That was a beautiful expression that perhaps the climate emergency has sabotaged as a literal truth. Spring this year came as devastating floods across Mozambique and the central US, as freak late snowstorms, as record heat in the Arctic, as cherry blossoms blooming early in Japan. We didn’t stop the spring, but we warped it. The future of the Earth and all living things on it now depends on whether we do enough in response to the climate crisis to limit its impact by radically transforming our energy production and consumption, our agriculture and forestry, our priorities and perceptions. This too has been led largely from underneath, by grassroots climate activists from the Philippines to Alaska, and they have accomplished astonishing things in the past dozen years, shutting down coal plants, stopping coal and natural gas terminals, pipelines, fracking (with outright bans in some US states, notably New York, and some countries, including France, Germany and Ireland). A technological revolution in wind and solar power will allow us to enter a post-fossil fuel age, but to do that means countering the great powers of the fossil fuel corporations, profiteers and the governments that serve them better than their citizens. This is a conflict that pits the young, some of whom are likely to live to see the 22nd century, against the old; it pits the poor and the people of the global south, who are feeling the impact most now, against the rich and the people of the north, who are largely responsible for the climate crisis. It has been, and will be, a conflict of the apparently powerless against the apparently powerful. We will need to remember our past victories, the powers of protest, but also of art, of transformations of imagination, of widespread non-cooperation. It is more than a conflict, though. The response to the climate crisis must be a transformation of everything from transportation systems to imaginations. Some already recognise an Earth in which everything is beautifully and terrifyingly interconnected, in which the coal we burn now, or don’t, has everything to do with the climate of the future, in which forests are the most elegant technology to sequester carbon – and in which the young now lead us. Greta Thunberg is the most famous of the new generation of climate activists, but the youth plaintiffs in the Oregon-based youth climate lawsuit and the young leaders of the Sunrise Movement and Extinction Rebellion count. I name them because they are visible to me in western America, but I know that extraordinary young people are at work in every part of the world – including 25 activists, ranging in age from seven to 25, who have just won a lawsuit in Colombia to stop Amazon deforestation, and the poet Aka Niviana who has raised awareness of the accelerating ice melt across Greenland. And I know that the power they have, and we have, could be adequate to this greatest of crises if we can understand it, imagine a different world, and make it happen with the tools we have always had but not always recognised.

"Downing Street has shot down claims made by the chancellor, Philip Hammond, that tackling the climate crisis would cost £1tn and require spending cuts for schools, hospitals and the police force. No 10 said plans to create a net zero carbon economy would cost no more than the UK’s existing plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  The firm response will be seen as a rare rebuke for Hammond, who warned Theresa May that reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net zero could cost the country £1tn and lead to industries becoming “economically uncompetitive” without government subsidies. In a letter to the prime minister, Hammond said the proposed 2050 net zero target – one of the most far-reaching proposed in the world – would mean less money for schools, the NHS and police forces, the Financial Times reported. Downing Street said analysis from the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) showed that the cost of a net zero carbon economy would “fall within our existing spending plans”. The Committee on Climate Change says cutting greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 is necessary, affordable and desirable. Here are some of the actions needed to make that happen: • Petrol and diesel cars banned from sale ideally by 2030 and 2035 at the latest. • Quadrupling clean electricity production from wind, solar and perhaps nuclear, plus batteries to store it and connections to Europe to share the load. • Connection of new homes to the gas grid ending in 2025, with boilers using clean hydrogen or replaced by electric powered heat pumps. Plus, all homes and appliances being highly efficient.   • Beef, lamb and dairy consumption falling by 20%, though this is far lower than other studies recommend and a bigger shift to plant-based diets would make meeting the zero target easier. • A fifth of all farmland – 15% of the UK – being converted to tree planting and growing biofuel crops and restoration of peat bogs. This is vital to take CO2 out of the air to balance unavoidable emissions from cattle and planes. • 1.5bn new trees will be needed, meaning more than 150 football pitches a day of new forests from now to 2050. • Flying would not be banned, but the number of flights will depend on how much airlines can cut emissions with electric planes or biofuels.  A spokeswoman for No 10 would not comment directly on the letter, but warned against any cost estimates which conflated economic costs with public spending. “There are a lot of figures out there on this issue that don’t factor in the benefits or consider the costs of not doing this,” she said. “The costs related to meeting this target are whole-of-the-economy costs, not a fiscal cost, and so it’s not really right to frame it as a trade-off for public spending,” she said. The target has the backing of the CCC, the government’s advisory panel. The current policy is to cut emissions by 80% over the same time period, which Hammond said was already off track. For any such targets to have credibility the government would need to have an “ambitious policy response”, he said. “This would almost certainly include increased government spending, meaning less money available for other areas of public spending.” To reach net zero, the UK would have to offset all carbon emissions with schemes such as planting trees or through processes such as carbon capture and storage. Hammond said the country would need to decarbonise virtually all heating, meaning households would need to spend thousands of pounds replacing gas boilers and installing insulation. He also claimed there would need to be a ban on petrol and diesel cars as well as a big increase in the number of charging points for electric cars. The CCC has previously estimated that achieving the net zero target would cost £50bn a year, but the chancellor used a figure of £70bn, which has been calculated by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. “On the basis of these estimates, the total cost of transitioning to a zero-carbon economy is likely to be well in excess of a trillion pounds,” Hammond wrote to the prime minister. When asked if Hammond was being misleading, the No 10 spokeswoman said: “I’m not going to talk about the specifics of a leak, but I think I’ve been pretty clear in the position from the PM.” The climate watchdog’s report said the cost of a net zero carbon economy would be between 1% and 2% of GDP by 2050. According to the report, this range remains valid even if costs climb to the £70bn a year mark suggested by Hammond. The forecast is also on a par with the cost of the UK’s existing target to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 80% from 1990 levels by 2050. The committee has said it expects the UK will be able to keep costs in check even while increasing its ambition, because green technologies are becoming more affordable.  May is understood to be keen on having the emissions legislation as one of the key legacies of her time in office, and will enshrine the target in law on 11 June, according to civil servants. Meanwhile, a report from the International Energy Agency published on Thursdaysaid the UK government must do more to integrate low-cost renewable energy. The agency’s first major report on the UK in seven years said embracing renewables should be a priority to allow consumers to “take full benefit of clean and affordable power”. It said the UK should simplify and remove outdated regulation, review environmental subsidies and reform energy taxation. The overhaul should place more emphasis on energy efficiency, it says.  May’s stance has the support of the frontrunner for the Tory leadership, Boris Johnson, who tweeted on Wednesday that a “government I lead would win our bid to host COP 2020, legislate for net zero emissions by 2050 & embrace the opportunity of green growth for the UK as a global decarbonisation leader.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterOcean warming, caused by man-made global warming, was supposed to lead to the destruction of the corals we were told again and again.
But now a new study published at the Marine Pollution Bulletin shows that corals are far more resilient than first thought. More bad news for the catastrophe-obsessed climate kooks.
The National Oceanography Centre here reports:
A number of coral species survive at seawater temperatures far higher than estimates for the tropics during the next century.
We associate coral reefs with tropical seas of around 28 degrees so in that mindset even slight warming can have devastating effects on corals. But in the Arabian/Persian Gulf, corals survive seawater temperatures of up to 36 degrees Celsius every summer, heat levels that would kill corals elsewhere. Corals have adapted.
Reefs are made up of many species of coral, each of which have a mutually beneficial, or “symbiotic”, relationship with algae living in their tissue. These algae supply vital nutrition to the host but are sensitive to environmental changes including increases in seawater temperature. […]

‘In Gulf corals, both the coral host and the associated algal partners need to withstand the high seawater temperatures,’ said Dr Wiedenmann who led the study.
But the scientists were surprised to discover that the algae in Gulf corals belong to a group not known for its thermal tolerance.
‘We see that the algae are indeed special but in a way that we did not expect,’ said Dr Wiedenmann. ‘The algae that we found in most of the corals in Abu Dhabi reefs were previously described as a ‘generalist strain’ that is usually not found in corals exposed to high levels of heat stress.’
‘The system seems to be more complex than it is commonly thought…’ “

How long have corals been around and what temperature extremes have they survived before? The results of the study are hardly a surprise.

"The demise of an entire ocean is almost too enormous to grasp, but as the expedition sails deeper into the Arctic, the colossal processes of breakdown are increasingly evident. The first fragment of ice appears off the starboard bow a few miles before the 79th parallel in the Fram strait, which lies between Greenland and the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard. The solitary floe is soon followed by another, then another, then clusters, then swarms, then entire fields of white crazy paving that stretch to the horizon. From deck level it is a stunning sight. But from high above, drones and helicopters capture the bigger, more alarming picture: a slow-motion blast pattern of frozen shrapnel radiating from the high Arctic southwards through this strait, which is the interchange of 80% of the water between the ice cap and the world’s oceans. This is where ice floes come to die, and the cemetery is filling faster each year, according to the leader of this scientific expedition, Till Wagner, of the University of North Carolina Wilmington (UNCW). One of the objectives of the expedition is to investigate why the collapse of Arctic ice is happening faster than climate computer models predict and to understand what this augurs for the rest of the planet.  The melt is not simply a seasonal process. The natural thaw that starts with spring’s warm weather is being amplified by manmade global heating. The Arctic has heated up by 2C above pre-industrial levels, twice the global average. Some hotspots, including parts of the Fram strait, have warmed by 4C. There are variations from year to year, but the trend is clear and accelerating. Sea ice is melting earlier in the spring and freezing later in the autumn. Each summer it thins more and recedes further, leaving greater expanses of the ocean exposed to 24-hour sunlight. This is driving back the frontiers of ice and fragmenting one of the planet’s most important climate regulators. It is also creating a series of feedbacks that are accelerating the Arctic melt. Several are only partially understood. The team and crew set out on the Greenpeace ships Arctic Sunrise and Esperanza from Svalbard’s port at Longyearbyen in May, less than a month after the sea ice reached yet another record low. At the start of the melt season, this is a fast-changing body of water. The Greenpeace crew say high winds and strong currents have pushed the ice front southwards by 50 miles in the last four days. The floes appear on the radar screen as a thickening swarm of yellow flies. When the bands of ice cannot be evaded, they are nosed aside by the prow, scraping the hull as we pass. Occasionally, they are smashed through with a clanging jolt. The combinations of shade and shape are endlessly varied: here an opal gorge, there an emerald grotto, some floes so perfectly rectangular they could have been cut with a guillotine, others as jagged as a Cornish coastline. Many surfaces are topped with snowy peaks or crenellations; others look as flat as a tennis court. Depending on the sea motion when it was formed, the ice can be frazilled into loose white ice crystals, pancaked into bluish layers, or dense, hard nilas so transparent that they appear to be black. But all the floes have one thing in common: they are steadily diminishing as they head south. On the surface you can see the outliers, tiny translucent chunks that are destined to shrink to the size of an ice cube before they finally melt into the Atlantic. Since the start of the satellite era in 1979, the summer Arctic has lost 40% of its extent and up to 70% of its volume, says Wagner. Other scientists calculate the rate of decline at 10,000 tonnes a second. Much of the multiyear ice is now gone. Most of what is left is the younger, thinner layer from the previous winter, which is easier for the sun to melt and the wind to push around. Wagner expects ice-free summers in 20 to 40 years, which would allow ships to cruise all the way to the north pole. Ice-free summers are 10 times more likely if the world warms by 2C rather than 1.5C, according to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The body of top international scientists said last year that the Arctic and coral reef systems were the ecosystems at greatest risk. The Fram strait is one of the few places in the Arctic where the ice extent has not declined, but that is probably not good news. One of the theories being tested on this trip is whether this is because more ice is being flushed through this channel. The pace of change is mindblowing, Wagner says. “What we are looking at is whether this exit is accelerating.” The team is also examining other processes to help gauge the health of the ocean and how it is changing. To get a baseline, they conduct tests at intervals along the 79th parallel. First, they identify a suitably sized floe, then an armed polar bear guard ensures there are no predators and checks the solidity of the ice. After the all-clear, a dozen or so scientists and volunteers pull up on motor dinghies to drill, measure, take water samples and extract cores. Every five metres a square trench is shovelled out of the surface snow down to the hard surface of the ice below. All the while, the floe drifts with the current and bobs gently in the swell. On the ship, crew members test the water at different depths for acidity, temperature, turbidity, dissolved oxygen and acidification. In the past, the data would have been related only to physics and chemistry, but there is a growing awareness of the crucial climate role played by marine organisms, so biologists are also part of this interdisciplinary team. They scan the horizon for whales, seals and walruses and use tightly meshed zooplankton nets to capture teeming masses of minute shrimp- and wormlike creatures. Far more than polar bears, these tiny creatures and the algae on which they graze play an essential role in not just the local ecosystem, but the global climate and food chain, according to a growing body of research. The largest synchronised movement of biomass on the planet is the vertical migration of zooplankton, which happens daily as the tiny creatures move from the depths to surface feeding waters. The area under the ice floes is such a rich source of nutrients that it has been described as an all-you-can-eat buffet for zooplankton. Researchers are discovering that the floes are home to an extraordinary variety and abundance of life, even during the four-month darkness of Arctic winter. Depending on how the ice is formed, it can be permeable and elastic, with space inside that can be colonised by bacteria, fungal spores and the tiny creatures that feed on them such as the transparent jellyfish Sympagohydra tuuli, which squeezes inside the cracks in the ice to hunt for food. The green and yellow shades at the base of floes indicate the presence of phytoplankton – algae that use sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into oxygen and energy. These are the pastures on which the zooplankton graze. Most important among them are copepods, a fat-filled staple in the diet of whales and fish. Together, millions of these species form an oceanic pump, says Mattias Cape, a biological oceanographer with the University of Washington. Phytoplankton help the oceans produce more oxygen than all the world’s forests. They also sequester carbon dioxide more effectively because copepods and the bigger creatures that eat them take the gas down to the depths, where it can be stored for hundreds of years. Nowhere is this pump more effective than near the poles – the zooplankton here are bigger, so they sink deeper. But this is changing. When Cape observes the zooplankton through a microscope in the hold of the ship, he can see that the chubby Arctic copepods have competition from their slimmer and shorter Atlantic counterparts. This invasion has been recorded in other parts of the ocean. “We see a shift from big to small, which is a concern, because it will make this pump action weaker,” he says. The study may help to explain why the Arctic is losing oxygen faster than almost anywhere on Earth. Another factor is that cold water absorbs more carbon dioxide, which gives it high levels of acidity. “We talk about the ocean being hot, sour and out of breath,” Cape says. If the Arctic were a patient, doctors would be alarmed by its vital signs. As well as hot flushes, asthma and contamination (the researchers are following up on studies that suggest the Fram strait has one of the highest levels of microplastics in the world), the ocean has also been diagnosed with a weakening of its immune system. For centuries, the Arctic’s distinctive character has been shaped by a layer of cold, relatively fresh water just below the surface, produced by melting ice and glaciers. This has insulated the sea ice from the warmer, denser, saltier waters of the Atlantic currents that flow in the depth. But this stratification is collapsing as temperatures rise. The oceanic shift was outlined in a landmark study published last year in Science, which found that the water density and temperature of the Fram strait and Barents Sea were increasingly like those of the Atlantic, while further east, Russia’s Laptev sea was starting to resemble what the Barents used to be. “The polar front is shifting,” the lead author, Dr Sigrid Lind, of the Institute of Marine Science and the University of Bergen, told the Guardian this year. “The Arctic as we know it is about to become history. It will go when stratification breaks down completely and the Atlantic takes over the whole region.” This has not happened for more than 12,000 years, but the shift is well under way. First to succumb, according to Lind, will be the Barents Sea, which will have no fresh water by 2040, then the Kara sea. The consequences will be far-reaching. The food chain is already affected. Atlantic species of cod, herring and mackerel are moving northwards. For the next 20 to 30 years this could boost fishing catches, but forecasts by Norway suggest boom will turn to bust later as the waters grow too warm for fish larvae. There are signs elsewhere in the Arctic that the arrival of smaller Atlantic copepods may be associated with a decline in the whale populations that rely on them. This is not yet certain. It may be possible for whales simply to eat more. But Heather Koopman, a marine physiological ecologist at UNCW, says she is concerned that the speed of change is outstripping some species’ ability to evolve. “The bowhead whale, for example, can live for 200 years, so some are having to adapt to a modern climate with faculties developed in the Georgian age,” Koopman says. “Things are moving far too rapidly for them to keep up. Perhaps small invertebrates can cope with year to year because their breeding cycles come round more quickly. But for a 200-year-old whale, how can they change that fast? Things are so accelerated.” For humanity, the biggest impact is on the weather. The area between the cold pole and the warm equator is a ramp that propels weather fronts across continents. Its incline has always varied from season to season as the icecap expands in winter and shrinks in summer, providing a global pulse that pumps sea and air currents around the world. But that frozen heartbeat is warming and weakening as the Arctic becomes more like the Atlantic. Lind speculates that ocean destratification is the key driver for ice loss, which in turn affects the jet stream, weakens the polar vortex and can lead to heatwaves in the southern US and cold weather extremes in Asia. “The rules of the game are changing. We seem to be seeing large-scale weather pattern changes connected to the shrinking Arctic. As the Arctic becomes history, we need to understand how it affects the globe.” Such concerns are part of the motive for a new wave of international research. From September a German research vessel, Polar Stern, will drift across the north pole and be frozen into the ice over the winter so that 600 scientists can conduct tests billed as the biggest ever study of the Arctic. Norway has just launched a new icebreaker, the Kronprins Haakon, which will embark on a series of trips over the next six years in conjunction with Birmingham University to examine ocean acidification and food chain contamination. “This area has been ice-covered and will change once the trawlers move in,” says Marit Reigstad, of the Arctic University of Norway. “We need to know more before we do anything. We need to develop new laws and regulations for the area.” Greenpeace is calling for the central Arctic to be declared a protected marine area. On World Oceans Day on Saturday, campaigners will rally outside parliaments in several countries to demand a new global treaty to end the overexploitation of the high seas. The US, China, Russia, Canada and Korea are more focused on the commercial and strategic opportunities that are emerging as the Arctic melts and opens. Fishing, mining, tourism and cargo shipping could profit, but any gains will be far outweighed by the costs of a diminished Arctic. A recent study found melting permafrost alone would cause $70tn of damage, 10 times the expected revenue from resource extraction and new trade routes. Adding further to that enormous, existential reckoning could be other feedback loops that are now being investigated. Among them is the possible loss of the Arctic’s soothing influence on the northern seas. Bands of ice buffer the waves. Inside the floes, the ship’s passage is far smoother. Wagner speculates that when this calming barrier melts away, the swells will churn the ocean and bring warm water to the surface, which could further accelerate the fragmentation of the polar cap. It is yet another potentially grim area of study, but he views it – like other signs of the Arctic’s demise – with professional composure. “Emotionally, I detach myself,” he says. “The Arctic is an object of study. It’s like a doctor observing a patient to see how sick they are.” He is reluctant to offer a prognosis without a longer-term study, but he says the physics make a recovery extremely unlikely. “I have to hurry up or my science will become archaeology,” the 34-year-old jokes. “There will still be sea ice during the winter, but in the summer it will probably disappear. It won’t be the death of the Arctic, but will be the end of the Arctic as we know it.” • This article was amended on 12 June 2019 because an earlier version referred to the Nansen Legacy as a new icebreaker that Norway had launched. That meant to say the Kronprins Haakon; the Nansen Legacy is an Arctic research project. This has been corrected."
"Canada’s handling of toxic chemicals and industrial waste shows a “blatant disregard for Indigenous rights”, a UN human rights expert has said following an extensive fact-finding mission in the country. Baskut Tuncak, the special rapporteur on toxic chemicals, called on Canada to improve its monitoring of hazardous materials in the country – and to better engage with the Indigenous people who live near harmful pollution.  Tuncak spent two weeks touring areas of concern across the country, including the county’s infamous tar sands and the Indigenous community of Grassy Narrows, which has fought for more than five decades to have toxic mercury removed from its waters. He released his preliminary findings on Thursday in Ottawa. Despite the vast geographic scope of his mission, a common element in many of the most troubling areas of contamination was their proximity to Indigenous communities. Numerous communities were unable access to clean drinking water, while others had elevated levels of toxins in the water and soil. At the Aamjiwnaang First Nation in Ontario, Tuncak found the community surrounded by chemical facilities. He told the Guardian: “I was struck by the incredible proximity of the affected First Nation to dozens of intense chemical production and processing facilities, which resulted in incredible releases of pollution and waste affecting the [residents’] health.” While the Canadian government has made attempts at reconciliation, the efforts still fall short of respecting basic human rights, he said, and fail to honour the numerous international treaties to which Canada is a signatory. “The government has taken steps to acknowledge the so-called ‘sins of the past’ and to increase engagement with Indigenous peoples,” said Tuncak. “But I also heard deeply troubling examples where the economic interests continue to have supremacy over Indigenous rights.” While much of his focus remained on the impact toxic emissions have on marginalized communities, Tuncak also rejected arguments made by the province of Alberta that its oil is among the world’s most environmentally friendly and ethical. “Based on what I saw first hand, the government can’t make the assertions that the tar sands are environmentally sound and that they’re an ethical source of petroleum products and energy.” He points to lack of data over contamination of water supplies. He also took aim at Canadian companies operating abroad, a number of which have been accused of turning a blind eye to human rights abuses. “The environmental footprint of these companies and the devastation that has been brought on water resources and the attachments these communities have to the lands on which Canadian businesses are operating needs further attention.” Despite witnessing a handful of bright spots on his trip, including Ontario’s closure of its coal plants and Quebec’s limits on asbestos, he said a greater effort is neededto address the damaging impacts of toxic waste on vulnerable groups. “It’s a question of political will. Canada has the financial ability and the technical capacity to do things better. It still lags behind many of its peers in terms of industrialized countries,” said Tuncak. “When it comes to environmental performance, its record on compliance leaves a lot of room for improvement.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s catastrophe-obsessed weekly Die Zeit is now claiming that climate models have in fact predicted long temperature stagnation after all. Suddenly, periods of temperature stagnation are showing up in models, climate scientists are discovering.
Last week, I wrote about how a Swiss climate modeller had suddenly discovered temperature stagnations in the models, and tried to claim this showed the model warming scenarios were right on track after all.
Now the catastrophe junkies at Die Zeit news magazine here have joined in. Until just a few months ago, Die Zeit had been telling us just the opposite: things were warming faster than ever!
In its latest article, Die Zeit writes that “climate skeptics are jubilant that the IPCC models are faulty”and that on the other hand Prof. Jochem Marotzke, Director of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg and IPCC author, vehemently scorns the skeptics for being so, insisting the climate catastrophe is coming:
“We are completely sure that at the end of the 21st century it’ll be warmer than today. However, the path to that point is simply not a straight line that follows CO2 concentration.”
Die Zeit writes (my emphasis):
Indeed such temperature plateaus have occurred also in the climate models; only the exact time of their occurrence is difficult to predict.”
Die Zeit goes on and explains that the temperature stagnation is caused by “external factors like volcano eruptions” and also”chaotic fluctuations in the atmosphere and oceans”, citing La-Niña and El-Niño-events, ocean currents, etc.
For 15 years in a row?
Next Die Zeit quotes Marotzke, who actually contradicts Die Zeit, saying the current stagnation is in fact a mystery:
Also the question of how long the plateau will persist and what happens afterwards cannot be answered at this time.”
Well, why not? The models are supposed to do that. Now you say they can’t. You can’t see what lies ahead for the next few decades? Unbelievable.
If the models had included all the factors, like the WELL-KNOWN solar cycles and the WELL-KNOWN ocean cycles, as Fritz Vahrenholt and Sebastian Lüning did in their book Die kalte Sonne, the models would have at least come up with the current stagnation. Moreover, the IPCC models would have seen that the stagnation would last until 2040. Now they are left standing there desperate for an explanation.
The solar and ocean cycles were known to the modellers years ago, but they were ignored, covered up, and swept out of sight. A reasonable model showing no warming until 2040 was the last thing they wanted the public to see. It would have taken all the alarm out of issue. If there ever was a case for organized scientific fraud and deception, then this is it. THEY KNEW OF THE NATURAL CYCLES YEARS AGO!
Jochem Marotzke and Die Zeit still hope to keep the charade going, insisting that we believe the heat is there – somewhere! Die Zeit writes:
That the surface temperature is currently stagnating does not mean in any case that global warming has taken a break, says Marotzke. To the contrary: The warming is just taking place somewhere else – in the oceans.”

Marotzke and Die Zeit now sound worse than slippery used-car salesmen.
Unfortunately there’s no data to support this – anywhere. Even Die Zeit admits it:
In any case, climate scientists cannot say for sure where the warming really is. ‘The measurement system for this is just not sufficient enough,’ says Marotzke. 3000 buoys have been in use only a few years now, within the scope of the global ocean observation systems (GOOS) – they sink only to a depth of about 2000 meters. Thus it cannot be proven whether the deep ocean is warming strongly or not.”
Die Zeit later in the article winds up admitting that the scientists really don’t have a clue at all as to what’s going on, writing that some scientists blame the current stagnation on aerosols, or “reduced water vapor concentration in the stratosphere”. Consensus is non-existent more than ever.
Marotzke also answers questions on why the IPCC 5AR models failed to foresee the 15-year plateau:
With these long-term climate models, you can’t expect such short-term plateaus to be predicted at the right times.”
Well, not using your kind of science. Die Zeit adds:
You simply don’t throw a climate model into the dustbin just because it fails to preceisely predict the weather in one year.”
That’s true. One only does that when it fails 15 years in a row!
“Many of us are now amazed climate is not linear”
Die Zeit finally tells its readers that the climate system is far from being understood and brings in Prof. Mojib Latif of the Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research in Kiel, Germany to answer some questions. Latif, also an IPCC lead-author, has spent 90% of his time over the last years calculating natural climate fluctuations (see, he knew). Die Zeit writes:
In any case, Latif admits that we have underestimated ‘how important it is to communicate the importance of natural climate fluctuations’.”
That’s an understatement. You guys never bothered to put these “important natural fluctuations” in the models. You were too damn obsessed with keeping the level of alarm elevated. This all reeks of intentional deceit.
Die Zeit adds:
The science often simplified things too much and reduced graphics to mean values. That’s why many of us got the impression that climate is always linear – and now are amazed that this does not correspond to reality.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Carbon Cycle, Nature or Nurture – Part 2
By Ed Caryl
In the last post, The Carbon Cycle, Nature or Nurture, sea surface temperatures were shown to have a large influence on CO2 rise in the atmosphere. This influence is so large, that changes in fossil fuel burning cannot be seen. In this article, the sea surface temperature influence will be subtracted to examine what remains in a continued search for man’s impact.
To begin that search, the first step is to annualize the sea surface temperature and the change in CO2. This results in Figure 1.

Figure 1 shows the annualized data for sea surface temperature and CO2 change.
 
Figure 2 is a scatter diagram of annualized SST anomaly versus CO2 change. Note the R2 value near 0.69.
1960 is near the beginning of the modern rise in CO2 that concerns everyone. It is assumed for this exercise that the sea surface temperature before the CO2 rise began was 0.1°C below the temperature anomaly baseline, and that the SST trend of 0.0105°C equals the CO2 trend of 0.0542 Gigatons per year. With those values assumed, the SST influence can be subtracted, resulting in Figure 3.

Figure 3 is the change in CO2 with SST influence subtracted.
The features on the blue trace are dominated by volcanic activity. From left to right, the negative, cooling peaks are due to Mt. Agung in 1962 to 1964, Fuego in 1971 and 1975, Mt. St. Helens in 1980, El Chichon in 1982 to 1984, Mt Pinatubo in 1991 to 1993, and a cluster of volcanoes in 2000 to 2002, dominated by Soufriere Hills and Nyamiragira. All these were large stratospheric sulphur dioxide sources. Mt Pinatubo was the largest, injecting 20 Megatons of SO2 into the atmosphere.
Oh yes, I nearly forgot. What about man’s influence?

Figure 4: Man’s influence on CO2 in the atmosphere after subtracting SST. R2 = 0.019.
That near zero R2 illustrates that man’s changing carbon emissions do not appear in the overall CO2 data, especially after removing SST influence. Man’s contribution is totally absorbed in the biosphere in real-time. There is no anthropogenic signature. Any carbon emission change is invisible in SST driven change and the continuous noise provided by volcanoes. There is no persistence, no CO2 lifetime beyond the present year. Man does not add to the load. All the “green” efforts are silly, misguided, but hideously expensive exercises in futility. Nature is producing all the CO2, and when the sun stops driving sea surface temperatures, CO2 will fall again.
“The true beauty of nature is her amplitude; she exists neither for nor because of us, and possesses a staying power that all our nuclear arsenals cannot threaten (much as we can easily destroy our puny selves).”
Stephen Jay Gould, in Bully for Brontosaurus (1991), Prologue

Share this...FacebookTwitterWe know that according to the catastrophe-obsessed nut-jobs, everything bad is enhanced or caused by global warming. So this won’t surprise you.
A new journal article appearing in Oceanography by scientists Charles H. Greene, Jennifer Francis und Bruce Monger at Cornell University now suggests that Hurricane Sandy was related to human-caused climate change. The article is short, and is worth reading just for the laughs.

Hurricane Sandy was just too weird to not have been caused by AGW, scientists suggest. Photo source: http://www.nnvl.noaa.gov/GOESEast.php, public domain photo.
According to the journal article, the relatively open late summer waters in the Arctic disturbs the Arctic polar Jet Stream and thus causes weird weather down in the middle latitudes. The scientists write that Sandy did not lose strength after making landfall “because it was supercharged with energy derived from a southward dip in the jet stream over the Mississippi Valley that ushered in an invasion of cold Arctic air (Figure 1).”
Of course nobody is going to dispute how the course and strength of Sandy developed. That’s well-documented. But to say that the weather patterns that led to Sandy’s development were due to human caused global warming indicates a science that is desperately clinging to life.

As evidence of a link to global warming, the authors say that Sandy taking a sharp turn west was “something never observed before in records going back to 1851”. In other words because the weather did not behave normally, global warming had to have been behind it. Moreover, the authors write: “To literally top it off, the storm surge combined with full-moon high tides and huge ocean waves to produce recordhigh water levels that exceeded the worst-case predictions for certain parts of New York City.”
Almost in comic fashion, the authors also attempt to pre-emptively defend themselves against the expected (well-deserved) criticism, basically saying that Sandy’s behavior and the weather patterns surrounding the storm were so unususual that it had to be have been due to the global warming-induced Arctic ice melt.
And maybe so was that freak car accident that occurred on last weekend’s icy streets.
They reason:
Although a direct causal link has not been established…perhaps the likelihood of greenhouse warming playing a significant role in Sandy’s evolution as an extra-tropical superstorm is at least as plausible as the idea that this storm was simply a freak of nature.”
This today passes as science. Sad.

Revkin actually published the content of that e-mail at the the New York Times Dot Earth site here (scroll down to comments).
Here’s the comment left by Revkin, quoting Annan’s e-mail (emphasis added):
The climate scientist James Annan sent these thoughts by email:
‘Well, the press release is a bit strange, because it sounds like it is talking about the Aldrin et al paper which was published some time ago, to no great fanfare. I don’t know if they have a further update to that.
Anyway, there have now been several recent papers showing much the same – numerous factors including: the increase in positive forcing (CO2 and the recent work on black carbon), decrease in estimated negative forcing (aerosols), combined with the stubborn refusal of the planet to warm as had been predicted over the last decade, all makes a high climate sensitivity increasingly untenable. A value (slightly) under 2 is certainly looking a whole lot more plausible than anything above 4.5.’

"Al Gore says Australia’s government, like his own, remains “in thrall to” the fossil fuel industry. But the former US vice-president has not lost hope, believing economic realities may ultimately force even the most obstinate of governments into creating policy capable of addressing the global climate emergency. If anything was to break the spell of the “dinosaur” industries, Gore said, it was simple economics.  “The United States and Australia have some things in common,” he told Guardian Australia in Brisbane. “Both have national governments that are in thrall to the dirty fossil industries of the past. “Both have dynamic business communities which are impatient with the obsolete ideas of governments that are dominated by special interests in one sector of the economy and both are experiencing the benefits of the sustainability revolution. “Electricity from solar and wind continues to drop rapidly [in price] and no lobbyist is going to be able to change that. They can’t make coal clean and they can’t make renewables go away. “So, they are kind of in the position of Wily E Coyote whose legs are moving furiously, even as he goes off the cliff, waiting for the pull of gravity to pull him down into the canyon below. That is an oft-used visual metaphor but it is appropriate here.” The renowned climate advocate arrived in Queensland to lead the Climate Reality Project’s training conference, an event aimed at training advocates on how to address the climate crisis, in what has proved somewhat awkward timing for the state Labor government. Federal Labor’s poor showing in Queensland, which subsequently contributed to Bill Shorten losing an election he was widely tipped to win, resulted in a swift reversal of the Palaszczuk government’s attitude towards the Adani coalmine, which, after years of delay, could now be approved as early as next week. During a visit to Sydney in 2017, Gore said Australia and Queensland faced a choice – the Great Barrier Reef or coal – with Adani’s Carmichael mine project having become the symbol for Queensland’s future as a coal economy. Labor’s federal election loss sent the state government running for the reset button. On Friday the premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, will host an event with Gore while attempting to walk both sides of the climate line – embracing Adani in the face of rising greenhouse emissions in Australia and a commitment from her government to transition to cleaner energy. But Gore maintains the Adani mine does not make sense. “I am not an expert, but all of the people that I have consulted … have come to the conclusion that the economic analysis makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, even without calculating a cost for all of the pollution that is involved,” he said. “I spend time in India and I have taken care to analyse what is happening in the market for coal [and] electricity. “Electricity from solar farms in India is now significantly cheaper than electricity from coal, some of the leading business experts in India have said you would have to have your head examined if you invested in coal in India today, so I would just say again, I am not an expert, but I have read enough and learned enough to have serious questions about the economic feasibility of the project.” As for why Gautam Adani would want to move forward under those economic circumstances, Gore says that is a question only the man himself can answer. “Maybe he has some notion that the Indian government would bail him out, or the Australian government would bail him out. I have no idea – you would have to ask him.” But he said Australia had a responsibility to enact a climate policy that seriously and sensibly addressed the crisis facing the planet – not just for its own future economic prosperity, but also for other nations which looked to it for guidance – the countries the prime minister, Scott Morrison, has taken to calling “family”. “Australia is one of the ground zero countries for the impacts of the climate crisis and other nations, in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond, often follow the values and leadership of Australia and, insofar as this is the most serious challenge facing global civilisation, all of the countries that punch above their weight have an extra responsibility to provide leadership on this issue,” Gore said. “Secondly, as many are aware, Australia can become the renewable energy superpower of the 21st century by exporting renewable electricity and hydrogen produced by extremely cheap electricity in the off-hours, here in Australia. “But a decision to allow the dirty fossil industries of the past to completely control the policy decisions of the national government would sacrifice the fantastic opportunities for the 21st century economy Australia could lead.” And if the “Book of Revelation” weather events, growing poverty and population displacement facing the world didn’t sound the alarm bells, Gore was hopeful another tenet of the developed world, just might. “I think that the basic economic realities could yet lead even the present government to re-examine what is in the best interests of the people of Australia,” he said. “The cost of electricity from solar and wind continues to plummet. Australia remains the sunniest country in the world with the greatest solar resource and one of the best wind resources. And some new entrepreneurs in Australia may yet take the reins in the business community.” But Gore was sensitive to the factors that led central and north Queensland, as well as northern Tasmania, parts of regional New South Wales and Western Australia to swing away from the Labor party, despite its promise of a more sustainable climate policy and lower power prices. He said it would be a mistake not to acknowledge the “great debt” Australia and other nations owed to coal industry workers for building the economy throughout the past century. But he said Australia, like the US, owed those workers and their communities “realistic and practical programs for job training and job placements in better jobs than the ones that used to exist in the coal industry”. “Almost no one who really spends time with the economic data believes that those jobs will be practical in this new century,” he said. “We [the US] are closing coal plants right and left. We are now beginning to close gas plants, to replace them with solar and wind. In the state of Texas there is so much wind electricity the new rate plans make electricity totally free from 9pm to 6am the next morning. How are fossil fuels going to compete with free? How are they going to compete with clean? The answer is – I don’t think they can. “But where these employees are concerned, we owe them better jobs. We owe them a realistic set of options and plans, to move on into the future, with safe, clean good paying jobs that they deserve.” Despite Australia’s failure over the past decade to commit to a sustainable and effective climate policy, which included the demise of at least three prime ministers, Gore remained optimistic a solution would be found. “I don’t think that this is an issue where anyone can afford to give up hope,” he said. “Sometimes, difficult transitions take more time than you think they will. But then they happen quicker than you thought they could. And I think both in the US and Australia, the carbon polluters have thrown so much money into their project to delay the recognition of reality, that they’re just about to run out their string. “So for those who hope for a brighter future, don’t give up. Change is coming.”"

"A favourite sport of the anti-green lobby is hunting out the climate hypocrites. It’s Emma Thompson’s lifestyle that has most recently been the subject of frenzied scrutiny after the actress addressed the Extinction Rebellion protest in London a few weeks ago. “Emma Thompson the first-class hypocrite!” blared one tabloid headline last month after she was spotted dining on beef carpaccio while flying first class to New York. So before I say any more about the lifestyle changes required to avoid catastrophic climate change, I’m going to hold my hands up. I’m a climate hypocrite. I care about the climate emergency. When I decided I couldn’t support Labour in the European elections, because of its Brexit position, I voted Green instead. But I’m ashamed to say I’m not great at applying my ballot-box behaviour to other areas of my life. The last time I ate red meat was last night. I’m heading to Gatwick to catch a flight after writing this.  There are those admirable saints who really do practise what they preach, but I’d bet most of those who profess to care about the planet are just as hypocritical as me. I don’t think it makes us bad people, just typically, fallibly human, lacking the willpower to do the stuff we know we ought, such as shedding a few pounds or putting away more in our pension. In the UK, we’ve already done the (relatively) painless stuff – closing coal power stations – when it comes to reducing emissions. The next frontier is stuff that is either expensive – ditching gas boilers and switching to electric cars – or requires us to change the way we live. That will certainly involve eating less meat, the production of which accounts for 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions, more than all the world’s cars, ships, trains and planes put together. Beef is by far the worst culprit: one study recommended cutting global consumption by 90%. It’s naive to think that we can achieve these sorts of lifestyle shifts by imploring people to do more. I already know we’re fast approaching a catastrophic climate tipping point and yet I’m just not very good at forgoing a steak, particularly when I know plenty of others won’t be either. The power of nudge is also limited here: shoving the steak further down the menu isn’t going to make me less likely to order it. So public policy inevitably ends up with sin taxes as the go-to policy lever for trying to get us to switch away from the bad stuff. Sure enough, a meat tax has been mooted. But the big problem with green taxes is that they hit the least affluent hardest. It’s people on low incomes who are most sensitive to marginal increases in the cost of their food and flights and who might decide they can’t afford their one holiday a year as a result. But it’s the very well-off who can much more easily absorb the cost of green taxes who do the bulk of the polluting: the richest 10% of households in the UK produce four times as many emissions as those in the bottom 50. That’s one reason why a jury set up by the Food Ethics Council rejected the idea of a meat tax last week. But, perhaps counterintuitively, I think the inevitable rise of the climate hypocrite – as awareness grows of just how much destruction we are set to wreak on the planet, but people still can’t quite bring themselves to pass up a Sunday roast or the holiday at the end of that budget flight – is a cause for optimism. I want to do more, but I know I need someone to force me to take my carbon footprint more seriously. And perhaps that means people will become more willing to countenance something more radical, but fairer, than sin taxes: saying there’s only a certain amount of meat or air miles we’re going to consume as a population every year and once it’s gone, it’s gone. Rationing is evocative of wartime Britain, when the amount of everything from petrol to sugar to eggs that each person was allowed to consume was tightly controlled. It commanded public support as part of the collective war effort. That support might be much harder to win when we’re not at war, but along with microbial resistance (a whole other disaster-movie plotline) the climate crisis is the biggest existential threat facing mankind. Maybe the Blitz spirit does have some contemporary relevance. Rationing to tackle the climate crisis could be given a modern-day makeover. People could be allocated polluting credits to cover activities such as meat eating and flying that they can sell and buy in an online marketplace. If you’re short of cash, or not that bothered about eating meat or flying abroad, you can feel smug as you sell your credits to someone who is, which makes this far more equitable than green taxes. And setting a population-level limit on something such as meat consumption would create huge incentives for companies to invest more in the production of things such as environmentally friendly, lab-grown meat. It’s not a new idea; in fact, in the mid 2000s, David Miliband waxed lyrical about personal carbon “credit cards” when he was environment secretary. But the government later distanced itself from the idea, coyly calling it an idea “ahead of its time”, to strident criticism from a group of cross-party MPs. A decade on, it’s surely an idea whose time has come. The climate school strikes show the next generation is hungry for more radical action. Sure, the hypocrite-hunters will balk at the prospect of rationing to save the planet. But I’m optimistic that more of us will come to see that it’s going to take something more drastic than trying to persuade people to voluntarily scale back to whip us into shape. • Sonia Sodha is chief leader writer at the Observer"

Share this...FacebookTwitterJoe Bastardi’s Weatherbell page here features the latest “Saturday Summary´, something I now look forward to every week.
First in North America, weather models at about the 2:45 mark show that things could get awfully brutal for an extended period. Already the 7 – 14 day forecast looks ugly:


Chart sources: National Centers for Environmental Prediction wxmaps.org/html
Joe calls it “a heck of a weather period coming up”.
Here in Europe we’ve had a nice spell of mild weather since Christmas-time, and some of you may be thinking of getting started already on some springtime chores. Well, don’t put the snow shovels and antifreeze away just yet. Models have been converging on and are pointing to another “Beast from the East” getting poised to shock-freeze the continent.

It’s too early to say just how brutal it may get. But should a protracted, deep cold develop, then it’ll be interesting to see how Germany’s now vulnerable electricity grid will hold up. A number of institute’s have been warming that if the winter turns hard, Germany’s power grid could collapse – thanks to the huge gap in baseload capacity left by the German government’s hasty shutdown of 8 nuclear reactors in the wake of Fukushima in 2011.
Here’s the Weatherbell chart for early-mid February:

Chart source: weatherbell.com/
Of course 30-day general forecasts are nothing certain, and things could develop differently. But should anything like this indeed develop, then look at the cold headed for Germany, Eastern and Central Europe. I really do hope they have every source of electricity generation ready on standby because they are going to need it.
Germany’s leaders, in my view, have been playing an irresponsible game of Russian Roulette with its citizens when it comes the nation’s power grid and supply, winging it and praying they’ll somehow eek by another winter. This winter they may not be so lucky. I can see the headlines already.
Enjoy the last few remaining days of mild weather. After that, hope that the Beast from the East shows a little compassion. Unfortunately, Mother Nature rarely does so.

Where’s David Viner when you need him?
The northern hemisphere is experiencing near record high snow cover, Moscow just got buried by record snow, today Boston faces record snow, and now ski resorts in France are shutting down because of too much snow!
English language The Local here reports that “most ski resorts pray for heavy snow each winter but the people of Cauterets in the French Pyrénées may have overdone it this year. The resort had to close this week after seven metres of snow fell in recent weeks. Sixty workers at the resort, stationed 1,800 metres high in the mountains, have been working around the clock to try and clear away the snow so the resort can reopen on Friday.”
Continue reading snow causes closure of french ski resort here.
Viner isn’t the only climate scientist goofball in Europe who predicted snow would become rare. Professor Mojib Latif of Germany also made a similar claim (Spiegel Online) in 2000, copycatting Viner:
Winters with strong frosts and lots of snow like we had 20 years ago will no longer exist at out latitudes.”

Latif in fact has made a number of spectacular predictions, as the following German YouTube video shows:

Latif’s prediction in 2009 for Germany in 2050:
“Temperature s will reach 50°C!”
In 1990 Latif said:
“By 2050 global temperatures may rise 3 – 4°C“.
But in 1997 he said:
“Winters will be ice cold for the next 20 years!”
It reminds me of what baseball commentator Bob Uecker once said of Michael Jordan trying to play Major League Baseball: “Keep swinging, eventually the ball will hit the bat!”

"Retirement used to be thought of as a soft slide into a more peaceful life. After a lifetime of hard grind, the daydream went, retirees would gratefully swap the office for a potting shed, a suit for slippers and commuting for a cruise. But the face of protest has changed. From environmental issues to this week’s protests against Donald Trump, older people are often at the forefront, not just taking to the streets but taking direct, radical action.  It makes perfect sense: many older people are concerned about leaving a better world for their grandchildren. Others feel liberated from fears that their career and CVs could be damaged by political action. Older activists can say what they want and take risks they wouldn’t have dared to when a family, a mortgage and a career relied on them keeping their nose clean. But the baby boomers, who helped remake society in the 1960s and 70s – through feminism, anti-discrimination battles, the rights of disabled people, equal pay, the climate crisis and the rights of the LGBT community – were always likely to be more passionate about politics and protests than their parents’ generation. Equipped with unprecedented amounts of time, money and motivation – and with longer and healthier lifespans – this new generation of retirees are leading the way. When I woke up at 1.30am on 14 June 2017 and ran over to Grenfell Tower, I had never seen such a horrific and scary thing in my life. I come from South Africa. Apartheid bred violence, and I had seen people stabbed, shot and killed. But this was far, far worse. I stood there and cried and cried and cried. I’m the project manager for Justice4Grenfell. My job is to build relationships with the trade unions and I work endlessly to get not just the unions to affiliate with us, but other groups, too. I have a lot of anger in my work. Anger can be destructive but I channel mine. I focus it and, when appropriate, I broker peace so that we can move forward to our goals. These are seeing those responsible for Grenfell prosecuted and creating a legacy for the next generation so they won’t be subject to the same regulations, attitudes to housing, racism and anti-immigration feelings. I came to the UK when I was 23. I was a teacher but, eight years later, in 1987, I joined the Socialist Workers’ party and, since then, have campaigned on all the big issues and local ones, too. Getting older has had a big impact on my campaigning. As an older woman, you lose all that self-consciousness about being seen, about wanting to please people and about fearing authority. That means you can be far more radical, speak truth to power. It also gives you a much more steely determination. Ageing also means that, as an activist, I have lots of life experience to pull on. I have a broader picture and a more thoughtful approach. But I’m less idealistic. When I was younger, I would probably have refused to talk to, say, a Tory councillor. Now, I know I have to engage. I’m never shocked – which means I can focus on the fight. I lived through the racism of the 70s and 80s, so I can say that one reason the Grenfell survivors and campaigners are not being listened to is because of racism: it’s because we’re not white. I’m confident to say that because I’ve lived it. I can call it, and I do. I took part in Extinction Rebellion’s occupation in Blackfriars last November. It was my first experience of direct action, but I had decided I had to do something dramatic because the environment is in a state of such crisis. When the bridges protest didn’t make any headlines, a few of us decided we needed to do something more attention-grabbing. I was one of those who stripped naked at the door of the public gallery at the House of Commons to delay the police reaching the protesters gluing themselves to the gallery. The police had to escort me out, giving the glue time to dry. I would not have done this when I was younger. I deferred to authority too much. But it’s easy for me now: I have nothing to lose. If they want to put me in jail, they can put me in jail. Because of my age, I feel responsible for being part of a system that has got us to this place of environmental crisis. I also know what a short time there is to do anything about this because I measure it against my own life. Being older helps the protest, too. I think it helps the public empathise when they see mature faces at the front of the protest. We’re harder to dismiss than students. Retiring from his job as a trade unionist in London in 1982, Schindler moved to Italy, the country he landed in as a soldier in the British army in 1944. His subsequent effort to identify, for their families, the places where fellow servicemen perished in battle won him an MBE and was made into a film. I’ve been fighting since before the EU referendum result for justice because the vote was discriminatory and illegal. I, and more than 1 million other British expatriates, were denied a vote because of the 15-year time limit on British expats being able to register as overseas voters. My age gives me a big advantage: I’ve been up this road before. The fact that I was around in 1933 as Hitler and Germany rose to power means that I can see the analogy between then and now: between this division, between all the political powers and what happened then in Germany. My age has not had the slightest impact on my brain power. When we get a new government in Britain, I’m going to send my letter again to demand that the promise to give expats a vote made by David Cameron, the Queen and included in the Tory manifesto is finally fulfilled. I’m not giving up on this. There’s no chance of that.” I was an art teacher and had always been politically aware, but as a teacher you just don’t have any spare time. When Jo Cox was murdered three years ago, that was the starting point. I just thought we should be doing more to bring people together and, by sheer fluke, somebody I knew through my regular choir said they were going to start up a street choir to sing at political gatherings. It’s called Canwyr Stryd Bangor Street Singers. A group went to London to join the climate crisis demonstration and we did something for the youth climate strike on Bangor High Street at the end of May. Peace is the common thread. I wish I’d done it before, but I’m glad I’m able to do it now. As long as I’ve got breath I’m going to be saying something, to change people’s minds, hopefully. We don’t want to be strident, but sometimes you need to be. On Monday, a core group of 10 to 20 of us will be singing loud and clear against Trump in Bangor, for about an hour. I think he represents all the worst aspects of our society so I think it’s important to protest against him. We’ll be handing out song sheets so people can join in and sing with us. My husband, David, says he’d rather poke his eyes out than sing, but he’ll come along and hold banners. And he’s good at shouting. I officially retired 10 years ago, but my phone never stops ringing. My age has made me more effective and focused. I’m also keener to collaborate and look back rather than just running around and looking forward. That means I plan better: I’m not just reactive. I’m the Birmingham coordinator of the BAME group of the Labour party and I’m chairing their Windrush day of action on 22 June. I’m chair of the Momentum black committee, a member of the Birmingham foster carers association, the Justin Webster campaign, and the Black Activists Rising Against Cuts group. I’m heavily involved in my church and my community. I also help anyone who is in trouble and can’t afford legal fees. These days I’m less headstrong and I think about my legacy in terms of acting strategically to develop young people. Because my head is not so hot now, I can talk to young people in a lighter way that’s more productive than when I was more radical and just wanted people to do what I wanted them to do. Now I’m more holistic: if I can teach younger people what I know now, they can apply it as they want to as they go through life. I intend to carry on as long as I possibly can – for as long as I see injustice and see how I can help young people. I’m just an ordinary working-class woman. My husband, Terry, and I planned to retire together in 2017 when I was 60 and Terry was 67. That was the star in the sky for us. Then, when I was 58, a woman at work said I wouldn’t be able to collect my pension until I was 66. I didn’t think it could be true: I’d received no letter or notification. Terry and I were horrified to discover she was right. I worked on for a bit but the arthritis was making it harder all the time. Then I found the BackTo60 campaign on the computer and realised I wasn’t alone. I knew nothing of social media. I thought Twitter was for the birds and tablets were what you took for high blood pressure. Now I’m on it all the time, rallying the group, arranging and organising. I write to my MP, I ring radio stations, Terry and I regularly go to London for the rallies. In October 2017, Terry had a heart attack. He’s never been ill a day in his life: it’s the stress of this struggle that caused it. I retired when he got ill but I’m constantly fighting. I should be kicking back and relaxing but instead, I’m ageing and raging. I wake up angry and I go to bed angry. The government has stolen £50,000 from me in these six years. This fight is being waged by widows, by women with sick husbands and by women with their own failing health. These should be our golden years but we’re having to waste them by fighting for what is rightfully ours. I experienced my first arrest at an Extinction Rebellion protest at Easter. I was a psychotherapist but now, as an older person with pensions, I am able to support all sorts of excellent innovative environmental projects. I’ve become highly politicised in my retirement. I’ve done non-violent direct action (NVDA) training, funerals for the future, “die-ins” in city centres, leafletting outside banks and stalls in my local marketplace to spread information. Preparing for the mass rebellion in London in April was nerve-racking. We set up an affinity group and met in my home to prepare for how the police would behave: would we be kettled, would they bring horses to trample us, would enough other rebels turn out? But, in fact, all went wonderfully well. I had made the decision at my NVDA training to be an “arrestable”, and three of our group were indeed arrested. I was treated well by the remarkably youthful police constables sent to arrest us. My arresting constable showed me pictures of his baby daughter and we shook hands warmly when he left me in my cell: we had come to respect each other. I am sure being older helped, although my ageing bones found the bench very hard and I was continually worried about my bad back. I am very happy to carry on putting my liberty on the line for such a great cause.  Additional reporting by Leo Benedictus."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe local Austrian daily Vorarlberg Online has a summary of this year’s winter in terms of costs for its region, written by Geraldine Rainer. She writes that the winter of 2012/13 has been an expensive one for the state and municipalities.

Arlberg. Photo released into the public domain by its author, Johnfmh.
This year’s Austrian winter is typical for much of Europe as the continent continues its battle against one of the most brutal in decades in terms of snow and cold.
According to Rainer, there have been many more snow days this year than normal, which has lead to much higher road-salt consumption in the Vorarlberg area: 10,500 tonnes thus far. By comparison only 7600 tonnes were used the winter before. “The higher consumption is due mainly to the greater number of days with snow and higher snowfall in the lower regions, especially around Unterland,“ says state road commissioner Ernst Geiger. And the winter is not over yet.
Under the featured photo in Vorarlberg Online report, the text reads: “Little sun, lots of snow – the 2012/13 winter is going to be one of the most expensive when it comes to snow-clearing.”
Cold snowy winters indeed involve much higher costs. The cities of Dornbirn of Feldkirch, for example, are already more than one third over their budgets this winter when it comes to road maintenance and plowing costs, Geiger writes.
Not only is the snow-clearing straining budgets, but so are the frost-related damages to asphalt road surfaces. “The current winter has seen much greater damage than in previous winters,” Geiger said. The final extent of the damage won’t be known until April.
Looking at the condition of streets here in North Germany, we see stretch after stretch of potholes, frost heaves, and ripped asphalt. It’s Europe’s story this year. The costs of this winter are just beginning to be tallied up.

"Australians love the great outdoors, from our beaches to our forests, rivers and wide open plains. We have some of the most unique flora and fauna on the planet. In Australia, nearly 50% of our birds, 87% of our mammals and 93% of our flowering plants are unique to us. But much of it is under threat. Climate breakdown, land clearing and invasive species are wreaking havoc on our natural environment. We’re ranked fourth in the world for plant and animal extinctions, as well as holding the terrible record of being the only developed country listed as a deforestation hotspot. We have 511 animals, 1,356 plants and 82 distinct ecological communities listed as nationally threatened, and these numbers are trending in the wrong direction. Globally, the UN tells us there are a million species under threat of extinction. Meanwhile, we have a government riddled with climate deniers, intent on sitting on its hands on climate action, while delaying the release of emissions data and wilfully lying about our ability to meet even our meagre Paris commitments. It has allowed broadscale land clearing to continue, destroying habitat. And it continues to leave our threatened species floundering, delaying additions to the threatened species list and cutting funding from an environment department already struggling to meet its obligations. Taking over from the most absent environment minister in our nation’s history, Sussan Ley certainly has her work cut out for her. The problems we face aren’t just about losing species. What happens to the planet affects all of us. Many Australians care deeply about this and are taking actions in their lives and homes to do better. From recycling to water tanks, solar panels, battery storage, planting trees and more, people are taking small actions to improve their environment. But some problems require political solutions. The climate and extinction crises we are facing are two such problems. We know they can be solved if only we have the political will. If we are to halt and reverse the damage we’re doing to our natural environment, we must take urgent steps. Our environment laws need updating. They don’t even account for climate change. For all the talk of Adani’s approvals, drilling in the Bight, and widespread land clearing in Queensland and New South Wales, there is no mechanism in Australian law to consider their climate impacts. That’s why I will be introducing a private member’s bill for a climate trigger when parliament resumes in July. Our environment laws have not kept up with environmental reality. Climate change is at the centre of the threats our environment faces today. While a price on carbon looks unlikely in the near future, with Labor crab-walking away and the Coalition seemingly to abandon any market mechanism, we need something that will limit damage to the climate. This climate trigger would give us a mechanism to assess major developments and approve or reject them based on their emissions. But reducing our carbon pollution won’t be enough to save species already under threat. With our list of threatened species continuing to grow, it’s well past time their recovery plans were fully funded. That’s why I am calling on Ley to, as a bare minimum, commit to the $200m a year environment groups say is necessary to fund our threatened species recovery plans. We must stem the tide of extinction.I encourage everyone to contact their local representative and ask what they are doing to solve these twin crises. With enough of us working towards it, we can build the kind of future we want, not the kind of future we are on course for.• Sarah Hanson-Young is the Australian Greens’ senator for South Australia and the Australian Greens environment and water spokesperson"

"The chancellor, Philip Hammond, has written to the prime minister to warn against adopting the strict targets on greenhouse gas emissions recommended by the government’s advisers. His intervention, first reported by the Financial Times (£), raises the important question of whether or not it makes economic sense to save the planet. If the question sounds absurd, that’s because it is. If we fail to move to a low-carbon economy, the consequences will be dire. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the body of the world’s leading climate scientists convened by the UN, we must drastically reduce our emissions in the next decade to avoid a catastrophic situation in which droughts, floods, heatwaves and extreme weather across the globe devastate lives, destroy agriculture, lay waste to wildlife and force millions to flee. Set against that, the costs – of £50bn a year in investment, according to the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), which set out the case last month for a target of net-zero emissions by 2050, or £70bn a year, according to the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy – of maintaining our current lifestyles and orderly existences are trivial. The UK’s economy is worth roughly £2tn a year at present, so Hammond’s estimate of a £1tn cumulative cost by 2050 amounts to less than half of one year’s GDP in three decades. Doug Parr, the chief scientist for Greenpeace UK, said: “The Treasury is putting their ideology before our wellbeing, and trying to shape the public debate for political ends. If you want to know whether a policy is good, include the benefits as well as the costs. In this case, the benefits include an economy fit for the 21st century, cleaner air, warmer homes, and maximising the chances of civilisation surviving. If reality doesn’t fit with the Treasury models, it’s the models that need to change.” Yet the question – can we afford to keep our planet liveable? – has dogged debates on climate change for more than three decades. While scientists have issued ever stronger warnings about the likely impacts of climate change, nations have held back on taking action to reduce greenhouse gases, which have remained stubbornly high, though their growth rate has slowed. The Stern review, conducted by the former World Bank economist Lord Stern for the Treasury in 2006, was supposed to settle this question once for all. Stern found, and his analysis has been widely backed up since, that the cost of dealing with climate change would be the equivalent of shaving 1-2% from GDP growth rates per year, compared with a cost of at least 5% of GDP per year from leaving global heating unchecked. The CCC, in its recommendation of a net zero target, also estimated a cost of 1-2% of GDP by 2050, which is far outweighed by the costs of not acting. Nor would the UK be alone: the EU is considering a similar net zero target by 2050, while Norway, New Zealand and a few other countries have already done so. Stern said that in the decade since his landmark review, the case for urgent action on the climate had grown even stronger. “In 2006, we understated the case: it has turned out that the risks of climate change were even greater than we knew, and the costs [of taking action] are far lower,” he said. “I think the current cost estimates will turn out to be far too high too, as we will adopt new ways of doing things.” He added: “If reports of the letter are correct, Hammond has not understood the urgency of the challenge and the immense costs of climate change, and has failed to understand the capabilities of the UK. The UK is in an enormously powerful position to take leadership, with its strengths in research and development, in innovation, in finance in the City, with our skills in city planning – there is enormous potential here.” The chancellor’s intervention may cause international consequences for the UK beyond Theresa May’s “legacy”. This weekend, the UN is set to discuss whether the UK or Italy should hold the COP26 conference in 2020, a crucial follow-up meeting to the 2015 Paris agreement. Awarding the conference to London now looks a harder decision. When we ask whether we can afford to tackle climate change, we are really asking – as the IPCC report and decades of climate science show us – whether we want humanity to survive in anything like our current structures. If our economic system stands in the way of doing so, perhaps it is the economics that are at fault. And economics, like politics, are just a human construct. The physics of the earth’s atmosphere are not. • Fiona Harvey is an environment correspondent for the Guardian."
"A major UK consumer loyalty programme has been criticised by environmental campaigners for making Esso – whose parent company ExxonMobil has been under fire for its track record on climate change – its new fuel partner. Petrol company BP has axed its 16-year partnership with the Nectar loyalty card, which means that from Saturday the 20 million holders of the card – owned by Sainsbury’s – will no longer be able to earn points with BP and will instead pick up Nectar points at Esso-branded sites when filling up their tank. In the biggest single shake-up yet of petrol station loyalty schemes that reflects the turmoil and environmental pressures on the sector, Esso has terminated its partnership with Tesco Clubcard to set up the Esso Nectar scheme. Environmental campaigners have warned that loyalty cards stimulate consumption of damaging fossil fuels, despite a looming government ban on new petrol and diesel car sales from 2040 and a push to encourage take-up of low-emission electric vehicles. “We have a climate emergency on our hands,” said Rachel Kennerley, a Friends of the Earth climate campaigner. “It’s a completely out-of-touch and backwards step for Nectar to be partnering with some of the world’s biggest polluters.” Paul Morozzo, a climate campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said: “Promoting fossil fuels is always deeply irresponsible. If someone poured bleach on your cornflakes, would you care whether it’s Cif or Domestos?” The world’s biggest international oil company, ExxonMobil is best known in the UK for its Esso and Mobil brands. It is one of the UK’s largest petrol retailers, serving about 800,000 customers every day through a network of 1,100 Esso-branded filling stations. David Chilton, the global loyalty programmes manager at ExxonMobil, said: “Our customers are our number one priority, so we’re very excited to be launching the Esso Nectar partnership.” However, in the US the company has been investigated over allegations that it knew about the dangers of global heating for decades but deceived the public over the risks. The firm has rejected the charge. Its alleged role in spreading misinformation about the climate crisis is being investigated by the European Union. James Moir, the managing director of Nectar Loyalty, said: “We’re always looking for new ways to reward our customers and are thrilled to be offering them the chance to turn their fuel into money off their weekly shop, as well as hundreds of other personalised rewards.” In a raft of other changes in the sector, BP will shortly launch a new loyalty programme for its UK retail business, a network of more than 300 filling stations in the UK and 900 more BP-branded forecourts owned and run by independent dealers. The Shell Drivers’ Club offered cash discounts on fuel or Avios points or Waitrose vouchers. But as of this month, it has launched a new customer loyalty card, Shell Go+, which no longer allows its members to direct their points value towards carbon offset schemes. The two major surviving schemes are Morrisons More and Texaco. “There is a huge shift under way in petrol station loyalty and by the summer the whole landscape will have been changed,” said Anika Newjoto, editor of supermarket rewards website Shopper Points. “This seems to be happening because, frankly, the schemes were not working. Petrol is a very low profit margin business and it seems that the cost of the loyalty points was not proving worthwhile.”"
"Joe Biden’s Democratic presidential campaign has amended his climate policy plan hours after it was released on Tuesday because a handful of passages did not credit some of the sources in the proposal, prompting allegations of plagiarism.  The changes come after the conservative Daily Caller and others reported that several passages from Biden’s plan appeared to borrow from policy papers and statements written by outside groups without citation. A Biden campaign statement read: “Several citations, some from sources cited in other parts of the plan, were inadvertently left out of the final version of the 22-page document.” The added citations included passages from documents published by the Blue Green Alliance and the Carbon Capture Coalition. The document by Biden, vice-president under Barack Obama, cites sources in the text of the plan. Some other campaigns use more formal footnotes in their policy papers. Biden’s 1988 presidential campaign ended amid controversy over plagiarized passages in his campaign speech and after he admitted plagiarism on a law school paper. At the time, Biden said the incident at Syracuse University was a matter of him not knowing the proper way to document sources. David Axelrod, a Democratic strategist and architect of Obama’s 2008 campaign, was skeptical that the errors in Biden’s climate policy proposal will affect his campaign. “There are many, many molehills that look like mountains during a campaign,” Axelrod said. “The challenge for the campaigns and the press is to decide which is which.” Yet Donald Trump’s re-election campaign wasted little time in trying to capitalize. “Four decades in public life and there’s always one constant. What would a Joe Biden candidacy be without a little plagiarism?” said Tim Murtaugh, the campaign communications director."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe following is video of a CNN debate between Marc Morano and Bill Nye. I thought Bill Nye was supposed to be well-informed about science. Boy, was I wrong.

Marc Morano Exposes Bill Nye’s astonishing ignorance of climate science.
It started as soon as Nye opened his mouth at the 1:39 mark, he claimed the Medieval Warm Period and Roman Period were isolated incidents occurring only in Europe. He repeated it again at 2:55.
That claim was already refuted 10 years ago. Since then there have been dozens of studies from every corner of the globe where proxy data clearly show that the aforementioned optimums occurred in cycles WORLDWIDE. Incredibly, Bill Nye thinks that the global temperature was more or less constant before human CO2 emissions. Even Michael Mann no longer believes that.
At the 2:20 mark, Nye then says that the rate of CO2 rise is of great concern. False. What is of concern is CO2’s impact on global warming. All scientists agree that a doubling of CO2 will lead only to about 1 – 1.5°C of warming by itself. CO2’s impact is turning out to be far less than originally feared. In fact “the rapidly rising CO2” has resulted in no global warming in over 15 years!
Then at about the 3:35 Morgan and Nye seem to claim that the climate is directly related to the human population, i.e. when population rises, then temperature rises. Now we are getting a good idea of just how bad Nye and Morgan’s science truly is.

Throughout the debate, Nye and Morgan’s arguments are carried by fear and horror visions. You can’t help but to think they are a bit on the hysterical side.
At the 4:30 mark, Morgan then totally confuses weather with climate. “How do you explain the warm weather today? Why is it we have all this freakish weather just when we have so many people? That’s evidence isn’t it?” The CNN host has now ventured into comedy science. It’s again that psychological affliction of insisting that the world is coming to an end, and not being able to live without that.
At the 6:30 mark it’s the old “precautionary principle” line. It’s a wonder these people ever hop onto a plane or drive a car.
The rest of the debate is pretty much Bill Nye and Piers Morgan neurotically worrying about the phony computer-generated horror scenarios 100 years down the road, and confirm they believe that global temperatures are rising (they aren’t, they’re flat) and that sea level rise is accelerating (it isn’t, in fact it is decelerating).
Finally, I couldn’t help noticing that their primary worry is population growth – for them there are just too many people on the planet. They need more “Lebensraum“.

By Fritz Vahrenholt, Frank Bosse
(Translated with permission by P Gosselin)
“Global Warming Is Taking A Break“ – that was the title of an article at the online Hamburger Abendblatt on 4 January 2013. And that’s hard to miss when you look at the latest global temperature chart:

Red and green: temperature; blue: CO2.
This of course demands an explanation, which is provided by Jochem Marotzke, Director of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg: It’s because of ocean currents, and this is indeed included in IPCC models. But something is wrong, and also Marotzke can’t get around it when he tried to explain the temperature stagnation in the interview with the Abendblatt:
“In such periods, the heat is taken in more strongly by the deep oceans. We still cannot explain why this is so.” Scientists have reason to suspect that heat is taken from the surface to the bottom in the southern oceans.“
The circulation in the world’s oceans is rather well known and how its function is not a mystery:

Source: Bildungsserver
We see a transport conveyor, and one region is especially distinct: the North Atlantic at 20-60°N and 10-60°W. Here we find the greatest heat release into the atmosphere. Wouldn’t this be the place to look in the search for the missing heat instead of suspecting mysterious, clandestine warm waters in the southern oceans? Let’s begin our search.
For an analysis we need data that accounts for the heat quantity at the lower depths of the sea. The IPCC models are often content with the upper 50 meters. But data have been collected down to 700 m already since 1955, and in recent times very precisely using automated bouys. What has been measured in the oceans 700 m can be found in the Ocean Heat Content (OHC) dataset. Here’s the development for the North Atlantic region:
 

 
The diagram above shows the anomaly from the mean in Gigajoule per square meter. Does the shape of the curve look familiar? It certainly does! Its similarity to global temperatures is mind-boggling:

Just how similar are the curves? And does the similarity mean that the heat comes from the depths or vice versa: i.e. the atmosphere warms the water in rhythm?  Here we carry out a correlation analysis to find out which is the hen and which is the egg. We want to know what comes first. Is it the heat content of the water mass, or the global temperature?

Just as we already suspected: correlation reaches a maximum with a lag of 12 months, with Ocean Heat Content (OHC) leading. This becomes even more distinct when the temperatures of the northern hemisphere (NH) are considered in place of global temperatures (global). Have we found a possible method of predicting global temperature 12 months out? For this a regression is carried out to determine the temperatures for the coming 12 months according to our model, which uses the current ocean heat values for the temperature prediction. And then we compare these temperatures with the real, measured temperature values.

That doesn’t look bad at all, does it? We were able to project the course of the quarterly temperature series one year in advance with an accuracy of 57%. How does it do with the deviations? We do see some rather large ones, 1998 for example! We therefore depict the time series of the difference between the projected and real values, and at the same time change between El Nino and La Nina – the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the form of the Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI) series:

Here we see that many of the deviations can be well-explained by the ENSO (MEI). The heat amounts deep in the Atlantic also cannot be aware of surface volcanic eruptions. The negative deviations of 1992-1995 can be traced back to the eruptions. Thus we can make a prediction for 2013:

The red curve above depicts the quarterly global mean temperature. A higher resolution is not possible because the Ocean Heat Content (OHC) data is only available on a quarterly basis.  We should not wonder that the first quarter of 2013 will be approx. one tenth of a degree C cooler than the previous months because the push by the last mini El Nino, which ended in fall 2012, is over. After a slight warming of a few hundredths of a degree in the second quarter of 2013, a tenth of a degree of cooling can be expected for the fall of 2013. This of course is only if no huge ENSO event occurs during the 2nd half of 2013. These impact the global temperature with a lag of about 4 months, which is why foresee the impact of the last ENSO until February 2013. How high is the probability for an El Nino in 2013? No one can say for sure, and so we will just have to wait and see for the second half of the year.
And then?
When the Ocean Heat Content of the North Atlantic has a period of approx. 65 years, then we can extend the curve above into the future, which would lead to values we saw in the 1990s!
The water of the lower depths is not sufficiently taken into account by the IPCC models. Should it indeed have an impact, as is indicated here, then it means that CO2 has a significantly lesser impact on the climate than we previously thought. It is likely that CO2 is only 50% of what the IPCC estimates when all natural factors and the impact of the sun are accounted for.
It’ll certainly be interesting to see how the months ahead shape up. We will see if our temperature prediction turns out to be right, and that without using any “mysterious”, heat transport somewhere down near Antarctica! So stop by at our Die kalte Sonne website as we will be keeping you up to date.
Our figures by the way are without any guarantee because there are weather variations and volcanic eruptions that cannot be foreseen…

==============================================
China’s Summer Rains Fluctuated During The 20th Century In Sync With The Solar 11-Year Cycles
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
Numerous studies in the past have shown that solar fluctuations on decadal, century, and millennial scales have had a significant impact on climate development. In December 2012 another impressive study appeared on the subject in the Journal of Geophysical Research. Jing-Song Wang and Liang Zhao from the National Satellite Meteorological Center and the National Climate Center in Peking respectively studied the impact of the 11-year solar activity cycle on June precipitation of various regions in China during the 20th century. Here they checked the relationships using six statistical methods. In the summary of their paper both scientists wrote:
The Huaihe River basin (HRB) of central China is located at the marginal region of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM). For this region we were able to show there is a reliable positive-correlation relationship between the 11 year sunspot cycle and June precipitation. In the south of the middle–lower Yangtze River region we found a possible negative correlation, and a very weak positive correlation in the HeTao Basin (HTB). The latter region is located in the central region of the monsoons in the westwind zone. We investigated the reasons for these regional differences and are able to show that the marginal region of EASM is more sensitive to solar forcing than its central interior. This explains the strong correlation in the region of the Huaihe River Basin. In years with many sunspots, the impact of the East Asian Monsoon expands and extends further north than in years with fewer sunspots. During years with few sunspots, westerlies dominate.”
The study clearly shows, yet again, that fluctuations in solar activity do not have the same impact in all regions. In some regions the solar impact on climate is stronger, and weaker in others – depending on local conditions. Also in different regions counter-acting developments arise. This becomes clear when for example a line of rain shifts, causing one region to be drier and another wetter.

Chart source: www.climate4you.com/SnowCover.htm
Greenland is melting? Where? The chart shows there is about 80,000 square km more snow cover today than in 1974. That’s the same as almost 1000 Manhattans.
When a piece of glacier the size of Manhattan breaks off and floats into the ocean, the media freak out about it? But when Greenland snow cover jumps a whopping 80,000 sq. km, we don’t here a peep.
Northern Hemisphere snow cover now 4th highest in 35 years

“Well, Greenland is a regional phenomenon,” the alarmists may claim. “We have to look at the entire Northern hemisphere”.
A few days ago we looked at December snow cover. So let’s look at the weekly snow cover for the northern hemisphere every year since 1966. Well, that too shows NO TREND!

Chart source: www.climate4you.com/SnowCover.htm
Where’s the melting?
Snow cover over the Northern Hemisphere currently (31 December 2012) is the 4th highest in 35 years!

"Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions are still increasing, according to a government report that was withheld for a week in defiance of a Senate order. The environment department published its emissions data for the December 2018 quarter on Thursday morning, but only after the energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, first disclosed information from the report in an interview with the Australian.  The data had been due to be published last Friday, under a deadline that was set by the Senate to stop delays in the publication of Australia’s national carbon pollution figures. Labor and the Greens have criticised the process by which the figures were released and warned it would be pursued in parliament. “Angus Taylor has shown his true colours in his first outing as minister for emissions reduction,” Labor’s climate and energy spokesman, Mark Butler, said. The latest report shows Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions are still increasing, driven by rising emissions across several sectors of the economy including transport and liquefied natural gas production. The figures show emissions rose by 3.5 m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, or 0.7%, in the year to December 2018. Emissions in the electricity and agriculture sectors were down but those falls were wiped out by increases across every other sector. Australia’s emissions have been rising since the abolition of the carbon tax. The government’s emissions reduction fund – rebadged before the election as the climate solutions fund – has failed to stall increases in Australia’s overall emissions. The quarterly seasonally adjusted and weather-normalised figures – which is a statistical tool that takes into account that emissions go up and down due to household and commercial heating and cooling – show emissions increased from the September quarter to the December quarter, something that is typically expected on this measure. But the unadjusted data, which should normally show a reasonable drop in emissions from the September quarter to the December quarter, shows only a slight decrease. “It’s barely a drop,” Tim Baxter, of the Climate and Energy College at Melbourne University, said. On the annual figures, which are up, Baxter said: “2018 was higher than 2017. 2017 was higher than 2016. This is the wrong way. We’re going in the wrong direction to meet our Paris commitments, let alone deal with climate change.” Labor and the Greens said the government, which published the figures on a day still dominated by news of Wednesday’s AFP raids on the ABC, was trying to avoid scrutiny of its track record. “Not only did he not release the emissions data by the deadline set by the Senate last Friday, today’s release shows once again why the Liberals will try every trick in the book to avoid scrutiny of their record on tackling climate change,” Butler said. “As expected under the Liberals carbon emissions continue to rise, once again exposing the government’s lie that Australia is ‘on track’ to meet even the Liberals’ weak emission reduction targets.” The Greens climate spokesman, Adam Bandt, said the minister had “continued his contempt of the parliament, seemingly dropping the pollution figures to the Murdoch media before making them public”. “This whole process has been outrageous and we will pursue the government and the department to get answers. There needs to be consequences for breaching the Senate’s orders. “This latest report confirms that investment in wind and solar is continuing to drive down pollution in the electricity sector, but we need to be exporting renewable energy too, not fossil fuels, or pollution will keep rising.” In a media release, Taylor argued that while Australia’s emissions were up, exports of LNG from Australia were contributing to emissions reductions elsewhere because they “were displacing coal”. “Australia’s total LNG exports have the potential to lower emissions in importing countries by around 148 Mt CO2-e in 2018 by displacing coal consumption in those countries,” he said. “This is a substantial global contribution to be proud of. The Morrison government is not going to trash successful Australian export industries that are reducing global emissions, in order to reduce Australian emissions.” The government has also been vocal in its support of the Adani Carmichael project, a coalmine with product intended for export overseas. Matt Drum is the managing director of Ndevr Environmental, an emissions-tracking organisation that replicates the federal government’s national greenhouse gas inventory quarterly reports but releases them months ahead of the official data. The organisation forecast the latest increase months ago, correctly projecting that drops in emissions in the electricity sector would be wiped out by increases in other industries. “Again, electricity emissions have decreased. These figures demonstrate they’re not the real problem with regards to absolute emissions,” Drum said. He said the Coalition’s policy was not enough to bring the economy-wide changes that were needed to reduce Australia’s emissions and work with other countries to avoid the worst effects of the climate crisis. “These results indicate the newly re-elected Coalition government is still going to have to do something different and more expansive in climate policy,” Drum said. “Theoretically, adding money to the emissions reduction fund will help to stimulate the carbon offset market. However, it isn’t enough to reduce total emissions. “Something needs to be be done to reduce our ever-increasing emissions from transport, fugitives and every other industry that keeps increasing.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterTwo days ago a wrote a post about Swedish scientist Lennart Bengtsson denouncing alarmist climate science. The original source of that story was a letter that Bengtsson and 3 other climate scientists had published at Sweden’s daily newspaper Dagens Nyheter. 
What follows is the letter that Bengtsson and the 3 other scientists had published January 21, 2013 by the Swedish major daily newspaper Dagens Nyheter in English (my emphasis):
=======================================
Misinterpreted climate report threatens the credibility of scientists
The World Bank’s  recent climate report was not saying that we necessarily face an extreme global temperature increase – but was about the potential consequences of such. It is one of several examples of how climate information can be misinterpreted and ultimately damage the credibility of researchers, writes leading climate scientists.
Recently, the World Bank published a report entitled ‘Turn down the heat: Why a 4° C warmer world must be avoided’.
The report received wide media exposure with its dramatic title, and in that it was the World Bank, which published it. The Bank had commissioned a German institute in Potsdam to write the report. It does not contain an analysis of the Earth’s climate, but primarily deals with the consequences of a supposed global temperature rise of 4°C. No detailed analysis was made of the probability of such a change. This was not clear in the Swedish debate.
As a warming of 4°C during this century is extremely worrying, it is important to try to assess how reasonable such a strong warming is. Individual model simulations have calculated global warming by 2100 of +6°C or more, but these have been deemed highly unlikely by the UN climate panel (IPCC 2007). The slow global warming, especially over the past 15 years, has reinforced this view.
Since the 1800s, the concentration of carbon dioxide along with other greenhouse gases have increased by about 75 per cent. Meanwhile, the earth’s average temperature has increased by about 0.8°C. Such a temperature increase is much smaller than the model calculations provide and only takes into account the increase in greenhouse gases as the cause. There may be compensatory cooling from aerosol particles, but systematic errors in the model calculations can not be excluded.
There is great uncertainty over how sensitive the climate system is to human influence and thus how high the carbon content must be to provide a warming of 4°C. Even with a high climate sensitivity a level of at least 1000 ppmv is probably required. This would require annual carbon emissions significantly higher than today.
An increase in temperature leads to an increase of the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere. This leads to a climate with more extreme precipitation with a tendency for increased precipitation at high latitudes and in the equatorial region and reduced rainfall in many parts of the areas just outside the tropics. One exposed area is the Mediterranean region. Given the dominant natural variations in the weather from year to year, it is not yet possible to reliably determine whether a systematic change in precipitation has occurred.
The increase in sea level is a result of ocean thermal expansion and mass contribution from melting of mountain glaciers and land ice. The increase based on recent satellite measurements amount to an average of about 3 mm/year (approximately 2 mm/year due to water mass addition, about half from mountain glaciers and the other half from land ice).
During the past 20 years, no acceleration of the increase of the sea level occurred. No apparent relationship between sea levels and global temperature changes during the 1900s appears to exist.

Extreme weather events create a great deal of attention because of the loss of life and extensive economic damage. With  a generalized global warming, one can expect more extreme high temperatures, but also fewer extremely low temperatures, for which there are now indications.
Tropical storms are often attributed to global warming. Current examples include Hurricane Sandy that plagued parts of the U.S. East Coast in late October 2012 and the typhoon Bopha that hit the Philippines a month later.
The mass media conveyed in many cases the perception that these tropical hurricanes were a result of the greenhouse effect. But there are no indications of an increasing trend in the intensity or number of tropical hurricanes.  The large increase in damage caused by severe storms in different parts of the world is caused mainly by people increasingly living and working in more exposed locations.
The most obvious consequences of climatic change during the last decades is the melting of mountain glaciers over most of the earth and of summer sea ice in the Arctic.
Although it is not entirely inconceivable that similar reductions may have occurred in previous centuries, it is likely that the reduction of summer sea ice in the Arctic is unique. Model calculations support the view that this is linked to an increasing greenhouse effect.
In summary, we believe that a temperature increase of as much as 4° C during this century is very unlikely. Nor is there any basis for claims that tropical hurricanes have become more extreme and more frequent.
We believe that the media, instead of blowing up the results of individual publications should give special attention to the specific international organization – IPCC – which by the international community has been charged with the continuous and comprehensive synthesis of a large body of research on the climate thus putting individual reports like the The World Bank’s in a larger perspective. The next IPCC assessment will be published in September 2013.
We want to use this article in no way to detract from the problem of global warming and its possible consequences. We only want to warn that misguided information may have the effect that the credibility of scientists can be questioned and that measures to deal with climate change may receive the wrong priorities. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences has in their analysis of energy issues assumed that reducing carbon emissions will have high priority in global politics and that very large investments over time are needed to replace fossil fuels with sustainable alternatives.
Society must also be prepared for climatic changes in order to protect the population against extreme weather events and systematic changes in climate, whether as a result of global warming or not.

Share this...FacebookTwitterFolks, if you care about the environment and precious habitats for endangered species, like the American bald eagle, then you are going to find the following video rolled in Haldimand, Ontario last Saturday profoundly disturbing:

Video courtesy of: www.ontario-wind-resistance.org.
The raw emotion of the protesters doing the camera work is clear and understandable. But imagine how the media would have handled this had it been for an oil drilling rig or pipeline. Because this eviction is to make way for “clean” planet-saving wind-turbines, which are going to spend 80% of their lifetimes idle, the media couldn’t be bothered to report on this.
The workman at the 1-minute mark in the video of course is correct. The workers there are only doing their jobs. The permit to destroy the nest was issued by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources (Friday evening!). And why would they issue such a permit? Because charlatans like Al Gore and a massive multi-billion dollar network of green organisations (Greenpeace, Sierra Club, WWF, etc.) managed to convince the world with corrupt science that CO2 is poisoning the climate. Blame them.

A summary of the bird nest destruction is here: http://thebiggreenlie.bald-eagles-nest-to-be-removed-for-wind-farm/
My advice to the angry activists with the camera: I understand your anger and frustration. But it is people like you who are responsible for this. You and millions of others allowed yourselves to have the wool pulled over your eyes by the climate charlatans and renewable energy industry.  They told you fossil fuels were destroying the planet and that you they would save it with their “clean” energy systems, and you believed them. In fact, you slurped it right up. The rest of us who expressed doubt were just flat-earthers, deniers.
The climate rescuers are only getting started. This is only the very beginning.
For example, look at the deforestation of natural rainforests taking place in places like Borneo, also to make way for “clean” energy palm oil plantations (though, the BBC blames it all on hungry consumers). The truth is that these palm oil plantations exist in large part so that Europe can meet its biofuel targets and pat itself on the back for being a leader in “rescuing the climate”.

Global temperatures, they claim, are rising faster (in fact they haven’t risen in 15 years), sea level rise is accelerating (in fact it is decelerating), and storms are increasing (when in fact they have been decreasing). Yet, despite the recent flurry of hysterical claims, policymakers are no longer listening anymore. In Doha they simply brushed them aside and pushed off the whole process yet another year – this for the 19th time in a row.
So what are climate scientists to do?
The answer: exaggerate even more scenarios, like polar ice melt. At least that’s what leading IPCC scientist Prof. Mojib Latif of the GEOMAR Heimholtz Centre for Ocean Research appears to have done. Just ignore the real measurements and make up your own scary story. And because you are a renowned climate scientist, hapless, lazy journalists will automatically believe everything you say.
Half of the polar ice area has melted in the last 30 years
Prof. Latif’s latest scare fantasy is reported by journalist Heinrich Pantel of the Kieler Nachrichten here. He reports, quoting Latif (emphasis added):
‘Whatever our grandparents and parents blew into the atmosphere is still there today.’ The problem here is: ‘The climate reacts slowly.’ It could take decades before we feel the full force of our actions.
The speaker [Latif] referred to the retreat of the ice in the Arctic and Antarctic. Since the first satellites in space have enabled precise measurements, it is known that the ice area at the poles has decreased by almost a half over the last 30 years.”

Half of the ice area has disappeared at the Arctic and Antarctic poles? That’s what the Kieler Nachrichten reports, based on a presentation by Mojib Latif. Who cares anymore what the real facts are – just say whatever shocks the audience and readers at hand. None of them are going to look up the true data anyway.
At the rate suggested by the Kieler Nachrichten, who we assume quoted Latif correctly, the remaining half of the ice at the poles will likely disappear over the next 30 years – if not sooner should the warming indeed be accelerating. Moreover, if half of the polar ice area has disappeared, wouldn’t sea levels be rising something like 100 times faster?
Sloppy science communication – irresponsible journalism
This is yet another classic example of both sloppy science communication by an IPCC scientist, and irresponsibe and negligent journalism by Pantel and the Kieler Nachrichten. Any journalist, who had even posessed just an inkling of knowledge about climate science, would have immediately known something was amiss here. Fact-checking? What for! Journalist Heinrich Pantel just accepted “expert” Latif’s nonsense as the Holy Gospel truth.
To be fair to Prof. Latif, it’s possible that the hapless journalist just got the facts all mixed up and thus completely misinformed his readers.
Unfortunately this has become the norm of science communication in Germany.
And so one should not wonder that many German citizens and policymakers have become hopelessly hysterical on the climate issue. And we should not be surprised that more and more readers are turning their backs on the print media and opting instead for information from blogs.

"Schools and colleges across the US have been accused of censoring students who have attempted to use their graduation speeches to speak out on the unfolding climate crisis. A youth-led movement called Class of 0000 is encouraging students to read out a prepared text at their graduation ceremonies that warns of “catastrophic climate change” and tells elected leaders to “have plan to get to zero emissions, or get zero of our votes”. More than 350 students set to speak at ceremonies as valedictorians, or in other roles, have pledged to read the message, but many have complained that educational authorities have barred them from doing so as the global climate emergency is deemed too political to mention. In the US education system, a valedictorian is typically a student with the highest academic performance in the class. This student delivers a farewell speech for the class at its graduation. Emily Shal, an 18-year-old senior class president, felt that her school considered that the climate message was “too controversial” for her graduation speech. Shal had read the speech at a talent show before the graduation ceremony and said she still received backlash from school authorities. “The administration were very mad, they were pissed,” said Shal, who attends Whittier Tech high school in Haverhill, Massachusetts. “Everyone was telling me I was in trouble. They now consider me rogue and rebellious. I was really worried about repercussions.” Worried that she would be dragged off stage if she made the climate speech, Shal decided to apologize and comply with the demand not to mention climate change at the ceremony last week. She said a large majority of her classmates consider climate a “huge topic” that needs to be addressed. “The school thinks it is a political issue that shouldn’t be brought up,” she said. “My freedom of speech was definitely taken away. We are tearing down our home, the Earth, and it should be our No 1 concern in the world. But it’s not.” Whittier Tech said: “We are saddened that our former student felt that she would not have Whittier’s support in speaking about a subject she is clearly passionate about. She does and she would have. “Whittier Tech does not benefit from discouraging students from freely expressing their opinions on relevant, worldly topics. We do not participate in such discouragement.” Jessica Lopez, another 18-year-old senior, was told by the principal of Health Sciences high and middle college in San Diego that she shouldn’t mention climate change as it’s political and instead “should be celebrating our achievements” in a more traditional graduation speech. Lopez said she was surprised as her school is “friendly and innovative” and previously allowed students to take part in a walkout to protest school shootings. “It’s shocking to me that we could voice our opinions then, but are silenced when we want to talk about climate change,” she said. “I was very upset and felt like I didn’t want to go up there and be a hypocrite. It’s created a lot of tension between the class and the administration.” In lieu of her planned speech, Lopez and most of her class plan to don badges that say “No Planet B” for the ceremony. “A lot of adults blame our generation for being sensitive but we have to deal with the problems they have caused,” Lopez said. “It’s really frustrating. We are vocal about climate change because no one else is going to do anything about it. On this issue, it feels like the adults are the children.” In other incidents, two students at Albany high school in California said their attempts to get climate change mentioned in graduation speeches were rebuffed. One, Tamara Valenzuela, used social media to attack the decision. A separate student, Saisantosh Tiruchinapalli from Arizona, was told he could mention the importance of voting but not climate change. The climate crisis has become a deeply polarized issue in the US, to the point that recent polling shows it divides voters even more than issues such as abortion and gun control. A growing youth climate moment has sought to break the political deadlock in the wake of a series of dire warnings from scientists over the flooding, wildfires, drought and societal unrest that global heating is spurring. Many of the US students planning to speak out say they were inspired by Greta Thunberg, a Swedish teenager who inspired an international wave of school strikes over the climate crisis. Meanwhile, the Sunrise Movement, one of the US groups that helped organize the Class of 0000 initiative, has been driven by youth activists and has been at the forefront of championing the Green New Deal, a plan to rapidly decarbonize the US economy. • This article was amended on 13 June 2019 to clarify that Albany high school students were not told to drop climate change from graduation speeches, though no speeches containing the Class of 0000 message were selected. It was further amended on 20 June 2019 to clarify comments from Emily Shal and to add a response from the school, Whittier Tech."
"Scotland’s nature conservation agency last week painted an apocalyptic vision of a country devastated by the climate crisis, from polluted rivers to eroded peatlands and forests devoid of birds. Now comes a warning about another part of Scottish culture which could, it is feared, also be hit by global heating: whisky. Scottish distilleries have revealed that during last year’s blistering heatwave, they had to halt production because they ran out of water. In a summer marked by high temperatures and little rainfall, water levels in springs and rivers fell so low that in the Scottish Highlands some whisky makers missed up to a month’s production.  “We lost the whole of September,” said Callum Fraser of the family-run Glenfarclas distillery on the River Spey. While some whisky makers take their water from the river, Glenfarclas – which means “valley of the green grass” – has its own private water supply. “It’s a natural spring, and it was dry,” said Fraser. The month’s pause saw Glenfarclas production down by up to 300,000 litres, he added. Rumours abound of other distilleries seeing similar problems. “We weren’t the only one, just the most vocal,” he added. The prolonged heat and longer dry spell meant even Scotland – known for soggy and temperate summers – had to cope with drought. Grasses stopped growing, which meant the Highland Games had to be cancelled, and wildfires spread in places they’d never previously been seen. Experts fear that last year’s conditions may not be unusual in future. This week the environment agency is hosting a “drought summit” in London with water company bosses, as fears grow over similar temperatures this summer. Research has shown that last summer’s heatwave was made about 30 times more likely by the human-caused climate emergency. Some estimate that such heatwaves could be happening every other year by 2050 if emissions continue to increase. Helen Gavin, who researches climate breakdown and drought at the University of Oxford’s Environmental Change Institute, said such extreme events place stress on the environment and the economy. “There’s an impact already,” she said. “It’s not just hot and dry summers, but strange weather like we’ve just had – 18C in February, that’s just weird. And that messes up biological and agricultural cycles.” This has a cascading effect, Gavin added, which first affects crop yields, then the cost of production and thus the price paid by consumers. “And it means if we take more water from the environment to try and save whisky, a farmer’s crop, or so we can still turn on the taps, it comes at a huge cost.” At some points last summer the Spey was running 97% lower than its normal minimum, and this winter has not brought enough rain to replenish it. “The water table hasn’t recovered yet, so it’ll be this year we see the full effect,” said Fraser. “We’ve still not had real rain yet.” Further south near Pitlochry, the Edradour distillery lost a few days’ production last year for lack of water. Its owner, Andrew Symington, said the neighbouring river runs visibly lower each year. Edradour now plans to install costly cooling towers to mitigate the effect of lack of water in the future. Drinks conglomerate Diageo, which owns several Scottish distilleries, would not comment on individual production schedules but said it had had “no major issue” because mitigation measures had already been put in place. Pernod Ricard, which also owns several distilleries, did not respond to a request for comment."

"The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased by the second highest annual rise in the past six decades, according to new data. Atmospheric concentrations of the greenhouse gas were 414.8 parts per million in May, which was 3.5ppm higher than the same time last year, according to readings from the Mauna Loa observatory in Hawaii, where carbon dioxide has been monitored continuously since 1958. Scientists have warned for more than a decade that concentrations of more than 450ppm risk triggering extreme weather events and temperature rises as high as 2C, beyond which the effects of global heating are likely to become catastrophic and irreversible. May is the most significant month for global carbon dioxide concentrations because it is the peak value for the year, before the growth of vegetation in the northern hemisphere starts to absorb the gas from the air. The seasonal peak and fall can be seen in the Keeling curve, named after Charles Keeling, who started the observations on Mauna Loa because of its isolation in the Pacific Ocean. This is the seventh consecutive year in which steep increases in ppm have been recorded, well above the previous average, and the fifth year since the 400ppm threshold was breached in 2014. In 2016, the highest annual jump in the series so far was recorded, from 404.1 in 2015 to 407.66 in 2016. As recently as the 1990s, the average annual growth rate was about 1.5ppm, but in the past decade that has accelerated to 2.2ppm, and is now even higher. This brings the threshold of 450ppm closer sooner than had been anticipated. Concentrations of the gas have increased every year, reflecting our burning of fossil fuels. Ralph Keeling of the Scripps Institute, and the son of Charles, said: “The CO2 growth rate is still very high – the increase from last May was well above the average for the past decade.” He pointed to the mild El Niño conditions experienced this year as a possible factor. Tuesday’s findings come from Mauna Loa and the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which has also made complementary independent measurements of greenhouse gas concentrations since the 1970s. NOAA’s Barrow observatory on Alaska’s North Slope showed an average of 417.4ppm over the period, but the Arctic typically has higher CO2 readings than the Mauna Loa series. Pieter Tans, a senior scientist at NOAA, said: “It is critically important to have these accurate long-term measurements of CO2 in order to understand how quickly fossil fuels are changing our climate. These are measurements of the real atmosphere, and do not depend on any models, but they help us verify climate model projections, which if anything have underestimated the rapid pace of climate change being observed.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterJoe Bastardi of weatherbell.com/ kindly took the time to write a comment, and so I think it deserves being upgraded to a post. It’s one whole semester of meteorology summed up (edited by PG)!

Here’s the problem globally: We continue to dwell on temperatures in the Arctic and ignore the fact that it’s a natural cyclical distortion because the planet wobbles on its axis and has much more water in the southern hemisphere, and more land in the north. So there is an eternal search for a balance that can never be attained. It can only go back and forth. Think about it. While CO2 warmists are yelling and screaming about the Arctic melting, the southern hemisphere ice is expanding. We are now told the deep water is warming (what bullocks, it does this every time the PDO has been warm.  What will happen over the next 20 years is the southern hemisphere sea ice will retreat and the northern hemisphere will advance once the AMO turns cold. We just can actually observe it now from above with satellites.
There is so much lunacy in their argument, they don’t even realize global ACE drop is because of the distortion; instead they scream about warming causing increased activity, when in reality globally it has gone the other way. Until such time someone can show me that there is less OUTGOING RADIATION than incoming, there is no “warming” going on.  There is no trapping of heat. Physically all CO2 can do is add its 0.4 to 0.7°C to the 33°C of the blanket gases that were wonderfully placed there and made the Earth’s temps reasonably livable, in spite of the variations that have to happen because of the system’s design.
Oceans are partly driving the climate
The whole CO2 argument is tiresome and absurd. The unmoved mover is the sun. The system below responds to the variations in the sun with a lag.  The “warming” was because when the oceans went into their warm cycle (remember there is far greater “energy” in warm water than in cold dry air), the natural response had to be a warming in the north – where there is more land-  because equatorial ocean warming increases the transport of warm humid air northward. That air has to then warm areas where there is dry air. If you dry out warm humid air, then you warm the air temperature if the wet bulb is constant. So there is warming over the continents, BUT IT ONLY CONTINUES UNTIL THE OCEANS HAVE ADDED THEIR INPUT. The leveling off of temps is completely consistent with an atmosphere that has absorbed the heat from the warming cycles of the oceans that occurred in tandem from 1995-2007 (warm PDO was 1978-2007,  warm AMO 1995 till present, but it will shift).
The other way around – low ACE indicates warming
The increase in the southern hemisphere’s ice cap is more impressive than Arctic melt because the cold source is the continent of Antarctica, and for the ice to expand it had to have been colder in the areas where it expanded, which is over water. This is much harder to do than warming up dry, cold Arctic air. Now we see the response. This is entirely natural. I argued at the Heartland Conference that the global ACE drop and the southern hemisphere ice show that this is merely a distortion that will turn around and go the other way. The cooling tropical Pacific means naturally the ACE lowers since most of our tropical activity comes from the Pacific. But the Atlantic, still in the warm AMO, takes up the slack. Tropical cyclones are major energy transporters and balancing mechanisms for the atmosphere. If there is no need to balance out (cooling Pacific, warmer in the north), then the ACE drops. Amazingly the OPPOSITE of what people are yelling about is the sign of the so-called warming. In fact as the Arctic areas start to cool and the AMO backs away from the warm cycle, we are likely to see the ACE come back up again, as the “need” for more Pacific cyclones will reappear.
CO2 is too trivial of a factor

The major problem is the people driving this train refuse to humble themselves to the majesty of the atmosphere. The sheer weight of numbers against CO2 causing this is staggering. The oceans have 1000 times the heat capacity of the atmosphere, CO2 1/2500th of the gas blanket that makes our Earth livable, man – according to the US Dept of Energy – is only responsible for 1/20th of that, meaning 1/50,000th of the air is “man-made”. Actually it’s merely man-recycled, for there has been no introduction of new CO2 to the system that I know of. What we’ve put into the air has always been a part of the system, it’s just recycled.
Does anyone know of some magic spaceship that came and increased the amount of CO2 inherent to the global system (fossil fuels for instance, come from sources that have always been on the planet)? So we are asked to believe that we are changing all this. Though a gross over-simplification, if the 1/2500th of the blanket gases is contributing 0.4 to 0.7°C to the wonderful 33°C which elevate the average temperature to 288°K instead of a frigid 255°K, and man is responsible for only 1/20th of that, then perhaps our contribution to the global temp is…0.035°C.
Since some consider me a neanderthal, let’s do what neanderthals love to do…compete for survival. Let’s simply measure the temperature by objective satellite over the next 20-30 years as the PDO remains cold and the AMO flips. Let’s measure the temperature and see if by 2030, the 5-year running mean is not back to where we were.
Quiet sun is a wild card – poses a threat
The explanation to all this is no different than you sitting in a sauna. Turn up the thermostat (natural ocean cycles) and it will heat until it reaches what the thermostat dictates. Arguing that turning on the light (the CO2 influence) is what heated the sauna is absurd. The wild card in this is the sun, which I am concerned is going to be a much bigger problem (believe me with the lunacy of the energy policies globally, a return to my temps is already a huge problem in itself, but the sun falling asleep would be worse). My ideas, which are not new, are basic climate cycle theory and were accepted before people decided they had to save the planet. They explain perfectly this chart:
http://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com/2012/08.jpg
To those who want to argue “natural variability” is hiding the warming, a) you didn’t tell us that before your models went busting badly, and b) are you saying without CO2 we would already be back in the Victorian era of temps? To those who say there is hidden heat and that a gas (which is only 1/2500th of an atmosphere in which the most prominent GHG is water vapor, and with oceans that have 1000 times the heat capacity of the atmosphere) is somehow controlling all this (recall that we once had an ice age at 7000 ppm co2) you live in a fantasy world.
Then again, men who have the fantasy of saving the planet by controlling others are indeed in their own world. It’s up to those grappling with the real facts to make sure that the world we live in is one that promotes freedom and the betterment of mankind, and not one controlled by those who believe they are superior to everyone else. This is where the real battle is, and not with a trace gas that has little if anything to do with the climate of a planet created and designed the way it was. – J.B.

"Advocates of the Green New Deal say there is great urgency in dealing with the climate crisis and highlight the scale and scope of what is required to combat it. They are right. They use the term “New Deal” to evoke the massive response by Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the United States government to the Great Depression. An even better analogy would be the country’s mobilization to fight World War II. Critics ask, “Can we afford it?” and complain that Green New Deal proponents confound the fight to preserve the planet, to which all right-minded individuals should agree, with a more controversial agenda for societal transformation. On both accounts the critics are wrong.  Yes, we can afford it, with the right fiscal policies and collective will. But more importantly, we must afford it. The climate emergency is our third world war. Our lives and civilization as we know it are at stake, just as they were in the second world war. When the US was attacked during the second world war no one asked, “Can we afford to fight the war?” It was an existential matter. We could not afford not to fight it. The same goes for the climate crisis. Here, we are already experiencing the direct costs of ignoring the issue – in recent years the country has lost almost 2% of GDP in weather-related disasters, which include floods, hurricanes, and forest fires. The cost to our health from climate-related diseases is just being tabulated, but it, too, will run into the tens of billions of dollars – not to mention the as-yet-uncounted number of lives lost. We will pay for climate breakdown one way or another, so it makes sense to spend money now to reduce emissions rather than wait until later to pay a lot more for the consequences – not just from weather but also from rising sea levels. It’s a cliche, but it’s true: an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. The war on the climate emergency, if correctly waged, would actually be good for the economy – just as the second world war set the stage for America’s golden economic era , with the fastest rate of growth in its history amidst shared prosperity. The Green New Deal would stimulate demand, ensuring that all available resources were used; and the transition to the green economy would likely usher in a new boom. Trump’s focus on the industries of the past, like coal, is strangling the much more sensible move to wind and solar power. More jobs by far will be created in renewable energy than will be lost in coal. The biggest challenge will be marshalling the resources for the Green New Deal. In spite of the low “headline” unemployment rate, the United States has large amounts of under-used and inefficiently allocated resources. The ratio of employed people to those of working age in the US is still low, lower than in our past, lower than in many other countries, and especially low for women and minorities. With well-designed family leave and support policies and more time-flexibility in our labor market, we could bring more women and more citizens over 65 into the labor force. Because of our long legacy of discrimination, many of our human resources are not used as efficiently as they could or should be. Together with better education and health policies and more investment in infrastructure and technology – true supply side policies – the productive capacity of the economy could increase, providing some of the resources the economy needs to fight and adapt to the climate breakdown. While most economists agree that there is still room for some economic expansion, even in the short run – additional output, some of which could be used to fight the battle against the climate crisis – there remains controversy over how much output could be increased without running into at least short-term bottlenecks. Almost surely, however, there will have to be a redeployment of resources to fight this war just as with the second world war, when bringing women into the labor force expanded productive capacity but it did not suffice. Some changes will be easy, for instance, eliminating the tens of billions of dollars of fossil fuel subsidies and moving resources from producing dirty energy to producing clean energy. You could say, though, that America is lucky: we have such a poorly designed tax system that’s regressive and rife with loopholes that it would be easy to raise more money at the same time that we increase economic efficiency. Taxing dirty industries, ensuring that capital pays at least as high a tax rate as those who work for a living, and closing tax loopholes would provide trillions of dollars to the government over the next 10 years, money that could be spent on fighting the climate emergency. Moreover, the creation of a national Green Bank would provide funding to the private sector for climate breakdown – to homeowners who want to make the high-return investments in insulation that enables them to wage their own battle against the climate crisis, or businesses that want to retrofit their plants and headquarters for the green economy. The mobilization efforts of the second world war transformed our society. We went from an agricultural economy and a largely rural society to a manufacturing economy and a largely urban society. The temporary liberation of women as they entered the labor force so the country could meet its war needs had long-term effects. This is the advocates’ ambition, a not unrealistic one, for the Green New Deal. There is absolutely no reason the innovative and green economy of the 21st century has to follow the economic and social models of the 20th-century manufacturing economy based on fossil fuels, just as there was no reason that that economy had to follow the economic and social models of the agrarian and rural economies of earlier centuries. Joseph E Stiglitz is a university professor at Columbia, the 2001 recipient of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics, a former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, a former chief economist of the World Bank and the author, most recently, of People, Power, and Profits: Progressive Capitalism for an Age of Discontent"

Share this...FacebookTwitterUPDATE: The press release reappears! Maybe the embarrassment of taking it down surpassed that of having it up.
================================
In December the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) issued a press release about a study model simulation claiming that greater snowfalls over Antarctica would increase ice discharge into the oceans, and thus speed up sea level rise, by Winkelmann, R., Levermann, A., Martin, M.A., Frieler, K. (2012): Increased future ice discharge from Antarctica owing to higher snowfall. Nature [doi:10.1038/nature11616].

Press release on lead author’s Ricarda Winkelmann’s controversial paper disappears. Photo source: Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research/M. Martin.
Anthony Watts and his readers at WUWT had a field day with that story. NTZ also chimed in, read here.
Although the claim pushed the limits of science absurdity into new territory, many media outlets still ran with the story anyway, not bothering to see if it held water. For example, Spiegel had the headline Snowfall increases ice melt in the Antarctic and Stern reported here, as did nuch of the German mainstream media…all telling readers that the PIK claim was yet more cause for even higher alarm.
The task of asking tough questions, once again, was left to the blogs.
As it turned out the story was not even based much on observed data, but more on crystal ball computer models. The claims by the PIK were dubious to say the very least. In not time at all they were torn apart and landed in the dustbin. For example, Don Easterbrook commented at WUWT:
Papers like this are why I don’t bother to read Nature anymore–it has lost all scientific credibility by publishing such nonsense. The authors apparently didn’t bother to check the temperature records at the South Pole and Vostok, which go back to 1957 and show no warming whatsoever over the past 55 years.”

Now it appears that even the PIK got embarrassed about it, and has quietly removed the press release they had issued here on 12 December. Do you find it? It’s also been removed from their German language page.
But it hasn’t totally disappeared. You still can find it with a bit of effort, if you know the address, It just isn’t anywhere prominent.
What explanation does the PIK offer for taking down the press release? One reader wrote to me in an e-mail: “From Ms Winkelmann, I still have yet to receive a reply after having sent here a query where I stuck to the facts back in December.”
It goes to show that there are some things left out there that are still too embarrassing to publish – even for the PIK.
===========================
UPDATE: It turns out that Ms Winkelmann is rather inexperienced in the field. She is not even a climate scientist. Flagship newspaper FAZ here, for example, wrote in 2011 (my emphasis): Hat-tip: DirkH
But: ‘Originally I do not come from climate science. Rather I come from the Chaos Theory.’ Ricarda Winkelmann is 26 years old and a professional climate modeller down to the tips of her hair. […]
Together with her colleagues at the PIK and scientists from Alaska, Ricarda Winkelmann developed admittedly the most advanced ice sheet and ice shelf model: About 10,000 program lines make up the super-computer model that simulates the fundamental processes of the polar ice sheets: The ice flow to the sea, the melting on the surface of the lower bedrock, ice collection above, the formation of crevices and including calving at the edge.”
Only 10,000 lines to simulate all that all over Antarctica? Only 26 years old, no experience and not even a climate scientist? If all that doesn’t sound like a half-baked operation. No wonder her team ended up with the preposterous result that more snowfall over Antarctica leads to faster sea level rise.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe real story of 2012 is one of unextreme weather and natural events. Deaths globally in 2012 from natural disasters were 90% below the longterm average.

Photo: Public domain photo, NOAA
The online, eco-leftist TAZ from Berlin has an article about reinsurer Munich Re’s Natural Catastrophe Statistics 2012 report on weather and natural disasters, released yesterday. 2012 was a year of few deaths and relatively little damage from natural disasters worldwide.
Recall that Munich Re is in the reinsurance business, and they stand to profit handsomely from the belief that climate related catastrophes are on the increase. They’ve been aggressive promoters of the manmade climate change story.
So it comes to us as a big surprise to hear them report that 2012 “saw far less damage than a year earlier“.

According to TAZ, 2012’s “total damages of $160 billion was below the long-term average. And foremost ‘only’ 9500 people died in 2012 from storms, floods and earthquakes – far less than the 106,000 in an average year.” That’s a huge drop of 90%! So all the dramatic stories about deadly weather extremes we’ve been hearing for months was mostly hype.
The Munich Re report said it was a “low-damage year”, with most of the damage caused by Hurricane Sandy and drought in the USA. Good news came from developing countries, where, according to the TAZ, “there were few catastrophes”.
Boy, if that isn’t a stark contrast from what we’ve heard from the media.
Yet, always itching to jack up their premiums, Munich Re insists that climate change is a major crisis for humanity, and although Hurricane Sandy cannot be attributed to man, it is “a sign of what the future holds”.
I bet all that good news was just really tough for the Munich Re to handle.

Having seen the film in its entirety for the first time, I was truly horrified by the scale of the environmental destruction and mayhem brought on by the recent climate protection movement. It is truly madness at a whole new level and dimension. If you have the chance to see the documentary, then do so. You’ll be shaking your head throughout the film.
Indeed the level of destruction with respect to loss of eco-systems, biodiversity, erosion, etc. brought on by the “green economy” is far beyond anything man-made climate change was ever fantasized of causing by the year 2100. The current damage caused by the “green economy” is real, and it’s happening here and right now. Worse, it’s all taking place with the official green stamp of approval.
In the film, environmental economist Nico Paech says:
Climate protection as it is practiced now is throwing the baby out with the bath water.”
The green economy, intended to rescue the climate from a man-made climate catastrophe in a computer, is in reality systematically accelerating the wide-scale destruction of the environment today by at least a factor of ten.
Many greens are having their eyes opened for the first time, and are now grudgingly admitting that something has gone terribly awry. Wiping out the Earth’s eco-system to rescue the climate is not what they had in mind.
Yet they still refuse to acknowledge that they’ve erred with the climate science, and that all the destruction was unnecessary. They still insist the computerized catastrophe is real, approaching fast, and that we need to act rapidly. The only thing they’re admitting is that the “green energy” sources of hydro-power and biofuel are no longer options. In their view the human race is now in a dilemma because so many sources of energy must never be used. There’s no painless way out.
After showing the Climate Crimes documentary, ORF held a discussion round discussion round. The theme of the discussion round was what needs to be done to get out of the (imagined) energy dilemma?
Four experts joined moderator Michael Hofer were Kurt Remele (ethics and theology expert), Angela Köppl (economics expert in the field of environmental economics, energy and climate protection and Angela Kallhoff (philosophy). The other was co-author of Die kalte Sonne, geologist Sebastian Lüning. Clearly the discussion was not to focus on climate science. For moderator Hofer and the 3 other guests, the science is settled in their view, and there was no need to discuss it. Thus the discussion focused on environmental ethics and man’s responsibilities.

Most of the discussion round was filled with the usual “the end is near” crap. The three greenie guests kept reminding the audience of our generational, environmental and social responsibilities. They told us of the “massive impacts” humans were having, and about all the “dramatic destruction” humans were causing.
We were reminded it would be necessary to get along with much less, to save energy, and to scale back productivity and consumption. Kallhoff, for example, said the human species was “crowding out nature” and that we were “too individualistic and selfish”.
Moreover, the three green guests reminded the audience that climate change is real. Köppl insisted that climate change is settled science and that there was “a tendency to more extreme weather”. She added that “humans would have to scale back” and “that it would not be possible to rely solely on technology”.
Remele poked fun at Arnold Schwarzenegger, who a week earlier had flown in to Austria on his private jet and pontificated about the importance of living green.
Hofer even asked the guests if perhaps our Judeo-Christian religion was perhaps responsible for the earth’s environmental and climatic ills today, citing that the Book of Genesis, which tells us: “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth.”
Near the end of the discussion round, moderator Hofer asked each guest to tell us what has to be done to get out of the environmental dilemma. The three greenies were more or less unanimous, telling the audience that we will have to change our behaviour, get away from the model of growth, expand public transportation, consume less, and to even eat less meat.
Lüning, the only guest with a different opinion, said that it was necessary to get back to science and real environmental protection. In Lüning’s view, the discussion had been taken over by extreme elements on both sides, and that it had to get back to the center. He also encouraged more critical thinking, and that we not immediately believe someone just because they have a doctor title.
Earlier in the discussion round, Lüning commented that there was too much fear-mongering by a number of opportunistic parties, for example re-insurers. Lüning said that the huge environmental backfire we’ve seen in the green movement so far should say something about the science.
Lüning also reminded the other guests and Hofer that climate science is not settled, and cited a recent study showing soot was a far greater factor in climate than previously thought.
He also pointed out that much more could be done locally and regionally with far less money, and with a far greater impact, than to try to solve the globe’s problems by tweaking a single trace gas.
Lüning said: “There are lots of high impact things that can be done for relatively little money.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman veteran meteorologist Klaus-Eckart Puls here has done an analysis of sea level rise. Contrary to claims made by fringe alarmist physicists, we see that sea level rise has decelerated markedly since 2003.
Sea Level Rise Since 2003 Has Slowed Down

From 1993 to 2003, sea level rose 3.5 mm/year. Over the next decade, sea level rose only 2.3 mm/year! Source: http://sealevel.colorado.edu, then supplemented by EIKE.
In his report, Puls writes that even TOPEX and JASON 1+2 show no acceleration. “The acceleration calculated by the models and constantly reported by the media does not exist!” 
Puls adds:
It is obvious to see that sea level rise has slowed down significantly. In view of the relatively short time frame in which the measurements have been made, it should not be speculated on whether the deceleration in the rise is a trend change or if it is only noise. What is certain is that there is neither  a ‘dramatic’ rise, nor an ‘acceleration’. Conclusion: Climate models that project an acceleration over the last 20 years are wrong.”
In the chart that follows, Puls fitted a polynomial curve to the data from TOPEX and JASON 1+2:

“The result is no surprise. The 20-year data series of global sea level rise shows a weakening!” No wonder con-artist Al Gore bought a mansion on the beachfront. It’s great living in a world of suckers and dimwit media.
But let’s not rely solely on the satellite data, which has been around only a measly 20 years, to infer a trend. Let’s compare it to tide gauges, which have been used well over one hundred years. Puls presents the following chart of the trend of the German bight”.

Sea level rise at the German bight. Source: see graphic. 
Puls writes:
An evaluation shows: Also tide gauges indicate a slow-down in sea level rise, and do so with a statistically very “robust” dataset of 160 years.”
Also there has been an evaluation of numerous tide gauages globally, see Die kalte Sonne.de/?p=4429. Conclusion:
We have found no indication that sea level has accelerated over the last 30 years. It doesn’t look good for the fans of acceleration.”
Puls summarizes:
The latest alarmist reports on the supposedly dramatic sea level rise for the present and the future cannot be confirmed by actual measurements. Quite to the contrary, they are refuted by the data. Globally neither tide nor satellite data show an acceleration of sea level rise. Rather they show a slow-down. Moreover they starkly contradict the previous and current claims coming from climate institutes. Also there are good indications that the satellite data were ‘overly corrected’ using inflated amounts.“

"Twenty-one youth activists faced off with the US government in an Oregon courthouse on Tuesday, where their attorneys petitioned a panel of judges to let their climate case go to trial. Until it does, their attorneys argued, fossil fuel development should be halted on public lands. The case of Juliana v the US charges the federal government with violating the constitutional rights of youth by perpetuating systems that contribute to climate breakdown. Those young people – who range in age from 11 to 23 and hail from all corners of the nation – argue that the constitution gives them and future generations a right to an environment free of climate catastrophe.  Their previously scheduled trial was abruptly halted in October 2018 after the government successfully petitioned the supreme court for review. Now, a three-judge panel at the ninth circuit has the final say. The panel did not issue a ruling on Tuesday. “I think what’s at stake is the ability of these young people to vindicate their constitutional rights,” plaintiff attorney Andrea Rodgers, senior staff attorney for Our Children’s Trust, the not-for-profit group representing the youth plaintiffs, told the Guardian ahead of the hearing. The key determination ahead, essentially, is whether kids get a trial over climate breakdown. Those stakes and the government’s handling of the case have catapulted it to rare courtroom celebrity. The youth plaintiffs are media regulars, with seemingly ubiquitous appeal: teen magazines, local newspapers, radio shows and recent appearances on 60 Minutes and in Vanity Fair. Hearings have been a spectacle, regularly mobbed by suit-and-tie types, kids of all ages, tie-dye and purple-haired grannies. More than 70 support rallies were held worldwide in lieu of a trial last fall. The digital following is no less a curiosity. The youth climate movement has begun to claim Juliana as central to its own narrative, using support rallies to train young leaders and to turn up the digital volume on the case with hashtags like #AllEyesOnJuliana. Tuesday’s hearing was livestreamed and broadcast into a park near the courthouse. Following the hearing, the plaintiffs walked from the courthouse to the park, where a marching band played and activists shouted chants. Levi Draheim, one of the plaintiffs, rode on the shoulders of Nathan Baring, another plaintiff. Park-goers rallied around the youth waving signs to “Let the Youth Be Heard” under the watchful eye of giant heads of the 12 presidents with knowledge of climate change. Jeffrey Bossert Clark on Tuesday argued against the trial on the government’s behalf. A former George W Bush administration appointee, he has publicly equated greenhouse gas regulation with socialist attempts to seize the economy and use of United Nations science as synonymous with US rule by foreign scientists. Clark said that the suitconstituted a direct attack on the separations of powers, and that the young activists wrongly want the courts, instead of elected officials, to direct things such as energy policy. Julia Olsen, a lawyer for the activists, argued federal energy policy “puts children in harm’s way”. Olsen also stressed courts can and have intervened when government actions violate the constitutional rights of citizens. Bloggers, legal experts, scholars and activists have puzzled over the government’s overall tactics to the case. In legal circles, the case is an anomaly, made an outlier by the repetitive, emergency petitions filed to squash it. That strategy has been repeated in cases on the far-right fringe of Donald Trump’s agenda: cases affecting Daca recipients, immigrants and the national census, and the transgender military ban. The questions raised in the case, however, are increasingly pressing in America, and worldwide. While the UN counted hundreds of climate cases worldwide in 2017, and more than 650 in America, the question as to whether greenhouse gas emissions violate constitutional rights is being pressed primarily by Our Children’s Trust and its partners. The organization has filed legal action in all 50 states with varying results - litigation is still pending in nine states (Alaska, Colorado, Florida, Maine, Massachusetts, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon and Washington). Similar efforts to uphold constitutional rights to a safe environment are also under way in 13 countries abroad. In the Netherlands, such litigation may soon force the Dutch government to take more measures against climate change in a case now headed to the Dutch supreme court. The supreme court of Pakistan and an appellate court in Norway will also hear similar cases soon. The US government has not disputed that climate breakdown is real, or that an environmental crisis looms. In fact, government experts generally agree with the plaintiffs’ experts on the science. Government attorneys have instead argued that the court does not have the legal authority to tell the federal government what to do about climate change, and that a trial would be too burdensome. They have also argued that Americans don’t have a right to “a climate capable of sustaining human life”. That position is one 17-year-old Nick Venner, a plaintiff in the case, called, “kind of ironic because this case is the only way to get it done because every other effort has failed, essentially”. He said the government’s attorneys “really like to keep it in this theoretical phase because, when they do that, they can deny the humanity of the issues that they are dealing with”. Most at issue, he said, are climate policies that are “going to drastically screw over future generations”. Those generations have sought to be heard. More than 30,000 youth signed an amicus brief filed by Zero Hour in support of the plaintiffs petition to move the case to trial. An additional 10,000 adults also signed. “I don’t want to be picking these fights. The youth don’t want to be picking these fights. And, honestly, it’s exhausting to be in the streets all the time,” said Zero Hour’s executive director, Jamie Margolin, who is 17. She added she doesn’t see another choice when other efforts have failed. “Our childhoods are being spent begging them to stop ruining our adulthoods, and our adulthoods are going to be spent dealing with the consequences of their actions,” she said. A decision to allow a trial and halt fossil fuel development in the meantime would stall production of 60 new oil and gas pipelines, 32 new liquefied natural gas and coal terminals, and one oil export facility.

" Labor and the Greens have demanded the government immediately release national greenhouse emissions data, and have warned the new emissions reduction minister could be in contempt of parliament for missing the deadline to publish the figures. Angus Taylor’s first act in his new role was to miss a Senate-set deadline on Friday for the publication of Australia’s emissions data for the December 2018 quarter.  The Senate passed an order last year that requires the minister to publish the quarterly greenhouse gas inventory no later than five months after the end of each quarter. For the December quarter that date was 31 May. The government, via a statement from the environment department, said late on Friday: “We anticipate the quarterly update of Australia’s national greenhouse gas inventory: December 2018 will be released soon.” But Labor’s climate and energy spokesman, Mark Butler, said Taylor “must immediately release the latest emissions data”. “Angus Taylor has failed his first task as new emissions reduction minister,” Butler said. “This is a disgrace and shows total disregard to the Australian people and Senate process. “But really it’s no surprise considering Angus Taylor has continually argued against climate action and is part of a government that has continually lied about what their emissions data actually shows, which is that emissions are rising and we’re not on track to meet our international climate commitments.” The government has been under pressure because its climate policy has been failing to stall Australia’s emissions, which have been increasing every year for the past four years. The Senate passed the order for rolling quarterly deadlines last year to address delays in the publication of national carbon pollution figures. The Greens climate spokesman, Adam Bandt, said the minister could be in contempt of parliament.  “The government and minister are showing early signs of contempt for the parliament and should be punished. “Emissions data should be no different to other nationally significant data, which gets released by the ABS like clockwork. The release of greenhouse pollution data should be automatic and free from ministerial interference.” In Senate estimates last year, department officials were asked if complying with Senate orders to publish the reports within five months would be a problem. “No … That time is sufficient for us to make use of the available data to prepare the reports,” they said. On Monday afternoon the Greens Leader Richard Di Natale wrote to the government’s deputy senate leader, Simon Birmingham, who is the representative for both Taylor and the environment department in the Senate. Di Natale reminded Birmingham of the department’s testimony that it could meet the upper house deadline. “Given the testimony from the department, the only conclusion is that it was held back for political reasons by the minister’s office,” he wrote. “I seek your answers explaining the reasons for the delay and reserve my right to put a motion to the Senate should the government continue to demonstrate signs of contempt for the Senate and its role in scrutinising the use of executive power.” Tim Baxter of the Climate and Energy College at Melbourne University, said although Morrison’s new ministry was only sworn in last week, he did not believe that should have led to a delay. “I don’t really think that’s a decent excuse under the circumstances because it’s not like the report has to be written. It has to be read,” he said. “Taylor, while he hasn’t been emissions reduction minister for long, has been energy minister and he has seen these reports.” Baxter said much of the information that was in the report was the same as previous quarters, it was just the headline figures that changed. “This is a pretty unambiguous Senate order. It’s not something he gets to choose …he’s the minister and it’s his job,” he said."
"Jaguar Land Rover is teaming up with BMW in a partnership designed to lower costs and try to get ahead in the race to produce electric cars for the mass market. The UK’s largest car manufacturer and Germany’s BMW said they would work together to develop electric motors, transmissions and power electronics in the latest industry alliance formed to address the challenges posed by electric and driverless cars.  The two companies would jointly invest in research and development, engineering and procurement to support volume production of electric cars, allowing consumers to shift away from petrol and diesel cars. Nick Rogers, JLR’s engineering director, said the partnership would be mutually beneficial at a time when the car industry was facing “the greatest technological shift in a generation”. He added: “The pace of change and consumer interest in electrified vehicles is gathering real momentum and it’s essential we work across industry to advance the technologies required to deliver this exciting future. “We’ve proven we can build world beating electric cars but now we need to scale the technology to support the next generation of Jaguar and Land Rover products.” Jaguar Land Rover is cutting 4,500 jobs from its global workforce as part of £2.5bn cost-saving programme amid falling sales in China and Europe and record losses of £3.4bn in the last three months of 2018. BMW, meanwhile, is trying to cut costs by €12bn and has warned that profits will fall this year. The huge costs to carmakers of developing electric vehicles come at a time when regulators are tightening the rules on emissions. Last month Fiat Chrysler and Renault announced plans for a €33bn merger in a move that would create the world’s third-largest carmaker, saving the companies the billions needed to fund the race to make electric and autonomous vehicles. BMW was one of the first major carmakers to launch a fully electric car, with the i3 hitting the market in 2013. JLR also has an electric car, the Jaguar i-Pace, and both companies have a range of plug-in hybrid models. Klaus Froehlich, a BMW board member, said: “Together, we have the opportunity to cater more effectively for customer needs by shortening development time and bringing vehicles and state-of-the-art technologies more rapidly to market.” Engineers from JLR and BMW will work together to design the components, which will then be made at their manufacturing sites. For JLR, this will be at its engine plant in Wolverhampton, which employs 1,600 people."

Share this...FacebookTwitterSpiegel has stopped believing. The flagship news magazine writes:
Global warming has stalled for 15 years. Experts thus are having doubts on the reliability of their prognoses. The temperature development is moving along the lowest margins of the UN scenarios.”
Science reporter Axel Bojanowski at Spiegel here looks at the performance of climate models, claiming that a few aren’t doing too bad, while the alarmist ones are failing. As a successful model he cites Myles Allen of Oxford University and his colleagues. Yet most fail, and thus Bojanowski writes:
For this reason some scientists now harbor the hope that the pessimistic climate prognoses could be wrong.”
They are, and tomorrow’s post will show just how miserably poor the models have been. In fact if policymakers had acted opposite of what the models suggested, far better policy would have been the result.
In the report, what Bojanowski is telling us is: sure, many models are not doing well, but I found one that is kind of right.

When you look objectively at the performance of climate models over the last 20 years, there’s really only one rational conclusion that can be drawn: Their performance has been deplorable.
To explain why the alarmist models “could be” wrong, Bojanowski cites former Max-Planck Institute for Meteorology Director Lennart Bengtsson, who calls the current global temperature development “mind boggling“, saying that although CO2 emissions have increased drasticly, “global warming is prgressing considerably slower than expected.”
The same is true when it comes to the tropics, where warming was supposed to be galloping away by now, Bojanowski writes. Both Bengtsson and Spiegel are somewhat astonished that the Earth refuses to warm up. Bojanowski sums it up in Part 2:
Thus there is hope that climate change is progressing less dramaticly than suspected.”
Here you have to read between the lines. What Spiegel really wants to say is: We’ve stopped believing in the climate catastrophe. The climate models have performed like crap, but we are not yet ready to come out and admit it.
Remember, admitting you’ve been wrong for a quarter century takes time.

Share this...FacebookTwitterJoe Bastardi at weatherbell.com/ posted a video where he tells us that another brutal December is in the works for the Northern Hemisphere.

Meteorologist Joe Bastardi. Photo source: Weatherbell
Contrary to what a few crackpot physicists tell us, it’s not because of a relatively small 2 million sq km area of less ice in September, but because of gigantic areas in the tropical Pacific.
At the 2:10 mark Joe tells us:
What goes on in the tropical Pacific is huge. It’s absolutely huge – you have to understand that. In fact it’s huge as to control the entire climate of the globe, which is why you hear me with the type of attitude I have on that because of the flip of the Pacific to a colder mode.”
Later in the video at the 5-minute mark his attention is directed at Europe:
“Look at this! This is just hard to believe. I just want too, again, people get a little nervous when I start talking about the climate aspect of this, but this is how the Little Ice Age began. In Europe there was an attack of one cold winter after another. This is the fourth one in a row that severe to record-breaking cold has entered Europe.”
Clearly ocean cycles do play a major role on climate, as Joe shows. But it’s not only Europe’s weather that is beginning to resemble the Little Ice Age. Also the sun is beginning to look like it did during the Little Ice Age.
Solar cycles as well bode very ill for the coming winters.
Frank Bosse has an article today at Die kalte Sonne.de/7191 on the current solar cycle. He writes as follows (translated and condensed):
Solar Cycle 24 is indeed the start of a deep solar slumber. Leif Svalgaard published a paper Svalgaard et al. 2005 already back in 2005 where he estimated sunspot activity would be a maximum of 70 for Cycle 24. David Hathaway of NASA and his colleagues on the other hand projected a powerful solar cycle, based of course on a new model. Lesson here: Don’t believe every model.
How has SC 24 progressed thus far?

The red line in the chart above shows the monthly sunspot value. The blue line shows the average of the previous cycles 1-24. The light, thin line depicts the entry into the Minimum of 1800 – 1833 ( SC5…SC7). In November 2012 the sun also was only able to reach half of the average value. All SSN values were corrected according to a new paper by  Svalgaard.
The following figure shows a comparison of the periods of activity and allows us to evaluate the accumulated monthly sunspot anomaly for each cycle:

Solar activity as measured by sunspot count today is the weakest we’ve seen since SC 7, which ended in October 1833. The question today is: Was the peak in November 2011 with a SSN=96.7 the high for the current cycle? Although the sun is capable of surprises, all observations indicate that SC 24 indeed reached its peak last year. There are a number of signs that tell us this: The poles of the sun’s magnetic field have switched, which is a strong indicator that the peak is behind us:

The weakness of SC 24 is also indicated by the strength of the solar winds, given by the Ap Index, and is depicted by the following chart:

Here we see that the maximum of the solar wind is always offset by 2-4 years after the sunspot maximum. In 2008 we saw a low point of the kind we haven’t seen since the space age began over 50 years ago. We are still stuck at low levels.
Let’s recall that there are a number of papers showing a strong correlation between low solar activity and harsh winters in Europe, e.g. Lockwood et al.
So what impact could the solar winds have on the planet? They could act as a modulator for cloud formation, which in turn has a massive impact on global temperature – Svensmark’s theory. The following chart depicts the galactic cosmic radiation measured by the Oulu <neutron Monitor, Finland:

It’s easy to see that this curve is the inverse of solar activity: the weaker the solar winds, the greater the cloud-seeding cosmic rays reaching the Earth’s atmosphere. In the current cycle, cosmic radiation is 5-15% stronger than the previous cycle.
So what do the experts say? Much points to a Grand Minimum. observation of the convection belt, solar corona and magnetic field strength of the solar sunspots allows us to derive that the sun could get a lot weaker. This last occurred during the Maunder Minimum from 1645-1715. Scientists Livingston and Penn were hardly given attention when they had observed in 2005 there had been a good linear falling tendency since 2000 with regards to magnetic field and sunspots.

 
If this development continues, then we will see hardly any activity during solar cycle 25, which is anticipated to begin in 2020. It could very well be that our quiet sun is a harbinger of what is to come in the years and decades ahead.
Models of the mainstream climate scientists say: It will not impact the climate on Earth more than 0.1 to 0.2°C. Such models may very well be wrong – much like the “solar model” in 2006 projected a powerful SC 24.

Share this...FacebookTwitterEarlier today a reader (I think Juraj)  left a comment with a link to a snow cover chart that disappeared on me. Sorry about the accidental deletion, but I’ve managed to find the chart using Google. According to Rutgers University here, snow cover over the northern hemisphere reached record December levels last month, thus dumping cold water on the notion that wintertime snows are getting rarer.

Why is it that whenever snow disappears in the Arctic in the late summer, warmists scream bloody climate murder, but when snow reaches record levels in the wintertime, then they get real real quiet. Yoo-hoo media…where are you?
It would be nice to see a trend line on these charts. Actually I just found a time series here.
Looking at the last 30 years, we see a definite trend upwards. If this keeps up, all that albedo is going to reflect all the solar radiation back into space, and thus cool the Earth more, which will then lead to more snow cover, more albedo…and thus (assuming the warmists are right about the theory of melting Arctic sea ice), lead to a tipping of the climate.
The chart for January northern hemisphere snow cover also shows a clear upward trend  over the last 20 years:

Share this...FacebookTwitterDonna Laframboise here at No Frakking Consensus refers us to a recent article on a “scientific study” that confirms dissent and skepticism over climate science is spreading globally and rapidly – in the form of books.
In the field of science that’s really good news because that’s how science progresses. It’s also essential for assuring a thriving democracy and holding off tyrants.
But it’s not good for devout global warming followers, like Cristine Russell of the Columbia Journalism Review, or the two authors of a new peer-reviewed paper by Riley E. Dunlap of Oklahoma State University and Peter J. Jacques of the University of Central Florida. Dunlap and Jacques’s paper was published in February by the journal American Behavioral Scientist and claims that conservative think-tanks are behind a wave of skeptical books now spreading across the globe. 
One can’t help but get the impression that both of these American sociologists themselves are obsessed with the notion of a vast right-wing conspiracy being behind the global pandemic of sceptic climate books.
Although the two authors are abnormally hostile, aggressive and paranoid to those having a different opinion on climate science, their paper is a clear confirmation that climate science dissent and skepticism are alive and well globally.
Russell writes that “the authors noted that there had been an ‘explosion’ of books since 2007” since Al Gore’s AIT. “108 books were published between 1982 and 2010, half of them between 2005 and 2010, and 15 of them in 2010 alone.”
She adds:
While 66 of the 108 climate denial books came from American authors (61 percent), another 19 books (18 percent) came from the UK, followed by seven from Canada, and six from Australia. The rest came from nations such as Denmark, France, Sweden, the Czech Republic, Germany, New Zealand, and the Netherlands. Since 2000, four of every 10 denial books have come from authors outside the US—evidence, say Dunlap and Jacques, of “the success of the US conservative movement in helping diffuse denial internationally.”
Thanks Ms Russell, Messieurs Dunlap and Jacques, for this very uplifting progress report. Hopefully someday you’ll see the benefits of dissent and open debate.

"Public concern about the environment has soared to record levels in the UK since the visit of Greta Thunberg to parliament and the Extinction Rebellion protests in April. The environment is now cited by people as the third most pressing issue facing the nation in tracking data from the polling company YouGov that began in 2010. Environment was ranked after Brexit and health, but is ahead of the economy, crime and immigration. Young people rate environmental problems such as the climate crisis and global annihilation of wildlife even higher, placing them second behind Brexit. Almost half of 18- to 24-year-olds chose environmental issues as one of the nation’s three most pressing concerns, compared with 27% of the general population. A similar surge in public anxiety has taken place in Germany, where the Green party performed particularly well in the European parliament elections last month. Across the EU, the number of Green MEPs increased by 40% to 69, making them the fourth-largest grouping. In the UK, the number of Green MEPs rose from three to seven and the party won more votes than the Conservatives. Thunberg, the Swedish teenager whose solo school strike for climate action helped create a global movement, told MPs in April that the UK government’s active support for fossil fuels and airport expansion was “beyond absurd”. She added: “This ongoing irresponsible behaviour will no doubt be remembered in history as one of the greatest failures of humankind.” Extinction Rebellion activists also mounted a week of high-profile protests, mainly in the capital, in which roads were blocked and more than 1,000 people were arrested. On 1 May, MPs endorsed a Labour motion to declare a formal climate and environment emergency. The previous record high for the environment in the YouGov tracking data was 23% in February 2014, following extreme winter storms and flooding in Somerset Levels and other parts of the south of England. But the concern did not outlast the poor weather, with the number of people worried about the environment falling by half within two weeks. Jonathan Bartley, the co-leader of the Green party, said: “Nearly half of the young people of the UK are putting the environment among their top concerns, and no wonder. They can see governments making decisions about their future that take no account of our climate emergency. “In sounding the alarm about the state of our environment, we are the party on the right side of history. Now we are aiming to step up to lead the action in this national emergency.”"

=======================================================
The avalanche starts to roll: British weather service drastically scales back its prognoses for warming
By Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt and Dr Sebastian Lüning
(Translated/edited with permission by P Gosselin)
The British weather service is one of the first important organisations to pull the emergency brake and drastically scale back its warming prognoses for 2020. After 15 years of no warming, it’s obvious that the models have been re-evaluated by the UK Met Office and that they have given up on the notion of an imminent global warming surge (see report at Tallbloke’s Talkshop).
The old prognoses showed a temperature increase of almost 0.5°C by the end of the current decade. Now the scientists expect the temperature will stay more or less stable, perhaps rising a tenth of a degree.
An animated comparator of the old and new prognosis is provided by Bob Tisdale.

Former Max-Planck Institute of Meteorology Director Hartmut Graßl and GISS director James Hansen are not going to be amused. Their legendary heat prognoses have lost yet more backing from today’s science (see our blog articles: “Graßl’s warming prognoses of 1990 risks dramatic collapse” and “What happened with James Hansen’s temperature forecast of 1988? Time for a look back“).

Share this...FacebookTwitterFace it, challenging a dogma takes real courage and character. There’s the real risk of being ridiculed, marginalized – even criminalized.

Fritz Vahrenholt thinks it is going to take 3 to 5 years before the mainstream says: ‘Oh, unfortunately we made a mistake.’
And history has often shown that sometimes you even have to wait way beyond your death before society wakes up and appreciates that you had been right all along.
Yesterday I wrote about Dr. Hans Labohm‘s report, soon to appear in E&E. In it he describes the growing sceptic movement in Europe and how it is succeeding in forcing a very much unwanted debate on the cause of today’s climate change. It’s a debate that unfortunately governments, academia and media would very much prefer to skip altogether.
Labohm mentions how in Germany Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt, a leading environmentalist, began challenging the AGW theory. Prof. Vahrenholt could have taken the easy path, stuck to the popular and morally accepted AGW narrative, and kept his good standing among his many prominent peers.
However, he saw that something was amiss, that the theory was flawed and ridiculously simplistic – he couldn’t in good conscience just stand in silence. So he challenged the “consensus” by co-authoring together with geologist Sebastian Lüning a best-selling skeptic book that took Germany by storm earlier this year. This year you can be sure Prof. Vahrenholt will be getting far fewer Christmas cards.
Thankfully, some elements of the mainstream media have remained open to Vahrenholt‘s views and have given him a voice. One of these is flagship daily Die Welt, which conducted an interview with the free-thinking environmentalist professor.
On the IPCC, Vahrenholt thinks that the UN organization “has committed a huge blunder” by blaming the recent warming on CO2. “This demonization is too one-dimensional, it’s even banal. When it comes to the world’s fossil supply, he says we are still a long way from reaching its peak.
In the interview Vahrenholt believes that Germany “went completely overboard and got over-excited” with its move to renewable energy. Vahrenholt says:

We are conducting a fear-driven energy policy.”
Germany’s drive to renewable energy is not only driven by fear and a lack of science, but also because in Germany “we want to be good. But in truth we are self-destructive.”
What could be the consequences of Germany’s hasty and misguided rush into renewable energy? Vahrenholt tells Die Welt:
Indeed I fear that with the energy feed-in tariffs we are on a path to putting huge burdens on people, especially the poorest among us, and that we are driving out energy-intensive industries out of the country. Even worse, Germany is losing its attraction as a place to generate electricity.”
In the interview Vahrenholt reveals his commitment to protecting wildlife, and explains how Germany’s “green” biofuel policy has actually caused great harm to biodiversity, as thousands of hectares of land have been covered by corn monoculture. Windmills are now claiming hundreds of acres of forests and endangering birds and other animals.
One coal-fired or one nuclear power plant needs about 1 sq. km. of area. To get the same energy output, wind energy needs 1000 sq. km, an area that is 3 times bigger than all of Hamburg.”
When it comes to the heated global climate change debate and how long it is going to take before Vahrenholt is vindicated:
Every morning I can look at spaceweather.com at how the sun is changing. It is doing exactly as we expected. But it is still going to take 3 to 5 years before the mainstream says: ‘Oh, unfortunately we made a mistake.’ […] For the time being, a bitter religious war is raging. But I’m taking it in stride because I know that those who maliciously came after me will soon be on the defensive. […] In the meantime my biggest worry is that too much could be destroyed by then. Like I said, I think we will recognize by 2020 at the latest, that climate gas CO2 had been completely over-rated.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterOver the last few days, Central Europe has been enjoying springlike sunshine with double-digit Celsius temperatures. Some readings rose to near 15°C (59°F). However, this will end brutally by the end of the week. At Twitter, meteorologist Dominik Jung of wetter.net posted the chart of what’s ahead, for example, for the central German city of Hannover:

Chart source: Dominik Jung at Twitter
Note how temperatures will plummet to under -10°C by next week. Meteorologist Dr. Karsten Brandt says the coming March temperature plummet will be the worst since 1987. He writes:
Snow may accumulate even in the flatlands. Temperatures down to -15°C will arrive during the course of next week. It will be a cold blast of the sort we last saw in 1987.”
German online Bild here presents a video of the coming cold. Yet another freeze-thaw cycle – and I thought the streets were already a mess!
Germany’s and Austria’s 2012/13 DJF winter summary:
Meanwhile, the German Weather Service, Deutsche Wetterdienst, (DWD) issued its summary report for the 2012/13 DJF meteorological winter for Germany, which pretty much represents Central Europe.
This winter has been characterized by its darker, colder and snowier conditions. It was the most sunless German winter since measurements began in 1951. On average tthe sun appeared for only 96 hours over the three-month period, which is only 62% of the mean of 154 hours.

As a whole, the 2012/13 winter for Germany was 0.6°C colder than the 1981-2010 average. That’s the 5th time in a row that winter has been colder than normal.
Germany as a whole was had above average precipitation. On average 210 l/m² of precipitation fell in the winter of 2012/13 – the long-term average is 181 l/m². On 21 January almost all of Germany was covered by snow.
Record snowfall in Austria
Austria’s ZAMG Weather Service writes that the DJF winter was characterised by having the lowest amount of sunshine since 1904. Sunshine was 37% below normal.
The mean temperature for the 3-month period over Austria was 0.1°C colder than the long-term 1981-2010 average.
Precipitation across Austria was well above normal, with new snowfall records being set in some regions. Austria’s 2012/13 winter saw 35% more precipitation than the 1981-2010 mean. The ZAMG writes that Reichenau an der Rax saw 330 mm of precipitation over the three-month period, the most since records began in 1865. In Bregenz 263 cm of new snow fell over the period – 4 times the average. On February 9 Bregenz set a new record for snow amount since measurements began in 1936.
Eisenstadt saw three times more snow than average and Vienna saw two times more snowfall than the 30-year long-term mean. Snowfall records were set at a number of other locations.
In both the German and Austrian summaries, there’s no mention of “climate change”, which otherwise almost always appears in reports when warmer than normal temperatures are the case.

"Companies bidding for public sector contracts will be forced to take radical steps to tackle the climate crisis under new regulations being proposed by the Labour party, addressing energy use, greenhouse gas emissions and waste. If elected, the party would force suppliers to “put people and planet before profit”, with the threat of losing contracts if they do not, in a stark redrawing of priorities for contract bidders.  The government buys goods and services worth about £284bn from the private sector every year, making it one of the biggest single customers for many private sector companies. The proposed changes would force companies to take a much greater role in combating the climate emergency, and have a knock-on effect across the business sector as they would be more likely to replicate those standards in other non-public sector work. If it was elected, Labour would also ensure the public sector bodies that deliver goods and services, including the NHS, would have to adhere to higher green standards. Shadow ministers have already pledged to “insource” more goods and services to the public sector, rather than favouring private companies. Standards on trade union recognition, late payments and tax compliance would also be updated and enforced. Jon Trickett, the shadow minister for the Cabinet Office for the Labour party, said: “For too long large firms have enjoyed the immense benefits that come from public sector contracts, but have failed to protect the public good. There is no greater public good than our planet and the environment – businesses must deliver decisive action.” Labour has pledged action on climate change to meet the “net zero carbon” target for 2050, recommended by the Committee on Climate Change in a recent landmark report. The party was also instrumental in having parliament declare a climate emergency. If followed through, both would require much greater action on carbon dioxide emissions across the economy but senior figures in politics and civil society are concerned they could be forgotten among other political priorities if pressure is not kept up. Trickett said: “Labour will ensure that every firm providing goods and services to the public sector puts people and planet before profit. The stakes demand nothing less.” The move may end up costing the Treasury and government departments more in the short term, because contracts are currently awarded largely to the lowest bidder, and cutting carbon dioxide emissions may require bidders to increase their investments. But Labour believes it will save money in the longer term and provide improvements in vital areas such as climate change, air pollution, health and other social benefits. Aaron Kiely, climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “The UK parliament has declared a climate emergency and all areas of government and business must respond to this crisis as quickly as possible. Making sure public money supports public good by only giving government contracts to green suppliers is a sensible start, and will lay down a clear marker for companies to comply.” The party has examined the current standards for bidders to supply the public sector, and believes the new pledges could be delivered with relatively minor changes to regulations. The proposals are part of Labour’s “green industrial revolution”, that has been championed by Corbyn, and would involve new investment in renewable energy such as solar panels, and cleaner forms of transport. It also follows mooted proposals to delist UK companies that fail to take action on the climate emergency, though that would be more complex. Public sector contracts are considered a good place to start because they are within the government’s control and many companies rely on the hundreds of billions they pay out each year. Perhaps unusually for Corbyn, who has often been defined in opposition to former Labour prime minister Tony Blair, the new plans are a redrawing of previous attempts by Blair more than a decade ago to use public sector procurement to force suppliers to make changes to their practices. A taskforce was set up in 2006 on how to “green” public sector contracts. The initiative foundered, however, when it met resistance from suppliers and public sector procurement specialists, who argued it would force a rise in costs for the government. After the financial crisis, little more was heard of it."

"It was always going to be awkward. Queensland’s premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, walked a thin political line on Friday, hosting a lunch with the US vice president turned climate activist, Al Gore, without mentioning the word Adani.  Nevertheless, the mining company’s name and all that it has come to represent loomed large in a room filled with the state’s most influential business and political leaders. Gore declared Queensland to be ground zero of change – “This is the place where the future is unfolding” – and praised Palaszczuk for her leadership. She spoke of natural disasters and a transition to renewables, and admitted resources sustained her state’s existence. “In Queensland, we are, and will continue to be, a state where minerals that sustain human existence are dug from the ground,” she said. “Ever since James Nash discovered gold near Gympie in 1867, Queensland has been a resources state. Whether it is copper, silver, lead and zinc from Mount Isa, copper and gold at Gympie and then Mount Morgan, or the world’s best metallurgical coal from the Bowen Basin west of Mackay, Queensland’s history is built on resources. “As long as the world needs steel, we will need iron ore and metallurgical coal to make it.” Labor lost two seats in Queensland at the May federal election, but it was the swing against Labor in central and north Queensland which has the state government, and the federal opposition, spooked. Having been weaponised by both sides of politics, Adani has aggressively gone on the offensive to protest about the delays in its approvals. The dust had not even begun to settle after the election before Palaszczuk was on a plane north, promising to set an approval time line for the mine. That last state approval is due on 13 June. It made Gore’s taxpayer-subsidised climate change training in the capital somewhat awkward for the government, turning a once celebrated and anticipated climate-themed week into the political equivalent of a nervous laugh. Palaszczuk pointed to the state’s progress in reaching its 50% renewables target by 2030. Gore welcomed Queensland’s progress. He echoed comments he made in an interview with Guardian Australia about the need to move towards more progressive climate change polices. And while he remains too much of a politician to embarrass his host, he acknowledged the Adani conundrum without saying the word. “You could make this your future,” he said of renewable energy. “Build a nationwide grid. You could export renewable electricity by long distance high capacity … cables to Indonesia. To Singapore. To other nations hungry for non-polluting energy. Energy does not contribute to the destruction of humanity’s future. “You could use zero marginal cost electricity which you already have, for several hours of many days, you could have it in abundance to operate the high school chemistry equations which convert water into hydrogen and oxygen and use hydrogen as a conveyor and storage medium for energy and export it to the rest of the world, starting with Japan. “… But the nation has to make a decision. “Will you educate the engineers that you need? Will you build the infrastructure that is necessary? “Will you avoid the opportunity cost of still going after dinosaur projects of the past? That is all I am going to say. “I’m encouraged; I am optimistic. I truly believe that Queensland is showing the way for humanity’s bright and hopeful future. I said that the jury is still out, but I am optimistic.” But Gore did not receive answers to his questions. Neither did anyone else. Unusually for one of these events, there was no question section for anyone in the audience. Gore left to continue his Climate Reality training as scheduled. Palaszczuk was whisked away by her staff, avoiding journalists. That was answer enough."

Share this...FacebookTwitterHaving been born and raised in Vermont in the 1960s and 70s, I remember the state always being environmentally aware and active in the sense of clean water, clean air and beautiful landscapes. The drive behind this traditional environmentalism came from the natural beauty of the state’s rolling green hills, mountains, lakes, forests and rural charm. There was always a desire to protect and preserve.
I’m no photographer, but here are a couple of shots I took of Vermont awhile back.

Near Craftsbury, Morey Hill Rd. I own a one and a quarter acre lot about a mile away. 

The “climate rescuers” want to industrialize these areas. Town Hill Rd. Wolcott

View from the top of Mt. Mansfield, just under the clouds. 
 I remember many long walks along gravel roads like the ones pictured above when I was a boy.
In the 1970s environmentalist kooks started pouring into the state from places like New York, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Connecticut. With them they brought an extreme strain of environmentalism, and lots of connections to big business and financiers.
Before too long a mission of a much higher order took hold: the world climate had to be rescued, whatever it took. And the only way to protect Vermont’s way of life and icons like maple syrup, ski industry and fall foliage season (what Germans like calling “Indian Summer”), they told us, was to build huge industrial wind turbines on Vermont’s mountain tops. The slick environmentalists somehow managed to convince the citizens to enter this madness.
And politicians, always the first to be duped, took it in hook, line and sinker. Old US Senators like Jim Jeffords, Pat Leahy and Bernie The Kook Sanders, who years earlier had warned us that rain was threatening our mountains and forests, led the way and suddenly became huge proponents of mountain top wind power. Soon construction companies and power companies began cutting down forests and blasting mountain tops in order to make way for the 500-foot monster wind turbines. Vermont patted itself on the back, believing it had become a global leader, role model and hero in “climate protection”.
Ethan Allen rolled in his grave.

Today, now that some windparks have been erected on mountains tops just a couple miles from my hometown, Vermont residents are starting to wake up, and many are truly shocked by the ugly reality of industrial wind energy. Citizens are realizing the wool had been pulled over their eyes.
Website Energize Vermont here reports that Vermont state senators Joe Benning and Bob Hartwell have drafted a bill calling for a moratorium on wind energy in the green mountain state. It’s high time.
What follows is a video of the press conference by these senators presenting a powerful case:

At 6:47 Benning:
The problem ladies and gentlemen is our Public Service Board has gone from its original mission of trying to determine whether or not a public good can be sustained when electric power is available, it itself can be sustained, and is inexpensive. That was the original intent of the Public Service Board. That mission has morphed into ‘industrial wind is renewable, and therefore it is good. We must build it now. We must build as much of it as possible and we igonre this kind of environmental destruction and the social upheaval that comes with it’.”
Disappointingly, the senators still believe in all the climate change crap and they advocate other silly energy sources that wouldn’t fulfil the Public Service Board’s original intent. But progress is slow at times, and I suspect they’ll have to get burned by every type of worthless renewable energy before they do finally learn. I’m sure there are plenty of people who are already telling them that solar and biogas are crap, too. Do you think they are listening?
We’ll have to be patient.
No matter, note the loud applause when Benning points out that mountain mutilation “is not right”. A few years ago such a reaction would have been unimaginable. There’s thunderous applause throughout the press conference. The growing momentum is palpable.
It’s interesting to listen to the comments of the senators. I can’t believe that they had not been told about the problems with wind energy earlier.
I don’t know what the situation is like in WUWT’s Ric Werme’s state of New Hampshire, Vermont’s sister state.
Please feel free to Send e-mails of support to any Vermont leader Senators with links to interesting stories we’ve discussed here in Europe, like: http://www.spectator.co.uk/features/8807761/wind-farms-vs-wildlife/  or http://www.ref.org.uk/press-releases/281-wearnandntearnhitsnwindnfarmnoutputnandneconomicnlifetime

"The second Morrison ministry contains no one with nominal responsibility for “climate” in any sense, despite the fact that it is the greatest threat facing the country. Angus Taylor, who spent much of his pre-parliamentary career fighting windfarms, claiming repeatedly that there is “too much wind and solar” in the system, is now minister for energy and emissions reduction. No mention of climate here, despite the fact that climate is what it is all about, or should be. Sussan Ley has been made the environment minister, but more intriguing, David Littleproud is minister for water resources, drought, rural finance, natural disaster and emergency management. Let’s take another look at this: water (or lack thereof) … drought … disaster … emergency management.  Is it possible that someone is starting to join the dots – a tacit admission of an escalating climate emergency? In the National party, where competition to develop sensible climate policy is nonexistent, Littleproud has at least pushed for serious policy to address climate impacts on farmers. His title, truth be known, should be the minister for the rural climate emergency. But when he gets a briefing from disaster management officials, he may be in for a shock. During the 2017-2018 Senate inquiry on the implications of climate change for Australia’s national security, the most compelling evidence was led by Mark Crosweller, the head of a resilience taskforce in the Department of Home Affairs, who used to be the director general of Emergency Management Australia. He described potential worst-case climate scenarios as being of an “existential nature”. This analysis was taken up in the inquiry’s final report. In contrast, the submission to the Senate inquiry by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade downplayed concerns about the impact on Australia’s economy of climate security threats, noting our dependence on strong international trade and investment and stating that: Climate-related costs have the potential to be a disruptive economic force, albeit accompanied by opportunities presented by global transition to a lower emissions, more climate-resilient economy.”  This rather misses the point. By mid-century, a plausible scenario is one of escalating extreme weather events, related conflict and migration, so affecting the international order and global trade that Australia itself would face dramatic political, economic, social and human security consequences in an increasingly chaotic world overwhelmed by climate impact. If Littleproud is to take his rural climate emergency duties seriously, he needs to understand why that might be so. We have addressed these issues in a new Breakthrough policy paper. In the foreword, retired admiral Chris Barrie says the paper has “laid bare the unvarnished truth about the desperate situation humans, and our planet, are in, painting a disturbing picture of the real possibility that human life on Earth may be on the way to extinction, in the most horrible way”. A realistic assessment of climate-related impacts and threats depends on understanding the strengths and weaknesses of climate science projections. Unfortunately, much scientific knowledge produced for climate policymaking is conservative and reticent. In reality, climate change now represents a near- to mid-term existential threat to human civilisation. A new approach to climate-related risk management is required, paying particular attention to the high-end and difficult-to-quantify “fat-tail” possibilities, such as climate tipping points. This should be the key task of the minister’s new department. What sort of approach should the government bring to emergency risk management in the face of existential climate risk? It is essential these high-end, bad possibilities, not just middle-of-the-road probabilities, are seriously considered. This may be most effectively explored by scenario analysis. In our paper a 2050 scenario is outlined in which accelerating climate-change impacts pose large negative consequences to humanity which might not be undone for centuries. To reduce such risks and to sustain human civilisation, including the Australian farming sector which is the minister’s particular concern, it is essential to build a zero-emissions industrial system very quickly. This requires the mobilisation of resources on an emergency basis, akin to wartime, rather than reactively responding to disasters when they arise. By that time it will be too late to avoid the worst climate impacts. This requires a whole of government taskforce, cutting across conventional ministerial and departmental boundaries, charged with the overriding objective of planning and implementing a rational response to the climate emergency. The plan would encompass the full gamut of national activity, including defence, industry, economic, financial, scientific and social considerations. For the best form of natural disaster and emergency management is proactive prevention, and that is only possible if the threat is first understood and acknowledged. Clearly the Morrison government, along with the ALP, have yet to reach that point as they contemplate further expansion of our fossil fuel industry in the Galilee Basin and elsewhere, which will only exacerbate climate pressure on our farmers. Littleproud arguably has the most crucial and important role in cabinet. How to convince his colleagues of the real climate disasters which now confront this country, and particularly the agricultural sector, unless we rapidly move away from our fossil fuel past. If he does not, he and his cabinet colleagues will fail catastrophically in their primary responsibility, which is their duty of care to protect the Australian people, their safety and wellbeing. • Ian Dunlop was formerly an international oil, gas and coal industry executive, chair of the Australian Coal Association and CEO of the Australian Institute of Company Directors.

"Sydney’s Inner West council says it has 100% divested from fossil fuels after a three-year process that began before the amalgamation of Leichhardt, Marrickville and Ashfield councils. The council is now calling on the New South Wales government to work with the big four banks “to develop financial products that will allow more organisations to follow our lead”.  The council has moved about $100m over three years and is one of more than 40 local governments across Australia that have taken steps to move out of funds with investments linked to climate change. It said its divestment included withdrawing money it had in products with the big four banks – with the exception of some longer term investments in climate and socially responsible bonds – and transitioning into other non-fossil fuel investments. It follows a lengthy campaign by the environmental organisation 350.org pushing institutions to divest from fossil fuels. At its first meeting in 2017, the newly merged Inner West council passed a motion to become fully divested from fossil fuel funds. Leichhardt already had a target of 50% divestment before the amalgamation and its previous mayor, Labor’s Darcy Byrne – now the mayor of Inner West council – said the new council wanted to continue that process. “The inner west of Sydney, sometimes referred to as the people’s republic of the inner west, is home to an enormous population of people who believe climate change is an existential threat to society,” Byrne said. “We’re determined that the inner west will be a national leader in the environmental debate and that means making important symbolic stands like divestment but also putting our money where our mouth is.” He said the process was managed in increments, and with monthly reports from council staff in an effort to mitigate financial risks. Byrne said they had still faced challenges and Tcorp – the New South Wales Treasury Corporation – had expressed concern at a meeting last year that it could affect the council’s ability to borrow funds from it. A spokeswoman for Tcorp said it had a policy of “not discussing client work” and therefore couldn’t respond to questions, but she confirmed the agency was working with the council on the financing of its new swimming pool at Ashfield. A spokeswoman for Inner West council said it wanted the state government to work with the big banks to develop short-term investment options that were not linked to industries that contribute to global heating. Glen Klatovsky, the acting chief executive of 350.org, said Australia had more local governments than anywhere else in the world that had committed to divestment. He said Inner West, to his knowledge, was the first in NSW to manage 100% divestment because of the work and challenges involved. “The council has a fiduciary and legal duty under the local government act to be careful with their investments,” Klatovsky said. “Several have raised the issue of governments and banks working together to create a fund that would meet this public demand then it would be much easier for Australian local governments to deliver on their commitments to divest. “At the moment there’s no financial reason that this couldn’t happen.” Klatovsky said 350.org had worked with nearly 40 councils that had committed to divestment, but the total number around Australia making similar commitments was greater than that. “The most interesting place is WA where 33% of the population is covered by councils that have divested,” Klatovsky said."

Share this...FacebookTwitterYesterday Germany’s No. 1 daily (circulation over 3.5 million), Bild online, carried the shock headline story: “Russian scientist sees next ice age approaching. Starting in 2014 it will start getting colder and colder +++ migration of people cannot be excluded“.

Other media outlets are reporting as well, see here, here, and here.
Stories in Germany about global cooling, hard winters, and ice ages have been popping up faster than dandelions in May lately. Global warming is beginning to look historical.
Bild starts by reporting that finally the snow and ice gripping Russia since October are beginning to thaw. “That’s why most Russians shake their heads skeptically when the topic of global warming pops up,“ Bild writes. 
While some scientists say the cold is due to global warming, “one scientist at the Pulkovo Observatory in St. Petersburg sees it completely differently: He sees the next ice age approaching soon!”
Astrophysicist Chabibullo Abdussamatov claims that the sun will radiate significantly less warmth in the coming years. “Consequently a ‘little ice age’ lies ahead.”

Bild adds that Abdussamatov says the Earth has had a negative energy budget since 1990, but that the oceans have been able to compensate with its stored energy. But the Russian scientist now says that’s over. Bild writes:
Beginning around 2014 the average annual temperature will begin to drop, and by 2050 it will be about 1.5°C cooler than today when the low point is reached. Also the water temperature in the world’s oceans will fall about 1°C.”
Personally, I think Abdussamatov is being too pessimistic. He says solar activity will be responsible for the decline, and says the 1.5°C temperature drop will be enough for Greenland to reglaciate. Other effects will be “a return to real hard Russian winters“, and cooler summers. Moreover he says the cooling will really start getting underway in 2015.
Abdussamatov is not the only scientist who is seriously skeptical of global warming. Bild writes that Andrei Fursov, Director of the Center for Russian Science at the Moscow University of Intellectual Sciences warns about the apocalyptic scenarios floating around. “The feared global warming left the worry of the ozone hole in the shadows. In the meantime, the ozone hole has since closed up by itself.”
Fursov says in an interview:
The ice at the poles is really melting, but that does necessarily have anything to do with greenhouse gases.”
Interesting that Abdussamatov sees a negative energy balance since 1990. An interesting view from Russia that needs to be looked at.
