"A joint US-Canadian declaration to help spur the transition to a low carbon economy passed the baton of global climate action from Barack Obama to Justin Trudeau on Thursday – and brightened prospects for the Paris agreement. The initiative, which roams from Arctic protection to plugging methane emissions from oil wells and pipelines to decarbonisation of the US and Canadian economies in the second half of this century, cements a new climate change partnership between neighbours after 15 years of pulling in opposite directions.  It signals once again that Obama intends to keep pushing hard on climate change in what was supposed to be the lame duck phase of his presidency. And it improves the prospects of rallying countries to ratify the Paris climate agreement when it opens for signing on 22 April. The agreement needs to be signed by 55 countries responsible for 55% of global emissions to come into force. “The United States and Canada are fully united in combatting climate change,” Obama told a press conference at the White House on Thursday. “We are focusing on making sure the Paris agreement is fully implemented.” Trudeau agreed, describing the Paris agreement as an action plan, and the US and Canadian leaders as key players in ensuring its success. “That agreement is both a symbolic declaration of global cooperation on climate change as well a practical guide for growing our economies in a responsible and sustainable way,” he told the press conference. “We know that our international partners expect and, indeed, need leadership from us on this issue.” The US and Canada were committed to signing the Paris agreement as soon as possible, Trudeau went on, a move which could help the United Nations reach its goal of ratifying the agreement in 2016, before Obama leaves the White House. Thursday’s declaration marks the first time in 15 years that US and Canadian leaders have been in sync on climate change. George Bush pulled the US out of the Kyoto climate accords when he came to the White House in 2001. Stephen Harper, the Canadian prime minister, also withdrew from the agreement and pushed aggressively the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, which would have ramped up production from the carbon-heavy Alberta tar sands. The two leaders began their relationship with some friction, with Obama cancelling the Keystone XL project  last November, days after Trudeau took office. The Canadian leader did not protest, however. But with the declaration of a shared vision on climate change, Trudeau is now cast as Obama’s heir – in terms of pressing for global actions.  Once Obama leaves the White House, it will fall to Trudeau to maintain continuity of a North American climate plan should a Democrat takes the White House, or to help to keep the flame alive in the event a Republican wins the election and follows through on threats to overturn Obama’s policies.  The concern for Obama’s long-term climate legacy was inherent in Thursday’s declaration, with the US and Canada pledging to deliver plans for decarbonising the post-2050 economy by the end of 2016.  The neighbours also pledged to lobby other G20 countries to produce their long-term climate plans – a move which could boost international confidence that the Paris agreement is indeed putting the global economy on a low-carbon trajectory. That could help box in Obama’s successor – from either party – making it difficult to overturn the Paris agreement without the risk of antagonising an important ally and neighbour. The joint commitment to reduce methane emissions by up to 45% from 2012 by 2025 will have the most immediate impact in helping the US and Canada to hit the emissions reductions targets they offered at Paris. Emissions from methane – a far more powerful climate pollutant than carbon dioxide – rose rapidly with the boom in fracking. Campaigners had been pressing Obama to cut methane from existing oil and gas wells – not just future projects, warning the US had no chance of hitting its Paris targets without such measures. Gina McCarthy, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, agreed, telling a White House conference call with reporters: “We are going to have to tackle emissions from existing sources.” The campaign group Earthworks, which has used infrared imaging to map methane leaks, said the new methane initiative was a significant step-up in Obama’s efforts to cap emissions from oil and gas wells. “With today’s announcement, President Obama starts to get serious,” the organisation said in a statement. But it was on the global arena, where Obama played a critical role in nudging countries towards the Paris agreement, where the renewed US-Canadian partnership on climate change could have the most impact. “On the big looming issues on the horizon, it is vital for us to work together because the more aligned we are, the more we can shape the international agenda to meet these challenges,” Obama said. “Climate change is such an example.” He suggested that having Trudeau on side with the two leaders’ shared liberal values would help drive solutions to help poor countries deal with climate change.  “If we don’t agree, if we’re not aggressive, if we’re not far-sighted, if we don’t pool our resources around the research and development and clean energy agenda that’s required to solve this problem, then other countries won’t step up and it won’t get solved,” Obama said. “That’s a really important effort.”  The two leaders also pledged to secure a deal cutting emissions from commercial air planes through the International Civil Aviation Organisation, which is based in Montreal.  They committed to raise fuel economy standards for delivery trucks and buses, and to work to get more solar and wind power on the US and Canadian electrical grids. On the Arctic, the two leaders pledged to take “science-based standards” into account for any future oil and gas drilling.  Noting the rapid disappearance of the sea ice cover, the US and Canada also committed to reduce the use of heavy fuel oil, set up low-impact shipping lanes, and work for sustainable commercial fishing.  Obama and Trudeau will have another chance to work on Arctic protections at a White House summit in the autumn and, as officials made clear in a conference call, he has no intention of reining back on climate activism any time soon.  The president will seek out climate partnerships with other countries in the remaining months, John Morton, an adviser, told reporters. “I can tell you we are working actively on ensuring that in final year of the administration we see continued progress bilaterally and multilaterally,” he told a conference call."
"The Obama administration abandoned its plan for oil and gas drilling in Atlantic waters on Tuesday, after strong opposition from the Pentagon and coastal communities. The announcement from Sally Jewell, the interior secretary, to bar drilling across the length of the mid-Atlantic seaboard reverses Obama’s decision just a year ago to open up the east coast to oil and gas exploration, and consolidates his record for environmental protection.  In a conference call with reporters, Jewell said Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida would remain off-limits for drilling until 2022 because of coastal communities’ concerns about risks to their fishing and tourist industries from an oil and gas spill, and warnings from the navy about interference with its systems.  “We heard from many corners that now is not the time to offer oil and gas leasing off the Atlantic coast,” Jewell said. “When you factor in conflicts with national defense, economic activities such as fishing and tourism, and opposition from many local communities, it simply doesn’t make sense to move forward with lease sales in the coming five years.” Jewell left open a small possibility for future drilling in the Arctic, saying officials would still consider leases at three locations within the Chukchi and Beaufort seas, and Cook inlet.   “We know the Arctic is a unique place of critical importance to many – including Alaska Natives who rely on the ocean for subsistence,” Jewell said. “We want to hear from the public to help determine whether these areas are appropriate for future leasing and how we can protect environmental, cultural and subsistence resources.”  But with limited industry interest in hunting for oil in Arctic waters at today’s low oil prices, the consensus from environmental campaigners was that, outside the concentration of industry in the Gulf of Mexico, America’s waters remain safe from oil and gas drilling.  “With the offshore Atlantic now closed to new exploration, it is hard to see where growth for big oil in North America is going to come from. Unimaginable even a few years ago, we are now seeing the beginning of the end of the oil age,” Greepeace said in a statement. There was never any consideration of drilling off the Pacific coasts, because of local opposition.  Environmental advocates called the Atlantic drilling plan  an outsize victory for reducing climate change. “It will prevent oil spills and coastal industrialization, it makes seismic testing unnecessary and it will help promote the clean energy solutions that we so desperately need,” said Jacqueline Savitz, Oceana’s vice-president for the US. “With this decision coastal communities have won a ‘David v Goliath’ fight against the richest companies on the planet, and that is a cause for tremendous optimism for the wellbeing of future generations.” Sierra Weaver, an attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Centre, said the decision was a victory for more than 100 towns that had protested against the drilling plan.  “The hero in this fight is not one person or one city or one group,” Weaver said. “It is a collection of determined communities and elected leaders from both parties that banded together to protect their coasts.” The American Petroleum Institute, the main industry lobby group, condemned the move as “extreme”. “This is not how you harness America’s economic and diplomatic potential,” Jack Gerard, API’s president, said in a statement. Despite the three leases, the Arctic was expected to remain off-limits to oil companies, in part because of low industry interest. Shell pulled out of its Alaska operations last year. Obama cancelled a number of Arctic leases last October. In a joint declaration last week, Obama and Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, committed to follow “science-based standards” when it came to sanctioning new oil and gas drilling in the Arctic.  Obama had faced strong pressure from industry and state governors to open up the Atlantic to drilling.  However, there was a backlash from coastal communities, who feared a repeat of BP’s disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. The Democratic presidential contenders, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, were also opposed to drilling.  

Obama has given a number of indications in the past six months that he is becoming more responsive to campaigners’ arguments that if he is serious about fighting climate change he must stop the extraction of coal, oil, and gas – not just put curbs on emissions. Obama and Trudeau took a big step towards protecting the Arctic last week, declaring that any future oil and gas exploration in the polar region “must align with science-based standards between the two nations that ensure appropriate preparation for operating in Arctic conditions, including robust and effective well control and emergency response measures”. The Interior Department cancelled lease sales in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas last October. The strictures against future Arctic drilling are unlikely to inflict an immediate political toll on Obama. Oil companies have grown more reluctant to invest the huge sums required to operate off the north coast of Alaska, given current low prices and the disappointing results that led Shell to give up on its exploratory well in the region."
"More than 36 million people face hunger across southern and eastern Africa, the United Nations has warned, as swaths of the continent grapple with the worst drought in decades at a time of record high temperatures. The immediate cause of the drought which has crippled countries from Ethiopia to Zimbabwe is one of the strongest El Niño events ever recorded. It has turned normal weather patterns upside down around the globe, climate scientists say.  But with the world still reeling from record-high temperatures in February, there are fears that the long-term impacts of climate change are also undermining the region’s ability to endure extremes in weather, leaving huge numbers of people vulnerable to hunger and disease. The worst hit country in the current crisis is Ethiopia, where rains vital to four-fifths of the country’s crops have failed. Unicef has said it is making plans to treat more than 2 million children for malnutrition, and says more than 10 million people will need food aid. “Ethiopia has been hit by a double blow, both from a change to the rainy seasons that have been linked to long-term climate change and now from El Niño, which has potentially led the country to one of the worst droughts in decades,” said Gillian Mellsop, Unicef representative to Ethiopia. The crisis has been damaging even to Ethiopians not at immediate risk of going hungry. It has truncated the education of 3.9 million children and teenagers, who “are unable to access quality education opportunities because of the drought”, she said. Neighbouring countries grappling with hunger after crops failed include Somalia, Sudan and Kenya, and altogether the failed rains have left more than 20 million people “food insecure” in the region.  The drought caught many officials by surprise, because although El Niño was forecast, the weather event normally brings more rain to the region, not less. “The typical pattern that you would expect with El Niño is very dry weather in southern Africa, but slightly wetter than normal in eastern Africa,” said Dr Linda Hirons, a research scientist at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science. “So the fact that we have had parts of eastern Africa experiencing drought is unusual … but every single El Niño event manifests itself differently.” In southern Africa, the drought caused by El Niño was expected, but it has been even more severe than feared, with rains failing two years in a row.  Overall nearly 16 million people in southern Africa are already going hungry, and that number could rise fast. “More than 40 million rural and 9 million poor urban people are at risk due to the impacts of El Niño’s related drought and erratic rainfall,” the World Food Programme has warned. Zimbabwe, once the region’s bread basket, is one of the worst hit countries. In February, the country’s president Robert Mugabe declared a state of disaster due to the drought, and in less than a month official estimates of people needing food aid has risen from 3 million to 4 million. Neighbouring countries are also scrambling to find food aid, including South Africa, whose ports are the main entry point for relief across the region. “We are seeing this as a regional crisis, a cross-country humanitarian crisis,” said Victor Chinyama. “In each country maybe the numbers [of hungry people] are nowhere near as much as Ethiopia, but if you put these numbers together as a whole region, you get a sense of how large a crisis this is.” More than a third of households are now going hungry, he said. Families that used to eat two meals a day are cutting back to one, and those who could once provide a single meal for their dependents are now entirely reliant on food aid, he said. Beyond the immediate scramble to get food to those who need it, aid workers in the region say the drought has served as reminder that communities vulnerable to changing weather patterns need longer-term help adapting. “It’s becoming common knowledge now that we will experience droughts much more,” said Beatrice Mwangi, resilience and livelihoods director, southern Africa region, World Vision, who said she is focused on medium- and long-term responses. “In the past it was one big drought every 10 years, then it came to one drought every five years, and now the trends are showing that it will be one every three to five years. So we are in a crisis alright, that is true. “But it’s going to be the new norm. So our responses need to appreciate that … there is climate change, and it’s going to affect the people that we work with, the communities we serve.”"
"A record number of Americans believe global warming will pose a threat to their way of life, new polling data shows, amid strengthening public acceptance that rising temperatures are being driven by human activity.  “I think a shift in public opinion and consciousness has been underway for several years now,” Michael Mann, a prominent climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University, told the Guardian.  A spokesman for 350 Action, the political arm of climate activist group 350.org, said meanwhile that politicians who cast doubt on climate science would soon have to take such polling into account. Republicans, he said, “are going to be screwed if they don’t change their tune”. Polling firm Gallup, which has been tracking public sentiment on the topic annually since 1997, found that 41% of US adults feel warming will pose a “serious threat” to them during their lifetimes. This is the highest level recorded by Gallup, a 4% increase on 2015. A total of 64% of those polled said they worried about global warming a “great deal” or a “fair amount”, the highest level of recorded concern since 2008. Just 36% of Americans said they did not fret about it, or only worried a little. The results show a solidifying belief that changes in the climate are under way, with 59% of people thinking so. A record 65% of Americans said global warming was down to greenhouse gases released by human activity – a 10% leap on last year.  Just 31% said the warming was due to natural causes, the lowest level of such skepticism in 15 years. The March polling involved more than 1,000 adults in all 50 states.  “I suspect it is a confluence of multiple factors,” said Mann. “The overall warmth in recent years here in the US, Europe and worldwide is part of it.  “But so too are the increasing number of destructive extreme weather events – floods, droughts, massive wildfires, extreme heat, unprecedented hurricanes … This puts a human face on the issue of climate change.” Strikingly, concern over global warming has grown across the political divide, with 9% more Republicans saying they worry about the issue “a great deal” compared to last year.  There remains a partisan divide, however, with just 35% of Republicans blaming human activity for global warming, compared to 85% of Democrats. Among independents, 68% accept humans are the main cause of warming, with 64% saying they worry a lot about the topic. The surge in public concern over rising temperatures following an abnormally warm winter in the US and the historic Paris climate deal in December, in which nearly 200 nations agreed to curb their emissions in order to avoid dangerous sea level rises, droughts, extreme weather events and food insecurity. The failed Copenhagen climate talks of 2009, along with with what has been called a “constant barrage” of climate science denial in the media, had made the American public increasingly skeptical of the issue. Polling by Gallup from 2014 found that more than 40% of Americans felt that the seriousness of global warming was exaggerated by the media. But climate campaigners claim the sheer weight of evidence of a warming world is now beginning to overwhelm the messages of doubt put forward by fossil fuel-aligned groups such as the Heartland Institute and conservative media outlets. Mann said climate scientists were doing well to get their findings heard “despite the fierce headwind of a millions of dollars fossil fuel-industry funded disinformation campaign we have been fighting for years”.  “I also think that the profound impacts that climate change is already having and which people are experiencing, has impaired the climate change disinformation machine,” he said. “Climate change denial is simply no longer plausible, and the American people are recognizing that.” February smashed a century of monthly global temperature records by a “stunning” margin, according to data released by Nasa this week. On Thursday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said the US has just experienced its warmest winter on record, with scientists calling the recent heat “staggering” and similar to “something out of a sci-fi movie”. The warmth, aided by a strong El Niño event, has essentially robbed the Arctic of its winter, reducing ice thickness. In Washington DC, pink cherry blossoms are blooming unusually early; heat sucked up by the oceans is causing havoc for wildlife off the west coast. Last year was the warmest year on record globally; scientists forecast this record to fall again in 2016. Despite this, climate change has barely featured in the Republican presidential debates. Frontrunner Donald Trump has derided the science as “bullshit” and called climate change a “hoax” invented by the Chinese. “Sadly, I think that the current Republican party including their likely presidential nominee are entrenched in their climate change denialism,” Mann said. “Only a major political shakeup and realignment is likely to change that. But we might very well see that realignment in this election.” A spokesman for 350 Action said: “Climate change is no longer a distant threat, but a clear and present danger. People can see the changes underway right in their neighborhood, whether it’s a forest fire bearing down on their backyard or rising seas lapping at their doorstep.  “I think we’re reaching a tipping point where that concern manifests into an even stronger demand for immediate action from politicians. Republicans are going to be screwed if they don’t change their tune.”"
"Doubling the share of renewables in the global energy mix to 36% by 2030 could save the world economy up to $4.2tn a year, research by the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena) showed on Wednesday.  Renewable sources, such as wind and solar, accounted for around 18% of global energy consumption in 2014. Under existing national policies, the share of renewables is forecast to reach 21% by 2030.   Doubling the current share would help achieve a global target to limit the rise in the global average temperature to below 2C above pre-industrial levels, which was agreed at a summit in Paris last year.  Irena is an intergovernmental organisation that focuses on realising the potential of renewables.  The report said the cost of doubling the renewable share by 2030 would be $290bn a year, but the annual net savings from reducing pollution and emissions on human health and agriculture would be between $1.2tn and $4.2tn.  “Achieving a doubling is not only feasible, it is cheaper than not doing so,” Irena’s director general Adnan Amin said in a statement.  “It would create more jobs, save millions of lives from reduced air pollution and set us on a pathway to limit global temperature rise to two degrees as agreed in Paris,” he added.  Separately on Wednesday, the European Environment Agency said the share of renewable energy in the European Union inched up to 15.2% in 2014 from 15% in 2013, according to preliminary data for 2014, the latest year available."

"   The “alarming” and “unprecedented” rate of climate change is “sending a powerful message to world leaders”, the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) has warned.  Releasing its Status of the Global Climate report, the WMO – a United Nations body – detailed the string of climate and weather records that were broken in 2015, including global temperature records, exceptional rainfall, devastating droughts, unusual cyclone activity and intense heatwaves. “The year 2015 will stand out in the historical record of the global climate in many ways,” said WMO secretary-general Petteri Taalas in the report. “The future is happening now,” he said in a statement released alongside the report. “The alarming rate of change we are now witnessing in our climate as a result of greenhouse gas emission is unprecedented in modern records.” Global surface temperatures in 2015 shattered all previous records by a wide margin, the report shows, sitting 0.76C above the 1961-90 average. Temperatures over land, over the ocean and in the top 700 and 2,000 metres of the ocean all set new records. “Our planet is sending a powerful message to world leaders to sign and implement the Paris agreement on climate change and cut greenhouse gases now before we pass the point of no return,” Taalas said. Dr Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick from the University of New South Wales in Australia said the language was very strong for the WMO. “They are usually very conservative,” she said. “We have to put this report in context. 2014 was the hottest year on record to date too. We’ve had something like 15 out of the 16 hottest years on record since the turn of the millennium,” she said. “Things aren’t getting better, they’re getting much much worse, and the tone of the report reflects this.” Perkins-Kirkpatrick said the statistics revealed an emergency. “We haven’t experienced a month that has been below average for over 30 years … I think people forget climate change started happening a long time ago, before a lot of us were even born. Honestly, it’s frightening.” The report follows Nasa figures showing that February 2016 was the most unseasonably hot month on record by a massive margin, which climate scientists described as “shocking”.  Although a strong El Niño was pushing temperatures up, it was only part of the story, since the temperatures were much higher than in 1998, when the world went through a comparable or even stronger El Niño. Dr Wenju Cai, from the CSIRO in Melbourne, said the El Niño was probably releasing some of the temperature that had been stored in the ocean during the so-called hiatus. “If you have a hiatus in previous years, more heat is stored in the ocean and that could make it a bigger release.”  The world was playing catch-up for the warming that had been less visible since about 1998, he said. “The startlingly high temperatures so far in 2016 have sent shockwaves around the climate science community,” said David Carlson, director of the World Climate Research Programme. Taalas said “urgent and far-reaching measures to cut carbon dioxide emissions” were needed to avoid temperature rises of 3C. He said investment in disaster early warning systems was essential to help communities adapt to climate change."
"Global greenhouse gas emissions resisted a rise for a second straight year in a sign climate policies are working, a leading energy forecaster projected on Wednesday. Renewable power played a “critical role” in holding CO2 emissions to around 32bn tonnes, the International Energy Agency said in a statement. The Paris-based thinktank also cited falling coal use in top carbon polluters China and the United States in its preliminary data. The figures mark the first period in 40 years that a halt or reduction was not tied to an economic downturn. The data does not account for pollution from transport or changes in land use. “The new figures confirm last year’s surprising but welcome news: we now have seen two straight years of greenhouse gas emissions decoupling from economic growth,” IEA head, Fatih Birol said. “Coming just a few months after the landmark COP21 agreement in Paris, this is yet another boost to the global fight against climate change.” Carbon dioxide is the most durable greenhouse gas, with a lifetime of up to 200 years. Since 1990, CO2 levels have soared over 60%, driven in part by China’s rapid growth. The IEA said surging deployment of renewable power, especially wind drove the plateau, with renewables accounting for 90% of new electricity generation in 2015. Emissions in China, the world’s largest carbon polluter, fell 1.5% on receding coal consumption as it restructured its economy away from energy-intensive industries and ramped up clean energy. In the US, the next largest polluter, a switch from coal to natural gas drove a 2% fall in emissions. Yet rising pollution in other Asian developing economies, the Middle East and Europe, offset those reductions. “It’s very encouraging to see energy-related CO2 emissions growth stall, but few steps have been taken to accelerate clean energy deployment so emissions start to decline,” said Greenpeace energy strategist, Emily Rochon. “As we are witnessing alarming temperature increases, this is no time to sit back and enjoy the ride. World leaders in Paris agreed to limit global warming to 1.5C, which requires unprecedented efforts today, not tomorrow, to scale up renewable energy and reduce energy consumption globally.” Last month was the hottest February on record, with global surface temperatures rising perilously close to that 1.5C threshold, while annual CO2 levels rose the fastest in 56 years."
"Sea levels could rise far more rapidly than expected in coming decades, according to new research that reveals Antarctica’s vast ice cap is less stable than previously thought. The UN’s climate science body had predicted up to a metre of sea level rise this century - but it did not anticipate any significant contribution from Antarctica, where increasing snowfall was expected to keep the ice sheet in balance.  According a study, published in the journal Nature, collapsing Antarctic ice sheets are expected to double sea-level rise to two metres by 2100, if carbon emissions are not cut.  Previously, only the passive melting of Antarctic ice by warmer air and seawater was considered but the new work added active processes, such as the disintegration of huge ice cliffs. “This [doubling] could spell disaster for many low-lying cities,” said Prof Robert DeConto, at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, who led the work. He said that if global warming was not halted, the rate of sea-level rise would change from millimetres per year to centimetres a year. “At that point it becomes about retreat [from cities], not engineering of defences.” As well as rising seas, climate change is also causing storms to become fiercer, forming a highly destructive combination for low-lying cities like New York, Mumbai and Guangzhou. Many coastal cities are growing fast as populations rise and analysis by World Bank and OECD staff has shown that global flood damage could cost them $1tn a year by 2050 unless action is taken. The cities most at risk in richer nations include Miami, Boston and Nagoya, while cities in China, Vietnam, Bangladesh and Ivory Coast are among those most in danger in less wealthy countries. The new research follows other recent studies warning of the possibility of ice sheet collapse in Antarctica and suggesting huge sea-level rises. But the new work suggests that major rises are possible within the lifetimes of today’s children, not over centuries. “The bad news is that in the business-as-usual, high-emissions scenario, we end up with very, very high estimates of the contribution of Antarctica to sea-level rise” by 2100, DeConto told the Guardian. But he said that if emissions were quickly slashed to zero, the rise in sea level from Antarctic ice could be reduced to almost nothing. “This is the good news,” he said. “It is not too late and that is wonderful. But we can’t say we are 100% out of the woods.” Even if emissions are slashed, DeConto said, there remains a 10% chance that sea level will rise significantly. Prof David Vaughan, at the British Antarctic Survey and not part of the research team, said: “The new model includes for the first time a projection of how in future, the Antarctic ice sheet may to lose ice through processes that today we only see occurring in Greenland.  “I have no doubt that on a century to millennia timescale, warming will make these processes significant in Antarctica and drive a very significant Antarctic contribution to sea level rise. The big question for me is, how soon could this all begin. I’m not sure, but these guys are definitely asking the right questions.” Active physical processes are well-known ways of breaking up ice sheets but had not been included in complex 3D models of the Antarctic ice sheet before. The processes include water from melting on the surface of the ice sheet to flow down into crevasses and widen them further. “Meltwater can have a really deleterious effect,” said DeConto. “It’s an attack on the ice sheet from above as well as below.” Today, he said, summer temperatures approach or just exceed freezing point around Antarctica: “It would not take much warming to see a pretty dramatic increase [in surface melting] and it would happen very quickly.” The new models also included the loss of floating ice shelves from the coast of Antarctica, which currently hold back the ice on land. The break-up of ice shelves can also leave huge ice cliffs 1,000m high towering over the ocean, which then collapse under their own weight, pushing up sea level even further. The scientists calibrated their model against geological records of events 125,000 years ago and 3m years ago, when the temperature was similar to today but sea level was much higher. Sea-level rise is also driven by the expansion of water as it gets warmer and in January scientists suggested this factor had been significantly underestimated, adding further weight to concerns about future rises. Recent temperatures have been shattering records and on Monday, it was announced that the Arctic ice cap had been reduced to its smallest winter area since records began in 1979, although the melting of this already floating sea ice does not push up ocean levels."
"This week’s pick of city stories from around the web take us from Seattle to the Finnish city of Tampere as we learn more about green transport, Batman’s hometown and a building called “Top Sexy Tower” (seriously). We’d love to hear your responses to these stories, and any others you’ve read recently: share your thoughts in the comments below.  Seattle’s mayor Ed Murray wants to dramatically increase electric vehicle (EV) use in the city – by 15,000 cars by 2025 – in order to halve greenhouse-gas emissions from the city’s vehicle fleet. The so-called “aggressive plan”, which was announced at the Climate Leadership Conference earlier this month, responds to the fact that transportation makes up the largest share (65%) of Seattle’s greenhouse gas emissions – and aims to significantly improve the city’s air quality.  The strategy, termed “Drive Clean”, involves electrifying more of the city’s public transport vehicles as well as promoting the use of private EVs – and relies on the use of Seattle City Light’s carbon-neutral electric energy. Murray hopes that about 120,000 gallons of gas burned in the city fleet each year will be replaced with electricity.  As Sydney Brownstone writes in The Stranger, Seattle will also “make sure the project is equitable – meaning that the benefits of the program are distributed to the communities that are most adversely impacted by pollution.”  Fictional it may be, but Batman’s hometown has a powerful place in our collective imaginary, the ultimate future metropolis. Writing in uncube, Elvia Wilk explores the birth of Gotham – from the its genesis as the nickname for New York to the manifestation of Hugh Ferriss’s dark and spellbinding drawings of the future city. “The effect of Ferriss’ aesthetic cannot be underestimated,” writes Wilk, “not just on the DC Comics universe, but on urbanism itself.” Nevertheless, writes Wilk, there are distinctions between his visions and the Caped Crusader’s city: Batman’s Gotham is no modernist city of glass and steel. It’s uneven and post-industrial, with neoclassical remnants of crested, crumbling brick façades wedged alongside gleaming skyscrapers. It is undoubtedly a city where the authorities haven’t been able to control growth, and the modernists haven’t won out against the rise and decline of industry or managed to erase the layers of architectural history. Batman’s Gotham may be highly futuristic, but it’s also deeply nostalgic. Ever thought your city skyline could do with the addition of a skyscraper shaped like a woman’s leg wearing fishnets and heels, called “Top Sexy Tower”? If so, Vasily Klyukin might be the architect for you. CityLab takes a look at the wacky, tacky architecture of this Russian billionaire – who has also designed buildings shaped as ships, cobras and rockets. Tellingly, none of these projects have actually broken ground.  We also recommend heading to Klyukin’s website to read his descriptions of his own designs. Regarding Top Sexy Tower, a putative Manhattan project: “The entire NY is beautified with skyscrapers that look like the long sexy legs of those top models who live and work here ... The higher it gets, the more breathtaking it is and this is applicable to the skyscrapers, as well as to the models’ legs.” Also in CityLab, there’s a great gallery of another kind of kitsch (and in this case largely inoffensive) architecture known as “Cinderella homes”, which gained popularity across the US in the 1950s. Now, however, many stand looking forlorn and forgotten in suburban neighbourhoods – so much for happy ever after. Old Nokia mobiles may be the butt of jokes in this smartphone-reliant era, but the company’s decline hasn’t just changed what we clutch in our hands. As the BBC World Service reports, the Finnish city of Tampere – which once benefitted from the firm’s role in turning the country’s economy into one of the most prosperous in the world – has been hit hard by the shifting industry. “It was the backbone of everything here,” says Kari Kankaala, director of economic and urban development for the city of Tampere. “The universities relied on collaboration with Nokia, the subcontractors depended on Nokia, the kids relied on being employed by Nokia. Now we have an horrendous unemployment situation.” Meanwhile the small town of Nokia – which gave the tech firm its name – can be found 15 minutes down the road from Tampere, just a quiet backwater with a pub and discount supermarket. “Inequality is enforced in Memphis, and it always has been,” writes Preston Lauterbach in a powerful Places essay, which traces the history of racial segregation in Tennessee’s largest city through the lens of housing.  Among large US metro areas, Memphis ranks first in both overall and child poverty – and nearly 80% of the poor are black. From decades of biased housing policy that targeted homes for demolition under the banner of “slum clearances” to the burning of a house with cultural significance for the city’s black community, Lauterbach analyses how racial inequality has played out in Memphis at a neighbourhood level.  Can we plan our cities to improve mental wellbeing? Writing in the Journal of Urban Design and Mental Health, Rhiannon Corcoran and Graham Marshall argue that there has been little considered thinking on the design of cities and neighbourhoods to match people’s needs, with urban development focusing instead on quotas and profit.  As the NHS seeks to create 10 new “healthy towns” across the UK, the article suggests that prioritising community wellbeing can transform the planning and development of the places we live in – but that we should reconsider the simplistic garden city approach, which promised healthy designs and didn’t fully deliver.

"In a warming world, we expect to see increases in some extreme weather events. The science is pretty clear that in some parts of the world, drought and heat waves have and will continue to increase. In other areas, more severe storms along with precipitation and flooding have increased. Drought, heat waves, and floods are examples of changes to weather and climate patterns that will have costs for human society.  It’s tricky to discern not only whether past extreme weather have changed, but also whether human-caused global warming is a factor. Scientists need high-quality records that go back many decades to see if there is any trend towards increasing or decreasing extreme weather. But weather is quite variable. We can see a rise or fall in extreme weather events with no apparent cause, human or natural.   While these trends tend to be shorter (over days, weeks, or perhaps months), some trends can have longer durations. How can we identify trends prior to high-quality instrumentation and how can we discern whether the extreme weather we see now is within natural variability? Those are the questions addressed in a new publication in the Journal of Geophysical Research by lead author Dr. Benjamin Cook and his colleagues.  The title of the article, “Spatiotemporal drought variability in the Mediterranean over the last 900 years” clearly indicates that this study considers almost a millennium of drought records and focuses attention on the Mediterranean region. The authors use a powerful database called the Old World Drought Atlas to look back in time prior to modern instruments. This atlas is a collection of tree-ring data that measures drought using the Palmer Drought Severity Index. Within the Mediterranean region, there are 106 different tree-ring datasets. These datasets go back various lengths of time but since 1100 CE, the region is accurately sampled.  The Palmer Drought Severity Index accounts for changes in precipitation as well as changes in evaporation and storage of water within soils. By using this measurement, the authors are able to find multiple droughts throughout the Mediterranean region. Often times, the droughts occur simultaneously in different parts of the region. For instance, droughts are likely to occur at the same in in both the Western Mediterranean (Spain, Portugal, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia) and in the east (e.g. Greece and Turkey). What did the authors find regarding the recent droughts in the Mediterranean? Well in recent decades, there has been a persistent and long-duration drought in the regions of Greece and the Levant region. The authors found that although the Greek droughts have been severe, they do not deviate from droughts that have been observed in the past.  In the Levant region, the recent drought (1998–2012) exceeds what they have seen in the past 900 years. In fact, the recent drought is likely the driest period in the last 900 years and very likely the driest period in the last 500 years. Here is what Dr. Cook told me:  To really understand the extent to which climate change is affecting extreme events, like droughts, you need to understand the full range of natural variability. This is why paleoclimate is so important - it gives us a way to extend our understanding way past the relatively short instrumental record of the last 100 to 150 years. In this study, we found that the recent drought in the Levant region of the eastern Mediterranean is likely worse than any comparable period of the last 900 years. This provides some independent support for other studies that have argued that climate change is intensifying drying in the region. To be clear, this study doesn’t prove that droughts are getting worse, and it doesn’t prove that human emissions of greenhouse gases are making droughts more severe. In fact, proving such statements would be nearly impossible. What this study does is put recent extreme weather into historical context.  We know human carbon emissions will warm the world. We know that a warmer world affects precipitation and evaporation and this should affect droughts. We are observing that recent droughts are likely to worst on record. We also know that droughts and other extreme weather events have tremendous societal and economic consequences. Was the recent extreme Mediterranean drought caused by us? Probably. Or, if not caused by us, certainly made worse. Can we prove it? Probably not. However, it is clear to people like myself that study this topic that we have enough information to make decisions about the future planet we want to live in. It is clear that if we want to avoid further increases in extreme weather, we need to reduce our emissions of global-warming gases."
"In the spring, after the permafrost thaws and the ground settles, Wilson Andrew Sr takes a wrench to the metal pilings that hold up the foundation of his house in Atmautluak, Alaska, and makes it level again. He cranks the screws until the foundation flattens out, level with the ground. At least for now.  Andrew’s house, on a small island traditionally inhabited by indigenous Alaskans, is a prototype modular home designed by the Fairbanks-based nonprofit Cold Climate Housing Research Center (CCHRC) to be resistant to harsh weather and a quickly changing climate, while still being affordable and easy to build.  These are the challenges of housing design in the far north, where seasonal variability is exacerbated by climate change – like the heave and twitch of permafrost and the slow creep landward of the edge of the sea ice – adds to the challenge of building in an already brutal environment. Pipes freeze, walls molder. It can be prohibitively expensive, if not impossible, to get labor and supplies, which has led to a huge shortage of housing. And then there’s the social challenge associated with providing permanent housing for population groups that have been living nomadic subsistence lifestyles for generations.  This winter, both January and February brought record low coverage of arctic sea ice. And, as the ice surface contracts, so does the oil money that funds many northern communities. Populations are increasing in places like Iqaluit, Canada, and towns like Newtok, Alaska need to be moved to avoid falling into the sea as the ice recedes. So city planners, architects, and tribal groups, in Arctic and sub-Arctic regions, from Newtok to Nunuvut, are trying to answer the question of how to live in the changing north, and how to do it now. It’s a technical, cultural, financial and environmental puzzle. And as the Arctic warms faster than predicted, it’s becoming increasingly urgent. There are 40 different indigenous groups that live within the Arctic Circle, from the Inuit to the Saami in Finland and Norway. For millenia, most of these groups were semi-nomadic, moving to hunt or fish, tracking the edge of the sea ice. It’s only in the last half a decade that more permanent structures have become part of the Arctic infrastructure, and they haven’t settled particularly well. Part of learning to design for a changing Arctic is amending what’s already been done. Molly Rettig, communications coordinator at CCHRC, explains that the federal government made a big effort to develop the Alaskan tundra in the 70s and 80s. Awarding contracts to the lowest bidder, the government’s housing push resulted in “cookie cutter pre-fab houses that look like they should be in Texas or North Carolina”, she says. “That means they’re not designed for permafrost. The houses have no eaves, and there’s no building envelope, so they’re falling apart and rotting, battered by storms and snow and wind. Plus, these are subsistence people, and there’s no space built in for skins or for working on snow machines.” She says it’s typical of government funding in these parts: “These agencies parachute in and say, ‘We’re going to give you plumbing’, and then the pipes freeze. They’re not engaged with it at all.” To design for the culture and climate, and to build in sustainable ways, CCHRC tries to meld building practices that have worked in the Arctic for centuries with technology and technique that can make structures affordable and easy to build in remote villages. “We try to flip it around and ask what their traditional housing was like,” Rettig says. “Fifty years ago they were in sod huts or skin tents, and you’ll still see the ruins of sod igloos around, so we try to use the pieces of that design and architecture that worked and that you could mimic.”  They’ve designed houses with super-insulated walls to imitate traditional sod, and built composting, waterless toilets that dry out waste so it can be burned for heat – crucial in places where sewers don’t make sense and sky-high fuel costs account for much of household spending. This spring, in Newtok, the nonprofit is working on a prototype house built on skis, so it can be towed across the tundra as the ocean encroaches.  But environmentally appropriate design is only part of the process. In environmentally risky locations it can be hard to get funding and impossible to get insurance. Just getting building materials to towns on the tundra can account for a significant portion of the building cost.  “The building season is short, especially for communities off the road system, which is 80% of communities in Alaska,” Rettig says. “We have to barge materials in, so by July you have to be ready. If you forget something you’re waiting another year.”  To get around this, CCHRC designs houses as easy-to-assemble kits that a crew of six relatively untrained carpenters can build it in eight weeks. In Atmautluak, population 277, CCHRC required Andrew to participate in the construction of his new house, in hopes that the process would also educate the community in how to construct more sustainable structures.  There is both a lack of housing and a lack of jobs in far northern aboriginal communities, which leads to overcrowding and hidden homelessness. Traditional practices, like hunting, have been physically squeezed out, setting off a cultural disconnect and a lack of food and supplies. “They’ve been in that area for thousands of years, but they’ve never had that permanent infrastructure. We came in, changed culture and changed land, and now it’s falling apart,” Rettig says.  A group of architects at the Toronto-based firm Lateral is approaching design in the far north from the perspective of sustaining and preserving culture. “For years we imported southern models of planning, food, education, just about everything,” says Lola Sheppard, a partner at Lateral. “That’s has failed dramatically in almost every sense, technologically and culturally, so we need to reimagine how we design in the north.”  Lateral has been working on a project called Arctic Adaptations, which tries to find design-based solutions to issues like overcrowding and the degredation of traditional hunting grounds. She says there have been huge failures in designing for northern climates because architects and planners haven’t taken culture into account. “We’re looking at how people move, how people hunt, how healthcare is provided, as well as the size of families and how they share food,” Sheppard says. “We want to look at how architecture can be a tool for cultural empowerment.”  They’ve designed a network of food storage hubs, and they’re working on ways to make buildings multifunctional, like a caribou research station that also serves as a shelter for hunters. The research is important for future design, but there’s also a need for immediate solutions. In Iqaluit, Nunavut, the capitol of Canada’s newest province, Mélodie Simard, the director of planning and development, is struggling to find land to build housing for the city’s burgeoning population. Located on the south coast of Baffin Island, Iqaluit is only 17 years old, but the government center now offers public services and a chance for employment.  Iqaluit was first established as an Army Base and now faces growing pains as aboriginal people from smaller more remote communities in Nunavut and residents from the south arrive for jobs in the growing economy. According to the Standards Council of Canada, in the Northwest Territories alone, estimates suggest it could cost as much as $230m to adapt existing buildings, or more than $5,000 for each of the 7,000 residents. Simard says they want to build a new, 500-unit housing development, and that they’re working within newly adapted infrastructure standards that were put in place to address climate change, but that she’s struggling to find both land and capital. “Right now my focus is trying to address the housing crisis. Our rental price is very, very, very steep,” she says. “We’re trying to make more land available as soon as possible within our constraints.” Iqaluit has developed a sustainability plan to reflect the Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit, or the Inuit way of life, and the new housing development is built accordingly. To soak up maximum light and heat from the sun, all the houses face the south, regardless of their orientation to the street. Thermosyphons, low-tech heat pumps have been installed into the foundations of larger buildings, to draw heat out of the land to keep the permafrost cold and less likely to move. Across northern latitudes, environmental changes are increasingly forcing communities to adapt more quickly than expected. In Kiruna, the northernmost town in Sweden, the land under the town has started to collapse due to mining. The town is slowly being rebuilt three kilometers away, and planners and architects are being more conscious of the community’s environment and the cultural context. The contractors are building around traditional reindeer herding grounds, instead of through them, and the new structures are ultra insulated and designed to harvest heat and shed wind. It hasn’t been cheap, but they’ve managed to find a way to adapt.  Rettig says there are some solutions coming out of Alaska, too. In the coastal city of Bethel, where they predict needing 2,000 homes in the next 10 years, the community has started a small-scale logging industry, reducing housing costs, and built a truss plant, creating both jobs and houses.  “Everyone keeps saying the next few years are going to be really telling,” Rettig says. “We are at a major pivot point: is this culture is going to keep going or disappear?”"
"The growing season for plants has become a month longer than it was a few decades ago, Met Office figures show. In the last 10 years, the growing season, measured according to the central England temperature daily record, which stretches back hundreds of years, has been on average 29 days longer than in the period 1961-1990, the data show. And while more of the year is warm enough for plants to grow, there has also been a decline in the number of frosty days in recent decades, the Met Office said. Between 2006 and 2015, the plant growing season, which begins and ends with periods of consecutive days where daily temperatures average more than 5C (41F) and is without any five-day spells of temperatures below 5C, averaged 280 days.  Figures also reveal that six of the 10 longest growing seasons have occurred in the last 30 years, with 2014 topping the list at 336 days, or about 11 months of the year, while 2015 was 10th, with 303 days – about 10 months. Only three of the 10 shortest growing seasons have taken place in the last century – in 1979, 1941 and 1922 – while the years with the shortest season were in 1782 and 1859, at just 181 days. Mark McCarthy, manager of the Met Office’s national climate information centre, said: “Between 1861 and 1890, the average growing season by this measure was 244 days, and measuring the same period a century later, the average growing season had extended by just over a week. For the most recent 10 years, between 2006 and 2015, the average growing season has been 29 days longer at 280 days, when compared with the period between 1961 and 1990.” Days gripped by air frost, when the daily minimum temperature dips below 0C, also declined, with just seven years since 1990 when the number of frost days exceeded the 1961-1990 average. The frostier-than-average years include 2010, when the bitter winter had the most days of frost since 1917. McCarthy added: “Although we have fewer air frost days on average than we experienced a few decades ago, the numbers can still fluctuate from year to year. Many people will remember vividly the cold spells during 2010 and 2013. In contrast, 2014 recorded very few days of air frost and was the lowest in the UK series from 1961.”"

"US coastal areas occupied by more than 13 million people will be at risk of being completely swamped by the sea under a worst-case climate change scenario, new research predicts, potentially leading to a population upheaval comparable to the Great Migration of the 20th century. Population growth in coastal areas over the course of this century, particularly in vulnerable areas of Florida, is likely to collide with the reality of rising seas caused by melting glaciers and thermal expansion as the planet warms.  Research led by the University of Georgia has provided the first glimpse of how demographic changes in America will place greater numbers of people at the frontline of sea level rises. In a severe scenario involving a 6ft (1.8m) rise in sea levels by 2100, fuelled by the gradual collapse of the Antarctic ice sheets, a total of 13.1 million people would risk seeing their homes inundated. A less dramatic sea level rise of 0.9m, still considered at the upper end of IPCC projections, would risk land occupied by 4.2 million people being claimed by the sea.  The projections are based on demographic changes in the US population over this century, as well as areas forecast by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration as being at risk of inundation.  Florida would bear the brunt of this potential population displacement, with more than six million people affected by a 1.8m sea rise by 2100. In Miami alone, nearly two million people would either have to be protected or displaced under this worst-case scenario. Other areas where significant numbers of people would be at risk include Long Island in New York; New Orleans; Charleston, South Carolina and San Mateo, California. Should these people need to move away from the coast, rather than be protected by new sea defenses, the population movement would be on a scale similar to the Great Migration, a long-term shift of African Americans from southern to northern states during the 20th century.  “Sea level rise is widely recognized as one of the most likely and socially disruptive consequences of future climate change,” states the study, published in Nature Climate Change.  “Florida accounts for nearly half of the total at-risk population. Whereas other south-eastern states have substantially fewer people at risk, states such as Georgia, South Carolina and Louisiana have over 10% of future coastal populations at risk under the 1.8m scenario.  “The south-eastern US alone represents nearly 70% of the entire projected populations at risk, suggesting the impacts of sea level rise will be highly regionalised in nature.” The paper warns that finding new land for displaced people will be “problematic” as well as expensive, citing relocations of Alaskan villages that have cost as much as an estimated $1m per resident. “We knew that the number of affected people had been underestimated until now, but the extent of that underestimation surprised us,” said Mathew Hauer, coauthor and demographer at the University of Georgia.  “Adaption will be an option, such as deploying critical infrastructure, raising buildings and roads. If we don’t do anything, the migration will mimic the Great Migration from the south to the north, over similar timescales.  “At the moment, roads and hospitals are typically being built in areas without these future projections in mind. In the future, this will need to be a factor in where we deploy roads, hospitals, people and so on.” The global sea level has risen, on average, by around 8in (20cm) since 1880, according to Nasa. This increase is uneven around the world, however, and predicting future sea level rise is complicated by a range of factors.  The rate of disintegration of the polar ice sheets is a key variable, as are changes to influences such as the Gulf Stream, which may be causing water to “pile up” along America’s east coast. Sea levels are rising several times faster than they have in the past 2,800 years. German researchers recently warned that the rate of increase from thermal expansion – in which the ocean expands as it warms – has been underestimated.  Last month, a Climate Central study found that coastal flooding days have more than doubled in the US since the 1980s. Climate change driven by human activity has been blamed for three-quarters of the flooding events that have occurred over the past decade."
"Almost half of Australian voters say policies on climate change, renewable energy and the Great Barrier Reef will influence the way they vote at the next federal election, according to new polling shared exclusively with Guardian Australia. The nationwide poll of 1,048 people over the weekend found 47% of people agreed or strongly agreed that “climate change and renewable energy will influence the way I vote at this year’s federal election”.  That was more than twice as many as the 22% who disagreed with the statement, according to the survey conducted by Lonergan Research and commissioned by Future Super. Similarly, 44% of respondents said they either agreed or strongly agreed that measures to protect the Great Barrier Reef would influence their vote – again, more than double the 20% who disagreed. And voters appeared particularly concerned about the impact of the Carmichael coalmine, which will be the biggest in the country if it goes ahead. In all, 65% said they were quite worried, very worried or extremely worried about the impact the mine would have on climate change and the Great Barrier Reef. Only 15% said they were not worried at all and 20% were not aware of the plans. “Today’s polling shows that, when voters go to the polls in the second half of the year, they’ll be concerned about climate change,” said Simon Sheikh, the founder and managing director of Future Super. “That should be an extraordinary wake-up call for the government. “In the last few months the government has tried ignoring the issue of climate change. It has undermined the jobs of climate scientists at the CSIRO and thrown its support behind polluting projects like the Adani coalmine. Today’s polling reveals they are on the wrong side of every one of those issues.” Sheikh said the number of people who were switching to Future Super, which is the only super fund in Australia that avoids all investments in fossil fuels, is further evidence for how much people care about the issue. He said the fund reached $130m under management, within 18 months of launching. The Australian Conservation Foundation is fighting the federal government’s approval of Adani’s Carmichael coalmine in court, arguing the carbon emissions from the coal it produces will put the Great Barrier Reef at risk. It will create more annual emissions than New York City, according to calculations done last year. “Any politician who wants to be taken seriously on climate change and Great Barrier Reef protection cannot support Adani’s proposal to dig the biggest coalmine in Australia’s history,” said Kelly O’Shanassy, the chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation. “What’s clear from this polling is Australians care about the Great Barrier Reef, they are increasingly worried about the damage climate change is doing to it and they will use their votes in this year’s federal election to demand a better deal for the reef. “Burning coal is warming the planet and warmer oceans are bleaching the reef. People can see the connection and they want better from their government.” The Queensland parliament, with the support of both Labor and the Liberal-National party, recently passed a motion supporting Adani’s efforts to get the required regulatory approvals passed, Sheikh said. “With 65% of Australians expressing their concerns over the impact the mine will have on our climate and on the Great Barrier Reef, both Labor and the Coalition appear to be on the wrong side of this issue,” he said. The survey also asked respondents what they thought of the statement: “The federal government was right to cut jobs, including those of climate scientists at the CSIRO.” A total of 49% disagreed or strongly disagreed, with only 20% agreeing or strongly agreeing. “With temperature records being smashed in 2014, 2015 and in the first two months of 2016, it’s little wonder that voters are deeply concerned about the issue once again,” Sheikh said."
"Almost 100 prominent figures from the arts, science and politics are calling on the new director of the British Museum to drop BP as a commercial sponsor. In a letter to the Guardian, the museum is urged to abandon the “completely out of touch” partnership.   The intervention is backed by actors Emma Thompson, Mark Ruffalo and Mark Rylance, writers Margaret Atwood, Naomi Klein and Caryl Churchill, as well as the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, and physicist Sir Tom Kibble. It comes shortly after BP announced it was ending its 26-year relationship with the Tate art gallery, blaming the “challenging business environment”. Anti-oil sponsorship groups claimed that move as a campaign victory, and have since turned their attention to the company’s remaining cultural ties.  The focus has switched to other beneficiaries of BP money: the National Portrait Gallery, the Royal Opera House and particularly the British Museum, where in December 2011 the four museum directors gathered to announce a five-year sponsorship deal worth £10m. All four institutions have vigorously defended BP’s involvement in the arts. The former British Museum director Neil MacGregor described BP as the museum’s best corporate friend. “What would you want companies to do with their profits?” he asked. “Do you want them to spend them in a way that benefits the public or not?” But Jess Worth of the campaign group Art Not Oil, which organised the letter, said signing up to a new deal would damage the reputation of the museum, especially since our understanding of climate change was evolving, with the need to “move away very, very fast” from fossil fuel companies. “If the museum is locked into this deal with BP beyond 2020 it is going to look completely on the wrong side of history and completely out of touch. The world has changed and the museum has to change with it.” The letter is timed to coincide with the arrival of the British Museum’s new German director, Hartwig Fischer, formerly director of the Dresden State Art Collections. The letter says: “As the impacts of climate change are being felt more forcefully around the world, it is vital that prominent public institutions like the British Museum play their part in minimising the environmental impacts of their activities.” Other signatories include the screenwriter John Collee, fashion designer Dame Vivienne Westwood, Bianca Jagger and Prof Dame Anne Glover, former chief scientific adviser to the European commission. Glover said: “The British Museum is a powerful symbol of our culture and celebrates the complexity of our heritage and development. The museum exerts clear influence in our society and as well as preserving our past, the museum can also make a statement about safeguarding our future by addressing man-made climate change. I hope the museum will choose its partners well to reflect this.” Emma Thompson said: “I find it unbelievable that the British Museum is promoting a company that’s not just extracting disastrous amounts of fossil fuels but is actively lobbying against clean energy alternatives. BP is sponsoring our past while destroying our future. We hope Dr Fischer will put an end to this.” The letter also coincides with a protest carried out on Sunday in the British Museum’s Great Court. The group BP or Not BP staged a “History of BP in 10 Objects” exhibition, mirroring MacGregor’s A History of the World in 100 Objects series on the BBC. The protest objects on show included crude oil from the Louisiana coastline after the BP Deepwater Horizon spill and a photograph of Colombian trade unionist Gilberto Torres, who is suing BP alleging it was complicit in his kidnap and torture. BP have previously denied any involvement with, or knowledge of, Torres’s abduction. Arts organisations have staunchly defended accepting money from BP and argue it is not easily replaceable. BP, meanwhile, is proud of its arts sponsorship, calling its sponsorship of the four big national arts organisations “one of the most significant long-term corporate investments in UK arts and culture”. On the back page of the programme for the National Theatre’s production of Les Blancs, which opened this week, is a full-page BP advertisement in which it boasts of its arts sponsorship. A British Museum spokesperson said: “BP is one of the British Museum’s most longstanding corporate partners, supporting the museum since 1996. The British Museum is exceptionally grateful to BP for their loyal and ongoing support, which has allowed the museum to bring world cultures to a global audience through hugely popular exhibitions and their associated public programmes.  “We believe it is more important than ever to deepen people’s understanding of the world’s many and varied cultures and this is something that can be achieved through the temporary exhibition format. It is only possible to develop and host temporary exhibitions with this kind of external support.  “We are grateful to BP for their long-term commitment, sharing the vision that our artistic programmes should be made available to the widest possible audience. Discussions regarding the renewal of the partnership are continuing.” Campaigners are launching a petition on Monday calling on Fischer to drop BP."

"The Chilean navy has rescued 14 people aboard two balsa wood rafts that were swept up in strong currents hundreds of kilometres off the coast. The Kon-Tiki 1 and 2 rafts set sail in early January from Easter Island in the Pacific Ocean toward the Chilean port city of Valparaiso with the aim of documenting climate change, pollution and marine life.  But strong currents pulled them far off course and the group sent out a distress signal on Wednesday asking for assistance. The Chilean navy said in a statement that the rafts were about 1,600km (994 miles) west of Puerto Montt in southern Chile.  The navy sent a merchant ship about 200 nautical miles (370 kilometers) away from the rafts plus a plane to track them from the sky.  In a statement, Kon-Tiki expedition leader Torgeir Higraff said they were aborting the voyage for safety reasons. “In a normal year, we would have reached South America by now,” said Higraff. “Instead, we are still 900 nautical miles (1,667 kilometers) from land and the weather forecasts are not promising. The crew is in good health and spirit, and there is no emergency situation.” The crews include citizens of Norway, Peru, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia and Sweden. The original Kon Tiki set sail in 1947 from Peru. The expedition was led by Norwegian Thor Heyerdahl, who was seeking to prove his theory that winds and marine currents allowed for prehistoric sailing trips between South America and Polynesia. After 101 days, Heyerdahl and five crew members reached the island of Raroia in the Tuamoto Archipelago. A book about the expedition was translated into dozens of languages. In 1951, Heyerdahl’s film about the journey won an Oscar."
"European Union renewable energy targets may have increased greenhouse gas emissions because the dirtiest biofuels produce three times the emissions of diesel oil, according to the most complete EU analysis yet carried out. Biodiesel made from palm oil emits more than three times as much and soybean oil around twice as much, when the crops’ effects on land use are considered, the research by the Ecofys consultancy for the European commission found. Europe’s aim of sourcing 10% of its transport fuel to “renewables” by 2020 – mostly biodiesel - will foster crop cultivation on 6.7m hectares of forests and grasslands, the paper says. When the loss of trees is factored in, such ‘first generation biofuels’ would generate around nearly 1bn tones of CO2 equivalent.  “We need to rapidly accelerate the phase-out of first generation biofuels,” said Jos Dings, director of the green thinktank Transport and Environment (T&E). “Biodiesel is a big elephant in the room. It accounts for three quarters of the biofuel we use in the EU and this report pinpoints that its emissions are much worse than fossil fuels.” The study says that an EU decision to cap the contribution that first generation biofuels can make to the transport target at 7% will save more than 500m tonnes of CO2 – around the same amount that Europe’s cars emit each year. But T&E still estimates that, far from slowing climate change, the EU’s transport goals could add approximately 2 gigatonnes of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. On an annual basis, that would account for around 2-3% of the continent’s total carbon output. “It is just astonishing,” Dings said. The report’s publication was delayed for several months and its release online last week – it has since been taken down – followed an access to documents request by T&E. “It was finished ages ago but DG Ener [the commission’s energy wing] never wanted to publish it,” one EU source told the Guardian. Internally, it was argued that the study’s publication could damage international relations with palm oil-producing states. But the official said it was “obvious” that the paper was sat on because its results were inconvenient.  The report examines the effect of land use change on biofuel emissions. Felling a forest for a palm oil plantation has clear consequences for increasing emissions. But when existing cropland is used for more profitable energy crops, the indirect effect can be similar; new land is carved out of forests or grasslands to grow replacement food staples. For every megajoule of energy used, the study finds that palm oil emits 231g of CO2 equivalent and soybean oil 150g/CO2e, far higher than the UN climate science panel’s estimates for any fossil fuel. Past commission estimates pegging palm oil’s CO2 emissions at less than half that figure were criticised by industry for being exaggerated. But it now seems that they significantly under-estimated biodiesel’s climate impact by not counting carbon emissions from peatlands drained to make way for oil plantations, experts say. “Because of the link to deforestation, peat loss to create biofuels is not just worse than fossil fuel diesels, but potentially a lot worse,” said Chris Malins, the head of the ICCT fuels programme, and an adviser on the report. “There is no case for continuing to support virgin vegetable oil-based biodiesel on climate grounds.”  Malins said that paper found that ethanol could still deliver emissions savings but had significant indirect effects on emissions, albeit “less fatal” than biodiesel’s. However, Robert Wright, the secretary general of the ethanol industry association ePURE said the study showed that ethanol had low land use impacts, strongly contributed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and had little effect on food prices. “We urge European policy-makers to reflect on these findings and identify ways to promote and incentivise the use of biofuels that have high greenhouse gas savings and low land use change impacts, such as European ethanol,” he said. Dings, an influential figure among Brussels policy-makers, said that while his organisation did not support ethanol, their priority was to push for a phase out of biodiesel. The European Biodiesel Board was not able to comment on this story at the time of writing."
"Recovery from the deepest recession in Britain’s post-war history has left Britons healthier, better off, less likely to be victims of crime and living greener lives, according to the latest official snapshot of national wellbeing. Life expectancy and living standards rose while unemployment fell during a three-year period from 2012-14, a time when the UK finally shrugged off the after effects of the financial crisis that began in 2007.   The Office for National Statistics said its fourth report on national wellbeing had shown that there had been improvements in 17 of its measures, a deterioration in eight and no change in 11. Areas of life which the survey showed as improving included personal finances and the economy, with real median household income and net national disposable income both rising and joblessness going down.  There was a a fall in the proportion finding it difficult to get by, which the ONS said was a sign that Britons were less worried about their finances. Healthy life expectancy continued, although at the same time satisfaction with health fell sharply from 66.3% to 57.8%. “The majority of improvements relate to objective measures of national wellbeing such as the unemployment rate, while the majority of measures assessed as deteriorated are subjective measures, such as satisfaction with health,” the ONS said. It added that between 2012 and 2014 crimes against the person dropped by a third, from 82 per 1,000 adults to 57 per 1,000 adults in the financial year ending 2015. Net national disposable income per head rose modestly from £22,487 to £22,786 and the proportion finding it difficult to cope financially fell from 11.6% to 9.1%.  More energy was produced from renewable sources, but at 7% was less than halfway towards the government’s target of 15% by 2020. Waste recycling rates increased slightly to just under 45%, closing in on the EU target of 50% by 2020. Between 2011 and 2014, greenhouse gas emissions fell from 553.4m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent to 514.4m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. But the ONS said not all areas of life in the UK were getting better, adding that the proportions satisfied with accommodation, household income and leisure time had all fallen over the three-year period. Mental wellbeing scores also fell over the period as did the proportion who had a spouse or partner, family member or friend to rely on if they had a serious problem. Adult participation in sport has also fallen. The latest data showed few changes in children’s overall wellbeing, with children reporting relatively high levels of personal wellbeing and positive relationships with parents. “However, there are still areas of concern, such as the proportion of children who report being bullied frequently and the proportion of children reporting symptoms of mental ill-health.”  The ONS study also looked at whether the UK had a sustainable future. “Looking at national stocks of things such as education, skills and competencies in the labour market (human capital) and the value of natural resources such as woodlands and rivers (natural capital), there is a mixed message about sustainability for the future. Human capital rose between 2013 and 2014, but remains below levels seen before the financial crisis and latest data for natural capital shows long term decline.”"

"Everywhere you look right now, the Earth’s climate system seems to be breaking records.  To choose the most inappropriate metaphor possible, February 2016 would have been enough to bring a lot of climate watchers out in a cold sweat. Figures from Nasa using thermometers and ocean temperature readings showed February was the hottest month on record, by quite a margin. According to satellite data, the amount of Arctic sea ice also hit an all-time low for this time of year since measurements began in 1979. Scientists also use satellite data to calculate air temperatures. Climate science contrarians and denialists like these readings because they have not shown as much warming as the more reliable readings on the surface.  But February also set a new record for global temperatures from satellites. As Joe Romm at Climate Progress noted, “climate science deniers need a new meme”. These heat records have been variously described as “terrifying”, “jawdropping” and “shocking”. One climate scientist in particular, Professor Stefan Rahmstorf, appeared to capture the mood with a quote repeated in stories around the world, including here on the Guardian. “We are in a kind of climate emergency now,” said Rahmstorf, of Germany’s Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.  But here’s the rub.  Global warming is proceeding pretty much exactly as predicted To climate scientists like Rahmstorf, the temperature records being broken right now are not a surprise and, at least according to Rahmstorf, they shouldn’t be seen as an entry point to some terrifying new era (at least not as terrifying as things already are).  “The media’s view is too short-term,” he told me. “As scientists we want to keep an overview of all the data and the knowledge of how the whole system works.” What we are seeing is a continuous process of global warming that is superimposed on to the natural variability. Just like a few cooler years were no reason to talk about a ‘slowdown’ in global warming, it would be wrong to conclude now that a few very hot years are acceleration. Global warming is proceeding pretty much exactly as predicted.  The fact that temperatures have now shot up again shows that those people who said global warming had stopped were wrong – we said all along that was nonsense. It is becoming more and more urgent. Time has almost run out to get emissions down. That’s the real emergency. Rahmstorf does think there is a climate emergency, but he would have made the same assessment at any point in time stretching back many years. The record-breaking February doesn’t change that. The vast majority of the extra carbon dioxide and heat being added into the Earth’s biosphere ends up in the oceans, where heat has been building up since the early 1970s.  What the ocean doesn’t take up, is left to accumulate in the atmosphere. There are two long-term records of the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, measures as parts of CO2 per million parts of the atmosphere (ppm).  Instruments at Mauna Loa in Hawaii have been showing the accumulation of CO2 since the 1950s. Last year though saw the biggest jump ever since records started. CO2 is now above 400ppm there. Australia holds the other long-term record of CO2 in the atmosphere – taken at the aptly-named Cape Grim, in Tasmania.  Here, the very latest readings for February 2016 show CO2 at 398.71ppm. At some point in the coming months, the Cape Grim data will also tip above 400 ppm. If you want records, then these readings in Hawaii and Tasmania have been breaking them pretty much year on year for decades.  According to the Geological Society, there is no known precedent in the history of the Earth for the rate at which we are now liberating CO2, chiefly from burning fossil fuels. The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has also been sending out warnings since the 1990s.  Since the early 1990s, there has also been an industry driven by ideologies and fossil fuel interests to convince the public and policy-makers that there is no climate emergency, that global warming might not be happening and, if it is, that it might not be caused by humans. Recent studies suggest that the “thinktanks” central to this effort continue to challenge the science using their suite of fake experts and cherry-picked pseudo-science. But there was another chunk of data released in Australia this week suggesting the Australian public might be getting the message that not only is it getting bloody warm out there, but that human activity is behind it.  For seven years, the polling and communications agency Essential Media Communications has been asking Australians about their views on climate change.  EMC has asked the public if they think there is “fairly conclusive evidence” that climate change is happening and – more to the point – that it is caused by humans, or if they think it’s all just a “normal fluctuation”.  This week, the level of acceptance that climate change is happening and is human caused hit an all-time high of 63% in the EMC poll. Public acceptance that #climate change is human-caused at highest point in 7yrs of polling, says @EssentialVision https://t.co/fHNM0DE4bN EMC director Peter Lewis says the question of whether the public accepts the evidence that humans are the cause of climate change is “one of the most important indicators in the climate debate”. He says a low point for this indicator was around late 2010 when Tony Abbott took over the Liberal party leadership from Malcolm Turnbull. Tony Abbott saw climate change as an opportunity to run an agenda against action. Now we have a better quality of debate. Lewis thinks that while climate change campaigners will be disappointed at the lack of policy change since Turnbull became prime minister, the “conditions for some sort of action are more conducive now than they were under Abbott”. “The heat has gone out of the political debate on climate change now, as far as belief is concerned,” says Lewis. As for the tumbling heat records, Lewis says: “For those that want action on climate change, all this heat becomes a pressure point.”"
"British health systems are unprepared for the “devastating” effects of climate change, leading health bodies have warned. As extreme weather events such as flooding or heatwaves become more common, the UK Health Alliance on Climate Change urged ministers not to “wait for disaster” before acting.  The new alliance, made up of leading health bodies including royal colleges, medical faculties, medical publications and doctors’ organisations, called on the government to be “properly prepared”. The group, launched on Wednesday, said the health service is ill-prepared for dealing with the effects of climate change such as the extreme weather seen this winter. In a letter to the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, the alliance wrote: “More work is urgently needed to prepare the personnel, the systems and the facilities of the NHS, as well as other institutions involved in health care, for the implications of climate change.” It points out that only a minority of local health bodies have plans in place which “adequately prepare their organisation to respond to climate change”, adding that almost one in 10 healthcare buildings in England are currently operating in flood risk zones. John Ashton, president of the Faculty of Public Health, said: “Ensuring that our NHS doesn’t fail as a result of the threats we face is vital. “The Zika virus epidemic in South America and the impact of heatwaves in Europe, including in the UK, clearly demonstrate the devastating effects that result when the public and the health systems they rely on are unprepared for and overwhelmed by new challenges. “Let’s not wait for disaster on this scale to strike the UK before we are properly prepared.” The alliance said climate change is “very much a UK health issue” because of factors such as the impact of flooding on mental health to the spread of new infectious diseases. Dr Clifford Mann, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said: “We see firsthand what happens in A&E departments when severe weather hits. Elderly people, pregnant women and children can be especially vulnerable and are often the first to get into difficulty. Flooding in particular makes homes uninhabitable and displaces large numbers of people. Even temporary displacement can result in long term physical and psychological damage.” The alliance highlighted the severe floods this winter that disabled major infrastructure in northern England. Army trucks were stationed at a hospital in Lancaster to act as ambulances after flooding at an electricity sub-station and the closure of all the road bridges cut the city off from the power grid. The group’s aim is to raise awareness of the health risks associated with climate change and promoting approaches to tackling the issue that also benefit public health, such as reducing air pollution, encouraging more active transport options, healthier diets and warmer homes."
"On Saturday 19 March many of us will be turning off the lights for Earth Hour. While this will make for a nice romantic meal, if you truly want to combat climate change, cross off meat, eggs and dairy foods from your shopping list. Foods derived from animals, whether eaten by candlelight or not, require more resources and cause more greenhouse gas emissions than plant-based foods do. Each year, humans kill 60 billion land animals for food – that’s about 7 million animals every hour. All these animals produce massive amounts of waste, which releases powerful greenhouse gases into our atmosphere. The livestock sector is the single largest source of both methane and nitrous oxide, greenhouses gases that are 25 and 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide, respectively. A person who follows a vegan lifestyle produces the equivalent of 50% less carbon dioxide than a meat-eater and uses 1/11th of the oil, 1/13th of the water and 1/18th of the land, which is why the United Nations has stated that a global shift towards a vegan diet is essential to combat the worst effects of climate change. So blow out the candle, turn on the lights and get into the kitchen and cook a vegan meal this Earth Hour. It’s the best thing any of us can do for the environment as well as for animals.Jennifer WhitePeople for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com"

"Plummeting coal use in 2015 led to a fall of 4% in the UK’s annual carbon dioxide emissions, according to government energy statistics published on Thursday. Coal is now burning at its lowest level in at least 150 years. The closing of old polluting coal-power stations and the rapid rise in renewable energy meant coal consumption fell by 22% compared to 2014, the biggest drop ever seen outside of miners’ strikes, according to analysts at Carbon Brief. Production of coal in the UK also fell to a new record low, dropping by 27% due to mines closing.  The rapid decline in coal use is continuing in 2016, with four more stations closed in the last fortnight, including Longannet, Ferrybridge and Eggborough, leaving six operational. The government has pledged to close all coal plants by 2025 to help meet climate change targets. The future of the large new nuclear plant at Hinkley Point in Somerset is also in serious doubt, leading to concerns about energy security. But experts said coal plant closures would not lead to the lights going out. “We have seen at least five years of “lights out” headlines, so far without so much as a flicker caused by insufficient capacity,” said Prof Michael Grubb, at University College London. “Despite tight margins, extreme weather is far more likely to cause any household disconnections than insufficient generating capacity.” “Closure of these coal plants is both expected and necessary,” said Jonathan Gaventa, director of thinktank E3G. “The UK has plenty of options to cover the loss of coal-fired power through energy efficiency, renewables, interconnection with other countries and smart demand. This combination can deliver low-cost electricity reliably and quickly.” Renewable electricity generation surged in 2015, rising by 29%, allowing it to claim a record 25% share of all electricity. Most of this came from wind power and bioenergy, the latter being boosted by the continued conversion of Drax - once the UK’s biggest coal plant - to burning wood pellets. Solar power increased by 50% in 2015 to make up 9% of all renewable electricity. The government has been repeatedly criticised for cutting support for renewable energy and energy efficiency programmes. “If anything is to blame for tight margins, it’s previous governments’ history of incoherent energy policy,” said Paul Massara, former CEO of “big six” energy company RWE npower. “Investors need long-term clarity on policy, and they simply have not been getting it.” “Look outside the UK and it’s clear that the direction of travel in is only in one direction, towards primarily low-carbon, flexible, smart energy systems,” said Andrew Garrad, senior consultant at DNV GL energy. “It’s been accelerated by the Paris climate agreement, and Britain is by no means ahead of the pack in this transition.” The share of electricity generated by gas remained unchanged at 30% while nuclear’s share rose by two percentage points to 21%. The energy used by transport rose, which the government said was probably due to lower petrol prices. Oil production in the UK was 13% higher than in 2014 and gas production 8% higher, both bucking the trend of steady decline seen since the peaks seen in 1999 and 2000 respectively. The UK is the only G7 country increasing fossil fuel subsidies, according to a report in November."
"Climate risk information should form part of companies’ routine financial filings, a taskforce led by Michael Bloomberg is recommending. As companies like Peabody Energy and Exxon Mobil face legal probes over allegedly lying about their exposure, it reinforces moves for greater transparency. In its first report on Friday, the taskforce emphasised the need to incorporate global warming threats into financial reports. “That is a big deal,” Curtis Ravenel, a Bloomberg executive on the taskforce’s secretariat told Climate Home. “Once it goes into financial filings, there is all sorts of oversight for companies. The point is to try and institutionalise thinking on this at board level.” Most G20 countries already require businesses to disclose “material” climate-related risks in their financial reports. But interpretations of what is “material” vary. Carbon-cutting regulations, clean technology and lawsuits can all hit the value of companies that rely on burning fossil fuels. Mark Carney, chair of the Financial Stability Board, last year warned there could be market shocks if investors failed to anticipate these trends. Long-term investors like pension funds are increasingly urging coal and oil majors to face up to the potential carbon crunch. Yet they face resistance from firms like Exxon Mobil, which maintains that demand for energy will trump global efforts to curb warming. Members of Bloomberg’s taskforce represent companies ranging from mining giant BHP Billiton to the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. They are set to publish a final report by the end of 2016, with voluntary guidelines on what kind of information companies should disclose. “Our thought is companies will want to adopt the guidelines to avoid the kind of legal implications facing Peabody and Exxon,” said Ravenel. Responding to the initial report, the Carbon Tracker Initiative emphasised the need to test business plans in line with a 2C warming limit. “Investors no longer want to see regulatory filings from fossil fuel companies that fail to discuss how the low carbon transition might impact their business models,” said Mark Campanale, founder of the London-based think tank. The Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, which represents 120 investors worth €13tn, agreed. “We strongly support the focus on more standardised disclosures and forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information,” said the group’s chief executive Stephanie Pfeifer. “This will help investors better assess and address carbon risk in their portfolios.” Jon Williams of consultancy PwC welcomed the taskforce setting out its stall. He said: “There is much ground to cover over the next nine months if it is to deliver on its highly ambitious targets and embed climate-related risks firmly within the financial mainstream.”"

"At the UN climate conference in Paris in December 2015, 195 countries concluded a groundbreaking climate accord. They agreed to limit global warming to well below 2C to avoid extremely dangerous and irreversible climate change. The international community’s remaining emission “budget” is less than 1,000 gigatonnes of CO2. The Paris agreement is intended to ensure as quickly as possible that the annual global emissions go down, the budget is stretched, and the net emissions of greenhouse gases are reduced to zero over a few decades.   The challenge of limiting the combustion of oil, coal and gas to this budget is enormous in view of the fossil reserves still underground. If we were to use all the known and probable reserves to generate energy, global emissions would amount to around 15,000 gigatonnes of CO2. So limiting global warming to 2C means this: of the 15,000 thousand gigatonnes of CO2, we need to leave at least 14,000 underground. Truly, our problem is not a scarcity of fossil resources, it is the exact opposite. We lack an exit strategy for oil, coal and gas. Energy efficiency and renewable energy are indispensable parts of a response to climate change, but they do not tell us why private companies and private individuals should stop extracting, marketing and consuming fossil fuels.  In fact, the progress made on energy efficiency and renewables can actually exacerbate the problem. An oversupply of fossil resources lowers the price and makes it even more tempting to use them. And the temptation is great: the fossil energy industry offers profits, jobs and low energy prices.  The Paris agreement says this to our children and grandchildren: “We promise not to expose you to the dangers of climate change.” If we are to keep our word, we have no alternative to decarbonisation. Our production and consumption must become carbon-neutral. There is an international consensus that the industrialised countries need to lead the way.  Germany does not need to change its climate and energy transition targets in view of the decisions made in Paris. There is a consensus amongst the political parties represented in the Bundestag that Germany will reduce greenhouse gases by 80-95% by 2050 from the 1990 baseline. The Federal government and the Bundestag have decided on the following interim goals: greenhouse gas emissions are to be down 40% by 2020, 55% by 2030, and 70% by 2040.  We should regard this challenge as an opportunity for a comprehensive modernisation of our economy. The fossil fuels are being substituted by investment in efficiency technologies and renewable energy. Here, a key role will be played by digitisation. In short: we will replace oil, coal and gas with intelligence and sustainable investment by 2050 at the latest. By doing this, we will be creating high-quality growth and jobs.  If this transformation is to become a success story not only in climate terms, but also in economic terms, in the coming decades, we will need a paradigm shift.  The most important aspect is to avoid misallocated investments. We want to complete the switch by 2050, which gives us three-and-a-half decades. Investments in fossil structures with a lifespan extending beyond 2050 will become stranded assets of the respective companies, and will require us to undertake expensive repairs in future. A forward-looking approach to modernisation which avoids lock-in effects, subsequent destruction of capital, and job losses, must put the right policies in place right now.  We should therefore declare efficiency and renewable energy to be the new “rule”, the new standard investment. Investments in fossil structures must become the exception. We should only undertake them in cases where we have no alternative technologies or where the alternatives are disproportionately expensive. We need to reverse the rule-exception relationship: that is the paradigm shift. What does the new “rule” – investment in energy efficiency and renewables – mean for the various sectors?  Power generation still accounts for by far the largest proportion of greenhouse gases. The sector is also set to grow as the decarbonisation of the heating and transport sectors will only be possible if we use more electricity. This electricity needs to stem from zero-carbon renewable sources, particularly wind and photovoltaics. We need to keep investing in these technologies.  Fossil fuel power stations have a lifespan of 40 years or more. To avoid misallocated investment which reach far beyond 2050 and to avoid lock-in effects, we should urgently dispense with new coal-fired power plants and extensions to opencast mines. Gas-fired power stations with comparatively small carbon emissions fall into the “exceptions” category, because we need them as controllable power stations for our energy security; however, natural gas will have to be replaced gradually by zero-carbon.  Of all CO2-relevant emissions, buildings have the longest lifespans, at around 100 years. We should therefore define an efficiency standard for all new buildings which, when coupled with the direct use of renewable energy and electricity, results in zero carbon emissions. We already have the necessary technologies and they are already affordable, so that this new standard can be introduced with just a few years’ notice.  The challenges in the existing building stock are far greater. These buildings are dominated by gas-fired and oil-fired combustion systems which mostly heat buildings which are only moderately insulated. In the short term, a switch to using efficient condensing boilers can save a lot of CO2 emissions. As heating systems have a lifespan of 20 years, from 2030 investment in fossil fuel heating systems should stop so that we can finish the transition by 2050. The only cost-efficient way to do this is to combine it with appropriate insulation of the building envelope. The transport sector may pose the greatest challenge. Most of the rail system has already been electrified, but almost all passenger and freight traffic on the road, in the air and on water is almost entirely dependent on fossil fuels. Electric mobility offers us the chance to achieve the energy transition in the field of private transport. With an average lifespan of 20 years we need to have switched from fossil-based to renewables-based engines by 2030 if we are to stop using gasoline and diesel on our roads in 2050. The emissions of newly bought vehicles must then amount to zero. We need a road map which enables the state and the automotive industry to draw up an ambitious investment strategy for the transport sector.  The paradigm shift in the energy transition cannot be applied to all sectors. The process-related industrial emissions, and the methane emissions from agriculture, cannot be avoided by higher efficiency or a switch to renewable energy. These emissions will continue unless we manage to develop alternative technologies. But by far the largest proportion of our emissions is produced by burning oil, coal and gas.  For this reason, a cost-efficient energy transition should be oriented to investment cycles with a view to a far-reaching decarbonisation by the middle of the century. Investments in efficiency and renewable energy must become the rule, and investment in fossil structures the exception with clearly defined timelines for an exit.  By adopting this forward-looking policy, we will avoid misallocations of investment and lock-in effects. It will enable Germany to follow a sustainable path of growth– whereas a continuation of investment in fossil fuels brings incalculable economic risks. In the aftermath of Paris, we are now seeing a race between nations to adopt the smartest and most cost-efficient modernisation policies. Thanks to its energy transition, Germany has a lead. We will have to work hard if we are to maintain this lead."
"The latest federal government carbon emissions inventory shows Australia has increased its emissions and has come under fire for allegedly vastly underestimating the amount of land clearing that has occurred, and its associated emissions. The Quarterly Update of the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory Report, which counts emissions in Australia up to September 2015,says greenhouse gas emissions from land clearing have fallen to record lows.  But Guardian Australia reported last month that a report commissioned by the Wilderness Society showed a land clearing surge in Queensland since 2012 has been so big that it would create emissions roughly equal to those saved by the federal government’s emissions reduction scheme, where they paid other farmers more than $670m to stop cutting down trees. The amount the Queensland government said was cleared in that state alone was almost twice what the federal government said was cleared nationwide in 2014. Queensland reported that almost 300,000ha were cleared in the 2013-14 financial year, while the federal government says less than 170,000ha were cleared nationwide. Looking at the emissions arising from land clearing, the federal government’s report says there have been only 10.8m tonnes of C02 emitted in 2014 and 2015, and just slightly more in 2013. But the Queensland figures say that state alone produced 38m tonnes of CO2 from land clearing in 2015, up from 25m tonnes in 2013. In response to those alleged discrepancies reported by Guardian Australia, the Department of Environment added a new explanatory section to the quarterly report. It raised seven differences in the ways Queensland and the federal government measure land clearing, and concluded that “it is not appropriate to compare the two data sets directly without adjusting the data for these differences”.  But the report does not explain how those differences could explain such a vastly contrasting result. “It defies logic. This is a major discrepancy that can’t be brushed off with the same inadequate explanations used so far,” the Wilderness Society’s climate campaign manager, Glenn Walker, said.  “The government “is either using very creative arithmetic or expects us to believe that the rest of Australia has planted enough trees to suck up the equivalent of about 20 million tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere,” he said. “That’s more than the emissions from Australia’s dirtiest coal power station Hazelwood.” Senator Larissa Waters, the Australian Greens climate change spokeswoman, said: “The Turnbull government is using dodgy numbers so it can allow its big fossil fuel donors to keep polluting while claiming to be meeting its woefully inadequate reduction targets set by Tony Abbott.” Even with the contested drops in emissions from land clearing, the report shows that emissions have risen. “In a sign of just how dodgy the accounting behind their climate targets is, the government is claiming to be meeting its 2020 target even though climate pollution is up,” Waters said. The report does not include any projections to 2020 or beyond, and so is unable to back up the government’s claims that Australia’s emissions peaked in 2005. And the government’s own projections from 2015 found they would be much higher by 2035. “We continue to see emissions steadily growing all the way to 2030, despite current policy,” said Hugh Grossman, the chief executive of the environmental consulting company RepuTex. “That’s cause for concern, in that current policy – even the [Emissions Reduction Fund] – is not curbing our national emissions growth. If the argument is about how much emissions are growing, we’re a long way from seeing emissions reductions.” A spokeswoman for Hunt said: “The emissions projections already fully take into account the Queensland government’s land clearing laws and practice.” “The advice from the Department of the Environment is clear, categorical and absolute,” she said, alleging that the Wilderness Society “wilfully misinterpreted data”. She said Australia’s accounting system was subject to external scrutiny by a panel of international experts appointed by the UN framework convention on climate change.  “Is the Wilderness Society now questioning the authority of the UNFCCC?” she asked."

"A research ship will spend an entire year adrift with the ice floes of the Arctic to better understand the disappearance of the polar ice cap. Scientists meeting in Fairbanks for the Arctic Science Summit warned this week that the area covered by this winter’s Arctic sea ice could be the lowest ever recorded, after three months of extremely warm temperatures and above freezing days at the North Pole. The international research cruise will set out for the Laptev sea off Siberia, aiming to monitor the sea ice across its entire life cycle – from the time new ice forms in autumn, through the utter darkness of winter, to the melting of ice in the early summer. Most research voyages in the Arctic take place in the summer months, but this voyage will also operate during the dark winter months, when temperatures plunge to 40F or even 50F below. “We are going to stick with that piece of ice and track it, as it grows and as it shrinks,” said Matthew Shupe, a researcher at the University of Colorado, who is leading the Mosaic voyage. “The goal is to integrate into the system and see what happens to the ice for an entire year.” The Mosaic research project will look at the behaviour of the ice – from metre thick chunks of ice that have remained frozen for years to thin sheets that grow and melt within a single season – to try to understand how the winds, clouds, snow and sun are affecting the ice melt.  “The ice is so diverse. Some of it is thick and rough and dirty, and some of it is very thin,” Shupe said. “And then you have lots of melt ponds.” The $60m (£41m) research project, involving 40 scientists from the US, Germany and Russia, is expected to launch in October 2019. In a separate initiative, the World Climate Research Programme and the Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation, this week offered a 500,000 Swiss franc prize to the team of scientists building an autonomous underwater vehicle (UAV) capable of travelling for 2,000km under the surface of the Arctic or Antarctic sea ice. The rapid melting of the polar ice caps has injected new urgency into scientists’ efforts to understand the climate systems operating in the Arctic. The bright white ice floating over the Arctic is an important driver of weather in the lower latitudes, according to scientists.  The loss of Arctic sea ice has already been linked by some scientists to disruptions in the jet stream, and the extreme cold blasts of the “polar vortex”.  Researchers now anticipate that the Arctic will be open water in the summer months by 2030 or 2040 – although it will continue to freeze over in the winter months. “Sometime in the 2030s or 2040s time frame, at least for a few days you won’t have ice out there in the dead of summer,” said John Walsh, chief scientist of the International Arctic Research Centre.

"Where only a few weeks ago there were swathes of vivid purples, blues and pretty much any other colour you fancy, now there is just grey and white. Corals in the northern section of Australia’s vast Great Barrier Reef – a length of more than 1000km or so – have become the latest and most famous victims of the third global “mass bleaching” of corals since 1998.  “It’s pretty confronting,” says Prof Terry Hughes, a leading coral scientist who has been spending recent days in a helicopter surveying the reef. Of the 520 reefs he flew over, only four have managed to retain their colour. He’s back in the skies to look further south in the coming days. “The Great Barrier Reef is today a diminished place from what it was a month ago,” Hughes, of James Cook University, told me. “We can’t climate proof this reef. We have seen the most pristine part of the reef take a direct hit.” As Hughes travelled further north to parts of the reef outside the boundaries of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, he saw corals “blitzed” in the Torres Strait. For >1000km of the #GreatBarrierReef, corals are severely bleached and dying, yet our government wants more #coal pic.twitter.com/LrtVA41Htj Corals get their striking colours thanks to the zooxanthellae algae that they live with.  But when the corals and the algae are stressed, they separate, leaving a bare white skeleton behind. In mass bleaching events, the stress comes when corals bathe for too long in unusually warm ocean waters. This is the point at which the Great Barrier Reef and the world’s fossil fuel industry come into direct conflict.  So far, the reef is losing. According to the Bureau of Meteorology, the sea surface temperatures (SST) in the Coral Sea region have been the highest on record for this most recent summer wet season. The BoM’s ocean temperature record goes back to the year 1900. As this chart shows, SSTs overlapping the northern parts of the reef have been the highest of any summer (December to February) on record. Hughes said that in 1998, 2002 and this current GBR bleaching event, the areas of the reef that bleached matched “perfectly” the areas with unusually high SST. The record warm oceans that have been stressing the corals in recent weeks are part of a long-term trend of warming ocean temperatures around the globe, including the waters off Australia. The cause of that warming trend is the extra heat being retained by the Earth’s climate system thanks to the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas that add greenhouse gases to the atmosphere and the oceans. Not surprisingly, the coal industry has tried to muddy the scientific waters on this key point. As I’ve written here before, the fact that Australia’s expansion of its coal export industry takes ships on a route straight through the reef could be seen as something of a sick joke. When I asked Hughes about the cause of the bleaching, he replied simply: “Global warming – the link is incontrovertible.” What’s also important to understand is that the corals in the north that have been bleached, are probably the least impacted by human activity across the GBR. Current and previous governments at state and federal levels, of both stripes, have increased investments to cut the amount of nutrient-rich waters and pollution running into the reef from farms and development along the coast.  But scientists, including the government’s own, have been warning for years now that the most important threat to the reef is from climate change.  Hughes says that while it is true that some coral species are more resilient to bleaching than others, this gives him little comfort when he had witnessed even the most resilient species bleached in recent days. “If half the corals bleach you will sea a pattern of winners and losers. But if all the corals are bleaching, then there are no winners. And they are all bleaching,” he says.  Hughes says it’s also misleading to pin the blame for the current bleaching event on the El Niño climate pattern.  Evidence from long term coral records did not show the signatures of coral bleaching, even though those corals would have been through many El Niño events. Hughes explains:  It’s only since 1998 that the extra spikes [from El Niño] cause problems. We had El Niños for centuries but they don’t show bleaching. Because it’s pristine [in the reef’s north], it’s not got the issues with run-off [from agriculture and coastal development] and it should better be able to bounce back. But if it takes 10 years, what’s the chance of getting another El Nino before 2026? It’s high. We will be in trouble if the return time is less than the recovery time.  In another bitter slice of irony, Hughes says that the central and southern sections of the reef probably “dodged a bullet” but this was only thanks to the cooling influence of the tail-end of the same weather system that caused the devastating cyclone in Fiji. When in November 2014 the US president, Barack Obama, told a crowd at the University of Queensland that the “incredible natural glory of the GBR is threatened”, Australia’s foreign minister, Julie Bishop, ignored the advice of her government scientists to lead a chorus of correction.  “Of course the Great Barrier Reef will be conserved for generations to come and we do not believe that it is in danger,” she said. In 2015, the Australian government spent $100,000 flying officials around the world to convince members of the World Heritage Committee not to place the reef on the “in danger” list.  The lobbying effort was a “success” but the victory must surely now be ringing hollow.  Hughes and other coral scientists are angry that years of warnings about the reef’s future have gone unheeded.  Hughes said there was a “disconnect” between the science and Australia’s policies of developing coalmines. Another world-leading coral scientist is Prof John Pandolfi, of the University of Queensland, who told me he had “several reactions all at once” to the bleaching playing out on the reef.  Sadness for the reef. Anger at the government for the lack of consistent policy to minimise emissions locally, and inability to lead globally. Embarrassment that this is happening to such a national and international icon, in one of the wealthiest countries on Earth – if we can’t stop it here, who can?  However, even though my immediate reaction is oriented toward policy, my measured scientific reaction is that this is a consequence of thermal stress, and we must use this event to further understand the thermal and other constraints under which corals survive.  Pandolfi says the link between carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels and the bleaching of the reef is clear. These hotter SSTs have caused a global mass bleaching event on the scale of which we have only witnessed two other times – 1998, 2010 – and the 2014-2016 event is now the longest on record. The Great Barrier Reef itself has suffered mass bleaching in 1998 and 2002.  Regardless, the link between high SSTs and global bleaching is very clear, and the link between climate change and SSTs is very clear. Finally the link between global emissions and the rise of CO2 and SSTs is very clear.  This all adds up to the human-caused element for this bleaching episode. It seems clear that if the ocean’s SST were not rising so fast we would not be experiencing these several bleaching events on a global scale.  So what needs to happen? Both Hughes and Pandolfi, and do doubt a great many other coral scientists, are in pretty strong agreement. You can’t keep the reef healthy while emissions from fossil fuels continue to grow. Pandolfi has another suggestion. I’ll leave you with it. I think it’s important for people to understand what they can do to help the situation. I grew up in a time when everyone thought it was impossible to ‘free South Africa’ but we all did what we could: we wrote to politicians, we personally divested from SA corporations and demanded our social institutions (e.g Universities) to do the same.  Ultimately the strategy worked. We can do the same thing here – personal and social divestment of non-sustainable energy companies and sources, switching ourselves to such energy sources where and how we can.  Emissions must come down sharply – the COP21 meeting has given the go ahead for this to become a reality. The coral bleaching on the GBR and elsewhere provides the prima facie evidence for pursuing this line of action. "
"The decision whether or not to have a child is one of the bigger ones a person will make in life – often the biggest.  I needed some strong convincing from my wife when it came time for us to make it. Most of my reluctance was self-interested: I liked my life well enough, and I didn’t want to change it. My wife talked about feeling a biological imperative, which I had no answer for. Who was I to stand in the way of something like that? I signed on.   But there is a whole other potential person to consider, too – the new life that you are bringing into the world without asking first. It’s not really fair. For while the world is a wonderful place, one we humans have made nicer for ourselves with wonderful inventions like books and record players, penicillin and pizza, it’s also a really awful place, one we’ve ravaged with deforestation and smog, nuclear weapons and mountains of pizza delivery boxes and other garbage.  The awfulness seems to be getting worse, especially now that climate change has sped up – sea level rise that was supposed to take centuries has recently been projected as taking just decades. This complicates the already difficult decision of whether to have a kid.  We’re living through what scientists call the “Sixth Extinction”, an era of precipitous decline in the number of species able to live on the planet. The last mass extinction, the fifth, happened 66 million years ago, when a giant asteroid crashed into Earth and 76% of all the species on the planet perished. This time, we’re doing it to ourselves.  “Climate scientists agree that humanity is about to cause a sea level rise of 20 or 30ft, but they have tended to assume that such a large increase would take centuries, at least,” the New York Times’s Justin Gillis reported. But a recent study led by retired Nasa climate scientist James E Hansen, published in Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, indicates that the negative effects are happening a lot faster than we’d thought, perhaps feet of rise within the next 50 years. “That would mean loss of all coastal cities, most of the world’s large cities and all their history,” Hansen told Gillis, adding, “We’re in danger of handing young people a situation that’s out of their control.”  Imagine that: New York, Tokyo, Mumbai, Shanghai, Bangkok, Amsterdam, Miami would go first. Think about the implications. Global economic collapse, famine, border disputes, wars. Jesus, just the inland traffic.  Thinking about the horrific future scientists predict hurts a very specific part of me, a part of me that I only first learned was there when I met my newborn son, 11 years ago, as he lay on the tray of the scale where the doctors had just weighed him and counted his fingers and toes. The moment is wordless, and as mind-blowing as any drug trip I ever took. But my friend Dave, who had kids before me, came closest to capturing its essence while we were talking later that day: it was like having a door open in your brain and stepping through it and realizing that there’s this whole other part of your brain that you never knew was there before. A room, roughly the same size as the part of your brain that you’ve been using all your life, it was vast and mostly empty (like your old brain) but in it I found stuff, inside myself, that I had never known was in there before.  This creature, this tiny newborn person, was half me. I felt a primordial bond that I’d never felt before, a connection different from anything I’d ever known. And I realized a deep, heavy responsibility: protecting him was instantly the most important job of all my jobs – to keep this thing alive, healthy, happy, thriving.  Future climate meltdown was already a theoretical concern for future generations: what kind of world would my great-great-grandchildren inhabit? Now it all feels more pressing. How am I going to protect my kid? Was it fair for me to bring him into this world at all? Was it immoral?  Was I complicit in the damage? I remember every extra paper towel I’ve ever unspooled from the roll, and think about a tree falling in the Amazon, and then think about my son growing up in a gray, dying world – walking towards Kansas on potholed highways. Maybe while trying to protect his own son, like the father in The Road. Will he decide to have a kid? I have foisted upon him a decision even more difficult than my own. It’s all very depressing. Still, I come down on the side of advocating reproduction. It gets back to the power we have, we humans. Such devastating power, with which we’ve already changed our world so dramatically. Maybe we can change it back, or at least innovate to survive. What if, and this is obviously a huge “if”, some young person, perhaps a certain 11-year-old in a Black Sabbath T-shirt (I highly doubt it, he can rarely remember to take his lunchbox out of his knapsack at the end of the day), perhaps someone who is not yet born, perhaps not yet conceived, is the one super-genius to figure out the invention that could save the planet?  The ultimate windmill system that can meet all our energy needs and somehow also cool the atmosphere while it works and also spread seeds to grow more trees as it does. And also make pizza. I don’t know. But that’s kind of the point: we don’t know. Maybe it could be something even better than that.  There’s always maybe. And that’s enough to persevere for."

"An announcement today that ANZ is absorbing a bigger than expected loss as a result of lending to the mining industry is likely to be the tip of the iceberg as coal and other fossil fuels go into structural decline, according to some financial analysts.  ANZ announced to the Australian stock exchange on Thursday that over the past month, conditions have changed such that expected costs associated with lending to the mining and resources sector would increase from a projected $800m to more than $900m. The bank said the change was caused by the “evolving position with a small number of Australian and multi-national resources-related exposures”. “While the overall credit environment remains broadly stable, we are continuing to see pockets of weakness associated with low commodity prices in the resources sector and in related industries,” said ANZ’s acting chief financial officer, Graham Hodges. The bank did not disclose which companies or loans caused the writedown, but Tim Buckley, a former Citibank analyst who is now with the anti-fossil fuel Institute for Energy Economics & Financial Analysis, said there were two new developments that could be linked to the move. The first was the warning by coal giant Peabody Energy that it was on the brink of bankruptcy after finding itself unable to pay an interest payment of US$70m. Buckley said if ANZ had lent to Peabody – which would not be known unless the company filed for bankruptcy – that would have put a dent the bank’s balance sheet. And on Wednesday the Australian Financial Review reported the owners of a coal export facility in Queensland, WICET, was struggling with its loans because of falling coal prices, and may be seeking a debt-for-equity swap, where the company exchanges debt for a pre-determined amount of equity or stock. A report in the AFR said ANZ was set to lose money on a loan associated with WICET’s coal export facility. Buckley said ANZ had previously been a lender to both these companies and it would not be surprising if they were still involved with them. “These are likely two triggering events,” he said. “We know ANZ was exposed to both these corporates and both have seen defining negative financial stress events in the last week or two. Have they traded out? Who knows? That’s not public information, but we know they were exposed to both. “I’d say this is the absolute tip of the iceberg. There are hundreds of billions of dollars that are being invested in new fossil fuel assets and infrastructure assets associated with that.”  Buckley said the risks associated with those investments were now coming to the fore, as foreshadowed last year by the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney. Julien Vincent from the financial activist group Market Forces agrees: “The coal industry is in structural decline, and it’s taking the bank industry with it, which means it’s taking shareholder value and customer value along with it.” “It means other banks are in the same position, and there are probably a whole bunch of other debt products that haven’t been put in this category but wouldn’t be far away. “We often think, ‘Oh look what’s happening to ANZ,’ but we’re all exposed to ANZ through our super or direct shares or by being a customer. The same goes for the other banks.” In February Guardian Australia reported analysis showing the big four banks, including ANZ, had signed off on $5.5bn of loans to the fossil fuel industry in Australia. Many commentators have warned these assets will become “stranded” if the world moves to avoid dangerous climate change, and keeps many of the known fossil fuel reserves in the ground."
"A little before midnight on a moonlit night, the solitary beam of a dog musher’s head lamp danced across the dark snow and ice of the Bering Sea coast and landed on a barking, trotting, tail-wagging mass of canine excitement: a team of 11 Alaskan huskies straining towards the finish of the legendary Iditarod dog sled race. The nearly 1,000-mile endurance race across the wilderness officially concluded with the dogs sprawled out on a snow ramp in the centre of Nome, an old gold rush town just below the Arctic Circle. Musher Marie Helwig, who finished in 71st place, posed with the red lantern given to last-place finishers as a salute to their perseverance.   It’s been 43 years since a kennel owner named Joe Redington seized on the idea of reviving the winter sport of dog sledding by paying homage to one of the most heroic tales from Alaska’s pre-statehood days – an epic journey by dog sled that brought  a life-saving serum to the remote town of Nome, where children were dying from a diptheria epidemic. The running of the Iditarod has turned dog sledding into Alaska’s most popular winter sport. But after this winter’s record high temperatures  – and a decade of perilously declining sea ice and permafrost across the Arctic, the question is now unavoidable: has the great dog sledding race had its day? The Iditarod is still about grit. Helwig, a first-time competitor, nearly dropped out of the competition after her house was destroyed in one of the climate-inflected wildfires that burned across Alaska last summer. On the trail, she made a painful choice to leave one of her dogs behind – after the animal ran off. (Fellow mushers later found him.) And two of the original Redington’s grandsons were forced to scratch. But this year’s Iditarod was less about snow and subzero temperatures than sickness and speed. Dogs slipped and slid their way across barren tundra and iced-up trails at breakneck pace. Mushers worried about keeping their teams healthy on afternoons so warm and sunny that dogs vomited from overheating. “There was just no snow. We were running on ice and dirt,” Helwig said. That made the course fast – but also more dangerous. “You can’t really control a sled when there is no snow,” Helwig said. Eight finishers completed the course in eight days – faster than any of the winners in some recent years. Even Helwig’s 71st-place time of 13 days would have put her in the top 10 in the 1980 and 1990s. A number of this year’s racers spoke about moving the Iditarod to January or February – when there is a greater chance of snow. Some no longer counted on training their dogs in Anchorage, because it was too warm, but were decamping for Fairbanks or even lower 48 states such as Idaho.  On several of the two dozen checkpoints on the trail, finishers of this year’s Iditarod reported high temperatures and low snow, slim ribbons of hard-packed sled trails against vast swaths of exposed tundra.  Climate change stole the winter from the Arctic this year: pushing temperatures up above zero at the North Pole, opening up treacherous black water on the Yukon river, and turning up the speed on the northbound trek to Nome.  “As far as this winter goes, my hunch is that there is essentially zero probability of that happening without climate change,” John Walsh, chief scientist at the International Arctic Research Centre in Fairbanks, said. “If your question is, ‘What are the odds of getting this warm a winter without climate change,’ I would wager that it would be zero.”  Warming is occurring twice as fast in the Arctic as anywhere else. On the Bering Sea, the ice cover is in rapid retreat. In the interior, thawing permafrost is draining lakes and raising the risks of wildfire on bone dry forests. Anchorage, the traditional starting point for the Iditarod, has to make contingences for a lack of snow.  Sled dog races and ski events were rerouted for the last three years. The local ski resort is considering investing in a snow-making machine to keep the season going. After the start of the Iditarod was moved last year for lack of snow, organisers this year arranged to ship in 11 rail cars of the white stuff. The low snow conditions persisted in the early stages of the race – and so did the unusually warm temperatures. “For me, the race was tough from the beginning because it was so warm and I have some really big dogs that are furry. They were not handling it so well. It was too hot for them,” said Helwig. “They were sluggish. A few of them threw up because they were dipping for snow so much – they ingested so much air and water.” Others found the warm temperatures a relief. Mushers ordinarily expect bitter -20F (-29C) cold in the interior of Alaska – but that did not materialise this year. “I don’t think it ever got colder than five below. It was super comfortable for us,” said Trent Herbst, a fourth-grade teacher from Ketchum, Idaho, running his eighth Iditarod. The days and nights were so warm he dispensed with a face mask or sleeping bag, curling up in the straw with the dogs. It was even warm enough to harness the dogs with bare hands. But Herbst also admitted being rattled by the absence of snow or ice. On some stretches of trail, there was no snow at all – just lots of gravel and tree stumps for distances of more than 20 miles, according to some competitors.  At Rainy Pass, the creek was strangely ice-free, a torrent of fast-moving water. Deep in the interior, it was so dry competitors were afraid their cook stoves would start a wildfire on the exposed tundra. From Galena to Nulato, dog teams were forced to change course away from the the Yukon river avoiding dark cracks which had opened in the ice. Up the Bering Sea coast, the last stretch of the race, the terrain was scoured clear of snow by strong winds. “There was absolutely no fresh snow anywhere on the trail. It was hard-packed snow and ice,” Herbst said. He spent a considerable amount of energy just trying to slow the team down.  Some sections of the route were as slippery as a skating rink. Others, especially the 70-mile traverse of an area destroyed by wildfire the mushers know as The Burn, were a bone-jarring, sled-wrecking obstacle course, Iditarod competitors said. Too much snow slows the race. The Iditarod rules require mushers to pack snowshoes to stomp out a trail for their dogs, if needed. Too much ice and the dogs slide all over the track: their paws can’t get a grip. New snow isn’t optimal either, according to Linwood Fiedler, who ran his 23rd Iditarod this year. “Fresh snow takes a while to set up. It’s all fluffy. It’s like putting your brake into whipped cream,” he said. “But after a while it will settle. With dog teams and snow machines running over it, it will set up and be firm.” Old snow, especially if it’s well travelled, means top speed – provided of course that mushers can hold on to their dogs and their sleds. “If you can imagine being pulled by 16 huskies all wanting to run and you are doing it on dirt and snow and ice – you are lucky you don’t bounce off trees,” Fielder said. His team fell several times on the most brutal section of the course, The Burn. That area typically does not get much snow, leaving a barren, scoured course. “We’ve got plenty of black and blue marks to prove it,” Fiedler said. “It was a hard, fast trail. It was hard to go slow.”  It was as hard on the dogs as the humans. Alaskan huskies were bred for performance in the north – smaller than Siberian huskies with a faster trot, thick coats to keep them warm, and fur between the toes to protect their feet from abrasive snow. Several racers said they adjusted their strategy – making sure to finish their runs by 11am or 12pm, allowing the dogs to nap in the warmest part of the day. Helwig ran her dogs at night, as much as she could. In some places even the dogs’ feed was at risk. At almost every checkpoint, the food drops of frozen dog meat thawed and refroze by the time some competitors checked in. Helwig said she was forced to throw out food because it had spoiled in the sun. Competing in the Iditarod – and finishing the race – takes a peculiar combination of dog-loving softy and mental discipline. For racers, it was unthinkable that warmer temperatures could ever put the Iditarod out of business. “You could go into the doom-and-gloom route and say we’re all done,” Herbst said. But he argued that would not be the Alaska way. The lower 48 might see Alaska only as a cold and lonely place – but they failed to see the whole picture. “For me Alaska, really is the last frontier. It’s about people being resilient,” Herbst said. “If you are Alaskan, you are used to change – and yeah, even climate change. People will change with it.” "
"Australia has not been a good neighbour to the Pacific islands vulnerable to climate change and needs to get out of fossil fuel-based growth faster, says Mary Robinson, the former Irish president turned climate change campaigner.  Speaking to Guardian Australia, she also urged rich countries to contribute to sustainable development in poor countries and to do so in their own self-interest.  Her former role as UN special envoy for climate change meant she had heard the pleas from developing countries for more action and Australia was urged to do more.  “I listened to the presidents and senior politicians and civil society of these Pacific island countries and I have to say they were very critical of Australia. Genuinely very critical,” she said of her time at the Pacific Island Development Forum in Fiji in 2015. “I was very struck by the fact that they did not consider that Australia or New Zealand, but more Australia, good leaders. “Australia was engaged in a fossil-fuel powering of its economy, which was hurting their economies and indeed their future. And it was said over and over again.” By that time, Australia had dismantled its carbon tax, was reviewing its renewable energy target and had axed or was planning to axe the majority of its government climate change bodies. “And when your neighbours think that of you – and that was an intimate forum for me to hear that – you need to think about what that means.” Robinson, who now heads her own organisation called the Mary Robinson Foundation – Climate Justice, had been invited to Australia by the University of Melbourne, where she delivered a lecture on sustainability on Tuesday night. She said Australia and other countries needed to work harder to lower emissions and stop climate change and emphasised the role of climate financing – a process whereby rich countries fund low-emissions development in poor countries. But she emphasised that it was not a form of aid. “It is not aid to developing countries. It is the means by which we secure a safe world for all our children and grandchildren,” she said. “The vast growth in infrastructure will have to be in developing countries. They have to build up their economies. And if we don’t help them with clean energy they will go the dirty route – they will go with coal – and then we will not have a safe world.” Robinson, who has also been UN high commissioner for human rights, said it was in the west’s interest to secure climate financing for developing nations. “It is human solidarity but it is also collective self-interest,” she said. “It’s in our self-interest to ensure that developing countries go clean because if they don’t they will lock in so much fossil fuel that we can’t have a safe world for anyone. “It’s like the Titanic. When the Titanic hit that iceberg, it wasn’t just those in steerage that went down, it was the first-class as well. “There is a real sense of interdependence and a need for human solidarity to realise we are all in this together.” When it comes to helping developing nations with the effects of climate change, that ship had already sailed, Robinson said.  “[Fiji] was hit by this awful cyclone Winston. Luckily not so many people were killed but it devastated their economy. “We can’t have this being the reality for very poor coutnries. We must ensure we move to a new pattern. “The reality is that we’re running out of time. Everyone is shocked by what is happening – we had the announcement that in February we had the greatest increase in heat, that it jumped more than scientists thought it would. “We have to be self-preserving and sensible. And, as a grandmother of five who will be in their 40s in 2050 and share the world with 9 billion others ... they will criticise us so harshly if we don’t get things right now. “We just have to get our minds right that we have a responsibility to move in the direction that Paris has given us – well below 2C as far as possible to 1.5C – a world that leaves no one behind. A world that is fair and inclusive … We can do it. And we will have a much better and more equal world if we do.”"
"After almost two years of coral bleaching, with some reefs bleaching twice and possibly three times since 2014, scientists have said that dire predictions of global coral decline made almost two decades ago may now be manifest. The rolling underwater heatwave has now arrived upon the Great Barrier Reef, with mass die-offs expected along the northern quarter of the world’s preeminent coral ecosystem.  Professor Nick Graham of Lancaster University said the devastation worldwide was probably now on the same scale as the worst ever bleaching on record, which occurred during 1997-98 and wiped out 16% of the world’s reefs in a single year. “This is the big one that we’ve been waiting for. This is the 1997-98 equivalent, which we’ve been anticipating for a long time,” said the coral scientist. The full impact could not be known until the event had finally ended, added Graham. Models predict it will now head west into the Indian Ocean and could continue in the Pacific until early 2017. Dr Mark Eakin, the head of the US government’s Coral Reef Watch programme, said this year’s massive bleach conformed with a prediction made by Australian scientist Ove Hoegh-Guldberg in the wake of the 1998 event. Back then, Hoegh-Guldberg predicted coral reefs would catastrophically decline by the middle to end of this century as oceans warmed and bleaching events became an annual occurrence on most reefs. “What we’re seeing now is unfortunately saying that Ove’s paper was not alarmist,” said Eakin. “This year is especially telling. In the past, big bleaching events happened pretty much during the course of a year. This current bleaching event started in mid-2014.” Eakin said many scientist had predicted two or three-year-long events would not begin occurring until the 2020s: “Yet here we are now with back-to-back to sometimes-back-again bleaching.” Coral bleaching occurs when the ocean temperature surpasses a natural threshold causing the tiny animals, called zooxanthellae, that give coral its brilliance to desert their polyp homes – leaving them bone white. Recovery tends to be patchy and slow. The concern that coral scientists hold for the future is that bleaching events will pile one atop the other, giving reefs no time to rebuild. But Graham held out some hope for the resilience of the reefs. He said that despite smaller bleaching events occurring throughout the past two decades, the next really massive event hadn’t come “as soon as Ove feared it would”. This had allowed some reefs time to bounce back. “After 1998 we were worried that they were going to become frequent quite quickly,” he said. “It’s been 18 years until this event which has been a blessing.”  Robbed of the zooxanthellae that clear the corals of intrusive plants, some of the reefs bleached in the past two years will be taken over by weeds and algae, strangling any hope they can return. “But others will [recover],” said Graham. “Then the real question mark is how frequent these events are going to be. If it’s another 18 to 20 years until we get the next one, then a lot of reefs will have time to bounce back.” Both the 1998 event and this year have been related to very strong El Niño patterns – which wash warm water across the Pacific Ocean and trigger increased heat around the world. El Niño cycles are fickle, but turn roughly every two to seven years. But the last huge one was in 1998. “If these super El Niños occur on timescales shorter than a decade then I think that’s when we’re really going to start seeing the ratcheting down of a lot more reefs,” said Graham. Great uncertainty exists around the effect climate change will have on El Niño. Mat Collins, joint chair in climate change at the UK’s Met Office, said current models showed no consensus over whether the frequency or intensity of the cycle would increase, decrease or remain the same.  However, predicting the behaviour of El Niño was incredibly complex and “we might see differences in future climate models as they improve”. Even so, El Niño is no longer the only cause of bleaching. In 2005 and 2010, large coral bleaching events occurred independently of the Pacific warming cycle. “As the temperature is creeping upwards [because of climate change], it takes less of an El Niño ... to cause a lot of bleaching,” said Eakin. “What we would have considered stressful temperatures back in the 1980s have become relatively normal summer temperatures now. That doesn’t mean the corals don’t mind it because a lot of them in fact are bleaching repeatedly.” The threat of an increasingly hot world has driven some adaptation among coral species and communities. Counterintuitively, being exposed to bleaching has actually made some reefs more resilient. This is because in some circumstances, the most fragile species of coral are killed off and stronger ones take over.  “But in the process, you’re losing biodiversity, which is a big problem,” said Eakin. “The whole question is: are temperatures rising faster than corals are able to adapt? And the answer so far seems to be ‘yes’.” Ultimately, he said, the determining factor for reefs would be human efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. If the world could limit warming to 1.5C above normal, the toughest target outlined by the recent Paris climate agreement, then reefs could stand a chance. “Even at 2C [which governments have agreed to hold temperatures to] we are going to be seeing the loss of a lot of coral reefs around the world,” he said."
"The Queensland government has granted three mining leases for Adani’s multi-billion dollar Carmichael coalmine, which will be the largest in Australia.  Environmental groups say the mine will fuel global warming and compound threats to the world heritage-listed Great Barrier Reef amid one of its worst coral bleaching events on record. The premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, and the mines minister, Anthony Lynham, made the announcement in Mackay on Sunday. The premier put the value of the project at $21.7bn, and said the approvals meant thousands of new jobs were now a step closer to reality. “Some approvals are still required before construction can start, and ultimately committing to the project will be a decision for Adani,” Palaszczuk said. “However, I know the people of north and central Queensland will welcome this latest progress for the potential jobs and economic development it brings closer for their communities.” She said stringent conditions would ensure the health of the reef and the environment, and the interests of traditional owners. The three leases, over the mine site 160km north-west of Clermont, cover an area estimated to contain 11bn tonnes of thermal coal.  Adani has estimated the mine, rail and port project will generate more than 5,000 jobs at the peak of construction and more than 4,500 jobs at the peak of operations. Earlier on Sunday, the Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) questioned whether Adani had pressured the mines minister to abandon his stated concerns about granting mining licences before court challenges had concluded. ACF is challenging federal approvals for the mine in the federal court, with a hearing set down for early May. Traditional owners have also launched a separate case. In announcing the approvals, Lynham said the approvals and the conditions attached were evidence of his government’s commitment to the sustainable development of the Galilee basin, and the jobs and opportunities the mine would create. The announcement came as the federal government’s own marine science agency warned water quality targets designed to protect the reef are unlikely to be met. Australian Institute of Marine Science researchers said water quality targets – set out in the Reef 2050 Plan, and aimed at warding off a Unesco decision to list the reef as in danger – would likely not be met under existing policies dealing with land-based pollution. Adani said the approvals meant it could proceed to the next stage of development but acknowledged ongoing uncertainty from unresolved legal challenges “by politically-motivated activists”. It said a final investment decision would not be made until the court challenges were resolved, and it had secured the final approvals it needs. “Having previously sought to progress to the construction phase in 2015, Adani is keenly aware of the risks of proceeding on major works in advance of the conclusion of these matters,” the company said in a statement. It also took a swipe at processes it said had held up a very significant project for Australia. “The granting of the mining lease, coupled with strict and rigorous science-based environmental approvals, underlines the importance of major projects in Queensland, and in Australia more broadly, not being subject to endless red tape, after approving authorities have exhaustively examined them over some six years.” Adani Australia chief executive, Jeyakumar Janakaraj, said the company was serious about proceeding with the mine. “We have invested $1.2bn in the mine so far, and we have bought Abbot Point for $1.8bn. Without seriousness of developing these projects, we wouldn’t be investing that kind of cash,” he told reporters in Mackay. “If we do not send clean coal ... from Australia, India will continue to burn dirty coal and that is just not good for anybody.” Janakaraj said he hoped all outstanding approvals could be obtained this year, so construction could commence next year."
"On the surface, green bonds seem counter intuitive: why would a company willingly take on debt to finance environmental efforts? But Apple’s recent decision to issue its first green bond suggests that this type of investment could play a key role in reining in global warming. Apple’s $1.5bn green bond, announced last month, will fund several initiatives, including the company’s conversion to 100% renewable energy, installation of more energy efficient heating and cooling systems and an increase in the company’s use of biodegradable materials. A green bond, like a typical bond, is simply a way to borrow money, but it’s issued specifically to fund environmental projects.   Apple’s green bond reflects a growing corporate concern about the economic impact of climate change. Businesses are responsible for the majority of manmade greenhouse gas emissions, which are driving up average temperatures worldwide and affecting many companies’ bottom lines. Some, including Apple, are realizing the need to invest in environmental resources, such as watersheds or forests, to protect the sources of their products. Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives, told Reuters that the company decided to issue its green bond after December’s UN Climate Summit in Paris, during which hundreds of companies pledged to fight climate change. With its bond sale, Apple has become the largest US company to have issued a green bond – although Toyota still holds the crown for the largest corporate green bond ever offered in the US with its $1.75bn green bond issued in 2014. The green bond market is still in its infancy. According to Climate Bonds Initiative, a UK nonprofit that tracks the market, the first green bond was issued in 2007, and the first corporate issuance didn’t come along until 2013. Since then, a handful of high profile companies have jumped on the bandwagon, including EDF, a French power company, and Bank of America, which used the proceeds to loan money to cities and other businesses for installing solar panels, wind turbines and LED lighting. For global companies, changing operations to deal with the impact of climate change requires a lot of time and money. As a result, many companies have traditionally been unwilling to invest in renewable energy or other climate projects without a significant return on investment. For example, Apple will need to raise billions of dollars to achieve its ambitious plans to reduce its environmental impact. Last year, it committed to spend $848m over 25 years to buy enough solar-generated electricity to offset all the electricity used in its corporate and retail operations in California. While green bonds have commonly been used to fund renewable energy projects, an increasing amount of money is going to projects that help offices and other buildings use water and other energy more efficiently, said Andrew Whiley, a spokesman for Climate Bonds Initiative. Electric cars and low-carbon transportation also are becoming popular, he added.  Globally, the green bond market is expected to keep growing. According to Climate Bonds Initiative, the market, including government-issued bonds, reached an all-time high of $41.8bn in 2015, up from $36.6bn in 2014 and $11bn in 2013. Financial services company HSBC predicts between $55bn and $80bn worth of green bonds will be issued around the world in 2016, while the Climate Bonds Initiative believes sales will exceed $100bn. Toyota’s green bonds demonstrate a growing investor interest in transportation in particular. The company has issued two green bonds totaling $3bn since 2014, and has used the money to fund leases and loans for its fuel efficient cars, which it defines as those that get 35 miles per gallon or use hybrid engines. Clinton Moloney, sustainability advisory leader at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said that as the effects of climate change become more devastating and widespread, green bond projects could grow more complex. For instance, proceeds can be used to build a seawall to help protect the San Francisco Bay from rising sea levels, or to restore marshlands that help to soak up runoffs during a big storm. “We can do environmental projects that use concrete and steel, or we can think of nature based solutions as well,” Moloney said. “Evaluating those projects needs to be more sophisticated. That’s where we’re headed.” Another issue facing green bonds is transparency. For investors who aren’t only interested in making money, figuring out the environmental impact of their investments while ensuring that the money is spent as promised can be difficult to accomplish. As a result, a number of organizations have come up with rules and metrics to help both corporate borrowers and investors track and understand how the money is spent. One such effort comes from the International Market Association, which has worked with investment banks or other investment firms such as JPMorgan Chase, BlackRock and World Bank to create a set of guidelines called the Green Bond Principles. The guidelines define the types of environmental benefits that could be covered by a green bond, such as reducing pollution or conserving wildlife. They also recommend an annual reporting by the bond issuers on how they use the proceeds. “The more confidence investors can feel in the green bona fides of a project, the better the marketplace will operate,” said PricewaterhouseCoopers’ Moloney. For its part, Toyota is communicating directly with investors to keep its green bonds transparent. To show investors that the money from its green loans is being spent properly, it publishes a monthly report to show the amount spent on financing leases and loans for qualifying models, such as the Prius. “Investors were able to see how the funds were being deployed and make their own determination, [and] whether it was consistent with what we had promised,” said Adam Stam, national manager of secured funding at Toyota Financial Services."
"It’s easy to be a bit nostalgic for work pre-internet, when research could involve exploring the dusty confines of the British Library or the excitement of digging out an old tome from a government archive with numbers on Ugandan coffee exports from 1957. But nothing really beats the satisfaction available today from downloading in just three or four clicks the entire import-export database for the same country. Yet, it can be tempting to make Wikipedia or Google the default for research. So, here are some gems which make international development research better, easier and more productive.   What’s it good for? If you like data visualisations and are interested in analysing trade flows and the sectoral composition of an economy, you can’t beat this website from Harvard. Cesar A. Hidalgo and Ricardo Hausmann have done some amazing work in the past few years conceptualising the enormous quantity of data on world trade to help us understand the processes of export diversification and industrialisation. This has developed further and the Atlas  and Globe are probably the best visualisations of any dataset I’ve seen yet. The cons: The product classifications can be difficult to understand, as can the product space concept.  What’s it good for? To see how we are causing average CO2 levels to rise with the most consistent and accurate dataset available, see the Earth System Research Laboratory. But the real cause of climate change is obviously the emissions of fossil fuels either through industry, transportation, electricity production or indirectly via forest depletion. The IEA provides excellent data on how each country produces and consumes energy. Its energy statistics report is excellent, as is its energy atlas data tool. For energy statistics as well as projections up to 2035, the BP Energy Outlook is also very useful. The cons: I’ve tried to calculate the CO2 implications of energy production and consumption figures in the past, but it is very difficult as the conversion factors used seem to vary from agency to agency. This is the best I’ve found. What’s it good for? International transactions in land have been called land grabs by some NGOs and the media. A meticulously developed database of international land transactions is available, called the Land Matrix, with plenty of useful visualisation tools. The cons: The site admits itself the data is inherently unreliable. As I understand it this is because the information on such deals is often private and commercially sensitive.  What’s it good for? The International Monetary Fund (IMF) Article IV reports are unbeatable as a free and up-to-date source of information on all major economic indicators for every country in the world; this includes debt and capital flows, as well as a treasure trove of qualitative information about the key developments, political and economic, from foreign direct investment (FDI) project progress to conflict and instability. The IMF World Economic Outlook data site and data mapper are very good as well, but if I’m researching any country I’ll always start with the Article IV report. The cons: The annex tables within each report can sometimes be difficult to read and interpret, and it is not always apparent which statistics come directly from the government in question and how many are estimates made by the IMF. It is worth reading the small print. In particular, if you need FDI information it is worth comparing the IMF estimates with those provided by UNCTAD. What’s it good for?  If you are trying to analyse fragile and conflict-affected states as opposed to other countries, you need clear definitions of which countries fit in and when. The Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP) has recorded ongoing violent conflicts since the 1970s, defining countries which had more than 25 battle deaths per year as experiencing minor conflicts and those with more than 1,000 as major conflicts. For fragility, try the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA), a series of 16 measures on countries’ performance in implementing policies that promote economic growth and poverty reduction, where the World Bank classify a country as fragile if scoring 3.2 on the CPIA. You can also try the Fragile States Index, which is easier to use. The cons: Conflict can be a highly contested term. In addition, the data does not distinguish terrorism as a separate category.  What’s it good for? I’ve found this an extremely useful and easy-to-use source of information on a broad range of business environment indicators, as well as excellent comparable data on the actual costs of trade. You do have to get into the sub-indicator information for it to be really useful though but the survey is annual so you can easily look for trends over time.  The cons: The Doing Business data collection process is often based on formal laws and procedures rather than those actually experienced by businesses in operation. As a result there is a case that it can be misleading on the true business environment – for example a formal process to start a business might take four days on paper but in reality would require a bribe to an official to be done in that timeframe. As a result I would also suggest using this data alongside Transparency International’s Corruption Perception index, which gives a measure of corruption based on surveys with real businesses and investors. What’s it good for? Absolutely everything. The World Development Indicators (WDI) is a huge collection of national data on hundreds of indicators, from the number of mobile phones per 1,000 people to the number of children out of school. It goes back a long way and has data on every country in the world.  The cons: As well as being prone to crash Microsoft Excel at 84MB for the full sheet, the database is a collation of a huge range of sources. It is important to understand the real source when evaluating the quality and consistency of the data used, but unfortunately the dataset itself is not clearly labelled so you don’t know the source for a lot of the information. You are also liable to drown a bit in the quantity here. So, if I was after agricultural data I would actually go first to the UN’s Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO), for education data Unesco’s Global Education Digest and for economic indicators I’d probably start with the IMF’s World Economic Outlook.  What’s it good for? If you want a holistic ranking of progress of a country on human development, the HDI still provides a good benchmark. It brings together gross national income (GNI) per capita with life expectancy, and high-level education indicators, into a useful index for international comparisons. But the dataset behind the high-level index is much more detailed, including information from the HIV prevalence rates to primary school drop-out rates. The cons: The HDI draws on a range of other sources. Read the small print. What’s it good for? For raw data on high-level trade, I would go to COMTRADE. They do visualisations but you can also download large amounts of data, although for this you need to know the commodity codes you are interested in. However, if you can get yourself a login for the World Bank’s World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS), do so, it’s by far the easiest way to search COMTRADE data.  The cons: There are a few different categories used for classifying product types. I would always use SITC ver.3, which I’ve found has the largest amount of data available and it is easier to analyse. As you can go right down to very fine product categories, you need to know what level of detail you are interested in, otherwise you can end up with an unmanageable amount of information. What’s it good for? If you are doing any analysis in which aid itself is a key variable, then there is no better source than the OECD aid database. It is the only really consistent data source on aid I’ve seen.  The cons: The aid data is collected from governments, which may have different definitions both of Official Development Assistance (ODA) and of what constitutes sectoral focus – I’ve found it particularly difficult to classify how much money is given to private sector development interventions, for example. In addition the split between budget support and sector programmes is not always clearly specified. It is useful to cross-check the figures with the IMF Article IV balance of payments stats if you can. What websites do you go to for your international development data?

"And another one bites the dust. The year 2014 was the warmest ever recorded by humans. Then 2015 was warmer still. January 2016 broke the record for the largest monthly temperature anomaly. Then came last month. February didn’t break climate change records – it obliterated them. Regions of the Arctic were were more than 16C warmer than normal – whatever constitutes normal now. But what is really making people stand up and notice is that the surface of the Earth north of the equator was 2C warmer than pre-industrial temperatures. This was meant to be a line that must not be crossed. Two degrees was broadly interpreted as the temperature that could produce further, potentially runaway warming. You can think of it as a speed limit on our climate impact. But it’s not a target speed. If you are driving a car carrying a heavy load down a steep hill you’re often advised to change down from top gear and keep your speed low, as if you go too fast your brakes will fail and you will be unable to stop. Less braking means more speed which means less braking – a dangerous runaway feedback loop. Hopefully the hill flattens out and you have enough straight road ahead to recover. If you don’t then you will be stopping much more abruptly. We are currently swamping the Earth’s ability to absorb greenhouse gases. 2015 saw the largest annual increase in carbon dioxide since records began – far higher than the Earth has experienced for hundreds of thousands of years. More carbon dioxide in the atmosphere means higher temperatures. There is already one positive feedback loop in operation; the extra warming from our emissions is increasing the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere, which further increases temperatures. Fortunately, this is not a very strong feedback loop. Unfortunately, there seem to be other, much more powerful ones lurking in the event of further warming. Tipping points such as the thaw of permafrost and release of the very powerful greenhouse gas methane in large quantities would drive world temperatures well beyond the 2C threshold. Even if we came to our collective senses and rapidly reduced carbon emissions at that point, we would still have to revert to drastic geoengineering to rein in further warming. There is no guarantee that such climate brakes will work. If they fail, our civilisation would be on a collision course with a much hotter planet. The safe–unsafe threshold of 2C recognises the significant amount of uncertainty there is over where dangerous warming really begins. It could be at more than 2C. Hopefully it is. But it’s not impossible that it is less. We need to bear in mind that it was only the northern hemisphere that crossed the 2C line. Also, we need to factor in the monster El Niño that is having an effect on temperatures across the globe. In 2014, I predicted that 2015 would break record temperatures. This is not due to any psychic powers on my part, but the then very clear El Niño signal that was emerging. So while temperature records may continue to be set for the rest of 2016, by the end of this year the situation should have cooled somewhat. Right? At times, it feels as if such statements are offered up as prayers in the hope that we are not in fact witnessing the beginning of abrupt and sustained climate change. But what’s even scarier is the political, economic and social reaction to these landmarks in climate change. Have you heard any political speeches referring to these recent climate change records? Not one of the major Republican presidential candidates even “believes” in human-produced climate change, let alone that it is something to worry about. How was the stock market this morning? It appears febrile enough to lurch from euphoric boom to catastrophic bust on the basis of bland statements from central bankers but proves remarkably deaf to evidence that the entire industrial and financial system is headed for disaster. Know what’s trending on Twitter as I write? A photoshopped giant dog, the latest Game of Thrones trailer and Kim Kardashian’s naked body. Actually, it’s mainly Kim Kardashian’s naked body and people’s responses to it. Followed by people’s responses to the responses. It would be churlish of me to deny people the pleasure of looking at pictures of a photograph of a cuddly dog adjusted in order to make it appear both cute and monstrous. But we appear uninterested, either through denial or desensitisation, in the environmental changes happening right in front of our eyes. There are sure to be more climate records broken this year. But we treat them as we treat new fashions, phones or films. More novelty, newer features, more drama. We seem unable to understand that we are driving such changes. Record breaking changes that will ultimately break our civilisation, and so scatter all that we obsess and care about. "

"Scottish ministers should aim to cut the country’s greenhouse gas emissions by a challenging but achievable 61% by 2030, an influential advisory committee has recommended. The UK Committee on Climate Change (UKCCC) said that cutting emissions that deeply would mirror the Scottish parliament’s existing goal of reducing emissions by 42% by 2020: both targets would outstrip the UK government’s current pledges.  In its annual report to Holyrood, the committee urged it to adopt “stretching” targets to install low carbon heating in 30% of homes by 2030; increase electric vehicle sales to 65% of new car and van sales by 2030, and cut emissions from electricity production from 220 gCO2/kWh to below Scotland’s legislated target of 50 gCO2/kWh, by greatly expanding renewables. Lord Deben, its chair, said: “There is a lot of positive action already under way in Scotland, driven by both its vibrant renewable sector and its bold policy approaches. This must now be accelerated.” The UKCCC said Scotland was already very close to achieving that 2020 target, with current cuts at 38% against 1990 levels. The UK government, however, is planning more radical plans than those set by Holyrood by enshrining a zero emissions target required by the Paris climate agreement into UK law. The UK government is already legally bound to cut emissions by 80% by 2050, but Andrea Leadsom, the UK energy minister, told Westminster on Monday: “The question is not whether but how we do it.” Environment campaigners welcomed the committee’s proposals but warned that substantial policy changes were needed from the Scottish government, which is pressing ahead with plans to cut air passenger duty in Scotland by at least 50% from April 2018 and continues to heavily invest in roadbuilding. Campaigners said that plan, outlined in a consultation paper on Monday, was deeply misguided. They pointed to new data from Nasa showing that February’s global temperature had smashed records as the warmest yet recorded, at +1.35C. It followed cuts in Scottish government funding for climate change reduction measures in its latest budget, said Mike Robinson, from the Stop Climate Chaos Scotland umbrella group of environment groups, anti-poverty charities and civic organisations. “Air travel has the highest climate emissions per km of any form of transport and emissions from the sector have risen significantly over the past 20 years,” he said. It would increase emissions by one of the UK’s least-taxed transport sectors after the government in Edinburgh had repeatedly missed its annual emissions reductions targets, mandated by Holyrood’s Climate Change (Scotland) Act. It requires annual cuts of 3% from 2020 onwards. Jim Densham, also from Stop Climate Chaos Scotland, said ministers would need “strong action and new policies” from ministers in Edinburgh. “The advice from the UKCCC describes a rapid transition away from fossil fuels towards a clean, renewable energy future,” he said.  “This is a massive opportunity to not only cut emissions but also deliver new jobs in sectors like home insulation and renewable energy across Scotland, improve public health, create investment in new industry and help tackle fuel poverty.” The UKCCC also recommended that Holyrood amend its remaining annual emissions targets from 2017 to 2020 to take account of changes in EU emissions measurement techniques, introduced after the climate act was written, which had increased overall emissions.  Those changes had led Scotland to miss its targets. Aileen McLeod, the Scottish climate minister, said despite that, Scotland was second only to Sweden in the scale of its reductions to date.  “I welcome this new advice from the Committee on Climate Change. Scotland is a world leader in tackling climate change, with our approach being described as ‘exemplary’ by Christiana Figueres, the head of the UN climate body, during her visit to Scotland last week,” McLeod said.  “Looking to the future, I recognise the need to need to maintain our high ambition – especially following the global agreement reached, as we hoped and argued for, in Paris. The committee’s current advice on how best to maintain our high-ambition approach will be taken into account when Scotland’s next batch of targets are set in October.”"
"David Cameron’s government is to blame for overseeing the fraying of the UK’s cross-party consensus for action on climate change, according to Ed Miliband.   The former Labour leader said that the many cuts to green policies enacted since the Conservatives came to power were “deeply, deeply disappointing” and the government had felt “far too able to do the wrong things on climate change”. The cutting of a pioneering £1bn carbon capture and storage competition last year was one of the worst things the government had done, as well as hasty cuts to solar power subsidies, he said.  “The truth is the consensus has frayed,” the former energy and climate secretary told an audience at a Guardian Live event in London on Thursday. “That has really accelerated since the general election with many of the things the government has done and they are deeply, deeply disappointing.”  He said that there was a need to engage with Tories to rebuild that consensus, which helped bring about the Climate Change Act nearly a decade ago. Unlike the US, where climate change is a politically polarising issue, in the UK there is cross-party agreement about the need to drive down the emissions that drive global warming. “I think most Tory MPs are not climate deniers,” he said. Miliband admitted that despite international agreements such as the Paris climate deal last December, governments and civil society had collectively failed to mobilise enough action. Acting on air pollution – much of which is caused by the burning of fossil fuels – was one way to tackle climate change more effectively, he said. “This is a daily killer. We’re allowing it to happen,” said Miliband, before adding that the government’s air clean-up plan published in December was useless. “[Pollution has] got to be made into a political issue.”  The government is facing an imminent legal challenge to its clean-up plan from the environmental law group, ClientEarth, which is expected to be heard this summer.  Miliband said he was concerned at the high pollution his children were exposed to at their local school in London. “There should be a ‘million mums and dads march’ about what is happening to our kids,” he said. “If this [were] any other issue, people would be up in arms and on the streets about it.” The Labour MP said that one thing individuals could do to act on climate change was to ask their pension funds whether they were invested in fossil fuels. “Contact your pension fund … ask them about what they’re doing with your money,” he said. “It might well be that pension is doing disastrous things to your kid’s future.” Miliband also praised the international campaign to keep fossil fuels buried to avoid dangerous global warming. “I think ‘keep it in the ground’, not just the Guardian but the international campaign, is a major step forward. The interesting and exciting thing about it … is it is a direct challenge to big corporate interests who are ... creating problems for us.” He said the Paris climate deal agreed last December had gone far beyond his expectations but it was only “the beginning of the beginning”."
"The UK will enshrine in law a long-term goal of reducing its carbon emissions to zero, as called for in last year’s historic Paris climate deal. Responding to former Labour leader Ed Miliband’s call to put the target into law, energy minister Andrea Leadsom told parliament on Monday: “The government believes that we will need to take the step of enshrining the Paris goal for net zero emissions in UK law. The question is not whether but how we do it.”  The UK is already legally bound by the Climate Change Act to reduce emissions 80% by 2050, but a law mandating a 100% cut would mark a dramatic increase in ambition. The final 20% is seen as the most difficult to cut, as it would have to come from sectors such as farming, which are not as easy to decarbonise as power plants. Miliband, who played a key role in legislating the Climate Change Act and who called for zero emissions to be enshrined in law ahead of the Paris climate summit in December, welcomed Leadsom’s comments. “It is the right thing to do because the science demands it, it makes economic sense and will build momentum in the fight against climate change,” said Miliband, who had tabled an amendment on zero emissions to the energy bill that won cross-party backing. “It is essential we build on the success of the Paris agreement and do not squander it, and I hope other countries will now follow the example of the UK.” The announcement by Leadsom follows months of criticism of the government’s green record by businesses and civil society after a series of cuts to subsidies for renewable energy, the axing of zero carbon homes regulations and a strong push for fracking. At Paris, nearly 200 countries promised to try to bring global emissions down from peak levels as soon as possible. More significantly, they pledged “to achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century”. Experts say that means getting to “net zero emissions” between 2050 and 2100. The UN’s climate science panel says net zero emissions must happen by 2070 to avoid dangerous warming. The commitment by ministers today to legislating for such a target comes as a series of climate milestones were passed. February was abnormally hot by a record amount globally, driven by climate change and El Niño, with scientists saying the anomaly was shocking and showed there is a climate emergency that gives added impetus to the Paris deal. Last year also saw atmospheric concentrations of CO2 jump by the highest amount on record. Ministers later this year will have to decide whether to accept the recommendation of the Committee on Climate Change, their statutory climate advisers, of a carbon cut of 57% by 2032, the so-called fifth carbon budget. The setting of the fourth carbon budget sparked a political row in 2011, with George Osborne and other ministers opposing it before David Cameron stepped in to agree to the targets. The Committee on Climate Change concluded in January that the Paris deal, which contained a tougher temperature target than previously agreed, did not merit a change to the proposed fifth carbon budget, a decision branded “desperately disappointing” by green campaigners. Leadsom said the CCC would be reporting back on the implications of the Paris agreement in the autumn and said that before a zero emissions goal was made law there was “an important set of questions to be answered”."

"Globally there are many well-known names who have raised concerns about climate change: the Pope, Barack Obama, Leonardo DiCaprio, Prince Charles, Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Rockefeller Foundation. In Australia too, a broad range of voices have added their concerns and fears to the debate: firefighters who can no longer protect people or houses as we battle increasingly extreme weather conditions, 90% of Australian youth who last year said climate change was an important issue for them, farmers who see the effects of climate change on their properties every day, doctors who stress the deadly impact of heatwaves on the elderly, very young and those with existing health problems, climate scientists, David Pocock, Cate Blanchett, the tens of thousands of protestors who took to the streets in climate marches held across the country in November 2015 … the list goes on.  A global chorus of voices applauded the historic climate change agreement reached in December 2015 in Paris, including Ban Ki-moon, Francois Hollande and representatives from the nearly 200 countries who took part in the negotiations.   The deal, which agreed to limit global warming to well below 2C and eliminate the use of fossil fuels coal, oil and gas for energy, was openly adopted by the Australian Government. In Paris, foreign minister Julie Bishop said “our work here is done and now we can return home to implement this historic agreement. This is a pivotal moment.”  Prime minister Malcolm Turnbull declared Australia’s support for this new agreement, calling it “good for our environment, good for our economies”.  So now, three months after the Paris climate summit, how has the Australian government begun “to implement this historic agreement”? Have those voices speaking out for climate reform been heard? What steps have been taken? Between December 2015 and March 2016 we’ve seen Australian government cuts result in the slashing of over 100 jobs at the government’s peak agency for climate science research, the CSIRO. The Minerals Council of Australia, which wields significant influence over Australia’s current coalition government, is still running “Coal. It’s an amazing thing’” advertisements on commercial radio and television stations across the country.  Bipartisan support continues for the go ahead of one of the world’s largest coal mines in QLD, the Adani Carmichael mine, despite multiple protests from Indigenous and environmental groups as well as Australian Federal Court and funding setbacks – Commonwealth Bank, National Australia Bank and Standard Chartered among others have refused to fund the project.  At a time when investing in the fossil fuel sector doesn’t even make financial or business sense, $5.5 billion of financial investments have been made by the custodians of the majority of Australia’s money – Australia’s big four banks, the Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, National Australia Bank and the ANZ.  Australians with BHP investments by their superannuation funds were understandably worried about their retirement futures following the February announcement by the mining giant of losses totalling $7.8 billion due to the end of Australia’s mining investment boom and plummeting global oil prices. Three months isn’t a long time, but long enough to see which voices the Australian government is listening to. Despite the broad range of voices in Australia and globally pleading for action on climate change – not to mention the science or the cold hard facts – the current Australian Government does not seem to be listening.  Australia’s average annual temperature in 2015 was up 0.16C from 2014, with climate change a major factor. Climate scientists clearly state that our energy mix must transition away from fossil fuels to renewable forms of energy in order to keep global warning below 2C.  How many more voices can one government ignore? If the last three months are anything to go by, a lot.  For almost half of Australian voters, a poll launched in March indicated that climate change and renewable energy policies will influence the way they vote. This is exciting. Let’s hope the upcoming federal election provides an opportunity for the public to hold our current government to account. "
"February smashed a century of global temperature records by a “stunning” margin, according to data released by Nasa.  The unprecedented leap led scientists, usually wary of highlighting a single month’s temperature, to label the new record a “shocker” and warn of a “climate emergency”. The Nasa data shows the average global surface temperature in February was 1.35C warmer than the average temperature for the month between 1951-1980, a far bigger margin than ever seen before. The previous record, set just one month earlier in January, was 1.15C above the long-term average for that month. “Nasa dropped a bombshell of a climate report,” said Jeff Masters and Bob Henson, who analysed the data on the Weather Underground website. “February dispensed with the one-month-old record by a full 0.21C – an extraordinary margin to beat a monthly world temperature record by.” “This result is a true shocker, and yet another reminder of the incessant long-term rise in global temperature resulting from human-produced greenhouse gases,” said Masters and Henson. “We are now hurtling at a frightening pace toward the globally agreed maximum of 2C warming over pre-industrial levels.” The UN climate summit in Paris in December confirmed 2C as the danger limit for global warming which should not be passed. But it also agreed agreed to “pursue efforts” to limit warming to 1.5C, a target now looking highly optimistic. Climate change is usually assessed over years and decades, and 2015 shattered the record set in 2014 for the hottest year seen, in data stretching back to 1850. The UK Met Office also expects 2016 to set a new record, meaning the global temperature record will have been broken for three years in a row. One of the world’s three key temperature records is kept by Nasa’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (Giss) and its director Prof Gavin Schmidt reacted to the February Giss temperature measurements with a simple “wow”. He tweeted:  Normally I don't comment on individual months (too much weather, not enough climate), but last month was special.https://t.co/nALWMlNDcP “We are in a kind of climate emergency now,” said Prof Stefan Rahmstorf, from the Potsdam Institute of Climate Impact Research in Germany. He told Fairfax Media: “This is really quite stunning ... it’s completely unprecedented.” “This is a very worrying result,” said Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics, noting that each of the last five months globally have been hotter than any month preceding them.  “These results suggest that we may be even closer than we realised to breaching the [2C] limit. We have used up all of our room for manoeuvre. If we delay any longer strong cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, it looks like global mean surface temperature is likely to exceed the level beyond which the impacts of climate change are likely to be very dangerous.” A major El Niño event, the biggest since 1998, is boosting global temperatures, but scientists are agreed that global warming driven by humanity’s greenhouse gas emissions is by far the largest factor in the astonishing run of temperature records. Prof Adam Scaife, at the UK Met Office, said the very low levels of Arctic ice were also helping to raise temperatures: “There has been record low ice in the Arctic for two months running and that releases a lot of heat.” He said the Met Office had forecast a record-breaking 2016 in December: “It is not as if you can’t see these things coming.”  Ed Hawkins, a climate scientist at the University of Reading, UK, said: “It is a pretty big jump between January and February, although this data from Nasa is only the first set of global temperature data. We will need to see what the figures from NOAA and the Met Office say. It is in line with our expectations that due to the continuing effect of greenhouse gas emissions, combined with the effects of El Niño on top, 2016 is likely to beat 2015 as the warmest year on record.” The record for an annual increase of atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, was also demolished in 2015.  Fossil fuel-burning and the strong El Niño pushed CO2 levels up by 3.05 parts per million (ppm) to 402.6 ppm compared to 2014. “CO2 levels are increasing faster than they have in hundreds of thousands of years,” said Pieter Tans, lead scientist at Noaa’s Global Greenhouse Gas Reference Network. “It’s explosive compared to natural processes.”    "
"Connoisseurs of fine wine should be drinking a toast to global warming, according to new research. Higher temperatures in France are producing exceptional vintages, but scientists have warned that if the trend continues too long, the current run of outstanding grape harvests could end.  Records dating back more than 500 years show that wine grapes across France are now being harvested two weeks earlier on average than they were in the past. Wine grape maturation is accelerated by warmer temperatures and delayed by rain, and earlier harvests are generally associated with higher quality wines. The main reason for the change is climate change pushing up temperatures in the absence of drought, it is claimed. Dr Elizabeth Wolkovich, from Harvard University in the US, who took part in the research published in the journal Nature Climate Change, said: “There are two big points in this paper. The first is that harvest dates are getting much earlier, and all the evidence points to it being linked to climate change. Especially since 1980, when we see a major turning point for temperatures in the northern hemisphere, we see harvest dates across France getting earlier and earlier. “The bad news is that if we keep warming the globe we will reach a tipping point. “The trend, in general, is that earlier harvests lead to higher-quality wine, but you can connect the dots here ... we have several data points that tell us there is a threshold we will probably cross in the future where higher temperatures will not produce higher quality.” There is a French word, “terroir”, that vintners use to describe the set of environmental factors affecting wine grape quality. It is because of terroir that the wine grape is one of the best barometers of climate change, say the scientists. “At the heart of a good wine is climate,” said Wolkovich. “So the grapes are a very good canary in the coal mine. “You want to harvest when the grapes are perfectly ripe, when they’ve had enough time to accumulate just the right balance between acid and sugar. “For much of France, there have been times when it’s difficult to get the exact harvest date growers want because the climate wasn’t warm enough that year. But climate change means the grapes are maturing faster.” In the past, early wine grape harvests have always required both above-average air temperatures and the added kick of a late-season drought, leading to warmer, drier soils and rapidly-maturing grapes. Prior to the 1980s, droughts were necessary for early harvests - without them, vineyards could not quite get hot enough. Since then, overall air warming alone has pushed summer temperatures over the early harvest threshold, the research shows. Throughout the 20th century France warmed by about 1.5C, and the upward climb has continued. Lead author Dr Benjamin Cook, of the US space agency Nasa’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies and Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, said: “Now, it’s become so warm thanks to climate change, grape growers don’t need drought to get these very warm temperatures. “After 1980, the drought signal effectively disappears. That means there’s been a fundamental shift in the large-scale climate under which other, local factors operate.” The wine-growing regions affected included some familiar names, among them Alsace, Champagne, Burgundy and Languedoc. Vineyards in these areas grow finicky pinot noirs, chardonnays and other varieties that thrive within specific climate niches and are especially good when they can be harvested early. “So far, a good year is a hot year,” said Wolkovich. But she pointed out that a foretaste of what might be to come occurred in 2003 when a searing heat wave led to the earliest French grape harvest ever recorded. In that year, grapes were picked a full month ahead of their usual time. However, the wines they produced were mediocre. Wolkovich added: “That may be a good indicator of where we’re headed. If we keep pushing the heat up, vineyards can’t maintain that forever.” Across the world, experts have found that each 1C of warming brings grape harvests forward roughly six or seven days. A 2011 study led by Dr Yves Tourre, from the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, suggested that a combination of natural climate variability and human-induced warming could force pinot noir grapes out of many parts of Burgundy. Other reports indicated that Bordeaux might lose its cabernets and merlots. One controversial study published in 2013 predicted that by 2050 some two-thirds of today’s wine regions may no longer have climates suitable for the grapes they now grow. As the world gets hotter, famous-name wine grapes might find unlikely new homes, possibly even making southern England the new Champagne region, according to some experts."
"A record expanse of Arctic sea never froze over this winter and remained open water as a season of freakishly high temperatures produced deep – and likely irreversible – changes on the far north. Scientists at the National Snow and Ice Data Centre said on Monday that the sea ice cover attained an average maximum extent of 14.52m sq km (5.607m sq miles) on 24 March, the lowest winter maximum since records began in 1979.  The low beats a record set only last year of 14.54m sq km (5.612m sq miles), reached on 25 February 2015.  “I’ve never seen such a warm, crazy winter in the Arctic,” said NSIDC director Mark Serreze. “The heat was relentless.” It was the third straight month of record lows in the sea ice cover, after extreme temperatures in January and February stunned scientists. The winter months of utter darkness and extreme cold are typically the time of maximum growth in the ice cap, until it begins its seasonal decline in spring. With the ice cover down to 14.54m sq km, scientists now believe the Arctic is locked onto a course of continually shrinking sea ice – and that is before the 2016 melt season gets underway. “If we are starting out very low that gives a jump on the melt season,” said Rick Thoman, the climate science manager for the National Weather Service’s Alaska region.  “For the last few years, we have had extremely low ice cover in the summer. That means a lot more solar energy absorbed by the darker open water. That heat tends to carry over from year to year.” After this winter’s record ice lows, scientists now expect more than ever that the Arctic will be entirely ice-free in the summer months within 20 or 25 years. “Sometime in the 2030s or 2040s time frame, at least for a few days, you won’t have ice out there in the dead of summer,” said Dr John Walsh, chief scientist of the International Arctic Research Centre.  Those changes are already evident on the ground. In 1975, there were only a few days a year when ships could move from Barrow to Prudhoe Bay off the north coast of Alaska. Now that window lasts months.  The Arctic will always have ice in the winter months, Walsh said. But it will be thinner and more fragile than the multi-year ice, and less reliable for indigenous peoples who rely on the ice as winter transport routes or hunting platforms. “It’s not just about how many hundreds of thousands of square kilometres covered by the ice. It’s about the quality of that ice,” Thoman said. The extent of ice cover is a critical indicator of the changes taking place in the Arctic – but the shrinking of the polar ice carries sweeping consequences for lower latitudes as well.  The bright white snow-covered ice reflects about 85% of sunlight back into the atmosphere, compared to the dark surfaces of the open water which absorb most of the heat energy. “Basically the polar regions are the refrigerator for the Earth,” said Dr Donald Perovich, a researcher at Dartmouth University. “They are extremely important for being able to keep the Arctic colder, and in turn help keep the rest of the planet colder.” Since 1980, however, the summer sea ice cover over the Arctic has gone into a drastic decline, from 7.8m sq km to 4.4m sq km in 2012, before rebounding slightly. “It would be as if the entire United States east of the Mississippi melted away plus the states from Minnesota down to Louisiana, past North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas and Oklahoma. It’s huge,” Perovich said.   This winter scientists said the Arctic freeze stalled early on, across the polar seas. The sea ice extent was exceptionally low both in the Barents and the Bering seas – which in past years has been one of the most prolific producers of ice. And it was thinner, especially in the Beaufort sea north of Alaska, scientists said. There were a number of causes, in addition to the record high temperatures and carry-over effects of earlier ice loss. The El Niño weather system produced more warming, and the Arctic saw influxes of exceptionally warm water from the Pacific as well as the Atlantic side. In any event, Walsh said it was becoming increasingly clear the Arctic would never return to its previous frozen state, even if there are small gains in ice cover in a single year. “The balance is shifting to the point where we are not going back to the old regime of the 1980s and 1990s,” he said. “Every year has had less ice cover than any summer since 2007. That is nine years in a row that you would call unprecedented. When that happens you have to start thinking that something is going on that is not letting the system go back to where it used to be.”"

"As Alaskans go to the polls in the Democratic caucuses on Saturday, one of the most pressing issues should be what is staring them in the face – or, rather, what isn’t: snow and ice.  “I’m looking out of the window here in Anchorage and I can just see grass instead of snow,” said Andy Moderow, state director of not-for-profit group Alaska Wilderness Action.  Moderow grew up dog-sledding but said record temperatures have effectively wiped out Alaska’s winter, meaning a miserable time for those who enjoy snow sports. “There has basically been no snow on the ground all winter in Anchorage. When I was younger, the Iditarod sled race went from Anchorage to Wasilla but there’s no snow there now.  “The changes are all around us. It’s very rare to have multiple winters like this in a row. When you see ski races not take place, grass instead of snow, villages falling into the oceans, you realise the impacts are real.” But while Alaska is clearly on the melting edge of climate change, this fundamental shift barely registered in the Republican caucus held earlier in March and won by Ted Cruz. Even though Democratic candidates have been more willing to discuss climate change, the topic hasn’t been front and centre ahead of Saturday’s caucus. It is an absence that has been felt in presidential primaries and caucuses across the US, including states that have been ravaged by drought or sea level rise. In a desperate attempt to reverse the lack of environmental focus, a group of Florida mayors begged CNN to quiz Republicans about sea level rise at a debate held in Miami.  In the event, Florida senator Marco Rubio’s response, like those of many of his fellow candidates, was light on science and heavy on equivocation. “I suppose the American media has to shoulder some of the blame,” said Michael Mann, a leading climate scientist. “Both Democratic candidates, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, consistently emphasise climate change as being one of our greatest challenges. “They mention it in nearly every speech they give. So the candidates themselves seem to be doing their part. Yet when American journalists have had an opportunity to question the candidates, in the various debates that have been held for example, the topic is rarely mentioned.” Several factors are tamping down debate over climate change and other environmental issues such as land use, pollution and mining. One is a lack of disagreement between candidates within the parties; another is the feeling that despite record numbers of Americans believing climate change is human-caused and a looming problem, it will not drive voters to the polls in a panic. “For most Americans, climate change is not a crisis,” said Bill Schneider, a veteran political analyst who has covered every presidential election since 1976. “Terrorist attacks and Isis are closer to crises.  “Unless a problem becomes a crisis, most Americans don’t want to talk or think about it. The only way our country deals with problems is when they become absolutely critical, that’s the way the government is set up. Everything gets blocked otherwise. “If the city of Miami became hopelessly flooded, maybe it would be an issue. But, like many elections, long-term issues take a back seat. Remember Ebola? It’s not an issue. It’s now Zika. Politics is a short-term game.” Republican candidates have generally avoided climate change or called the science behind it “bullshit” or a “religion”. Even the Ohio governor, John Kasich, who accepts the world is warming due to human activity, has steered clear of the topic, seemingly out of a sense of political self-preservation. Kasich recently admitted his lack of climate denialism was “apostasy” within the current Republican party. But even Clinton and Sanders, who both advocate sharp reductions in greenhouse gases and the phasing out of fossil fuels, rarely lead on the issue of climate. “They want to reassure liberal Democrats that they are thinking about it, but then Sanders instantly changes the topic to inequality and Hillary switches to terrorism,” Schneider said.  “They talk about what they want to talk about. If she’s the nominee, Clinton will talk about climate change, but not too much because it may hurt her in parts of the country reliant on the auto industry or coal.  “Democrats say climate change is a serious problem, much like Republicans say the national debt is a problem. But neither are seen as a crisis. When Republicans are asked if they will cut programs and raise taxes to deal with the debt, they won’t do it. Climate change is the same. There’s not an immediate requirement to deal with it.” Much like everything in this election, the spectre of Donald Trump looms large. Last week, the Republican frontrunner said: “I am not a great believer in manmade climate change. I’m not a great believer.”  To now customary bemusement, he added: “I think our biggest form of climate change we should worry about is nuclear weapons.” Trump’s denial of the science – he regularly conflates climate with the weather – has helped suck oxygen out of the issue. “With Trump being the dominant news story, it’s hard to hear anything about any of the Democratic priorities,” said Professor Christopher Anderson, a climate scientist at Iowa State University who was part of an effort to get the issue on the political radar ahead of the state’s curtain-raising caucuses. “In years to come, 2016 will be called the Trump election, all about him,” Schneider said. “He’s driving the Republican race and he’s also driving the Democratic race.” While the spectacular rise of Trump will live long in the memory, future generations may well be astonished that climate change wasn’t top of the agenda when Americans took to the polls after the world’s warmest year on record, with parts of the country in their worst drought in 1,200 years and millions of people at risk of being swamped by ballooning sea level increases. “I think historians will be befuddled by the fact that the greatest challenge we face as a civilization was all but ignored by the media and political class,” said Mann.  “But give the two Democratic candidates their due credit. They’re trying.”"
"Australia’s former treasurer Joe Hockey has weighed into the debate about cuts to climate research at CSIRO, by writing a letter to the New York Times. In February, CSIRO chief executive Larry Marshall announced the agency would halve its commitment to climate change modelling and measurement.  In his new role as Australia’s ambassador to the US, Hockey took umbrage at an editorial the newspaper published, titled “Australia turns its back on climate science”. But in defending Australia’s role, he appears to shine a light on budget cuts he made while treasurer, which are now considered partly to blame for the cuts CSIRO’s chief executive has made. His first line of defence in the letter is to point out that there continues to be funding for climate science under the National Environmental Science Program, commonly referred to as Nesp. Hockey created Nesp in his now notorious 2014-2015 budget. But rather than boosting climate science, it was a budget-saving measure. Nesp was created by amalgamating two other programs and cutting $21.7m in the process. This fact was raised in a recent Senate inquiry, which examined the cuts. World-leading CSIRO climate scientist John Church told the Senate in most research programs CSIRO is required to match the funding they receive with revenue from external “clients”. But often that client is the government, with money coming from funding programs. Church said that since CSIRO relied on external funding streams, and the government had shrunk those streams for climate science, it was predictable that CSIRO would move away from conducting climate science research. “Effectively, at this time we were in a weak position in terms of external earnings,” he said. In his letter, Hockey also said the Australian Antarctic Division and the Bureau of Meteorology would continue to conduct the sort of work that was being cut at CSIRO. Let’s look at the Australian Antarctic Division first. The chief scientist of the Australian Antarctic Division, Gwen Fenton, told a Senate inquiry that about a quarter of their programs rely on the CSIRO in some capacity, and that if CSIRO programs were cut, that would affect their research. Fenton couldn’t quantify the effect, since no details of the cuts have yet been announced. “It is hard to know exactly,” she said. “It is hard to conclude that reducing the number of people overall would not reduce the total capability. It is the capability we need in the program.” Then Hockey mentioned the Bureau of Meteorology. That’s the bureau that was not told about the cuts more than 24 hours before they were publicly announced. In that hearing, head of the BoM, Rob Vertessy, said there were several joint programs between the two programs and it wasn’t clear yet which would be affected. “I am drawing attention to several areas where we are working together, where we are dependent on CSIRO collaboration, and which could be impacted. There are many areas, and it will depend on which of those areas are actually changed.” Hockey’s next line was to point out that Australia is “renowned in international climate change forums for contributing a uniquely southern hemisphere perspective”. It is the loss of that very reputation – and indeed capability – that has troubled climate scientists in Australia and abroad. The CSIRO has revealed it is trying to strike a deal with the UK’s Met Office to move its unique and highly regarded climate model there, where it is unlikely to get the continued focus on southern hemisphere climate science. In terms of international reputation, Church told the Senate inquiry it was “already trashed”. Finally, Hockey says “Australia will continue to meet its international climate change obligations and commitments, including those made in the Paris agreement”. Indeed, Australia’s Climate Council – the reincarnation of the formerly government-run Climate Commission, which Hockey and his government axed – declared in a report that the cuts to climate research at the CSIRO were already in breach of that agreement."
"A third woman has claimed she was sexually harassed by the former head of the UN climate change panel, Rajendra Pachauri, who is charged with sexually harassing, stalking and intimidating a female employee. The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said on Thursday she had decided to make a public statement after reading an article in the Observer in which Pachauri denied the allegations against him claiming his email account had been hacked and the claims were a conspiracy to defame him.  Pachauri, 75, former chair of the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), was formally charged this month, a year after a 29-year-old former employee filed a police report against him. She had worked at The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), which was led by Pachauri. A second female employee has also filed a police report against Pachauri. Pachauri, stepped down in February last year as head of the IPCC, which was awarded the Nobel peace prize in 2007 under his chairmanship. The third woman who has now come forward, who is not an Indian national, said she was 19 when she worked at the New Delhi branch of TERI in 2008. In a statement, she said she believed Pachauri’s claim that his computer was hacked was “totally false” and that his counter allegations were “right in line with his character”. She said she had begun feeling uncomfortable around Pachauri as he “would put his hands on my waist repeated times, he would hug me longer than felt comfortable, [and] kissed me on the cheek”. On one occasion, she said, Pachauri went to her home. “I actually was sick and could not come to the office. He then came to my home with a bouquet of roses. This might sound sweet, but at that time I just felt uncomfortable and scared. He would call me during non-working hours and holidays to ask me to come to his office and when arriving it became evident that he had no specific task for me. Pachauri would indulge in frivolous talk and try to get close to me.” The breaking point came, she claimed, when Pachauri invited her to his summer home, making it clear they would be alone and that his wife was out of town. “At this point, I felt genuinely scared of what his motives for inviting me over were, and I decided to speak out and set a firm limit,” she said. She requested a move to another department but was still summoned to Pachauri’s office from time to time. She said that despite making it clear she did not want to be around himhe told her that her contract would be terminated early. When she left New Delhi, she had only completed four months of her one-year contract. “When he terminated my contract, I did not think there was any point in contesting it, as from my conversations with former employees at TERI I had gotten the feeling that it would be of little use trying to challenge any decision of Pachauri’s,” she said. “I also felt very relieved that I would not have to face Pachauri’s sexual harassment any longer.” Pachauri faces trial next month over charges relating to the first woman. It is claimed that in emails, texts and WhatsApp messages, he professed his love for her. One message allegedly read: “I will go on a fast after a cricket match … I will break the fast only when you believe I love you with sincerity and unfathomable depth.” According to a report in the Economic Times, an internal committee appointed by TERI found that “Pachauri’s conduct amounted to misuse of his position and violation of the organisation’s policy on sexual harassment”. The second claimant’s statement was registered with the police last year, but was not included in the final charge sheet filed by the police against Pachauri. The woman who has now come forward said she could “very much relate” to the allegations about Pachauri made by the other two women and was surprised to see the claims of hacking which Pachauri made. Vrinda Grover, a lawyer representing two of the women who have made statements against Pachauri, said: “There are many, many, women who don’t speak out because they see what the women who do go public face. They see that she has to face hostility, severe harassment, she loses her job, she’s maligned and defamed as though she’s part of a larger conspiracy.”"
"Last week, the Democratic and Republican presidential candidates participated in debates in Florida. A bipartisan group of 21 Florida mayors wrote to the debate moderators to argue it would be “unconscionable for these issues of grave concern for the people of Florida [climate change and sea level rise] to not be addressed.” The moderators of both debates listened, and asked the candidates questions about climate change – including by far the most substantive climate question posed to the Republican candidates thus far.  The climate discussion in the Democratic debate can be viewed in the video below. In her response (transcript available here), Hillary Clinton said that she would proceed with implementing President Obama’s Clean Power Plan, and his executive actions on climate change. She supported the use of natural gas as a “bridge fuel,” arguing: We need to implement all of the president’s executive actions and quickly move to make a bridge from coal to natural gas to clean energy Clinton also argued that Sanders would delay implementation of the Clean Power Plan – a statement to which Sanders reacted incredulously, and which PolitiFact rated false. However, Sanders does want to tweak the Clean Power Plan to make it tougher (for example, to incentivize renewables instead of natural gas, extend renewable tax credits to 2030, and to regulate methane emissions); it’s true that these changes could significantly delay implementation of the plan, but they would also strengthen it. In his response to the climate question, Sanders noted that in 2013 he introduced what he described as “the most comprehensive climate change legislation in the history of the United States.” Sanders also called for a carbon tax and regulations to end fracking in the United States. There’s a debate amongst climate scientists about whether natural gas is a viable ‘bridge fuel’ between fossil fuels and renewables. At best, natural gas releases half the carbon pollution as burning coal. However, the amount of methane leakage during natural gas extraction is a big question mark that could erase most of its climate benefits.  The other issue is that power plants have long lifespans, so choosing to install natural gas instead of a lower-carbon power source locks in its emissions for decades. Research by Zeke Hausfather and others has shown that for these reasons, using natural gas as a ‘bridge fuel’ could make it easier to keep global warming at less than 3°C above pre-industrial temperatures, but harder to stay below the internationally-accepted 2°C target. Essentially, natural gas replacing coal power is an improvement. But if a coal power plant can be replaced by renewables or other low-carbon sources, that’s a much better solution. If fracking makes natural gas so cheap that it crowds out deployment of renewables, it could do more harm than good. It’s a difficult question worthy of debate, although the balance of evidence suggests that we should rely on natural gas as little as possible (fracking also causes other environmental problems). It’s a debate that in large part can be solved by putting a price on carbon emissions, like the carbon tax that Sanders proposed. That would make energy prices reflect their true costs, including the costs of the damages they cause via climate change. A carbon price would make coal expensive, and could potentially make renewables cheaper than natural gas.  Marco Rubio gave the worst answer to a climate question in either debate.  It was similar to the boilerplate response he gave in a previous Republican presidential debate. For example, he claimed that President Obama’s Clean Power Plan and every climate policy proposed by Democrats would cripple the economy, kill jobs, and make energy bill soar. However, studies have shown that carbon pollution pricing would have a minimal, potentially even modestly beneficial impact on the economy if the revenue is returned to taxpayers. Sanders’ proposal takes this approach, refunding 60% of the revenue generated from the carbon tax directly back to Americans. On the other hand, failing to take action to slow climate change would have immense costs, which is why Florida’s mayors are so concerned. According to a study by scientists at Climate Central,  2120 square miles of land lie less than 3 feet above the high tide line in Florida. Some $145 billion in property value, and 300,000 homes, sit on that land. These figures jump to $544 billion and 1.4 million homes on 4660 square miles of land under 6 feet. Every inch of sea level rise within these ranges will be more damaging than the previous inch. Rubio also argued that America can’t slow global warming by itself, placing the blame on China and India. However, virtually every country in the world agreed to cut carbon pollution as a result of the Paris climate negotiations, including the United States, China, and India. In fact, while Rubio made comments about President Obama waging a war on coal, in reality China has been waging a fierce war on coal, and winning.  Implementing dog-whistle politics to appeal to those in climate denial, Rubio used the popular ‘climate always changes’ logical fallacy, followed by the argument that, If there is higher sea levels, or whatever it may be happening, we do need to deal with that through mitigation, and I have long supported mitigation efforts. But as far as a law that we can pass in Washington to change the weather, there is no such thing. Of course, the only way we can mitigate the rising, accelerating sea levels that are causing flooding in Florida is by cutting the carbon pollution that’s causing it. That’s going to require the kinds of policies that Rubio opposes. Fortunately, John Kasich followed Rubio with the most sensible climate-related comments made by a top 2016 Republican presidential candidate. Kasich noted that humans contribute to climate change, and that we can cut carbon pollution in an economically beneficial way. He had his own climate denial dog whistle, saying we don’t know how much humans contribute to climate change (in reality, we know humans are the dominant cause of global warming over the past 50–100 years). However, Kasich is one of the few leading Republicans, and the party’s only remaining presidential candidate who supports taking some sort of action to solve the problem. He concluded his answer with an important argument directly contradicting Rubio’s economic alarmism: The fact is that you can have a strong environmental policy at the same time that you have strong economic growth; they are not inconsistent with one another. Donald Trump and Ted Cruz weren’t asked about climate change in this debate, but Trump has repeatedly called it a hoax, and Cruz is in denial. Rubio repeated his standard argument that we shouldn’t do anything to cut carbon pollution because it would be too expensive, and in practice, denying the solutions isn’t much better than denying the problem. Kasich refuted that argument by noting that good policies can result in a clean environment and strong economy. Clinton and Sanders had a more substantive debate on the issue, raising specific policies about fracking, natural gas as a bridge fuel, and carbon pollution pricing. Consistent with their stances on most issues, Clinton took what she views as a more pragmatic approach (maintain and protect existing climate policies), while Sanders promoted a more idealistic view of strengthening current policies and introducing stricter new ones. One of these candidates will be the next President of the United States. After more than a decade of foot-dragging and international obstructionism, America has finally become a leader on climate change, including reaching a critical agreement China, and recently joining forces with Canadian PM Justin Trudeau.  In the wake of the landmark international climate agreement in Paris, we’re finally moving in the right direction to tackle climate change. The choice of the next American president will be a critical one in either maintaining this momentum, or in steering the world toward climate destabilization."

"In December, David Cameron joined 195 other leaders to promise ambitious action on climate change. Achieving the Paris goals requires leaving most of the world’s fossil fuel reserves in the ground. A first step must be to stop subsidising fossil fuel production. Wednesday’s budget is an acid test of the government’s Paris commitment. In last year’s budget, the chancellor gave £1.3bn in new tax breaks and direct funding to the oil industry. The UK Treasury receives a smaller share of oil revenues than most other comparable countries. Meanwhile, the government has exempted a whole new fossil-fuel industry – fracking – from half of its tax, despite huge local opposition wherever it is proposed. The government has slashed support for wind and solar energy, costing thousands of jobs. Yet its free-market rationale does not apply when it comes to the oil and gas industry, which has received continued government support even in times of super-normal profits. The chancellor has to change course. He should scrap subsidies that keep the British economy hooked on fossil fuels, and instead set out a strategy to help communities currently dependent on fossil fuel jobs to diversify and to rebuild around world-leading clean technology.Craig Bennett CEO, Friends of the Earth, England, Wales & Northern Ireland Marc Stears Chief executive, New Economics FoundationElizabeth Bast Acting executive director, Oil Change InternationalPeter Wooders Programme leader, Global Subsidies Initiative, International Institute for Sustainable Development Mika Minio-Paluello Coordinator, Platform  • In your article on the alarming rise in global temperatures, you quote Professor Rahmstorf from the Potsdam Institute of Climate Impact Research, who said that “we are in a kind of climate emergency now” (February global temperature ‘shockingly’ high, say scientists, 15 March). He is, of course, correct, and so we urgently need to implement an effective response. The obvious way to do this would be to cut global greenhouse emissions now, but electorates are still utterly unwilling to accept the radical lifestyle changes we need to achieve this. No western government would dare double petrol prices or remove our ability to repeatedly fly abroad for holidays. No developing-country leaders are going to tell their people they can never have a western lifestyle. The only politically feasible solutions are technological ones, such as carbon scrubbing and geoengineering. Therefore, David Cameron and other world leaders need to start making a massive investment in those areas now, possibly funded by an international financial transactions tax. Otherwise, we do face disaster.Richard MountfordTonbridge, Kent • The chief executive of the Road Haulage Association (Budget 2016: Osborne to cut an extra £4bn, 14 March) is guilty of some very selective arithmetic. If an RPI increase in fuel duty represents an increase of £450 per truck per year, then the 40p drop in fuel prices we have enjoyed over the last few years represents a decrease of £24,000 per truck. I wonder how many hauliers have reduced their prices to reflect this. The low fuel prices are a heaven-sent opportunity for the chancellor to raise some serious revenue. If the RPI 0.75p rise would bring in £345.5m, then a 20p rise could raise over £9bn with motorists and hauliers still better off than when prices reached their peak. That would save a great deal of pain elsewhere in the economy.Keith PotterGunnislake, Cornwall • The proposed CMA reforms in the gas and electricity distribution sector are a grave disappointment (Report, 11 March); its intention to “enable competition to grow further” may be misguided. We don’t need another layer of expensive administration the costs of which will inevitably be passed on to consumers. And it will take too long to implement. Since nationalisation, this industry has lost its moral compass and become more concerned with maximising shareholder profit than providing a minimal cost reliable service. The intention of encouraging consumers to migrate to cheaper deals is admirable, but it is optimistic to believe that this will lead to lower overall costs rather than merely redistributing the same total billing charges over the same customers. Would it not have been simpler, easier and quicker to make each major supplier improve the lot of their own existing customers that have been on a standard variable tariff (SVT) for say more than two years by moving them on to that company’s best fixed one-year tariff? The suppliers could be mandated to make this move within six months and to maintain such customers on a similarly priced fixed tariff for at least four further years. The current practice of migrating customers at the termination of a fixed price period on to a SVT unless the customer makes an effort to stay on a better tariff should be banned. The default should be to move them to another reasonably priced term tariff.Iain Oldcorn Ascot, Berkshire • It has been said that the Hinkley Point imbroglio has led to a missed opportunity to install the equivalent capacity over the period up to 2024, probably at lower cost as with power actually becoming steadily available over the construction period (Hinkley Point is a costly mistake, but only France can pull the plug, 14 March). As it happens, the current cost per megawatt of providing wind and solar power is about the same as that for building Hinkley Point. But as the sale price for Hinkley Point output is inflation-proofed by the government up to 2092, wind and solar power are certain to continue coming down from today’s prices. It is of course true that wind and solar cannot be relied on for continuous electricity in all weather conditions. But nuclear power has consistently failed to function at the levels of baseload for which it has been designed. And that also requires back-up reserve plants, thus improving the relative performance of the alternative fuels. Wind and solar power consume fuel that is cost-free, and therefore uses 100% of its potential, whereas nuclear and fossil power wastes about a third of its fuel. They also lose a large proportion of the remaining two thirds in transmission costs from generating plants over long distance to connect with the grid. Wind and solar power coming from smaller generating plants can and should be connected to local networks and will therefore be able to reduce losses in transmission. This will also reduce the length, cost and viability of any new pylon lines. Thus, had we committed ourselves to a 10-year programme of non-nuclear electricity, we would have achieved a steady increase in output and eliminated the risk of the lights going out with the stubborn persistence in choosing Hinkley Point.Harvey ColeWinchester, Hampshire • In his article on Hinkley Point, your journalist writes “business solutions are often described as zero-sum, or win-win”. In fact, zero-sum (+1 -1) means the opposite: one winner, one loser.Professor Brian VickersLondon  • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com"

"Falling coal use in China and the US and a worldwide shift towards renewable energy have kept greenhouse gas emissions level for a second year running, one of the world’s leading energy analysts has said. Preliminary data for 2015 from the International Energy Agency (IEA) showed that carbon dioxide emissions from the energy sector have levelled off at 32.1bn tonnes even as the global economy grew over 3% . Electricity generated by renewable sources played a critical role, having accounted for around 90% of new electricity generation in 2015. Wind power produced more than half of all new electricity generation, said the IEA.  The figures are significant because they prove to traditionally sceptical treasuries that it is possible to grow economies without increasing climate emissions.  “The new figures confirm last year’s surprising but welcome news: we now have seen two straight years of greenhouse gas emissions decoupling from economic growth. Coming just a few months after the landmark COP21 agreement in Paris, this is yet another boost to the global fight against climate changem” said IEA director, Fatih Birol. The two largest emitters, China and the US, both reduced energy-related emmisions in 2015. In China, they declined 1.5%, as coal use dropped for the second year running and in the US they declined 2%, as a large switch from coal to natural gas use in electricity generation took place. However, these declines were offset by increasing emissions in most other Asian developing economies and the Middle East, said the IEA. In the 40 years in which the IEA has reported on CO2 emissions, there have been only four short periods in which emissions stood still or fell compared to the previous year. Three of those — the early 1980s, 1992 and 2009 — came in periods of economic crisis.  But the new stall in emissions comes amid economic expansion. According to the International Monetary Fund, global GDP grew by 3.4% in 2014 and 3.1% in 2015. “When the IEA said last year that global emissions had stalled whilst economic growth had continued, they understandably sounded a note of caution; was this a one-off, or the start of something major?” said Richard Black, director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU). “The sense of excitement as they report similar findings this year therefore is palpable, because in essence they’re showing that combating climate change is perfectly compatible with continuing economic growth, and that’s hugely significant,” said Black.  A seperate report by the European Environment agency (EEA) shows that the EU-wide share of renewable energy has increased from 14.3% in 2012 to 15% in 2013. This allowed the EU to cut its demand for fossil fuels by 110m tonnes of oil equivalent in 2013. This, said the EEA, is the equivalent of a gross reduction of CO2 emissions of 362m tonnes in 2013."
"The use of private email by senior staff to discuss job cuts at the CSIRO “looks like dubious administration” and may be a breach of its code of conduct, the Senate clerk has said. The assessment has prompted the Senate committee examining CSIRO job cuts to signal it will ask the auditor general to investigate senior officers’ use of private email. On Friday, Peter Craig, the director of the CSIRO’s weather research collaboration with the bureau of meteorology, told a Senate committee at least seven people in the CSIRO’s ocean and atmosphere division had used private emails to discuss job cuts because they were directed to do so. In response to a question on notice he added that it was the oceans and atmosphere division director, Ken Lee, and the deputy director, Andreas Schiller, who had given the verbal direction on 28 November. The CSIRO claimed it was meeting record-keeping obligations despite use of private email because it would ensure the emails were entered into its system. In a letter released on Thursday, the Senate clerk, Rosemary Laing, wrote to the Senate committee investigating CSIRO cuts raising concerns about the propriety of using private emails, even if later entered into records. “Although this subsequent ‘capture’ of the records originally conveyed by private email may not be contrary to the requirements of the Archives Act (or national security), it looks like dubious administration and may be a breach of the organisation’s code of conduct by senior staff,” she said. The code states CSIRO staff must maintain “complete, reliable and accurate records of the performance of your work-related decisions and activities” and “ensure the proper storage of, and access to, records, including the confidentiality and security of information”. Laing said: “Furthermore, it has understandably led to concerns that it may create difficulties for the Senate or its committees to seek information.” The Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson, chair of the Senate budget scrutiny committee, raised that concern at its 8 February hearing. He said “clearly, if private emails have been used, it is going to be very difficult for us to access information” about an executive meeting that decided to make 350 positions redundant.  “It is very concerning that there is no transparency around this if private emails have been used.” On Wednesday, Whish-Wilson told the Senate full production of documents was needed to assess CSIRO’s restructure and reprioritisation and “to reverse these cuts to the best climate scientists in the world and to increase funding to this critical area of public good science”. The opposition’s innovation, industry and science spokesman, Kim Carr, told Guardian Australia he was “deeply concerned that there is a case to answer as to why CSIRO staff were directed to use private emails”. He said this arguably breached two record-keeping laws and the CSIRO code of conduct. “Given the Senate clerk’s assessment that this action is ‘dubious administration’ the Senate committee will now seek to have the auditor general investigate the matter.” Carr said: “There are still serious questions of public-sector administration that CSIRO needs to answer.  “How many people were involved? Who issued the directive? What access was there by third parties? How can we be certain the information has been returned to the CSIRO and is secure?” CSIRO denied there was a directive to use private emails. At an earlier Senate committee hearing Alex Wonhas, the CSIRO’s environment, energy and resources executive director, said private emails were used to plan job cuts to ensure “information stays within a small group of people to not cause distress and concern among staff”. On Wednesday the cabinet secretary, Arthur Sinodinos, told the Senate he had advice from the attorney general’s office and finance department that CSIRO officials had not breached their obligations. “CSIRO senior staff have been reminded of the policy regarding the private use of emails,” he said. “If there are further concerns, these are best raised directly with the CSIRO, who are an independent authority with full responsibility for these matters.” "
"The mayor of Miami Beach, one of the US cities most vulnerable to sea level rise, has criticized Marco Rubio after the presidential hopeful said that it’s not possible to “change the weather” or the rising oceans through government regulation. Asked if he accepted the reality of human-induced climate change, Rubio, a US senator for Florida and running for his party’s presidential nomination, said: “If the climate is changing, one of the reasons is because the climate has always been changing.”  Speaking at the Republication presidential debate in Miami on Thursday, Rubio said the flooding experienced by Miami is due to the the city “largely built on land that was once a swamp”. “And number two, because if there is higher sea levels or whatever it may be happening, we do need to deal with that through mitigation,” he told the CNN event.  “And I have long supported mitigation efforts. But as far as a law that we can pass in Washington to change the weather, there’s no such thing.” Rubio, who is badly trailing Donald Trump in the race to be the Republication nominee, said Barack Obama’s clean power plan, aimed at slashing greenhouse gas emissions, would “devastate” the American economy, all while other countries continued to pump out planet-warming gases. “If you took the gift list of all of these groups that are asking us to pass these laws and did every single one of them, there would be no change in our environment,” he said. “Sea level would still rise. All these other things that are happening would continue to go on for a lot of different reasons. “One, because America is not a planet. It’s a country. And number two, because these other countries like India and China are more than making up in carbon emissions for whatever we could possibly cut.” Tomas Regalado, the Republican mayor of Miami, has endorsed Rubio but via the debate’s host Jake Tapper he questioned whether the senator accepted the mainstream scientific position on climate change and his commitment to combat the problem. Rubio said Regalado is a “great mayor and a good friend” but said that any laws to reduce emissions would drive up power bills in Miami and cause the mayor a political headache. Philip Levine, mayor of neighboring Miami Beach, said Rubio was “100% using the language of a climate change denier” and has overlooked the escalating problem of sea level increases for south Florida. Miami Beach has already spent $100m on new sea defenses to curb the regular flooding of its western half. Sea levels are expected to rise in south-east Florida by six to 10 inches by 2030, with ever increasing levels throughout the century unless greenhouse gases are severely cut. These increases risk inundating large areas of the region, with 2.4 million people living within 4ft of the local high tide line. “Unfortunately, Senator Rubio went to his usual talking points, fed to him by his donors in the sugar and energy industry,” said Levine. “According to him, America shouldn’t be a leader in the greatest challenge of our generation. If he were around during World War II, he’d want us to sit on the sidelines and leave Britain to its fate. “He made the amazing statement that America is not a planet. I’m sure he had to go onto Wikipedia to get that information. He said he’s all for making cities resilient but he’s done absolutely nothing as a US senator for us, he’s never come to Miami Beach to meet with us. The only time he comes down here is for a fundraiser.” Levine said he was more impressed by Ohio governor John Kasich, who said he accepts the science of climate change, but that he was disappointed that the other candidates, Trump and Ted Cruz, weren’t also asked about climate change. A coalition of 21 Florida mayors wrote to the networks broadcasting the two Miami debates this week – the Democratic debate was on Wednesday – to demand that questions were put over sea level rise and climate change. The US experienced its warmest year on record in 2015, with the lower 48 states emerging from the warmest winter on record this year. The leading Republican presidential candidates have pledged to scrap Obama’s plan to limit emissions from power plants and have criticized the landmark Paris climate deal, which committed 196 nations, including the US, to cut emissions."

"Hundreds of academics and other staff at the Australian National University have called on the university to divest completely from fossil fuels, in an open letter addressed to the ANU council.  In 2014, under the previous vice chancellor, ANU divested from seven resource companies, selling about $16m worth of shares. The move attracted a torrent of criticism in editorials in the Australian financial press, and even the country’s treasurer at the time, Joe Hockey, weighed in, describing ANU as “removed from the reality of what is helping to drive the Australian economy and create more employment”. The new letter, signed by 450 academics and general staff, commends the university for withstanding that pressure, and calls on it to divest all its holdings in fossil fuel companies, which it estimates to be over $45m. The university’s vice chancellor responded, welcoming the petition and promising to consider its argument at the next relevant meeting. A spokesman for 350.org, which helped organise the open letter, said it was the second largest such letter in the world, after one organised at the University of California, which led to a significant divestment by the university in September last year. When ANU divested from the seven resource companies in 2014, the then vice-chancellor Ian Young said, “We need to be able to put our hand on our heart when we talk to our students and to our alumni and to our researchers and be able to say that we’re confident that the sort of companies that we’re investing in are consistent with the broad themes that drive this university.” The current vice-chancellor of ANU, physicist and nobel laureate Brian Schmidt, described climate change as “the great challenge for humanity over the next 100 years” and said that to keep warming below 2C, “citizens of the world need to demand it.” Picking up on that call, the open letter said: “As citizens of this university, we demand the ANU take leadership on this issue. This includes fully breaking ties with the fossil fuel industry – the ANU must divest the rest.” Fossil Free ANU spokesperson and ANU student Zoe Neumayer said staff wanted to send a strong message to Schmidt. “This letter sends Prof Schmidt and the ANU Council a message they can’t ignore. ANU staff want their university to move beyond its first step and divest in full from fossil fuels.” “As Brian Schmidt faces up to his new job, he must make sure ANU faces up to the scale of the climate challenge – and that means divesting from the fossil fuel companies that are holding back progress.” The campaign was facilitated by 350.org, which has led divestment campaigns around the world. In September 2015 the University of California divested from coal and tar sands. In November, just ahead of the Paris climate change negotiations, 10 universities in the UK pledged to divest from fossil fuels. Those moves follow others from universities including Syracuse University and Glasgow University, as well as many other organisations around the world. Schmidt said in response to the petition: “Decisions on investments are matters for the ANU council, of which I am a member. The council has to balance both its fiduciary responsibilities to provide the funds for students and staff needs, such as superannuation payments and student scholarships, with that of socially responsible investments. It is a complex issue, and both the council and I welcome the views of staff and students. The letter will be tabled at council.”"
"Flights from Britain to the US could take longer in future because of climate change. The jet stream is expected to become more powerful as the climate warms, and that means flights to America battling against fiercer headwinds. Flights from New York to London, on the other hand, will probably speed up as they ride on the faster jet stream, although this won’t balance the slower flights and a round trip will still be longer. That means more fuel used by the aircraft, more air pollution and possibly higher fares, according to researchers at the University of Reading in a study published in the journal “Environmental Research Letters”.  And the effect of a powerful jet stream was brought home in a remarkable flight in January last year, when a British Airways flight from New York to London reached 745mph, near supersonic speed, by riding on an exceptionally fast jet stream of around 250mph. Airlines face other troubles as the climate warms. Planes taking off in hot weather need to reach higher speeds, because warm air is less dense than cold air. That means aircraft having to travel lighter, with fewer passengers or less cargo. Since 1980, the number of flights forced to cut their loads increased at four airports studied in the US, as average temperatures rose at each location. Alternatively, aircraft will have to use more fuel, but either way it’s likely to mean higher fares. The only other options are more take-offs at night, early mornings or evenings when it’s usually cooler, or building longer runways, none of which is good news."

"English cities and towns left without planned flood defences by government cuts will now get the projects after a surprise £540m boost in funding in Wednesday’s budget.  The north of England, devastated by winter floods, will get at least £150m of the new money, giving better protection for thousands of homes.  The Guardian had revealed that 294 projects in line for funding were left stranded after heavy cuts by David Cameron’s coalition government and exposed a series of places that were later flooded. These included Leeds and Kendal, which were submerged in recent winter storms. Both places will now get new defences. The new funding, plus another £160m over the next five years for maintenance of defences, was delivered despite Cameron having long insisted the government was spending large amounts on flood defences. As recently as January, environment secretary Liz Truss said there was no more money available to protect Leeds. But on Thursday, Truss said: “Thanks to this additional funding, communities across the north will be better protected from the devastating effects of the sort of extreme weather we saw in December. By delivering improved flood defences and looking at what more we can do to slow the flow of flood waters across whole catchments we are doing more than ever before to protect Yorkshire and Cumbria.” The new money, funded by an increase in insurance premium tax, was widely welcomed.  The government had been warned by a series of official bodies that flood risk was rising due to inadequate spending and was costing billions of pounds in damages. Government scientists have long warned that more severe flooding is the greatest impact of climate change in the UK.  “It is obviously good news for those communities affected,” said Mary Creagh MP, chair of the Environmental Audit Committee. “But we knew six years ago that flood defences were needed in York, Leeds, Cumbria and Calderdale. It is tragic it has taken the government so long to wake up to this fact.” “The scale and extent of the floods in December and January showed the gap between the government’s rhetoric and the reality on the ground,” she said. “Osborne had no choice but to act.” Daniel Johns, head of adaptation at the Committee on Climate Change, the government’s official advisers, said: “This is a significant and unexpected boost to flood defence expenditure over the next five years, more than making up for the underinvestment over the last parliament.” He said the rise in maintenance spending was “odd” given that the government had until now claimed there would be no benefit in increasing it.  Johns had called previous government claims of increased spending “essentially meaningless”. But he warned that flood defences are not the whole solution: “In parallel we need to think more strategically about how to manage the landscape and river catchments in ways that hold back and store flood water where it can do least damage.” Leeds suffered flooding in areas that would have had protection from defences that were part of the original 2011 plan. The new money means these defences, north of the railway station and protecting 579 properties, will go ahead with £35m of the £65m total being spent by 2021. Kendal, which had been in line for a £4m scheme, has now got funding. Local MP and Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said. “The scheme has been repeatedly kicked into the long grass. The government is now announcing again that it will provide funding, but what is needed is action not words.” In total, £33m will be spent on new flood defences in Cumbria, including schemes for Appleby, Wigton and Braithwaite. York, hard hit by recent floods, will get £45m for two schemes on the Rivers Foss and Ouse, providing better protection to 3,390 properties. The Calder Valley receives £35m including new schemes at Hebden Bridge and Mytholmroyd. Carlisle will get up to £25m after the Environment Agency has concluded a review of its needs. The remaining £390m of the new flood defence funding is likely to be spent in other parts of the country. The Guardian has revealed projects left unbuilt in flood hit areas by cuts right across the nation, from Somerset to Dawlish in Devon, to Kent and along the Thames Valley. “We have had severe floods almost every year since 2000 and people in almost every part of the country have been affected,” said Paul Cobbing, chief executive of the National Flood Forum, which represents community flood groups. “It is now clear that we need to raise our level of ambition significantly, so whilst this funding is welcome there is a very great deal more that needs to be done, and quickly.” Cobbing said the impact of flooding driven by extreme weather was getting ever greater: “When you look at the scale of the high risk events, it is absolutely phenomenal.” Flood management plans, from defences to avoiding development in floodplains to slowing water flows, all need to be boosted to a level to match the risk, he said: “It’s is a long way from where we are now.” Kerry McCarthy, Labour’s shadow environment secretary, said the government has slashed Environment Agency staff numbers and funding for research and development to improve flood management: “Ministers must drop their complacency over the need for climate change adaptation and develop a long-term strategy for protecting homes, businesses and communities from the risks of increased flooding in the future.” The government is conducting a National Flood Resilience Review to assess how damaging the rise in extreme weather could be and is also considering how to manage river catchments better. Note: In the original version of this article Croston, Lancashire, was mistakenly placed in Yorkshire’s Calder Valley. "

"Leonardo DiCaprio used a Japanese press conference for the Oscar-winning western The Revenant to launch a thinly veiled attack on Donald Trump and other Republican candidates for the US presidency who deny climate change, reports AFP. The actor and environmentalist, in Tokyo to promote the local release of Alejandro G Iñárritu’s 19th century frontier epic, said the next leader of the world’s most powerful nation should not be someone who refused to listen to reason.  “We should not have a candidate who doesn’t believe in modern science to be leading our country,” he said. “Climate change is one of the most concerning issues facing all humanity and the United States needs to do its part.” The two leading Republican candidates for the presidency, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, have both dismissed climate change out of hand. Cruz has referred to it as “pseudo-scientific theory”, while Trump said earlier this week that he was “not a big believer in man-made climate change”. Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, has called climate change denial a “charade”. DiCaprio, who signed a multi-year partnership deal to make green-themed films with Netflix in March last year, also expressed hope that an upcoming documentary about climate change might raise awareness ahead of the November presidential election. “We’ve been travelling around the world documenting climate change,” he said, confirming that film-makers visited China, India and the North and South Poles.  The actor was greeted by hundreds of fans, some dressed as bears in a reference to The Revenant’s key plot line, as he made his first trip to Tokyo in two years to promote the film. He told reporters it was “gratifying and feels fantastic” to have won the best actor prize for his role as fur trapper Hugh Glass, but added: “You hope to remain with your initial ideals and dreams of what you want to be as an actor, and all I can hope for is that I’ll continue to keep trying to make the best movies I possibly can.” Later, DiCaprio told an audience at the Japanese premiere for The Revenant at Roppongi Hills in Tokyo that he was “privileged to be a part of cinema history that I think is very ground breaking”, adding: “It was a huge honour for all of us the night of the Oscars, to be awarded the way we were.”"
"The tiny Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw tribe has called the coastal marshlands of southern Louisiana home ever since their ancestors settled there to avoid forced relocation under the Indian Removal Act of 1830. But the close-knit community of Isle de Jean Charles has grown increasingly fragmented as their island slowly disappears beneath their feet and powerful storms ravage their homes and crops. A potent combination of accelerating sea level rise, salt water intrusion and subsidence of the land has caused devastating erosion and flooding, exacerbated further by regional oil and gas development and the shipping industry. Today, less than a quarter of the original inhabitants still live on the island, which has lost 98% of its landmass since the 1950s. Most inhabitants resettled in nearby parishes, but even the few miles distance have diminished cultural knowledge long nurtured by the relative isolation of island life. As the waters swallowed Isle de Jean Charles decade by decade, the tribe reluctantly began to face the possibility of another relocation. Only this time, they would set the terms. In 2000, they began drafting a plan to resettle on the mainland, in a location that would offer protection from hurricanes and flooding yet allow them to maintain their cultural identity, including access to traditional fishing and agriculture. The plan doesn’t force anyone to leave the island. Some residents say they won’t go, although it’s unclear how much longer their homes will remain standing before the water completely consumes the land. In January, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) awarded $48m for a resettlement plan, part of an initiative to help communities stricken by natural disasters. It makes Isle de Jean Charles one of the first communities in the lower 48 states to undertake a complete relocation due to climate change. HUD, the state and the tribe hope the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw plan will become a model for other tribes and communities facing imminent climate threats. But while the relocation plan and funding are celebrated as an important precedent and possible roadmap for future relocation projects, this level of support isn’t likely to be available to other tribes seeking funding and guidance for climate-related displacement and resettlement. The HUD grant was a one-time award, part of a $1bn Natural Disaster Resiliency Competition. While the agency has other programs for federally-recognized tribes to undertake relocation, they are not intended to cover resettlement of an entire community, says Marion McFadden, deputy assistant secretary of grants at HUD.  Government disaster programs generally support individual, not collective, relocation projects. But this approach doesn’t consider the cultural disruptions that occur when native peoples must relocate in a piecemeal manner, says Julie Maldonado, an anthropologist and lecturer at the University of California, Santa Barbara and a lead author of the 2014 National Climate Assessment chapter on indigenous peoples. In fact, she says, there is no single government entity or framework designated to provide tribes imminently threatened by climate change with support navigating the complex, costly process of community relocation. From Alaska to the Pacific Northwest to the Gulf Coast, hundreds of tribal communities are now grappling with how to protect their safety, economic sustainability and cultural integrity as climate change combines with other social, economic and environmental factors to threaten their way of life. In Oregon and Washington, warming streams and changes in the seasonal water cycle threaten traditional salmon grounds, and coastal tribes like the Tulalip, Swinomish and Hoh also face recurring damage from flooding and sea level rise. In the Southwest, Pueblos like Santo Domingo are altering their traditional irrigation methods in the face of prolonged drought, while some wells and livestock watering holes on the Navajo Nation have gone dry. Meanwhile, Florida’s Seminole and Miccosukee tribes are confronting a future of sea level rise in the Everglades that threatens homes, drinking water and cultural resources. Traditionally, many tribes adapted to weather extremes and seasonal patterns by migrating temporarily. But reservation boundaries and encroaching development make that virtually impossible today, which can prompt urban migration that further weakens connections to traditional culture and community. “Often climate change is impacting people who have already been placed in vulnerable situations, who have already been marginalized and pushed to the fringes,” says Maldonado. “They’ve still been able to adapt and cope and make changes and survive. And what happens is that climate change can act as a kind of a tipping point in that scenario.” Most tribes are opting to adapt by reinforcing existing infrastructure: building seawalls, elevating their homes, combining traditional ecological knowledge and scientific modeling to anticipate how their lands, culture, economy and public services are likely to be affected. But those who make the difficult decision to relocate are entering largely uncharted territory. State and federal programs, where they exist at all, concentrate on disaster relief and rebuilding. There is no clear government funding mechanism to preemptively relocate an entire community or partner with tribal counterparts in the way that HUD and Louisiana are doing with Isle de Jean Charles.  Further complicating matters, many federal programs require applicants to be federally-recognized tribes. For the approximately 400 tribes, including the Biloxi-Chitmacha-Choctaw, that are not officially recognized by the federal government, funding options are much more limited. When Isle de Jean Charles first began exploring avenues to fund their resettlement plan, it soon became a complex patchwork of funding sources, each with its own distinct – and sometimes competing – requirements. “You can apply for a Department of Energy grant for your solar system,” says Chantel Comardelle, the tribe’s executive secretary. “But you need different funders for purchasing the land and having the infrastructure for your solar, so it’s a lot of putting in for different resources to pay for different things.” Receiving the HUD grant allowed the Biloxi-Chitmacha-Choctaw to quickly move ahead with their plan without worrying about stitching together disparate sources of funding. Even though other tribes aren’t likely to receive full funding from a single source, Comardelle thinks some – particularly smaller tribes like hers – could benefit from more centralized support. “I think you would almost have to create a sort of climate change resettlement division, to where they could say, ‘OK, you bring us your plan, and we will help you find the resources – this is the funding for this, this is the funding for that, and help give clarity with this process’,” says Comardelle. That’s something that would help Native American villages in Alaska struggling through a long, fraught relocation process. In Alaska, warming is occurring at more than twice the rate of the US mainland, causing earlier snow melt, vanishing sea ice and rising ocean temperatures. Dozens of indigenous communities are in imminent danger from coastal flooding and erosion, according to a 2009 report by the US Government Accountability Office. One of the most threatened is the Yup’ik village of Newtok in western Alaska, where the combination of diminishing Arctic sea ice, thawing permafrost and extreme weather events are causing severe erosion and flooding that threatens homes and their drinking water. It is increasingly difficult to get essential supplies like fuel into the village, which is only accessible by plane and boat. “It’s very scary right now,” says Andy Patrick, former president of the Newtok Traditional Council. “We’ve got the flooding, eroding and sinking of the community. The village is sinking very fast, the permafrost is melting and there’s no way that we can prevent this happening.” Newtok voted 20 years ago to relocate. The village secured a piece of land on higher bedrock ground through a land swap with the US Fish and Wildlife Service in 2003, still within reasonable proximity to their traditional hunting lands. Since then, however, there’s been scant progress. Its lack of roads makes moving the village difficult – and expensive. Discrete funding programs are available through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Bureau of Indian Affairs and other federal entities. But there is no dedicated, comprehensive program to pay for relocation or help coordinate the process. A tribal leadership struggle further complicated the relocation effort. In Washington, the Quinault Indian Nation is also planning to relocate a major population center in the face of sea level rise, warmer temperatures and increasingly destructive storms. The tribe occupies more than 200,000 acres and 23 miles of Pacific coastline on the southwestern end of the Olympic Peninsula. In 2014, a storm surge breached a seawall and flooded the historic lower village of Taholah, which lies at the confluence of the Pacific Ocean and the Quinault River. Some 700 people – about 20% of the tribe’s population – live in lower Taholah, which is also the site of a tribal school and Head Start, senior housing center and a jail. Quinault received a $700,000 grant from a tribal program at the US Department Health and Human Services to develop a relocation plan. The grant is a drop in the bucket compared to estimated $65m needed to develop the new village over the next decade. Last week, Quinault President Fawn Sharp testified before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior and Environment that the federal government had fallen short of its treaty obligations when it came to tribal funding. Quinault, she said, had spent $4.4m of its own money to compensate for federal funding lapses – money it needed for other pressing matters, including climate adaptation and relocation. “It would be helpful for the entire federal government to elevate the need to respond to climate change to the top of its priority list, and to assure, without question, that the resources are available – directly to tribes – to adapt to its impacts,” Sharp told the Guardian in an email this week. Sharp is also vice president of the National Congress of American Indians, an indigenous rights organization. Back in Louisiana, the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw reject the label of “climate refugees” that some have attached to them. They consider themselves a forward-looking, sovereign people taking charge of their destiny in the face of significant environmental change – something others might learn from, says Maldonado. “You’re talking about people who are employing a sense of agency, who still are empowered in their decision-making and are working to stay together. These terms get thrown out there and there’s this idea of the canary in the coal mine, but they’re not the canary in the coal mine – they’re showing us how to get out.”    "
"James Hansen’s name looms large over any history that will likely be written about climate change.  Whether you look at the hard science, the perils of political interference or modern day activism, Dr Hansen is there as a central character.  In a 1988 US Senate hearing, Hansen famously declared that the “greenhouse effect has been detected and is changing our climate now”.  Towards the end of his time as the director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, Hansen described how government officials had on other occasions changed his testimony, filtered scientific findings and controlled what scientists could and couldn’t say to the media – all to underplay the impact of fossil fuel emissions on the climate. In recent years, the so-called “grandfather of climate science” has added to his CV the roles of author and twice-arrested climate activist and anti-coal campaigner. He still holds a position at Columbia University. So when Hansen’s latest piece of blockbuster climate research was finalized and released earlier this week, there was understandable global interest, not least because it mapped a potential path to the “loss of all coastal cities” from rising sea levels and the onset of “super storms” previously unseen in the modern era. So what is Hansen claiming? Well, the first thing to understand is that Hansen’s paper, written with 18 other co-authors, many of them highly-reputable names in climate science in their own right, is far from conventional.  Most scientific papers only take up four or five pages in a journal. Hansen’s paper - in the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics - grabs 52 pages (although it’s hard to quibble over space when you’re laying out a possible path to widespread global disruption and the complete reshaping of coastlines).  Nor was the paper published in a conventional way. If you’re getting a faint sense of déjà vu about Hansen’s findings, then that could be down to how a draft version of the study was published and widely covered in July last year.  The journal runs an unconventional interactive system of peer review where comments and criticisms from other scientists are published for everyone to see, as are the responses from Hansen and his colleagues.  This is arguably a more transparent way of conducting the scientific process of peer review - something usually carried out privately and anonymously.  None of this should really detract from Hansen and his co-author’s central claims.  Firstly, Hansen says they may have uncovered a mechanism in the Earth’s climate system not previously understood that could point to a much more rapid rise in sea levels.  When the Earth’s ice sheets melt, they place a freshwater lens over neighboring oceans. This lens, argues Hansen, causes the ocean to retain extra heat, which then goes to melting the underside of large ice sheets that fringe the ocean, causing them to add more freshwater to the lens (this is what’s known as a “positive feedback” and is not to be confused with the sort of positive feedback you may have got at school for that cracking fifth grade science assignment). Secondly, according to the paper, all this added water could first slow and then shut down two key ocean currents – and Hansen points to two unusually cold blobs of ocean water off Greenland and off Antarctica as evidence that this process may already be starting.  If these ocean conveyors were to be impacted, this could create much greater temperature differences between the tropics and the north Atlantic, driving “super storms stronger than any in modern times”, he argues. “All hell will break loose in the North Atlantic and neighbouring lands,” he says in a video summary. Hansen points to evidence from ancient climates (known as paleoclimate data) to suggest this has previously happened on Earth – an interpretation that was challenged during the interactive peer review process.  Now, according to the IPCC, global sea levels will only rise a maximum of not quite a metre by the end of the century. But Hansen says this is too conservative. His paper claims that climate models, including those used for his paper, don’t properly capture the consequences from adding freshwater from melting ice sheets. Sea levels could rise several metres beyond the IPCC’s estimates, and the rise would be much faster.  So what’s the upshot? According to Hansen:  These feedbacks raise questions about how soon we will pass points of no return in which we will lock-in consequences that cannot be reversed on any time scale that people care about.  Consequences include sea level rise of several metres, which we estimate could occur this century or at the latest next century if fossil fuel emissions continue at a high level.  That would mean the loss of all coastal cities, most of the world’s largest cities and all of their history. The idea that ice sheets are becoming unstable and could raise sea levels several metres is not as controversial as you might think. There is good evidence that sea levels have been many metres higher in earth’s history, well before humans came along.  A May 2015 study covered here on Planet Oz found Antarctica’s ice sheet alone could have pushed sea levels as much as 17 metres higher, but it would have taken thousands of years. Commenting on Hansen’s study, Dr John Church, a sea level rise expert at Australia’s CSIRO, says multimeter sea level rises are consistent with current research, but where Hansen departs is on claiming it could all happen before the end of this century. But Church says that as fossil fuel emissions grow, the world is committing future generations to much higher sea levels.  “Even with the lower emission scenarios we have committed the world to ongoing sea level rise for centuries,” he says. Other scientists have already challenged many of Hansen’s conclusions, as Hansen himself predicted would happen. “You can be sure that many scientists – indeed most scientists – will find some aspects in our long paper that they would interpret differently,” Hansen says.  But he also commented that these disagreements shouldn’t be misinterpreted. I find that the public sometimes misinterprets our science discussions – how research is done. Scepticism is the lifeblood of science. It takes time for conclusions to be agreed upon and details sorted out.  And so it’s in this spirit that I think Hansen’s paper should be taken.  Hansen and his co-authors have laid out their science and are proposing an idea that will live, die or evolve through the scientific method. Whether or not March 2016 becomes another seminal moment in Hansen’s storied climate career only time, and a failure to reign in fossil fuel emissions, will likely tell. One final point. Hansen has long called for a straightforward rising price on greenhouse gas emissions, which he argues would “quicken the transition to cleaner energy.”  “This is a tragic situation, because it is unnecessary,” he says. We could already be phasing out fossil fuel emissions if only we stopped allowing the fossil fuel industry to use the atmosphere as a free dumping ground for their waste."
"This year’s record-breaking temperatures have robbed the Arctic of its winter, sending snowmobilers plunging through thin ice into freezing rivers and forcing deliveries of snow to the starting line of Alaska’s legendary Iditarod dogsledding race. Last month’s high temperatures – up to 16C (29F) above normal in some parts of the Arctic – flummoxed scientists, and are redefining life in the Arctic, especially for the indigenous people who live close to the land. In Fort Yukon, an indigenous Gwich’in community eight miles inside the Arctic Circle, the freakishly warm weather is forcing people off the rivers that are their main transport corridors in the winter time.  “You can’t trust the ice,” said Ed Alexander, Yukon Flats centre coordinator for the University of Alaska at Fairbanks. “This is the warmest winter that we have ever seen up here. We have had less snow. We have had real thin ice. We have had an explosion of growth in the brush clogging up trails and that kind of thing. It makes everything dangerous.” Other communities downriver lost a number of people this winter when their snowmobiles fell through soft ice – and these were experienced hunters and trappers, he said. Alexander said he and his wife had a narrow escape when they went out for a Sunday drive on their snowmobile. “I noticed there was water all the way across the river and I went to stop my snow machine and say: ‘Oh maybe we should turn around and go back a different way’.” By the time he turned around to his wife, Alexander saw the back of the snowmobile was already sinking into snow and soft ice. “We just took off and there was as rooster tail of water coming out 30ft behind us,” he said. “We made it back to shore but that will wake you up.” Warm is a relative term in Fort Yukon. The community nestled between the Yukon and Porcupine rivers lays claim to the coldest – and hottest – temperatures ever recorded in Alaska. Temperatures at the start of this week were well within the boundaries of what most of the world would describe as very cold at –6C (20F), but that was still up to 10C (18F) warmer than expected for this time of year.  “When I was growing up it would warm up from 60 below to 20 below and we would be walking around with T-shirts on,” said Craig Fleener, a Fort Yukon native who advises the governor on climate change. “It’s all a matter of perspective.” This year, the backwaters were already slushy by early March – so much so that Fort Yukon had to start their dog sled races in the middle of town rather than on the ice. The smell of sap was already coming off the willows, and some plants were budding up, Alexander said. Winter was almost over – without ever getting cold enough to create the conditions Arctic villagers rely on for their way of life. In Fort Yukon, many people depend on wood for heating in the winter months. Come freeze-up, they are out with heavy equipment on the river hauling timber. But without a consistent run of extremely cold days – about two weeks of temperatures approaching -51C (-60F) – the snow never gets hard enough to pack into ramps or roads. Fort Yukon, Alaska - Dog sled demo for visitors pic.twitter.com/nyceQozUpE The ice over the river never gets thick enough for heavy equipment, said Dacho Alexander, a local magistrate and Ed’s brother.  “I normally like to have an ice thickness of between 24 and 36 inches and generally up here we have about 34 to 36 inches,” Dacho Alexander said. The ice this year never made it beyond 20 inches, at the points where he drew core samples.  “We really need 50-60 below in order for the ice to thicken up. Even if it is a week or two weeks that gives us really good ice thickness. It’s not the same to have two months of 10 below. The ice doesn’t get any thicker.” January and February obliterated global temperature records, and nowhere more so than in the Arctic which saw some locations 16C (29F) warmer than normal. In late December, temperatures at the North Pole rose to a balmy 0C. “You can’t overestimate how big the changes in warming we saw in January and February in the Arctic,” James Overland, an Arctic and climate change researcher at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told reporters covering the Arctic science summit in Fairbanks.  “Not only have we beaten the record, we have beaten it by an unbelievably large amount, when you think of it in relation to how Arctic temperatures changed in the past.” The Arctic had already been warming twice as fast as anywhere else over the last 30 years but scientists were still taken aback by the February records. “We would never have expected such a jump in one year,” Overland said. “It sends us into a new temperature place that we have never seen before.” The record temperatures are already resounding across the Arctic and beyond – melting the sea ice cover, thawing the permafrost and soil, and shaking up the orderly patterns of the jet stream.  Researchers are already beginning to connect such changes in the jet stream to weather effects in mid-latitudes such as the unseasonable blasts of cold Arctic air known as the polar vortex. From where Ed Alexander sees it, they had better get moving. “To put it in context: I tell people to imagine what if Los Angeles was 60 [F] degrees warmer than it was supposed to be – because Fort Yukon is 60 degrees warmer than it’s supposed to be.  “People think the changes up here are invisible … but if it only changes half as much down there as it has changed up here you guys are in for a hell of a lot of trouble.”"
"Remember when vegetarian restaurants were a novelty? Or even vegan restaurants? Now it’s barely worth noting when there are so many other free-from options to trumpet.  From chains such as Wahaca, which has announced that it is carbon-neutral, all the way to Michelin-starred restaurants, in the last few months an ever-growing number of places are accentuating the negatives – the things you won’t find at their restaurants – over what you will.   Market researchers Mintel forecast sales of free-from foods to grow 13% to reach £521m in 2016, up from an estimated £470m in 2015. In part, this is because some of us don’t have a choice and have to find free-from ways to eat; the growing number of gluten-free restaurants is great news for those who are coeliac. But while we clearly need to do more to cater for different dietary requirements, is omission a virtue in and of itself? Victoria Hall, the owner of gluten-free restaurant 2 Oxford Place in Leeds, has found that for many people, it is. “When we opened two years ago, our clientele was almost all coeliac diners. Now maybe 60% of our diners can eat gluten, but come because it’s more that the food just happens to be free-from, but is still great.” Chef Dominic Teague found the same thing; last year he said that his restaurant Indigo had secretly gone both gluten- and dairy-free without anyone noticing. “There’s not been one negative comment,” he says. “Our sales have gone up 30% since December, which speaks for itself, really.” He believes this is because even if most people don’t have an intolerance, they know someone who does, and want to be able to eat without the hassle of having to ask. “People come because they know everyone can eat anything from the menu. People with an intolerance are saying they feel normal, which is wonderful.” No one would suggest that Wahaca had made a bad move by being the first restaurant chain to go carbon-neutral, though it inevitably has had an impact on the food it is able to serve. “Where possible, we’ve found English equivalents,” says the group’s founder Thomasina Miers. This means English-grown Mexican vegetables such as poblano peppers and tomatillos, among others. “Of course, we can’t always find a carbon-neutral way to deliver all our Mexican favourites, and so there are some things, such as tuna and octopus, that are popular in traditional Mexican dishes that we aren’t able to add on to our menu. But people care more about where their food comes from, and the impact it has on the environment. Because of that, we’ve worked hard to minimise our carbon footprint.” Tom Hunt, the owner and head chef of Poco in Bristol has also had to make changes to the kinds of food he serves to become impact-free on the environment. Along with restaurants such as Silo in Brighton, his restaurant is one of a growing number aiming to be 100% waste-free. “We recycle and compost 95% or more of all our products,” he says, “and we’re always trying to think of new ways to reduce our recycling and compost, working with suppliers and getting thriftier in the kitchen. We don’t really see it all as waste any more. To us, they’re vital resources.” Though there’s clearly an environmental imperative for food that’s organic/pesticide-free, and for meat-free eating, what has galvanised some restaurants to offer more stripped-back menus perhaps has more to do with the current fashion for “clean eating”. “People want to know what they are eating is good for them, without having to second-guess what’s in their food,” says Lily Simpson, founder of the Detox Kitchen in London. Noemi Takacsne opened Deserve, a gluten- and sugar-free restaurant in Aberdeen after losing 30kg over 18 months by cutting both out of her diet. “I felt so energised by it, and I thought people in Aberdeen deserved the chance to eat this way, too,” she says. “We get lots of people with intolerances, and diabetics, as well as athletes, and people who know we are different and want to try it.” But if you strip back food to extremes, what’s left? Newly opened London dessert restaurant Yorica! is free from the main allergens, including dairy, lactose, gluten, nuts and eggs. “We wanted to offer treats both for people with dietary requirements and people looking for a healthier option without compromising on taste,” says the manager, Monika Jagielo. But Yasmine Larizadeh, one of the founders of The Good Life Eatery, which has three branches across London, doesn’t believe you ought to exclude things from the menu or limiting people’s dining choices to be inclusive. “When we opened, we wanted to have places where you can eat vegan, gluten-free, paleo, or none of the above, and still eat something delicious and satisfying.” So if it means small children can enjoy ice-cream, more of your friends can sit at a table and share a meal together without anxiety, and that careful sourcing makes our food more sustainable, is free-from dining better all round? Or is a “free-from” approach a kind of food propaganda that deprives us of choice? Let us know below the line. "
"We congratulate Dr Hartwig Fischer on his new role as director of the British Museum (Profile, 1 April), and would like to take this early opportunity to raise an ethical issue of great concern to us all. As the impacts of climate change are being felt more forcefully around the world, it is vital that prominent public institutions like the British Museum play their part in minimising the environmental impacts of their activities. BP’s sponsorship contract with the museum is coming to an end this year. While governments in Paris committed to transition away from fossil fuels, BP remains a barrier to progress. It is working to extract new sources of carbon-intensive oil from the tar sands, the Arctic and under the oceans, when we need to keep at least two thirds of known fossil fuels in the ground. BP’s business plan is incompatible with a stable climate, and the company is using its influence to lobby against effective climate policies. Meanwhile, its operations are affecting lives and livelihoods across the world. The company was recently hit with the biggest criminal fine in US history for its gross negligence in causing the Deepwater Horizon spill. To receive sponsorship from BP is to condone these business practices. Retaining such an unethical sponsor would seriously damage the British Museum’s reputation, and place it firmly on the wrong side of history. Indeed, Tate and BP have just parted company after 26 years, following intensifying protests and criticism. We urge Dr Fischer to follow Tate’s lead in not renewing this contract, and to seek funding from sources more in line with the museum’s values and what is needed to ensure a stable future.Professor Anne Glover Vice-principal external affairs, University of Aberdeen, former chief scientific adviser to the European CommissionMargaret Atwood WriterMark Ruffalo ActorMark Rylance ActorDr Jane Goodall DBE Founder the Jane Goodall Institute, and UN messenger of peaceSir Tom Kibble Emeritus professor of physics, Imperial College LondonNaomi Klein Author, activist and film-makerJeremy Leggett Author, solar entrepreneur and advocateRichard Horton Editor-in-chief, The LancetSimon Lewis Professor of global change science at UCLEmma Thompson ActorNaomi Oreskes Professor of the history of science, HarvardMark Goldring Chief executive, Oxfam GBDr Nick Winterbotham Director, BTC & Museums and Resilient Leadership;

"Birds that were expected to do well due to climate change have outperformed other species in the past 30 years, a study of wildlife in Europe and the US has found. Scientists said they have shown that common bird populations thousands of miles apart are responding to changing weather in a similar, pronounced way. The international team, led by Durham University, found that birds they thought would be suited to the changing conditions “substantially” outperformed those expected to suffer between 1980 and 2010.  The research, conducted in collaboration with the RSPB and the United States Geological Survey, is published in the journal Science. They studied 145 common European birds and 380 American birds, having split them into groups of ones they thought would prosper through climate change and ones that would struggle. They found a clear difference in the average population trends of bird species either advantaged or disadvantaged by climate change in both continents. Populations of bee eater and Cetti’s warbler – species with a southerly distribution in Europe – have increased in recent years, while more northerly distributed species such as willow tit and brambling have been declining in the same period. Trends have also been noted within the same species. Wrens, for example, have been increasing in northern European areas where winters have been milder, but declining in some sourthern countries with hotter, drier summers. The UK’s population of the Dartford warbler, which used to be limited to Dorset, has increased eightfold since the early 1980s, while declining in Spain. The American robin, a familiar species across much of continental USA, has declined in some southern states such as Mississippi and Louisiana, but increased in north-central states, such as the Dakotas. The study’s lead authors, Dr Stephen Willis and Dr Philip Stephens at Durham University’s School of Biological and Biomedical Sciences, said the findings showed that there was a large-scale, consistent response by bird populations to climate change on two continents. Stephens said: “If there was no impact of climate change, you would expect the average population trend of species in the two groups to be the same, but the differences expose the fact that recent climate change has already favoured one set of species over another.” Willis said: “These findings represent a new climate impact indicator for biodiversity. The same approach could also be applied to species such as bees, butterflies and dragonflies, which are well monitored and highly susceptible to changes in climate.”"

"Last month, Anohni (formerly Antony and the Johnsons) became the first transgendered artist to be nominated for an Oscar - a benchmark moment organisers felt was important enough to warrant a mention on their trivia page, but not a live appearance: “I want to be clear — I know that I wasn’t excluded from the performance directly because I am transgendered,” said Anonhi in an open letter, entitled ‘Why I am not attending the Academy Awards’. “I was not invited to perform because I am relatively unknown in the US, singing a song about ecocide, and that might not sell advertising space.” It’s true: despite decades of warnings from top scientists, ecocide remains an unfashionable issue, thanks in no small part to intensive lobbying and spin from agribusiness, biotech corporations and carbon barons, who use art world patronage to create an illusion of benevolence.  Musicians across genres and generations are calling time on this lie, from Neil Young’s furious Monsanto Years album and Greenpeace’s striking Requiem for Arctic Ice to THEEsatisfaction’s lush, eco-conscious odyssey, EarthEE. “We want to start a conversation about climate change,” the Sub Pop duo told the Guardian last year. “Because it’s a real issue, a problem many try to avoid.”  Hopelessness, Anohni’s forthcoming album, is a stunning response to this inaction, joining journalist Rebecca Solnit’s call to label climate change “extreme, horrific, long-term, widespread violence”. The songs are sublime in their movement, devastating in their truth-telling – war, surveillance, American imperialism, the slow murder of the Earth and its inhabitants not just by men with machines, but by all of us who are complicit in the planet’s devastation. It is, to quote Elizabeth Barrett Browning, a curse from the depths of womanhood: “salt, and bitter, and good” – a sonic extension of Anohni’s work in the Future Feminists collective.  Fear and rage are powerful tools for change, but delight and pleasure are equally formidable. These things are in abundance on THEEsatisfaction’s limber, Afrofuturist poetry (on the aforementioned EarthEE, or their debut, AwE NaturalE, and their catalogue of mixtapes) – heady, rich, semi-mystical music that traces symbiotic lines between earth and body, music and mind, lineage and land. Brooklyn-based rapper Junglepussy has a similar, pesticide-free MO on her excellent second album, Pregnant with Success, a record ripe with carefree confidence, black love and green metaphors – witty, salacious and earthy in equal measure. In JP’s world, merch is a line of organic beverages (Junglepussy Juice), self-love is paramount (“I seen you eating Mickey D’s, knew you ain’t love yourself / I’m up in Trader Joes, shopping cart full of health”) and would-be lovers are advised to woo her not with popping bottles (“that’s not impressive”) but freshly picked fruit.  It makes sense that artists like Junglepussy, Anohni and THEEsatisfaction are at the forefront of green music, since it’s marginal communities – oppressed, poor, BAME, “other” – who are, and will continue to be, the first and worst affected by ecocide, while the 1% holiday in the sun. Ask the black, working-class people of Flint, Michigan, who are forced to drink and bathe in lead-contaminated water; the victims of developing countries devastated by the droughts and famines that follow extreme weather; the many indigenous peoples across the globe fighting oil spills and pipelines, land grabs and deforestation. And yet, as Anohni points out, identity politics in this “tipping point” era are increasingly used against us by big business as smokescreens to distract us from a culture of wealth extraction: They are going to try to convince us that they have our best interests at heart by waving flags for identity politics and fake moral issues. But don’t forget that many of these [award show] celebrities are the trophies of billionaire corporations whose only intention it is to manipulate you into giving them your consent and the last of your money. They have been paid to do a little tap dance to occupy you while Rome burns. Hopelessness works because it articulates the despair so many of us feel on our worst days – that we’re all doomed, that the world is past saving, that we’re all to blame. But it also speaks to defiance and refusal, joining a growing resistance that is starting to take root across the globe: in Sudha Kheterpal’s SPARK technology, in Björk’s tireless activist-art, in the healing, pleasure-filled rhythms and melodies of THEEsatisfaction and Junglepussy."

"“Stunning,” “wow,” “shocker,” “bombshell,” “astronomical,” “insane,” “unprecedented”– these are some of the words climate scientists have used to describe the record-shattering global surface temperatures in February 2016. It’s difficult to see any ‘pause’ or slowdown in the global warming over the past 50 years. To put the current temperatures into context, prior to last October, monthly global surface temperatures had not been more than 0.96°C hotter than the 1951–1980 average, according to Nasa. The past 5 months have been 1.06°C, 1.03°C, 1.10°C, 1.14°C, and 1.35°C hotter than that average, absolutely destroying previous records. Estimates from Noaa are in broad agreement with those from Nasa. Right now, the Earth’s average surface temperature is hotter than it’s been in thousands of years; potentially even longer. We’re currently at the peak of a very strong El Niño event, which has brought warm water up to the ocean surface. That’s certainly played a major role in the current record-breaking temperatures. The hottest years are almost invariably years with El Niño events, although 2014 was the first year in decades to set a temperature record without an El Niño. For comparison, the current El Niño event is very similar to a previous one in 1997–1998. That event made 1998 by far the hottest year on record at the time, and it’s why contrarians often cherry pick temperatures over the past 18 years – the abnormally hot 1998 was 18 years ago. However, the past 6 months have been 0.43°C hotter than the corresponding months in 1997–1998. So clearly, while El Niño is a big contributor to the current record-shattering temperatures, human-caused global warming is playing a major role as well. Climate scientist Michael Mann attributed the record to approximately 50% human influences, and 50% a combination of El Niño and natural weather fluctuations. Last December, 195 countries signed the COP21 international climate agreement in Paris. Graham Readfearn summarized the agreement for The Guardian: The guts of the agreement hang off the so-called “long-term goal” that commits almost 200 countries to hold the global average temperature to “well below 2°C” above pre-industrial levels and to “pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C”. Depending on how exactly we define “pre-industrial,” February temperatures were between 1.5 and 2°C hotter than those in pre-industrial times. So, we’re already starting to tread on thin ice, in the range that the global community has deemed dangerously hot. However, since we’re at the peak of an El Niño, as they did after 1998, global surface temperatures will temporarily go back down once this event is over. That is, until human-caused global warming pushes them up to and beyond these temperatures once again in the near future. As climate scientists Steve Sherwood and Stefan Rahmstorf wrote, This is the true climate emergency: it is getting more difficult with each passing year for humanity to prevent temperatures from rising above 2℃. February should remind us how pressing the situation is. In the meantime, we’re getting a glimpse at the future climate consequences of our carbon pollution. Just to name a few, Africa is being battered by heat and drought, with more than 36 million people facing hunger across the southern and eastern parts of the continent as a result. Droughts in Vietnam and Zimbabwe have cost these countries 4% and 12% of their GDP, respectively. Arctic ice is in poor shape as a result of the region’s warmest-recorded winter. Australia has been breaking heat records as well, with 39 consecutive days in Sydney above 26℃ (double the previous record). And a massive coral bleaching event appears likely on the Great Barrier Reef. Arctic heat so extreme this winter that govt. mappers ran out of colors https://t.co/Ne9igrf9VD pic.twitter.com/5DHkUmsfPK These are some of the reasons why temperatures 1.5–2°C above pre-industrial levels are considered dangerous. This intense heat is not good for agriculture, ice, sea levels, or coral reefs. There’s still time for us to prevent such high temperatures from becoming the norm, but that time is running out.  Fortunately there’s been some good news that we may be on the verge of getting carbon pollution and global warming under control, but we have to continue with this progress and avoid reversing it. People seem to be grasping the problem just in time: a record number of Americans (41%) now see global warming as a threat, and almost two-thirds realize that humans are responsible. California is providing a blueprint for solving the problem, as the state’s carbon pollution has fallen despite a growing population, as its economy has thrived. We’re capable of solving the climate problem, but with temperatures already approaching dangerous thresholds, the time to act is now."

"There have been multiple scientific studies that all concur: scientists know that climate change is happening and it is largely caused by humans. I recently wrote about this here, where I reviewed the studies. It turns out that the more scientists know about climate change, the more they are convinced that humans are warming the planet. In fact, the consensus is extraordinarily strong. But it isn’t just that the vast majority of scientists agree; it’s that the best scientist agree. We find that the contrarian scientists tend to be less accomplished, have had their research found to be incorrect time after time, and they produce less science.  But very recently, a study from the George Mason University Center for Climate Change Communication was completed that adds to our knowledge on the consensus. Lead author Ed Maibach and his colleagues are very well-respected surveyors and scientists who study this topic. The study didn’t focus on what we think of as climate scientists – rather they polled meteorologists.   There were actually two surveys that were merged. In one, the authors identified 1038 professionals currently working in broadcast meteorology from the American Meteorological Society (AMS). In a concurrent study, the authors obtained a list of members from the AMS who were not broadcast meteorologists. The two groups were asked a series of questions on whether climate change is occurring, the degree to which respondents felt humans were responsible, what could be done to minimize climate change, among others. The authors also asked about the educational background of the respondents. Not all members of the AMS are meteorologists. Additionally, someone working in meteorology is not necessarily a climate scientist. Similarly, a climate scientist is not necessarily a meteorologist. Sometimes these populations overlap but in many cases they do not.  One thing that tends to differentiate practicing meteorologists from climate scientists is that meteorologists tend to observe short-term weather more, while climate scientists tend to look at long-term trends. While this difference may sound trivially obvious, it’s an important distinction to keep in mind because it suggests meteorologists may be more likely to see differences in observed weather patterns. Climate scientists would be less likely to be swayed by changes in weather patterns. So what did the survey find? First, nearly every meteorologist (96%) agrees that climate change is happening, and the vast majority are confident in their opinion. Only 1% felt that climate change isn’t happening (3% did not know). Next, a large majority feel that climate change is being caused by humans. For instance, 29% believe that the change is largely or entirely human caused; 38% think most of the change is from humans; 14% answered that humans and natural factors are about equally responsible. Only 5% felt that climate change is mainly natural. Another important finding is that most meteorologists feel that some of the change can be averted, based on how we react. Small minorities felt that a large amount of change can be averted or that climate change cannot be averted. These views have changed over the years. For instance, almost 20% of meteorologists say their opinion on climate has changed over the past five years. Of that group, the vast majority are more convinced that the climate is changing and they cite a variety of reasons including new research, seeing first-hand evidence, the consensus amongst climate scientists, or from interactions with climate scientists. A final important result is that only 37% of the AMS respondents consider themselves climate experts. Speaking more broadly about the meteorology community beyond the AMS, that population tends to be more skeptical that the Earth’s climate is changing. I tend to believe that the skepticism is partly because meteorologists in general focus on short-term events and also because a great many non-experts are counted as meteorologists (including people who do not have degrees in any science, let alone a meteorological science). Despite this, meteorologists’ views are important not only because they are a consistent scientific presence in many households, but also because the collective weather observation record from the meteorological community is a resource that is unmatched. With this new study, the meteorological consensus is seen to be nearly as strong as that in the climate science community. I asked author Ed Maibach for a summary and he told me:  It is not surprising that more meteorologists are now more convinced that human-caused climate change is happening. That is how science works. As the scientific evidence becomes more irrefutable, which is the case with harmful, human-caused climate change, more scientists of all types will become convinced."
"Record hot spells in Australia this month blurred the line between summer and autumn in another sign of rapidly advancing global warming, a Climate Council report says. The first four days of March saw maximum temperatures in much of the country 4C above average – and 8C to 12C above average in most of southeastern Australia – the report said.  Despite summer being over, the New South Wales/Victorian border towns of Echuca and Tocumwal suffered the longest, hottest spell in their recorded history, with eight consecutive days of 38C or above. It follows a summer that delivered Perth more 40C days than ever before and 39 consecutive days over 26C for Sydney, a record that more than doubled the previous high. The Climate Council said the Australian findings reflected worldwide heat records that, among other impacts, threatened the Great Barrier Reef with widespread coral bleaching and drove a record low in Arctic sea ice cover last month. The report linked prolonged local heat to destructive fires in Tasmania’s world heritage forests and a major algae outbreak in the Murray river.  It argued that evidence of escalating heat impacts lent urgency to climate mitigation efforts that remain politically contentious in Australia, including a moratorium on new coalmines. “As Australians continue to suffer from more frequent and worsening extreme heat events, the path to tackling climate change is becoming more urgent: no new coalmines can be built, existing coalmines and coal-fired power stations must be phased out and renewable energy must be scaled up rapidly,” the report said. The report’s release on Sunday came as the federal environment minister, Greg Hunt, took an aerial tour over the Great Barrier Reef to inspect the impact of coral bleaching. Hunt was due to address reporters after the flyover with the chief executive of the Great Barrier Reef marine park authority, Russell Reichelt.  Tim Flannery, the former Australian climate commissioner who helped found the Climate Council after the commission was abolished by the Abbott government in 2013, said world heat records were an ominous sign the world had shifted from “climate change concern to climate change consequences”.  “Scientists have been voicing their concerns for decades and now we are seeing the consequences,” Flannery said. “Our internationally renowned Great Barrier Reef is already experiencing widespread coral bleaching due to record sea surface temperatures.  “Our world heritage ancient forests in Tasmania have been razed by bushfires sparked by tinderbox conditions driven by climate change. “And, just weeks after health experts warned of the grave dangers posed to Australians through more frequent and severe heatwaves, we’ve seen hospitals in Perth overwhelmed after four consecutive days over 40°C.  “The window of time we have to act is closing. The world is acting but Australia is so far behind.” The Climate Council’s chief executive, Amanda McKenzie, said there had been no “substantive policy announcements” by the federal government since a UN summit in Paris agreed to rapidly cut fossil fuel emissions. She called for an “orderly closure of our ageing and polluting coal-fired power plants” to make way for renewables. McKenzie said extreme heat events affected farmers’ harvests and pushed Australia’s bushfire season “well into autumn”.  Heat records this month included 10 consecutive days above 30C for Canberra and Melbourne’s hottest March night on record at 38.6C. Brisbane researchers this month predicted the world economy was on track to produce enough carbon emissions by 2020 to lock in a 1.5C rise above pre-industrial levels, and enough by 2030 to lock in a 2C rise."
"World leaders must show their commitment to tackling global warming by signing the Paris climate agreement at a ceremony in April at the United Nations, climate change activist and former US vice president Al Gore said.  Gore said there was a “tremendous push” for heads of government to formally ink the accord, to keep up momentum for the deal struck by nearly 200 countries in December and to avert the worst impacts of climate change on vulnerable nations.   “There is an overwhelming amount of hope that the Paris climate agreement could be a turning point towards a more resilient, low-carbon future,” Gore told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an interview. “While the deal is not enough by itself, it is a major step forward.”  At the Paris climate talks, governments agreed to limit global temperature rise to “well below” 2C above pre-industrial times and pursue efforts to keep it to 1.5C.  Ségolène Royal, France’s environment minister who recently took over as chair of the UN-led climate negotiations, has said that between 80 and 100 countries are expected to sign the agreement in New York on 22 April.  The agreement is due to take effect in 2020, but requires at least 55 countries representing at least 55% of global emissions to ratify it first.  Gore, who was in Manila to lead training for more than 700 local advocates for climate action under an international programme he launched in 2006, praised the efforts of countries at high risk of climate impacts that had pressed for the lower 1.5C cap in Paris, led by the Philippines.  “I certainly hope that we can meet that 1.5C goal, and I am very grateful to the Philippines for helping to include that goal in the Paris agreement,” Gore said.  “Conventional economic analysis has convinced many people that it’s not a realistic goal,” he added.  But “non-conventional analysis that takes into account the unconventional dramatic change in renewable energy competitiveness has convinced others that actually we may have a chance to meet that goal,” he said.  The key is for countries to switch to renewable energy, Gore said. “With the Paris agreement, we send a signal to the business community that the way to a low-carbon future is going solar or wind or geothermal,” he said.  As more and more people become aware of the challenges posed by the “climate crisis”, more legal changes can be expected that support action, he noted, citing moves by China to adopt a national carbon emissions trading scheme next year.  “If you and I had been told three or four years ago that China would have a nationwide cap-and-trade programme, it would have been hard to believe - but they will, and many other countries are moving in the same direction.“ Philippine climate change commission secretary Emmanuel de Guzman told the Thomson Reuters Foundation his country would sign the Paris agreement in April.  The Philippines has pledged to cut its carbon emissions by 70% from business as usual by 2030, conditional on international financial support, as part of the Paris deal.  “The agreement tells the world that human rights will be upheld, that the big and powerful have stood up for the small, poor and vulnerable, and that the world is determined to rise to this great challenge,” de Guzman said.  The Paris accord promises $100bn per year from 2020 to fund projects enabling vulnerable countries to adopt clean energy and adjust to the impacts of climate change such as rising seas and fiercer droughts, floods and storms.  Gore said rich nations “must do more in helping poor nations to adapt to the changing climate”.  The Green Climate Fund (GCF), which was set up under the UN talks to support climate action in the developing world, “still needs to be completely funded and I will be among those working to make sure that it is”, Gore added.  The Nobel Peace Prize winner, who gave an hour-long presentation on climate disruption and its solutions in Manila this week, said there was “basis for genuine hope” that the world can curb climate change.  “It matters a lot how long it takes to prevail, because we are programming into the Earth’s system a lot of distractive changes every day, so the sooner we make the transition, the less damage we will do,” he said. “But I am filled with hope that we actually will win this struggle.”  • This article was amended on 18 March 2016 to amend the byline from Reuters to Thomson Reuters Foundation."
" Sea-level rise may be the most predictable outcome of climate change. Expanding warmer waters and melting land ice both contribute to flooding – and scientists agree that we are locked into sea-level rise for centuries to come. The question is not if we will retreat from the coast, but when. Still, the rush to develop the coast occurs at a maddening pace.  We now know that 13.1 million people are at risk of flooding along the US coast by the end of this century. A new study published in Nature Climate Change further suggests that massive migration will occur unless protective measures are taken. Since sea-level rise will speed up after the end of the century due to increased glacier and ice sheet melting, the flooding we face in this century is just the tip of the iceberg.   The problem is particularly severe along our 3,000-mile low-lying sandy barrier island coast extending, with a few breaks, all the way from the South Shore of Long Island to the Mexican border. Along this long barrier island coast, Florida has the longest and most heavily developed shoreline. In Miami, a city perilously perched atop a very porous limestone, two multibillion-dollar construction projects are under way, despite the fact that parts of the city routinely flood during high tides and that widespread flooding by the rising sea in a few decades is a virtual certainty. No sea walls, levees or dikes can stop the rising waters from flowing through the underlying spongy limestone and into the city. Miami is ultimately doomed.  A few miles to the north, Fort Lauderdale is undergoing equally intense development and population growth. This city has more beachfront high-rise buildings per mile than any other American beach. According to Katherine Bagley of Inside Climate news “nearly 5,000 apartments or condos are or soon will be under construction” in the city, which already faces routine nuisance flooding. The city’s many canals make Fort Lauderdale all the more vulnerable to rising seas. In light of the wet future in store for the city, increased density is insane.   On the other side of the Florida peninsula along the Gulf of Mexico, a Fort Myers Beach developer proposes to build a massive project to include four beachfront hotels, nine restaurants and a 1,500-car parking structure; all to be protected with a soon-to-be-constructed half-mile-long seawall. If you need to build a seawall to protect your construction project, you should not be building at that site. Remember – seawalls destroy beaches. Two barrier island communities deserve attention as the nation’s most vulnerable to sea level. On the east coast, North Topsail Beach in North Carolina is a narrow, low, rapidly-eroding island segment. In spite of the obvious natural dangers, the town has several immovable high-rises, at least one of which may soon fall in. On the Gulf coast, Dauphin Island, Alabama is an extremely low island that is frequently overwashed by storms, and repeated beach nourishment has done almost nothing to stop erosion.  Storms have severely damaged the west end of Dauphin Island five times since 1973. While the west end has no high-rises, storms, including hurricanes Katrina and Ike have repeatedly destroyed houses.   And, just a few years after Hurricane Sandy flooded much of the area, New Jersey’s Gold Coast (the Hudson waterfront) is experiencing a construction boom. Developers are building numerous high-rise structures, hoping to attract commuters seeking cheaper quarters than those available in nearby New York City.  They have taken measures to make these structures more resilient, but in this age of certain sea-level rise, it is preposterous to continue to build in areas that were previously inundated by floodwaters and will certainly be inundated in the future.  The time has passed for such foolish projects. The frequency of super costly “natural” disasters on the coast will only increase if we continue to cram buildings up against the beach and treat storms as urban renewal projects. It is time for a profound new outlook – where we construct smaller, less expensive and perhaps mobile structures and do not replace buildings destroyed and damaged in storms. It is time we prepare to retreat from the rising sea."
