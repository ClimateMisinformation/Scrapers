Share this...FacebookTwitterThe 5th Arctic Frontiers Conference in Tromsø, Norway recently took place with about 1000 scientists attending from all over the world (another big footprint). But except for a few fringe media outlets, no one listened. So I thought I’d lend these poor desperate alarmist scientists a favour and help them get their message out.
This year’s motto for the conference was dubbed: “Tipping Points”. The German online, leftist TAZ daily wrote a piece called:
The Blind Spots Of Climate Scientists
The article of course is another spread-the-panic piece that claims the climate could reach a tipping point at a certain temperature, this according to “leading scientists”. This is so shocking that Norway’s foreign minister Jonas Gahr Støre was compelled to say:
 “The scientists are warning us that we are approaching a condition where the Arctic ecological system is about to collapse.”
Scientists warn that the tipping point is rapidly approaching because a number of “tipping components” are already in action, namely the melting of sea ice, which reduces albedo and leads to warming of the ocean. There’s also the thawing of the permafrost, which leads to the release of methane gas, which…and so on. And TAZ reminds us of the Greenland ice pack:
“If the ice on Greenland disappeared, oceans would rise seven meters globally – but that would take thousands of years, because the ice in the middle is 2 km thick.”
I thought Greenland’s ice was three km thick. Has 1 km already melted away? Oceanographer Carlos M. Duarte of the Spanish research centre Imedia says:

With a melting of Arctic sea ice, the ‘tipping point’ would already be exceeded. Beginning in the year 2020, an Arctic in the summer months that is practically without ice most likely cannot be averted.
Perhaps Mr Duarte is not aware, but the Arctic core has gained 2000 CUBIC KILOMETERS of ice since 2007. That would be 4 million sq km of equivalent additional ice half a meter thick. Add that to the current sea ice area!
Greenland melts with another 0.4°C of warming
Wherever alarmism and end of the world scenarios are fantasised, one can expect to find Stefan Rahmstorf of Germany’s alarmist Potsdam Institute For Climate Impact Research. TAZ quotes Rahmstorf:
New research could yield that the targeted limitation of global warming to 2°C will not be enough, says oceanographer Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute For Climate Impact Research: It’s possible that Greenland’s ice already could melt irrevocably with a rise of 1.3 to 2.3°C, which is what still unpublished research indicates. In its 2007 report, the IPCC spoke of 1,9 to 4.6°C. Already now the global temperatures have risen on average 0.8 to 0.9°C .
So as TAZ reports it, Rahmstorf is claiming that Greenland could melt with just another 0.4°C of warming. TAZ mentions “still unpublished research”. Perhaps this is new research from Rahmstorf that’s designed to salvage his already discredited claims of 1.8 metres of sea level rise by 2100. Does that mean we should expect another piece of panic science from Rahmstorf to appear in an upcoming Nature issue.
What is needed is an early warning system for a climate tipping, say the scientists. But TAZ reports  that the scientific basis is still missng for such a system – there are so called blind spots. Oran R. Young, Professor at the University of Santa Barbara:
Our problem is not that we have too little data. We have to find out which data is relevant. We need just a few but decisive indicators.”
Blind spots? I’d say dead zones would be more accurate.

"Canada has imposed a landmark carbon tax on four provinces which had defied Ottawa’s push to combat climate change, prompting unhappy premiers to say they would challenge the measure.  The prime minister, Justin Trudeau, citing international commitments to fight global warming, had made clear for two years he would slap the tax on any of the 10 provinces that did not come up with their own plans by 1 April. The measure is opposed by Ontario, the most populous province, where Trudeau’s Liberals need to do well to stand a chance of retaining power in a federal election this October. Carbon pollution will initially cost C$20 ($15) a tonne, rising by C$10 a year until it reaches C$50 in 2022. It also applies in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and New Brunswick. “As of today, it’s no longer free to pollute anywhere in Canada,” the environment minister, Catherine McKenna, said on Twitter. “Climate change is real ... some politicians may not care much, but our kids and our grandkids do.“ Official data regularly show Canada has little chance of meeting its climate change goals of reducing emissions by 30% from 2005 levels by 2030. Although Ottawa says the money collected will be returned to taxpayers in the form of rebates, right-leaning parties portray it as a cash grab. The Conservatives, who polls show could win the October election as a scandal over alleged political interference dogs Trudeau, promise to scrap the measure. Ontario premier Doug Ford vowed to oppose what he called “the worst tax ever” in court. “We’re going to keep fighting this carbon tax with every single tool at our disposal,” he said in a filmed statement. Scott Moe, the premier of Saskatchewan, which has already launched a challenge, said he hoped the tax was an April Fool’s joke. “We now have four provinces representing half the population in this nation that say this is a flawed policy,” Moe told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. Trudeau’s other efforts to combat climate change are also proving a challenge. Last year the government unveiled legislation to overhaul environmental assessments of energy projects, paying more attention to greenhouse gas emissions. Critics say this will deter future investment at a time when existing projects are already in trouble. Canada bought Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd’s Trans Mountain crude pipeline for $4.5bn last year after the company expressed doubts it could proceed with plans to more than double the existing capacity."

Share this...FacebookTwitterParts of Europe are being gripped by unusual cold, even though the calendar says it’s meteorological summer. Now children in Sweden are finding out what snow is like – in June! Strangest warming I’ve ever seen.

Winter pounds Sweden – and it’s summer!
The English language The Local here writes that “Stockholm broke an 84-year-old cold record on Saturday, as the capital’s temperature only reached 6 degrees Celsius, the lowest June maximum daily temperature the city has seen since 1928.”
Indeed, you could be excused for thinking that the current chill is more like winter than summer. It was actually colder in the capital yesterday than on Christmas Eve. ‘The temperature was a degree lower than it was at Christmas in Stockholm, so it is colder. And it’s windier, too,’ said SMHI’s meteorologist Lisa Frost to newspaper Dagens Nyheter.”
Just two days ago The Local here reported that snow blanketed northern parts.
Residents in northern Sweden were forced to grab shovels rather than sun lotion on what was supposed to be the first day of summer, as much of the region was left covered in a thick blanket of snow on Friday. As much as 20 centimetres of thick, wet snow fell in parts of Västerbotten County, giving residents quite a shock when they woke up Friday morning.”
The mercury also dropped to minus 6 degrees Celsius in one town, making it the coldest June Sweden recording in 20 years. The Local adds:
The weather agency forecasts that the first weekend in June will feel more like the start of winter than the start of summer.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s Sunday and this report here at The Local has parallels that I just couldn’t help but notice.
For us skeptics we should never be so naive to think that we are going to convince the world of natural climate change in our lifetime. As history shows us, those who are right often have to wait a very long time before getting the credit or apology they deserve. Hey, it’s the price of far-sightedness.
In climate science we are indeed dealing in large part with religious, fanatic zealots – all drugged up in their CO2 global warming paranoia. Today every weather anomaly even gets blamed on the wicked ways of CO2 emitters, who, we are told, have a pact with the Big Oil devil.
Today, skeptic scientists, bloggers and a few journalists are being singled out and a guilty verdict is being sought for them in the court of public opinion. Some nut-cases are even calling for Nuremberg-type trials.
The Local here writes about skeptics and dissidents (witches!) of the past, how they were blamed for natural catastrophes. Take Katharina Henot –
Germany’s most notorious ‘witch’ – stood accused of having entered into a pact with the devil, conjured up a plague of caterpillars, sown strife and encouraged sexual deviancy. In 1627 she was sentenced to death by torture by the Cologne Court. 385 years later, in a symbolic gesture by the Cologne City Council, Henot and 37 other “witches” executed by local authorities are to be pardoned and rehabilitated, wrote Die Welt newspaper on Saturday.”
So you see, the path back to sanity can indeed be a very long one. Those with the truth at times are put to death as “criminals”.
As the climate catastrophe-obsessed mob decends deeper into madness, us skeptics must always keep in mind that we could very well end up being burned at the stake (of public opinion) and not be rehabilitated until the next phase of the solar millenial cycle when the Earth enters its next cold period – 500 years from now.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAnyone who still does not believe environmentalism is a front for repressive, authoritarian-like state control of our lives can now look at yet another example that it is indeed so. And again the target is poor countries.
The online weekly Die Zeit reports here on how the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) recently issued a press release that surely puts a big smile on the faces of Marxist environmentalists. Get set for a another round of expensive and repressive regulation, taxes and penalties. You’ll notice the familiar language of authority and consensus.
The WHO IARC writes (link and emphasis added):
After a week-long meeting of international experts, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), which is part of the World Health Organization (WHO), today classified diesel engine exhaust as carcinogenic to humans Group 1, based on sufficient evidence that exposure is associated with an increased risk for lung cancer. […]
There has been mounting concern about the cancer-causing potential of diesel exhaust, particularly based on findings in epidemiological studies of workers exposed in various settings. […]
The scientific evidence was reviewed thoroughly by the Working Group and overall it was concluded that there was sufficient evidence in humans for the carcinogenicity of diesel exhaust.”
Now we’re all really scared. Oh my, what can we do! The expert doctors recommend (emphasis added):

Given the Working Group’s rigorous, independent assessment of the science, governments and other decision-makers have a valuable evidence-base on which to consider environmental standards for diesel exhaust emissions and to continue to work with the engine and fuel manufacturers towards those goals.
Dr Christopher Portier, Chairman of the IARC working Group, stated that “The scientific evidence was compelling and the Working Group’s conclusion was unanimous: diesel engine exhaust causes lung cancer in humans.” Dr Portier continued: ‘Given the additional health impacts from diesel particulates, exposure to this mixture of chemicals should be reduced worldwide.’
Dr Kurt Straif, Head of the IARC Monographs Program, indicated that ‘The main studies that led to this conclusion were in highly exposed workers. However, we have learned from other carcinogens, such as radon, that initial studies showing a risk in heavily exposed occupational groups were followed by positive findings for the general population. Therefore actions to reduce exposures should encompass workers and the general population.’
Dr Christopher Wild, Director, IARC, said that ‘while IARC’s remit is to establish the evidence-base for regulatory decisions at national and international level, today’s conclusion sends a strong signal that public health action is warranted. This emphasis is needed globally, including among the more vulnerable populations in developing countries where new technology and protective measures may otherwise take many years to be adopted’.”
How about just letting the developing countries develop like the industrial countries did. Now a body of bureaucrats want to take their diesel fuel away or force them to accept technology they can’t afford.
The big green monster just keeps growing. Expect men donning white protective suits to soon show up to tow your car away.

"People pressed their semi-naked bums on the gallery glass in the House of Commons and had to be peeled off by police, and it still wasn’t the stupidest thing that happened in parliament this week. On Monday, the night that parliament was supposed to “take back control”, protest group Extinction Rebellion got into the gallery, took their kit off and tried to stick a variety of body parts to the glass, turning the House of Commons into some kind of X-rated human zoo. It seemed weird but by the time Tuesday came around we were all looking back on it as a rare moment of sanity. For one thing, it was just nice to see people who had made a decision. It wasn’t the best decision – they were going to glue their hands to some glass and wriggle their bums around for a bit – but at least something got decided in parliament. Because what happened next was that MPs, who had just taken control from a government who kept bringing back the same deal over and over again, decided to reject every available option they had created for themselves for the second time in a row. You can only imagine how the evening went down in EU capitals. “All right, 1,011 days since the referendum, 11 left to go. Let’s take a look at what the UK is doing … oh you’re taking the piss!” “What’s wrong, Angela?” “They’re having a wee initial think about what kind of Brexit they actually want to happen.” “Are you sure they aren’t making final preparations?” “NO, THEY’RE BRAINSTORMING!” “OK, but how are they getting on? Are they at least nearly there, Angela?” “No. And I don’t know how to tell you this, but they’ve hired strippers.” With all other options having been rejected, Theresa May sat down to reject the final option of having a general election. In a seven-hour cabinet meeting, she and her colleagues argued furiously about what the hell to do next, probably setting aside at least two hours to talk about what a baller move it was of David Cameron to call the referendum to solve divisions within the Tory party. At the end of it, May gave her inevitable press statement (they may as well strap a lectern to her tummy at this point) and announced her genius solution: do the same thing that had just failed 24 hours before on Bum Day. May’s game-changing suggestion was to try to agree an approach with Jeremy Corbyn, and if that didn’t work then a range of options for the future relationship would be put to the Commons in a series of votes. To be fair to May, it was extremely on brand for her to go down a route that had already failed repeatedly. The government, which spent almost three years fighting itself before it even considered compromising with a party it actively despises, now wants to get this sorted by the end of the week. In 2016 this offer would have been sensible. Now, with a week to go, it looks like the prime minister, having started a fire and fanned the flames, is asking Labour to stand there holding a can of petrol with her and act a bit shifty till the police arrive. There’s another problem. Anything Labour agrees, it will have to trust May’s successor to carry out. A few weeks ago it looked like May would cling to the doorframe of No 10 until humans died off and she was governing over a mutated breed of cockroaches who also didn’t like her that much. But she’s now promised to resign, meaning whoever replaces her will have to carry out what she agrees. And that’s, to put it mildly, bad, as Boris Johnson is trying to make himself look electable again. Late on Tuesday, irony died as the cauliflower told the BBC that people want politicians in Westminster “not to focus on themselves, but to focus on the needs of the country”. This from a man who hired a photographer to photograph his own resignation in protest against a deal he would go on to endorse in return for the prime minister quitting to make way for him. Now with Brexiteers already quitting or threatening to strike, the DUP livid, the EU sceptical that the plan will work, maybe even to the point that it won’t grant an extension, the chaos really begins. And it’s going to make bum glue-apalooza look like a regular Monday. • James Felton is a TV and radio comedy writer"

Share this...FacebookTwitterUnless the power grid collapses, the printing presses will continue churning out tens of thousands of copies of the latest edition of DER SPIEGEL – well into the night so that they’ll be fresh for the newsstands tomorrow.
UPDATE: SPIEGEL reveals more
Tomorrow’s edition features a story on environment expert Prof. Dr. Fritz Vahrenholt, author of the new book Die kalte Sonne” (The Cold Sun). According to the text provided by Der Spiegel, Vahrenholt’s underlying message is clear: “It’s also the sun, stupid!”
Here’s how DER SPIEGEL describes tomorrow’s upcoming story:
THE CLIMATE REBEL
With heretical claims, RWE ma­na­ger Fritz Vah­ren­holt is causing a commotion: ‘The climate catastrophe is not taking place’, the environment expert claims. The sun is being underestimated as a natural climate factor. ‘The sun has been weak since 2005’, Vahrenholt said in a DER SPIEGEL interview. ‘We can only expect cooling from it for the time being.'”
Perfect timing

The timing of the DER SPIEGEL feature story couldn’t be worse for Germany’s catastrophe-obsessed warmists. This week renewable energies manager Fritz Vahrenholt’s and geologist Sebastain Lüning’s much anticipated climate-catastrophe skeptic book “Die kalte Sonne” is also hitting bookstores everywhere.
Even the weather is cooperating!  When citizens pick up their copy of the flagship Spiegel magazine tomorrow morning at the newsstands, they’ll be shivering in temperatures down to -20°C, as Germany remains gripped in its coldest February freeze in 25 years. Temperature tomorrow morning in Berlin are forecast to dip to a frigid -17°C with no warming in sight.
There’s no way of knowing whether DER SPIEGEL will unload on Professor Vahrenholt and Dr. Lüning, take a more fair and balanced approach, or back them up. One thing is certain – the DER SPIEGEL story will push sales of Vahrenholt’s and Lüning’s book way up the overall best-seller list. The unwanted debate is unavoidable.
More than just the sun
One thing I have noticed: all the premature criticism from the warmists so far is focussed on the sun. I hate to tell you critics, guardians of the climate catastrophe narrative, but the book looks at a hell of a lot more than just the sun. We’re talking about over 800 cited sources (many peer-reviewed) and 80 graphics on a wide range of factors. I suggest you all hold your blabber and read the book first.
Expect lots of howling from the catastrophe-obsessed warmist zealots in the weeks ahead.
So pick up a Spiegel copy tomorrow (and the book) and let the debate begin!

"It’s not hard to see why Chris Grayling jumped at the opportunity to visit Heathrow airport early on Tuesday to welcome passengers landing on a dreary morning at Terminal 2. He was marking the launch of an air service from Flybe – which will now be operating four return flights from Newquay on the north coast of Cornwall to London seven days a week. This is a transport secretary made famous for his inability to actually transport things, whether that be people by train or goods over water (he’s even managed to stop cyclists making it safely from A to B) – and so for Grayling, a plane on a new flightpath taking off and landing on time is a much needed chance to claim an easy win and arrange a photo-op.  But while I’m sure travellers were thrilled to be greeted by grinning Grayling at baggage reclaim, news that more domestic flights are set to take off and land in Britain is not a cause for celebration. It’s remarkably irresponsible, even by this government’s standards, to embrace a growth in domestic air travel when global carbon emissions are on the up, as are global temperatures. To put it bluntly: it is entirely unsustainable while we’re in the midst of a climate emergency. Just this week, budget airline Ryanair was revealed to be one of Europe’s top 10 carbon emitters alongside nine coal plants; the company’s carbon footprint is up nearly 50% in the past five years. And while aviation accounts for about 3% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, it’s forecasted that by 2050 this could rise by up to 700% as growth in demand continues. There’s a complex conversation to be had about how we drastically limit international air travel in a way that reduces climate change while offering travel opportunities. But, let’s be honest, in a country as small as the United Kingdom the vast majority of domestic fights are far from essential. That said, yesterday afternoon I took a quick look online to see the options for travel from Newquay to London and back for early next week. On Great Western Railway, a Super Off-Peak return ticket purchased in advance for the 250-mile journey would set me back £116, and it takes up to five hours each way. Meanwhile, I’d get change from £100 if I decided to fly, and I could be disembarking in just over one hour. It’s a broken system that’s reflected across the UK which urgently needs fixing. It’s hard to quantify just how reckless unnecessary air travel is, and how misguided it is for our politicians to support it. According to the Aviation Environment Federation, taking a flight from Newquay to London sees (roughly) six times more emissions released per person than rail travel, and that’s before other emissions such as nitrogen oxides, which also contribute to global warming when released at such high altitudes, are taken into consideration. But while it remains faster and cheaper to jump on a plane, it’s difficult to expect travellers not to. For families on a budget, the difference in cost can end up being huge; company bosses intent on efficiency are likely to want employees to be in transit for a short a time as possible. It’s why an antidote to our addiction to air travel won’t be found in “the market” or through consumer choice – no good will come of leaving it up to the individual to give up the short-term convenience of slightly faster journeys for the longer-term ambition of having a planet to live on. That’s why we need bold governmental action if we’ve any chance of reducing emissions from travel. Instead of cosying up to airline executives at Heathrow, a transport minister should be campaigning to reverse the airport’s third runway plans. The state should be restricting all but essential domestic air travel in the UK and nationalising a sustainable rail service, subsidised where needed – intervention on this scale is sorely needed. It’s the role of the government to invest in sustainable employment for job losses that would follow: a Green New Deal in action. That should be a priority for any politician taking climate change seriously, but instead Grayling’s department is using public money to subsidise these Cornwall-London airfares. These are the things he should have been talking about at Heathrow this week, rather than singing the praises of air travel. In fact, the only silver lining to Grayling’s airport announcement that he hopes to see more and more flights traversing the length and breadth of Britain is that, given his track record, it’s a plan that will end up failing miserably. Lo and behold, just this morning Flybe cancelled flights amid talks of hub closures. Failing Grayling strikes again – maybe there’s hope for the planet after all … • Michael Segalov is a contributing editor to Huck magazine"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe media today in Germany are filled with the news of the ethanol debacle. 
The government has mandated that super grade gasoline be sold with a minimum content of 10% ethanol in Germany, so-called E10 gasoline. But as always, when the wishes of the government clash with the wishes of the markets and citizens, then you get chaos. That’s the case today in Germany.
Never mind that burning ethanol is an environmental debacle that leads to the destruction of forests and food shortages that lead to higher prices and more hunger worldwide, but it also burns less efficiently and causes damage to many cars. It is yet another well-intentioned program that is making things only worse. Nobody in Germany wants the stuff – neither the drivers nor the environmentalists.
WDR public TV has a report here (in German), which interviews an expert from the environmental group Bundesumwelt- und Naturschutz, Werner Reh, who calls the whole program “stupidity”:
Laws are passed where ethanol percentage requirements are mandated without even knowing where the quantities are going to come from. They have to be certified. A 35% reduction of CO2 has to be shown. Yet the indirect impacts on landuse are not even included in the calculation, and if you do that, then the entire CO2 reduction is wiped out completely.”
But German consumers are not avoiding ethanol for those reasons. Many are simply afraid that the 10% ethanol content will damage their auto engines. So what is the result? They aren’t buying the fuel blend and are opting for the more expensive super premium gasoline instead, paying about €0.40 per US gallon more.

Petrol stations aren’t selling the unwanted ethanol blended fuel. So with unsold E10 gasoline piling up, refineries will soon find themselves scaling back production and will incur additional costs, which eventually the consumer will have to bear.
Gas stations that are still offering the fuel will continue to do so. But the rest are refusing to order it. Holger Krawinkel, energy expert of the Federal Association of Consumer Centres (that’s the best translation I can come up with) offers a brilliant observation, read here:
With biofuels, the costs of CO2 savings are very high.”
Unfortunately that’s the case with almost all renewable energy forms, and not just with biofuels. And we should again ask ourselves what are these high costs for?
A couple of tenths of a degree less warming over 100 years.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe widespread frigid cold gripping Asia and Europe is illustrated by the following chart (Source here) .
Media outlets have reported that this is the worst February cold wave to hit Europe and western Russia in 25 years. Dozens have frozen to death over the last few days.
So it goes without saying that the warmists at their websites are truly desperate for an explanation – any explanation will do. It turns out that all the cold is caused by global warming, the warmist sites and one institute are now claiming. And, the global warming is going to cause winters to get even colder in the future, they say.
Their level of desperation is clearly illustrated by their most recent absurd claims to explain the cold. The reason for all the cold, writes warmist site klimaretter.de (climate rescuer) emphasis added:
It’s going to get much colder. So far 70 people have frozen to death in Central Europe, but this is only the start of the effects of global warming: The less summertime  ice coverage there is in the Arctic, the higher the probability is for Arctic cold in the following winter in Munich, Dresden, Potsdam, Warsaw or Kiev. That’s the result of a study from the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Ocean Sciences.”
The same rubbish is also being spewed by warmist site Klima der Gerechtigkeit (Climate of Justice). Both of these hard-up sites are referring to an Alfred Wegener Institute paper I mentioned a few days ago here.

Altered States
So how does a little local Arctic summertime warming freeze half the globe? The Alfred Wegener Institute says that in the summertime the warming melts the Arctic ice, which leads to a more exposed Arctic Ocean, which in turn then can release heat into the atmosphere. This heated atmosphere then triggers altered atmospheric dynamics that morph into massive widespread frigid cold waves sweeping down all over the northern hemisphere 6 months later.
You see, the situation was reversed back in the 1960s and 70s when all the extra summertime Arctic ice coverage led to all them warm Eurasian winters – you know – the ones with all the snow and cold in Europe?
Altered atmospheric dynamics where a little warm triggers massively amplified cold?
I’d say the Alfred Wegener Institute has become that weird little laboratory in that early 1980s film Altered States. Climate science trips, sensory deprivation, hallucinations, dormant genes – it’s all there folks!

"Your article on why women need to start investing to exercise more control over their futures (Why finance is a feminist issue, G2, 9 April) contains much sound advice. However, it neglects an important consideration. If, as Emilie Bellet explains, women are “looking more at where we want to be in 10, 20 or 30 years’ time”, then we also need to think hard about the kind of future our money is going to support. Many women – and men – would be horrified to think that the price for their own security is increased uncertainty and instability across the world, as many funds continue to rely heavily on the fossil fuel and extractive industries. Even so-called ethical funds are often only undertaking basic negative screening, for example ruling out pornography, weapons, tobacco and gambling, but with very little to say on climate risk. The real bottom line is that there is no money to be made on a dead planet. Happily, this can be a win-win situation. Increasingly, fund managers are recognising the risk of the “carbon bubble” and are starting to shift their own funds. And evidence is growing that over the long term, sustainable investments can outperform the broken business-as-usual market. But this shift won’t happen without ongoing consumer pressure on the financial sector. An influx of motivated women into this space presents an excellent opportunity.  At Friends of the Earth we have been campaigning for fossil fuel divestment and corporate accountability for many years. Through our innovation work we are currently piloting a new peer-led programme for women who want to take control of their finances, but in a way that supports their vision for a safe and liveable planet.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAnother “abnormal” baby is born.
Heike M. was born this morning at St. Peters hospital and weighed in at 3850 grams and was 57 cm long. Doctors said that she was heavier and longer than normal. The normal weight for a baby girl in Germany is 3250 grams and 51 cm long. Though bigger than normal babies can occur, their increasing frequency is a sign that size at birth is going up, experts say. If the trends continue, babies will outweigh their mothers by the year 3700.  
Also Heike’s hair was more reddish than normal, and not the blond we used to see more often, say 100 years ago. Moreover, Heike’s skin colour was too pale. Though German babies tend to be on the pale side, it is abnormal for a baby to be as pale as Heike. The last baby that was that pale was 2 and half years ago. Doctors report that St. Peters hospital has not seen a normal baby in about 15 years.
Last week Sven was born. He weighed in at 2850 grams and was 49 cm long. Doctors said that although smaller babies are not unusual, and will also occur in the future, Sven’s smaller size, they say, is attributable to “natural variability”. Mothers, they say, will however have to fear oversized abnormal babies in the future.
Maybe some readers by now are wondering what all this is supposed to mean. I’m merely using this baby example to demonstrate the absurdity of taking the statistic of a single random event and attaching too much significance to its deviation from the mean. This unfortunately has become standard practice in weather analysis and climate.

At the end of each month in weather, the statistics get tallied up and compared to a 30-year mean that is arbitrarily chosen. Nowadays if there is a single weather deviation from the mean, we are told that something is wrong and that something significant is happening. But as the above baby example shows, this is a ridiculous practice and we need to get away from it.
The German Weather Service (DWD) just released its statistics for March, 2012 (for Germany) and they tell us that the month was “too warm, too sunny, and too dry”, i.e. that once again the month was not normal. It appears that the German Weather Service, and especially the media, have forgotten that weather is never normal.
Indeed things are getting so bad that the media and desperate warmists are now fretting over half months, or even claiming that single weather events are climatically significant. It seems that deviations are no longer supposed to occur. More often than not we now hear in Germany claims like: “The first half of this month was 4°C warmer than normal”, or “the last 10 days of this month were the wettest in 33 years”, or “the winds in Hamburg in yesterday’s storm were the strongest in 6 years.” The public is supposed to believe that something is wrong with every deviation that occurs in a chaotic system.
We have to return back to reality and remember that with weather, anomaly is normal, and normal is anomaly. Weather anomalies are not climate trends. Anyone claiming otherwise is either a charlatan or a plain fool.
Note: The above baby characteristic statistics are arbitrary and selected only for the purpose of demonstrating a point. I don’t know what an average baby is.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn Germany the news from the NOAA that the Barrow, Alaska station has recorded a CO2 concentration at 400 ppm “for the first time” is sweeping through the media – along with fresh warnings of impending climate doom.

“The northern sites in our monitoring network tell us what is coming soon to the globe as a whole,” said Pieter Tans , an atmospheric scientist with NOAA’s Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL) in Boulder, Colo. “We will likely see global average CO2 concentrations reach 400 ppm about 2016.”
Average global levels of CO2 were 390.4 ppm in 2011, according to NOAA measurements.
The NOAA press release also writes that the concentration of the greenhouse gas has increased every year since 1959. “In the early 1960s, it rose about 0.7 ppm per year. For the last decade, it has been rising at about 2 ppm per year. That observed increase, independent of the seasonal ups and downs described above, is due to the accelerating pace of emissions from human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels.”

What impact has that had on temperature over the last decade?
Spiegel online tells us:
The data, however, have not shown any warming  for 13 years.
At the same time the question of whther the CO2 increase will warm the climate is still always disputed. The strength of the warming depends mostly on how much water evaporates; water vapour enhances the greenhouse effect considerably more than CO2. Estimates on the water vapour effect diverge greatly. Thousands of scientists are working on that question.
Global temperatures just aren’t listening to the climate models. And so much for consensus.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWe’ve been hearing stories that the UK government may have put the lives of its citizens at risk by keeping a forecast of cold winter secret from the public in a cynical attempt to mislead them. 
If this is true, then this government has squandered its public trust and is not fit to serve its citizens. Who needs a government that deceives the people it is entrusted to serve?
Benny Peiser has assembled 19 questions for the Government to answer, see his press release here.
 Here is Dr. Peiser’s letter to Louise Ellman, MP and Chair, Transport Select Committee:
————————————————————————–
Louise Ellman, MP
Chair, Transport Select Committee
House of Commons
London SW1A 0AA
5 January 2011
Dear Mrs Ellman
Transport System’s Winter Fiasco
I am writing to you on behalf of the Global Warming Policy Foundation regarding the transport system’s ill-preparedness in face of this year’s record cold winter.
The GWPF is calling on the Transport Committee to set up a parliamentary inquiry into the winter advice the Government received by the Met Office and the renewed failure of both the Government and local authorities to prepare the UK transport system for the third severe winter in a row.
This year’s winter fiasco has severely damaged the British economy – and its international reputation – as a result of the country’s ill-preparedness.
It would appear that the Met Office provided the government with contradictory winter advice and we need to find out what went wrong. Lessons have to be learned well in advance of the start of next year’s winter so that we are much better prepared if it is severe again.
Last summer, the Department of Transport carried out a study of the resilience of Britain’s transport infrastructure in the light of the two previous severe winters.
When the Quarmby Report (The Resilience of England’s Transport Systems in Winter) was published in late October, it entirely relied on the Met Office’s assurance that the chance of a severe winter and heavy snow would be relatively small and that the effect of climate change had further reduced the probability of severe winters in the UK; see also Transport chaos not an annual issue, say official report. Investment in more equipment may not be economical given rarity of British snow, says RAC Foundation chairman <http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/dec/21/transport-met-office>
In recent days, the Met Office has stated that it apparently changed its original advice in October and actually warned the Cabinet Office that the start of winter would be exceptionally cold. It would appear that the Met Office’s cold warning was kept secret from the public.
According to media reports, the Cabinet Office has been unwilling to confirm whether or not it failed to pass on the Met Office warning to local and road authorities, airports and water companies.
Not only is the lack of Government preparedness a cause for concern, but we wonder whether there may be another reason for keeping the cold warning under wraps, a motive that the Met Office and the Cabinet Office may have shared: Not to undermine the then forthcoming UN Climate Change Conference in Cancun.
Throughout October and November, the Met Office repeatedly pushed and published their key message in the run-up to the UN climate summit – that 2010 would probably turn out to be the hottest year on record, culminating in these Cancun-timed media reports: Cancun climate change summit: 2010 was hottest year on record <http://www.telegraph.co.uk/topics/weather/8175591/Cancun-climate-change-summit-2010-was-hottest-year-on-record.html>
The Met Office was represented at the UN Climate Summit in Cancun by key scientists who briefed news media about their key message; see Scientific evidence is Met Office focus at Cancun <http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/corporate/pressoffice/2010/pr20101126b.html>
It will be important to establish whether the Met Office consulted with government officials about the UK’s Cancun strategy and what effect this may have had on the handling of the ‘secret’ cold winter warning.
The transport minister Philip Hammond has asked the government’s chief scientific adviser whether the last three cold winters may signal a ‘step change’ in weather in the UK.
The Met Office appears to deny this possibility. In its submission to the Quarmby Report, the Met Office claims that the chances of a harsh winter are receding steadily. Yet, the Met Office models were contradicted by Sir David King, the former government’s chief scientific adviser, who has publicly warned that the government should plan for more cold winters in the next few years.
It is evident that Sir David King has serious doubts about the reliability of the Met Office’s computer models. This manifest contradiction is further undermining the credibility of the Met Office which makes it all the more important to properly investigate the underlying problem of its erroneous winter projections and government advice over the last three years.
In light of the renewed failure to prepare the UK and its transport system for a prolonged and harsh winter, the following questions need to be addressed in order to avoid future debacles:

1. Why did the Met Office publish on its website estimates in late October showing a 60 per cent to 80 per cent chance of warmer-than-average temperatures this winter? What was the scientific basis of this probabilistic estimate?
2. Why did the Met Office provide the government with a secret forecast about a exceptionally cold start of the winter, at the same time it was publishing an opposite forecast to the public?
3. Did the government conspire to keep the Met Office forecast secret in the run-up to the Cancun climate summit?
4. Did the Cabinet Office fail to take appropriate action in response to the forecast and inform the relevant authorities to prepare the country, to keep the highways clear, to prepare airports?
5. Why did the government let its Winter Fuel Allowance budget be used up with only a fraction of the winter gone?
6. On what scientific basis did the Met Office tell the Cabinet Office that there were early indications of an exceptionally cold start to winter?
7. Why did the Met Office confirm to the news media on 27 October that its probability map showed significant warming in the months ahead?
8. Has the late October prediction by the Met Office that this winter would be mild affected planning for this winter? If so, what is the best estimate of how much this has cost the country?
9. In 2009, the Met Office predicted a 65% chance that the winter of 2009/10 would be milder than normal. Has the Met Office subsequently explained what went wrong with its computer modelling?
10. What is the statistical and scientific basis for the Met Office’s estimate of a 1-in-20 chance of a severe winter?
11. Has the Met Office changed its view, or its calculations, following the harsh winters of 2008, 2009 and 2010?
12. Is the Met Office right to be confident that the severe winters of the last three years are not related?
13. Which severe weather alerts were issued by the Met Office and when?
14. Although the Met Office stopped sending its 3-month forecasts to the media, it would appear that this service is still available to paying customers, the Government and Local Authorities for winter planning. What was their advice, in September/October, for the start of winter 2010?
15. Has the Met Office been the subject of any complaints from its paying customers regarding the quality of its advice?
16. Is it appropriate that the chairman of the Met Office is a member, or a former member of climate pressure groups or carbon trading groups?
17. Should senior Met Office staff (technically employed by the MoD) make public comments advocating political action they see necessary to tackle climate change?
18. Has the government evaluated different meteorological service providers and has it ensured that it is using the most accurate forecaster?
19. What plans has the government to privatise the Met Office?
In view of the high level of public interest in this matter, we shall be releasing the text of this letter to the press. I look forward to hearing from you.
Yours sincerely,
Dr Benny Peiser

"When measures designed to curb climate change have a beneficial effect and result in a greener planet, it is cheering. The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has been on a relentless upward trend but things would be far worse if countries in the northern hemisphere were not planting forests and restoring natural habitats. Measurements taken over 60 years of the uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere during the growing season show that, north of the equator, plants are absorbing more carbon than they used to.  This is not enough to halt global warming but it is at least slowing it down. The increase in uptake became apparent in the 1990s but has again grown significantly since the turn of the century. Sadly, this has not been replicated in the southern hemisphere, where many tropical forests are still being destroyed at an alarming rate. The figures from the north have surprised scientists, who had not anticipated this so-called carbon sink in their climate models. Some contributions are from the use of extra fertiliser in Asia, but the scientists believe that the main driver is the growth of young forests, particularly in China and North America, which is locking the carbon in young trees. It proves that planting trees and restoring forests works. "

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhat do the intellectually challenged do when they’re out-matched in debate and fully exhausted of arguments?
You do what the University of Osnabrück has done: you prevent the opponent from entering the debating arena. You call it off and closed-mindedly insist you’re right.
Hat-tip: Die Achse Des Guten
This is what is happening today with the University of Osnabrück and Prof. Dr. Fritz Vahrenholt, who had been invited by the university to give a speech on February 8.
It’s a vivid look into the cowardice of today’s German academia and it’s intellectual depletion.
The problem is that Vahrenholt has just written a controversial climate skeptical book (Die kalte Sonne) together with geologist Dr Sebastian Lüning – a book that is politically incorrect because it doubts the climate catastrophe fairy tale. The book is already near or at the number 1 position in Amazon.de bestseller list for environment and ecology books, and is thus causing the warmists to scurry in panic. The sense of alarm and fear that have gripped the climate establishment is so strong that the University of Osnabrück decided it would be improper to have Vahrenholt as a speaker.
Vahrenholt got his dis-invitation 2 days ago. Openly questioning the dogma of catastrophic global warming is not welcome. The University prefers to stay in the Dark Ages.
Here’s the public invitation:
In the series of presentations “University Speeches” of the University of Osnabrück, Prof. Dr. Fritz Vahrenholt – RWE Innogy, Essen will hold a speech titled “The Climate Catastrophe is not Taking Place”.
The IPCC is wrong. The climate debate has to be restarted. In contradiction to prognoses, there has been no global warming in over 10 years. Even with rising CO2 emissions the warming for this century will not exceed 2°C. The warming effect of CO2 is over-estimated. The latest findings show that ocean cycles and the sun, which recently entered a longer-term period of quite activity, has played a greater role in the course of climate than previously assumed.

Date: 08 February 2012
Time: 18.00 h
Location: Schlossaula (Osnabrück)”
Here is the incredible letter of cancellation:
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,
When we invited Prof. Vahrenholt in May, 2011, it was done with regards to a very good speech he had given in Greifswald (Greifswald Speeches – a Foundation of the Alfried Krupp College Greifswald) on the topic of “Options for the Future Energy Supply of Germany”. This topic and the speaker also were accepted by the Osnabrück University Professorium.
When we invited him, we suggested this topic, which he did not object. When we asked him to provide us with the exact title of his speech 3 weeks before it was scheduled to take place, he surprised us with the provocative title ‘The Climate Catastrophe Is Not taking Place’. The reactions to this announcement range from positive to critical, and to negative. Independent of these reactions, we have become convinced that such an assertion requires ‘a counter speech’ from a climate scientist and that the subsequent discussion be led by a competent moderator. Because it is not possible to organize this before February 8, we will search another date in 2012, in agreement with Prof Vahrenholt and the 2 yet-to-be-named individuals. We will inform you on a timely basis.
Yours sincerely,
Prof. Dr. Karlheinz Altendorf
Prof. Dr. Wolfgang Asholt”
So unhindered, free dissent and questioning are unwelcome. Not believing that the world is on the road to catastrophe is “provocative”. Sorry, but this is the kind of insecure behaviour ones sees from dictatorial regimes. It’s intellectual insolvency.
Things really are that bad in Germany’s academia today – at least at the University of Osnabrück.
Two questions to professors Altendorf and Asholt: What are you afraid of? Does a movement steeped in fear and insecurity have any chance of victory? Your letter is as clear an admission one could get that the answer is “definitely no”.
Your decision is as about as remote as one can get from the true spirit of academia.

"Josh Frydenberg spent the first night of the election campaign defending the Coalition’s decision to approve the groundwater management plan for the Adani coalmine to a room of 600 voters in his electorate of Kooyong, where climate change has emerged as a key issue. Speaking at a candidates’ forum hosted by the local environment group Lighter Footprints at Hawthorn Arts Centre on Thursday night, Frydenberg said the project still had to pass nine more approvals after the environment minister, Melissa Price, granted the latest approval on Tuesday, of which he said the “most fundamental” were with the Queensland government. “In this case on the water issue, we took the advice of the CSIRO, of Geosciences Australia, and that is why it has gone to the next stage,” he said. Labor has indicated it may push for a review of the approval decision because the timing of the election announcement meant a planned estimates hearing where the CSIRO would explain the extent of its advice did not go ahead. The Adani coalmine is expected to cause difficulties for Frydenberg in Kooyong. Of the six candidates at the forum – also there were Labor’s Jana Stewart, the Greens’ Julian Burnside and the independents Oliver Yates, Bill Chandler and Angelina Zubac – he was the only one who did not criticise the project. About a quarter of the 260 questions submitted by the audience in the packed venue were about Adani. Yates, a former Liberal party member and chief executive of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, said the project had lost all social licence. “For a government that represents its people and for a member who represents this audience to be continuing to support a project that its electors in this area do not support is an extraordinary position for a local member to take,” he said. Burnside said suggestions that voters in Kooyong would vote solely on economic rather than environmental issues was “a mark of the contempt with which the Liberal party see this electorate”. “They can’t even imagine the possibility that this electorate would turf them out.” He dismissed concerns of sovereign risk over the Adani project as “a meaningless expression as a matter of law”. “I would say if there’s a contract which Adani could enforce I would hold to account those members of the outgoing Liberal government who signed the contract,” he said. Yates, Burnside and Chandler had the strongest support from the crowd. Stewart said she “personally [didn’t] agree with Adani” but that Labor would take a “balanced approach”, prompting Chandler to hop to his feet and step from side to side, saying: “This is Labor jumping from one foot to another on Adani, they keep moving on it all the time.” At a separate climate change forum in Mildura, the Nationals candidate for the western Victorian seat of Mallee, Anne Webster, engaged in some heavy product differentiation from her Queensland party colleagues. “The only people I’m beholden to are the voters of the Mallee electorate,” she said. “Some of you possibly thought I would come tonight and talk about climate change not being real … I want to assure you that I make up my own mind, have my own opinions and I’m not afraid to stand up to others.” While four independent candidates at the forum emphatically panned the Adani project, Webster said: “Renewables ought to be our focus.” She said she would not be afraid to cross the floor of parliament on a range of issues. Webster is seeking to continue the Nationals’ hold over the seat after it was vacated by Andrew Broad following allegations of inappropriate conduct during an official government trip overseas. The forum was divided on whether there needed to be a federal royal commission into the Murray-Darling basin plan, with Webster and the independent Cecilia Moar, a former farmer, opposed, and the independents Jason Modica, Allen Ridgeway and Ray Kingston in support."

By Ed Caryl
We know, from ice measurements, measurements at Mauna Loa, Hawaii, Barrow Alaska, and the South Pole, that atmospheric carbon dioxide has been increasing in our atmosphere since the beginning of the industrial age. We also know that temperatures have been increasing in that same time interval, as the earth warms up from the “Little Ice Age.” The proponents of the theory that man’s production of CO2 has resulted in this temperature increase, use that idea to predict future temperature increases based on our continuing to use fossil fuels and continuing to force an increase in atmospheric CO2. But, is the increase in CO2 due to man; or is the increase in CO2 natural, due to rising temperatures caused by natural means?
The natural CO2 flux to and from oceans and land plants amounts to approximately 210 gigatons of carbon annually. Man currently causes about 8 gigatons of carbon to be injected into the atmosphere, about 4% of the natural annual flux. There are estimates that about half of man’s emissions are taken up by nature. But is that true? Are there variations in the natural flux? Could those explain the CO2 increase?

Figure 1: From NOAA and the IPCC, here.
In June, 2011, Dr. Murry Salby gave a presentation at a IUGG meeting in Melbourne, Australia. This presentation was mentioned later on Judith Curry’s blog, and some others. DirkH brought this presentation to my attention recently in comments on NTZ, and I tracked down the YouTube version. In that presentation, Dr. Salby plotted the changes in CO2 and changes in global temperature and soil moisture. The soil moisture data is behind a paywall, but the monthly global temperature and sea surface temperature sets are easily and freely available from WoodForTrees. The annual carbon fossil carbon release figures are also available, covering nearly the same period as the Mauna Loa CO2 numbers.
The differential changes in CO2 are calculated on a two-year centered average of the monthly figures, then taking the monthly differential on that average. This gives a somewhat smoothed number, removing the annual cycles, yet preserving the timing.

Figure 2: Monthly change in CO2 at three measuring stations.

Figure 3: Magnified view of Figure 2.
Figure 3 is a magnified view of Figure 2, the interval from 1990 to 2000, showing the effect of the Mt. Pinatubo eruption in June 1992 and the El Niños of 1995 and 1998. The sharp cooling from the volcanic eruption appears before June 1992 because of the centered averaging to remove the noise and the annual variation.
Changes in CO2 seem muted at the South Pole, and the Barrow station is noisy as well as having a somewhat short record. Effects at the equator appear delayed at the stations closer to the poles. For those reasons, we will use the Mauna Loa record. It seems evident from Figures 2 and 3 that temperature influences CO2. But is it the global land and ocean temperature, or just the sea-surface temperature that is most important? Figure 4 is a plot of global surface temperature and monthly CO2 change:

Figure 4: Global surface temperature and monthly CO2 change.
The plots in Figure 4 look very similar; the question is how similar?

Here is the scatter diagram:

Figure 5: Scatter diagram of the data in Figure 4. Note the R2 value is 0.47636.
Here is the same comparison using sea surface temperature (HADSST2).

Figure 6: Plot of the monthly sea surface anomaly and monthly CO2 change.

Figure 7: Corresponding scatter plot showing an R2 value of 0.5528.
Sea surface temperature seems to be driving atmospheric CO2 changes. This makes sense because CO2 solubility in seawater is temperature dependent.
But what of man’s CO2 additions to the atmosphere? The data for carbon release is annual data, so the graphs are much coarser in appearance, and the change in CO2 must be annualized.

Figure 8: Annual change in fossil carbon use and the annual change in CO2.
 
Figure 9: Scatter diagram of carbon emissions change vs atmospheric CO2 change. Note that the R2 value is 0.05386, less than a tenth of the value of SST vs CO2.
It is ten times as likely that atmospheric CO2 is coming from natural sources, namely the warming ocean surface, as it is likely that it is coming from anthropogenic sources. The changes in CO2 track ocean surface temperature, not global carbon emissions. Burning fossil fuels is not increasing atmospheric CO2. Recovery from the Little Ice Age, driven by the sun, is causing the oceans to release CO2. It is temperature driving CO2 release, not the other way around. Just as it has always been.
As the sun gets quiet in the next few years, sea surface temperature will begin to fall, and the rise in CO2 will cease. If the sun stays quiet for 30 or 40 years, ocean surface temperatures will fall far enough to reverse the CO2 rise, the globe will enter a new little ice age, and things will get really interesting.

"Ryanair has become the first non-coal company to join Europe’s top 10 carbon emitters, according to EU figures. The Irish airline, which transports 130 million people a year, declared 9.9 megatonnes of greenhouse gas emissions in 2018, up 6.9% on last year and 49% over the last five years, according to data in the EU’s latest emissions trading system registry. Andrew Murphy, the aviation manager at the European Federation for Transport and Environment, said: “When it comes to climate, Ryanair is the new coal. This trend will only continue until Europe realises that this undertaxed and under-regulated sector needs to be brought into line, starting with a tax on kerosene and the introduction of mandates that force airlines to switch to zero-emission jet fuel.” Ryanair’s chief executive, Michael O’Leary, dismissed climate change concerns as “complete and utter rubbish” in an interview two years ago. His airline is now ranked as Europe’s 10th worst emitter, after nine coal plants. Poland’s Bełchatów is the worst polluter, producing 38 megatonnes of planet-warming emissions annually. Coal emissions are falling, though, as Europe’s transition to cleaner energy continues. In stark contrast, emissions from airlines, which are exempted from fuel taxes and VAT on tickets, have soared by 26.3% since 2014, outpacing all other transport sectors. EasyJet was Europe’s next worst-performing airline, in 31st place on the list, after an 11% rise in emissions in 2018. It was followed by Lufthansa, Norwegian and British Airways, according to analysis of the EU data by the thinktank Sandbag and Transport and Environment. Aviation is responsible for about 3% of Europe’s greenhouse gas emissions, but industry forecasts suggest this could rise by up to 700% by 2050 as the sector grows. Murphy described aviation as “Europe’s biggest climate failure”. Europe’s airlines pay about €800m (£680m) a year for their rights to pollute. But some studies suggest this sum is eclipsed by the €27bn they would have to stump up if their fuel tax and VAT exemptions were ended. Despite increased attention from policymakers, the sector receives up to 85% of its EU emissions trading allowances free, with Ryanair consequently saving €96.6m in 2018. Kevin Anderson, a professor of energy and climate change at the University of Manchester, said: “Ryanair use new and efficient aircraft rammed to the rafters with passengers, illustrating how technology alone cannot reconcile aviation’s rocketing emissions with the Paris climate commitments. “If we genuinely care for our children’s futures, we need to drive down the demand for aviation. This will require stringent regulations focusing on frequent fliers rather than those taking the occasional trip.” A Ryanair spokesperson said: “Ryanair is Europe’s greenest and cleanest airline. Passengers travelling on Ryanair have the lowest CO2 emissions per km travelled than any other airline.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterAnother of Germany’s leading dailies, DIE WELT, has a skeptical piece (for a change) on global warming – written by Dirk Maxeiner and Michael Miersch. Read here. It starts:
The claim that man was causing global warming has long been said to be irrefutable. But this is contradicted by renown scientists but also by the latest data.”
My how the times have changed. Remember how just a few years ago the debate was over and the science was settled? Die Welt reminds us:
In the middle of the last decade, former UN Secretary Kofi Annan handed down the final verdict: ‘The few skeptics who are left and trying to sow the seeds of doubt should be seen for what they are: out of touch, depleted of arguments and washed up.’ Since then, much has changed“
But today, once written off skeptical scientists are now re-emerging. Maxeiner and Miersch write:
Svensmark, whose research in this field had long been ignored, is now causing people to change their minds. Those who are convinced of anthropogenic climate change have suddenly gotten much more careful. And those who kept their doubts hidden, have suddenly become braver.”
Take Professor Fritz Vahrenholt and Dr. Sebastian Lüning, for example. DIE WELT is just the latest major media outlet to put controversial, new skeptical book Die kalte Sonne in the public focus, following right on the heels of FOCUS magazine and DIE ZEIT. This early media attention is likely just a preview of what is to come in the days and weeks ahead.
For many establishments this is all going to cause some major indigestion, like the University of Osanbrück, for example.  Maxeiner & Miersch write:

This politically correct field of science still has not gotten used to the new situation. When the University of Osnabrück found out that Vahrenholt wanted to speak about his book at his scheduled speech, he was promptly dis-invited. The reason: It was necessary to first organize a the counter-speech by a climate scientist.
Just one problem. One couldn’t be found.”
Maxeiner and Miersch should have mentioned that the University of Osnabrück also deemed skepticism of the climate catastrophe as “provocative”.
The book comes out next week. I’m quite excited about how the greenheads and alarmist kooks are going to react.
Chronic insistence of the “climate catastrophe” is not really normal
Normally the book ought to be good news. It’s a powerful argument that the climate catastrophe is not coming and that the science underpinning the theory of a coming climate catastrophe is pathetically weak, crappy, and so cannot be taken seriously at all.
But oddly, from a psychological point of view, the chronic alarmists appear obsessed with the end of the world, and actually seem to hope that it will come. And it’s as if it couldn’t come soon enough for them. If I were like that, I’d seek professional help and counseling. That’s just not healthy.
This reminds me of all the elite kooks now down in Antarctica claiming the ice there is melting faster than ever. Yet, the data shows the contrary – ice growth trending up over ther last 30 years!

According to this site here:
Dr. Lean received a B.Sc. (Hons), Physics in 1974 from the Australian National University, Australia, where she was awarded the Priscilla Fairfield Bok Prize as the university’s best female student in the field of science. In 1980, she completed a Ph.D. in atmospheric physics from the University of Adelaide, Australia. She currently serves as the NTZ April Fools prank of 2011.”
Sorry guys. You really ought to check the calendar before believing every thing you read. Happy First of April Day!

"The charity running the Edinburgh international science festival is to ban sponsorship from oil companies including Shell and Total after protests by climate campaigners. Edinburgh Science said on Wednesday it realised its commitment to educating people on climate change was substantially compromised by accepting money from fossil fuel companies.  The charity said the oil industry “is not moving fast enough” to cut greenhouse gas emissions, adding that “climate change is without doubt an urgent threat of unprecedented magnitude”. Edinburgh Science has taken money from Total and Exxon to pay for its “Generation Science” tours of Scottish schools, promoting science as a career in classrooms, as well as from Shell and the Scottish Oil Club. Climate activists had warned Edinburgh Science it faced protests during this year’s festival, which starts this weekend. Protesters believe the festival does not do enough to educate visitors about the threats posed by climate change. The Scottish Oil Club was targeted by Extinction Rebellion activists last month when it held its annual dinner at the National Museum of Scotland, leading to 14 activists being charged. The Edinburgh international festival dropped BP as a sponsor in 2017. One science festival event for families this year involves teaching children how to find and drill for oil, inviting participants to construct a scale-model drilling rig. In contrast, this year’s Edinburgh medal for scientific achievement is being awarded as part of the festival to Christiana Figueres, the executive secretary of the UN framework convention on climate change. Edinburgh Science said: “With the issues of climate change ever present and urgent, we feel increasingly compromised by the conflict between accepting sponsorship from fossil fuel companies and programming events that scrutinise the main causes of climate change. “The UN intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) calls for a dramatic and immediate reduction in the amount of fossil fuels consumed if we are to keep global warming to no more than 1.5C. “Whilst we see change happening in the oil and gas sector and appreciate that the demands on them are complex, we are of the view that the sector is not moving fast enough to meet the IPCC targets and that there is a conflict between their behaviour and the underlying science.” Tara Wight, a spokeswoman for the campaign group Science Unstained, said the charity’s decision was welcome. “By being associated with science outreach events, fossil fuel companies aim to clean up their image and present themselves as responsible organisations that are in alignment with scientific consensus on climate change. “Sponsoring educational and cultural organisations is a cheap and effective means of improving their public image while continuing to destroy the earth.”"
"A fresh wave of youth strikes for climate action will hit towns and cities across the UK on Friday, as a government report revealed that the nation is set to miss its emissions targets. More than 60 demonstrations involving tens of thousands of young people are expected from Parliament Square in London to sites in Leeds, Manchester and Brighton. They follow the global strike on 15 March, when more than 1 million young people across the world took action to demand rapid action to tackle the climate crisis.  The movement began when Swedish student Greta Thunberg started a solo school strike in August. The protests have been widely praised, although some have criticised the students for skipping school. On Friday, many UK students will already be on holiday. “Young people in the UK are sending those in power a clear message: we won’t accept anything less than urgent climate action,” said Anna Taylor, 18, from London and co-founder of the UK Student Climate Network. “Our futures, the health of our environment and the lives of those around the world already suffering the devastation of the climate crisis are not up for debate. We need [leaders] to act to protect people and planet.” On Wednesday, Green party MP Caroline Lucas challenged Theresa May to join the leaders of all the other major parties who have already agreed to meet Thunberg when she visits the UK on 23 April. Thunberg has already met UN secretary general António Guterres, the pope and addressed the Davos summit. The prime minister declined to say she would meet Thunberg, saying: “I often hear young people tell of the importance of climate change.” May added: “This government has a fine record on climate change.” However, a government report published on Thursday showed the UK is now set to miss its 2025 and 2030 emissions targets by an even larger margin than before. “Many policies which will affect the 2020s and beyond have not yet been developed to the point at which they can be included in these projections,” it said. “With our young people coming out on to the streets in record numbers calling for a structural change to tackle the climate crisis, the public will not forgive failure on this scale,” said Rebecca Long-Bailey, Labour’s shadow business secretary. Concern about climate change is higher than ever amongst UK students – 91% – according to a rolling opinion poll for the National Union of Students, which began in 2014. In Cambridge, several hundred school children plan to lie on the ground in a “die-in” protest to demand urgent action against climate change. They will wear blue to highlight the impacts of flooding and sea level rise on future generations and on the people of Mozambique and Zimbabwe who were hit by Cyclone Idai in March. Rowan Williams, former head of the Anglican church and master of Magdalene College at the University of Cambridge, will join the protest. “It’s a great sign of hope that so many of our young people are willing to stand up and be counted. This is their world, and our generation has come close to wrecking it,” he said. Ella Hone, at Chesterton Community College, said: “This Friday is my 12th birthday, so as a present I would like people to understand how important it is not only to me, but to everyone. Climate change is affecting all life on earth [and] we desperately need to stop it.” While the once-a-month strikes are expected to be large in the UK, Brazil, India and the Baltic nations on Friday, elsewhere weekly strikes have continued, particularly in Germany and Belgium. Luisa Neubauer, a youth striker from Hamburg, said 20,000 were expected to protest again on Friday. Neubauer has put the demands for climate action to Germany’s economy environment ministers. “We still don’t see that our government has understood what historical and global responsibility it carries,” she said. “So we really don’t have a choice but to keep going. For us young generations it’s an existential question.” Around the world, strikes are expected in 500 towns and cities in 70 countries on Friday, according to the Fridays for Future website. “These striking school children might not be able to vote yet, but they’re certainly changing the face and pace of the debate – this is exactly what we’ve all been waiting for,” said Helen Clarkson, CEO of The Climate Group, which has agreements from 200 multinational companies and 220 state and regional governments to take significant climate action. “For the last 20 to 30 years, the environmental movement has been waiting for the public to care about climate change,” she said. “[The young people] taking to the streets to protest, are bringing exactly the energy and urgency that is needed to transform the conversation.” Extinction Rebellion activists have said they will “shut down London” on Monday by blocking roads in the capital, as part of global protests by that movement."
"In the past few months I have started putting down roots. It’s a cliche but it’s literally what I’m doing. I spend my weekends transforming the tired old lawn into garden beds, layering woodchips, straw and horse shit I’ve shovelled from the paddocks next door into rich soil to grow my lettuces and kale. I have always loved gardening but now, more than ever, working with the earth has taken on an element of the spiritual. As a teenager, like many suburban white girls, I got way into Wicca, that gentle, nature-centred neo-pagan religion beloved by would-be witches everywhere. Much later, in my early 20s, I revisited witchcraft, finding an unstructured feminine spirituality that helped me make sense of the world.  Like many other young women I loved the playfulness of astrology and the tarot, but what always appealed to me most was the sense of communion with the natural world. Now, at a point of genuine global climate crisis, I am beginning to see how valuable fostering that connection can be. Women have long been associated with nature, usually to our detriment. An enduring, exasperating thorn in the side of feminism has been the persistent belief that women are inherently closer to the physical world, and to our animal bodies, than men, disqualifying us from our right to intellectual or cultural pursuits beyond the home. Simone de Beauvoir wrote about it when she described woman as being “more enslaved to the species than the male” thanks to the embodied reality of human reproduction; the anthropologist Sherry B Ortner wrote in 1974 that associating women with nature handily allows us to subjugate half of the world’s population, while asserting confidently that it is simply the natural way of things. It’s all rubbish, of course; as Ortner put it, all humans have a physical body and a sense of nonphysical mind. And, certainly, we can’t be bound to either by something as ephemeral as gender. But I think this correlation of women to nature, which has been oppressive and restrictive for so long, can now be a source of power and unity for women who are concerned – as we all should be – about the future of our natural environment. My favourite way to think of the witch is as a woman drawing strength from what ought to subdue her. When you think of it this way, a whole coven of earth witches emerges among the women of Australian agriculture. Much of what we associate with the figure of the witch concerns women’s knowledge of the natural world: plants for eating and healing, solstices for planting and harvesting, cycles of the world by which to set the cycles of the home. When I part the mulch to plant seedlings, or when I forage blackberries and wild brassica while I’m walking the dog, I feel a sense of connection to all the planting, farming and foraging women who’ve come before me. And though many of the farmers I’ve spoken to would probably balk at the idea of identifying as a witch, the term taps into a long lineage of women’s knowledge about the earth. Women in agriculture seem the most logical inheritors. Regenerative agriculture is a radical new approach that privileges soil health and holistic farming. In Australia many more women are involved in regenerative agricultural practices than are in traditional agriculture, which remains male-dominated. It can be tempting to attribute this unquestioningly to the notion that women are somehow inherently more in tune with nature but that’s neither accurate nor useful. The reality is that many farming women inordinately take on the role of childcare and food preparation – and this is what makes them experts in their field. They see the connections between earth and food and human health. Living those connections feels like the most conscious, everyday kind of witchcraft. It’s easy to dismiss this kind of thinking as kumbaya nonsense but that’s partly because the impulse is so ingrained in us to devalue anything associated with the feminine – in this case, something as objectively neutral and undeniably necessary as the Earth on which we stand. For a long time, just as we have associated women with nature, we have coded nature as feminine and, as we do with all other things coded feminine, we have degraded, exploited and subjugated it. But taking up the position of the witch – someone who values the feminine, and defiantly claims the knowledge and power of the bodily and natural – shows how to completely reimagine our relationship with the Earth and, hopefully, to change the future of all who live on it for the better. • Sam George-Allen is the author of Witches: What Women Do Together"

"I don’t expect much joy in writing about climate breakdown. On one side, there is grief and fear; on the other side, machines. I became an environmentalist because I love the living world, but I spend much of my life thinking about electricity, industrial processes and civil engineering. Technological change is essential, but to a natural historian it often feels cold and distancing. Today, however, I can write about something that thrills me: the most exciting field of research I have covered in years. Most climate scientists agree that it is now too late to prevent 1.5C or more of global heating only by cutting our production of greenhouse gases. Even if we reduced our emissions to zero tomorrow, we would probably overshoot this crucial temperature limit. To prevent a full-spectrum catastrophe, we need not only to decarbonise our economy in the shortest possible time, but also to draw down carbon dioxide that has already been released. But how? The best-known proposal is called bio-energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). This means growing wood or straw in plantations, burning it in power stations to produce electricity, capturing the carbon dioxide from the exhaust gases and burying it in geological formations. Yet, if deployed at scale, it is likely to trigger either an ecological or a humanitarian disaster. One BECCS proposal, favoured by certain governments, would cover an area three times the size of India with plantations. This involves converting agricultural land, in which case BECCS would cause mass starvation, or converting wild land, in which case almost lifeless plantations would replace 50% of the world’s remaining natural forests. Even so, it might not be effective, as any carbon savings would be counteracted by the use of nitrogen fertiliser and the release of greenhouse gases from the soil as it’s churned up for planting. BECCS can lead only to catastrophe, and should be immediately abandoned. Another option is direct air capture: extracting carbon dioxide with machines. Aside from the expense, which is likely to be massive, the amount of steel and concrete required to build these machines could help to push the world beyond certain climate tipping points before the positive effects are felt. None of this is necessary, however, because there is a much better and cheaper way of drawing carbon from the air. Natural climate solutions do it through the restoration of living systems. The greatest potential identified so far – as so much land can be used this way – is in protecting and restoring natural forests and allowing native trees to repopulate deforested land. The greatest drawdown potential per hectare (though the total area is smaller) is the restoration of coastal habitats such as mangroves, salt marsh and seagrass beds. They stash carbon 40 times faster than tropical forests can. Peaty soils are also vital carbon stores. They are currently being oxidised by deforestation, drainage, drying, burning, farming and mining for gardening and fuel. Restoring peat, by blocking drainage channels and allowing natural vegetation to recover, can suck back much of what has been lost. These are the best-studied natural climate solutions. They could help to solve two existential problems at once: climate breakdown and ecological breakdown. Their likely contribution is enormous – bigger than almost anyone guessed a few years ago – and other possibilities have scarcely been explored. For example, we currently have little idea of what the impact of industrial fishing may be on the seabed’s vast carbon store. By disturbing the sediments and lifting the carbon they contain into the water column, trawlers and dredgers are likely to expose it to oxygen, turning it into carbon dioxide. One study suggests that repeated trawling in the north-west Mediterranean has caused a reduction in carbon storage in the top 10 centimetres of sediments of up to 52%. Given the vast area trawled every year (most of the seabed on the world’s continental shelves), the climate impact could be enormous. Closing large parts of the seas to trawling could turn out to be a crucial climate strategy. Scientists have only begun to explore how the recovery of certain animal populations could radically change the carbon balance. For instance, forest elephants and rhinos in Africa and Asia and tapirs in Brazil are natural foresters, maintaining and extending their habitats as they swallow the seeds of trees and spread them, sometimes across many miles, in their dung. White rhinos can play a major role in preventing runaway wildfires in African savannahs: their grazing prevents dry grass building up. If wolves were allowed to reach their natural populations in North America, one paper suggests, their suppression of herbivore populations would stop as much carbon being released every year as that produced by 30-70m cars. Healthy populations of predatory crabs and fish protect the carbon in salt marshes, as they prevent herbivorous crabs and snails wiping out the plants that hold the marshes together. What I love about natural climate solutions is that we should be doing all these things anyway. Instead of making painful choices and deploying miserable means to a desirable end, we can defend ourselves from disaster by enhancing our world of wonders. However, nothing should be done without the involvement and consent of indigenous people and other local communities. Nor should damaging projects, such as monocultural plantations, be passed off as natural climate solutions. As a paper published this week in Nature shows, several governments are attempting this deception. Today, a small group of us is launching a campaign for natural climate solutions to receive the commitment and funding they deserve. At the moment, though their potential is huge, they have been marginalised in favour of projects that may be worse than useless, but which are profitable for corporations. Governments discuss the climate crisis and the ecological crisis in separate meetings when both disasters could be addressed together. We have set up a dedicated website, produced an animation and written a letter to governments and international bodies signed by prominent activists, scientists and artists. We don’t want natural climate solutions to be used as a substitute for the rapid and comprehensive decarbonisation of our economies. The science tells us both are needed: the age of carbon offsets is over. But what this thrilling field of study shows is that protecting and rewilding the world’s living systems is not just an aesthetically pleasing thing to do. It is an essential survival strategy. • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"
"The UK’s biggest teaching union is to decide whether to object to fossil fuel giant Ineos sponsoring the school Daily Mile initiative over allegations the company is using the event to greenwash its image. Campaigners accuse Ineos, owned by the UK’s richest man, Sir Jim Ratcliffe, of endangering the wellbeing of future generations through its fracking activities and plastics production.  On Saturday the executive of the National Education Union will debate a call for the schools to oppose Ineos’s sponsorship of the event, which sees tens of thousands of children take part in an outdoor run each week. The campaign is being supported by the UK Student Climate Network, which helped coordinate the recent school strikes that saw more than a million young people take part in demonstrations over the escalating global warming crisis. Anna Taylor, 18, co-founder of the group, said: “Climate criminals like Ineos, with their fracking for plastics agenda, are already destroying our environment and fuelling climate change for profit. “Allowing them unfettered access to classrooms and attempting to normalise their fossil fuels ‘extractivism’ with our generation is totally and utterly unacceptable and must be outlawed.” The Daily Mile is promoted as “a social physical activity, with children running or jogging – at their own pace – in the fresh air with friends”. But campaigners say its promotion of “fresh air and a healthy lifestyle” is at odds with the reality of Ineos’s operations. Two primary schools in Strensall and Copmanthorpe, York – both of which are within areas licensed for fracking – have withdrawn form the Daily Mile after the link was highlighted by local campaigners. Adrian Palmer, a parent from the Copmanthorpe school, said: “Our schools are unwittingly falling foul of these Ineos PR stunts as they don’t have time to research and make the connection between the Daily Mile and its controversial petrochemical fracking company backers … Having this Ineos PR in our schools is akin to a tobacco company sponsoring the school’s sports day.” An Ineos spokesperson said: “Ineos has supported the Daily Mile for many years and has seen this project grow from modest beginnings to a global success. We are proud of the role we have played in this growth and we intend to go on supporting the charity, which helps improve children’s health and wellbeing across the world.”"

"Last Saturday the Guardian started publishing the carbon dioxide (CO2) measurement from Mauna Loa, Hawaii. Far from big sources, this is an indicator for the whole northern hemisphere. Each day you will see the numbers change a little. Over the last year they varied between 404 and 415 parts per million (ppm). They were lowest in late summer due to plant photosynthesis and greatest in spring from emissions that accumulated during the winter. But compare year on year and you will see CO2 rising as emissions from our fossil fuel burning exceed what natural systems absorb. Globally, about 70% of CO2 emissions comes from cities. In leafy Egham, west of London, summer CO2 decreases by day due to plant photosynthesis and then plant respiration releases some of this at night. Along with emissions from fossil fuels, typical summer days show a variation of about 25ppm.   For nearly 10 years, scientists at King’s College London have been measuring CO2 right inside the city. Here, the daily changes from the plants are completely overwhelmed by emissions from traffic and building heating. Close to roads CO2 can reach 1,000ppm. These measurements will tell us if our vehicles and buildings are really becoming more fuel efficient."

Share this...FacebookTwitterFormer German Chancellor (1974-82) Helmut Schmidt of the center-left SPD Social Democrat party gave a speech at the Max Planck Society earlier this year, which in part was focused on “the responsibility of science and a personal word on the relationship between science and politics”. He also commented on the topic of global warming, see below.H/t: Benny Peiser, who starts with:
In a now disclosed Speech at the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft, former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt has cast the integrity and credibility of the IPCC deeply into doubt and has called for an independent, scientific investigation of questionable practices.”
It goes without saying that the 92-year old chain-smoking Schmidt will say what is on his mind and couldn’t care less about any political retaliation or critique at this stage of his life, and so is free to speak openly. He starts by reminding us that the predictions made by Thomas Robert Malthus more than 200 years ago were false, and that many more people are being fed today than Malthus could have ever imagined.
Here it is clear that Schmidt’s focus is not on a climate that may occur in 100 years, but on today’s problems of over-crowded cities, sprawling urbanization and the threatof conflict if supply does not meet the needs. Schmidt also speaks about the challenges and “the total failure of bank supervision, supervisory boards, accountants, etc. with respect to the obscene practices of some banks, shadow banks, mortgage institutes and insurance companies.”
He then focuses on another challenge that mankind is claimed to be confronting: climate change. Schmidt says that the earth has gone through natural cycles of ice ages and warm periods, i.e. climate change is natural. He then says that nobody knows exactly what man’s contribution to warming really is, and then adds (emphasis added):
The documentation delivered so far by the international group of scientists (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC) has been met with skepticism, particularly that some of the involved scientists have proven to be frauds. In any case the targets publically set by some of the governments have turned out to be less based on science. and based much more on politics. 
In my view it is time for one of our leading scientific elite organisations to take a hard critical and realistic look at the work of the IPCC, and thus explain in a clear manner the yielded conclusions to the public.”

I wonder if the scientists at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK)  are listening. Here Schmidt is clearly calling for a real, COMPETENT investigation by an independent expert body, and not a small group of corrupt hacks.
Schmidt points out that the development of new alternative energy is indeed a real challenge for science and research, as conventional supplies are not unlimited.
Here fundamental research is challenged to make regenerative energy sources as suitable alternatives.”
This statement is open to interpretation. Here he uses the adjective “suitable”. For me these energies first have to be made appropriate and reasonable for use. Committing economic suicide is not what I’d call “suitable”. More research on alternatives to make them affordable ? Yes! Forcing down half-baked expensive technologies with the false claim they are going to save the planet? No!
Schmidt also looks into the future and expresses his views on what to expect in the future:
–  there is not going to be an end to economic growth – technonological growth is unavoidable.
– there is not going to be any global food problems as growing crops and animals will continue to be successful, as gene technology will aid this.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis is no April Fool’s story. It’s a real story at Spiegel. 
Everyone knows that some climate scientists like to use sea level rise as a way to scare the public when it comes to the dangers of global warming. A one-meter rise could wreak havoc and displace tens of millions of people overnight over 100 years they fret.
 Most experts, however, agree that the current rate of sea level rise is more of a nuisance than a catastrophe, and something that we can do little to prevent. But now there are some experts who say that there is another risk looming out there that needs to be taken far more seriously, especially in Japan – monster tsunamis.
Der Spiegel has a new article on how Japan could be a hit by a 34 meter (113-foot) tsunami from earthquake activity in the Pacific. Spiegel writes:
New research results show that the danger is greater than assumed up to now. […] An earthquake in the ocean with a magnitude of 9.0 in the Nankai Gorge off the east coast of Japan could trigger a wave of more than 20 meters and flood a large part of the coastal region, the Japanese media quoted a research report today from a government-appointed expert commission. […] Wave heights with peaks of up to 34 meters are possible in the future, the report now says.”
That is something we definitely need to worry about, much more than the improbable one meter sea level rise over 100 years due to global warming in a dubious climate model. The Japanese report goes on to say that even earthquakes of 7.0 under certain conditions would be enough wreak havoc for Tokyo, an area that is home to 33 million people.
So what should the government do? Should coastal areas be closed and everyone moved to higher ground? The answer is of course no. The benefits of residing along the coast are immense. People should be made aware of the risks and plans need to be drawn up that allow for an effective response in the event of such a disaster. The best we can hope for is to find effective ways to minimize the damage.
Is this all just irresponsible fear-mongering? Der Spiegel writes:
A powerful earthquake in the area is long overdue. In the event of a catastrophe, a power outage of more than one week has to be expected and the water supply could be knocked out for a mionth.
The report states that most people are not stocked up with enough supplies to carry them over for these periods.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMore major media covering mavericks Vahrenholt’s and Lüning’ new skeptical book. Influential daily DIE WELT jumps in, see below!
First, part 2 of the 3-day special series called “The CO2 Lies” appearing in the 16-million circulation German daily Bild is out today. Its title:
There Hasn’t Been Any Global Warming In 12 Years!”
This part was authored by Vahrenholt and Lüning themselves, who remind us that CO2 is not that potent of a gas, and that a doubling would lead to only a 1.1°C temperature increase. But the IPCC fudges the models so that they produce a much higher increase because of the assumed water-vapor amplifier. Vahrenholt and Lüning remind readers:
But the amplification process is far from being understood and that the whole assumption is a really on shaky ground.”
But don’t tell that to the climate-catastrophe addicts. Without their daily fix of impending doom and catastrophe, they’re likely to start bouncing off the walls. Any good news about the catastrophe getting called off is the last thing these catastrophe-crackheads ever want to hear.
Bild reminds us that very few people are aware of the fact that global temperatures have stagnated over the last 10+ years. Thanks Bild, for finally telling us! Hopefully Bild will keep reminding us in the future.
Bild wonders why the IPCC never predicted that and asks: “How could the IPCC have erred? Here Vahrenholt bring up the ocean cycles and the sun, which the IPCC has a chronic habit of forgetting them in its summary reports. They write:
If the sun and PDO play a role, then it means CO2’s role is even less. And it’s precisely this that the IPCC refuses to acknowledge.”
Vahrenholt and Lüning then remind us that soot also is a major contributor and that a recent study shows that it was seriously underestimated just a few years ago. It all means that the IPCC models are completely out of whack. How do the IPCC lead scientists react to this? Bild tells us:
“…the IPCC decision-makers are fighting tooth and nail against accepting the roles of the oceans, sun, and soot.”

When assigning the amount of forcing to various factors, Vahrenholt and Lüning conclude:
“The facts need to be discussed sensibly and scientifically, without first deciding on the results.”
Full page interview with DIE WELT
Meanwhile flagship daily DIE WELT featured a full page interview with Professor Vahrenholt in its print edition…no restrictions, no omissions. Finally a good interview by a warmist paper.
In the interview, Vahrenholt explains why he grew skeptical of the IPCC. One problem was that the IPCC had the habit of filtering out important scientific findings so that they never appear in the summary reports. By examining past temperature fluctuations, Vahrenholt and Lüning believe that the sun is a greater factor than CO2.
Vahrenholt gives three reasons why he expects it to get cooler in the future: 1) we are or soon will be beginning on the downward flank of the Gleissberg and Suess cycles, 2) the ocean cycles will be in their negative phases over the next decades, and 3) we currently find ourselves in the weakest phase of solar activity in 80 years, and the next solar cycle could be a very weak one.
German Minister of Environment Röttgen “clueless”
Then the DIE WELT interview focuses on energy policy in Germany. According to Vahrenholt, Germany has a solar capacity of 25,000 megawatts and a wind capacity of 29,000 megawatts, which are very volatile sources. Conventional power plants are going to be needed to balance out the supply.
At the end of the interview, because of Germany’s now volatile power supply, DIE WELT asks Vahrenholt to estimate the current chances of power blackouts:
The outgoing President of the Federal Power Grid Agency says that we are dancing on a razor’s edge. A cold wave like the one we are now experiencing means Alarm Level Red. The French and the Czechs, from whom we import, need the power for themselves – for heating. Currently we are supplying our needs with power from an Austrian oil-fired power plant. We hope that things will not go astray over the coming 2 weeks. When Mr. Röttgen [Minister of Environment} says that solar energy reduces the probability of blackouts, it shows how clueless this man is. The greatest demand for power occurs in the evening in the wintertime – just when solar energy is zero.”
All these major media reports started appearing just when Vahrendorf’s and Lüning’s book was released. Skepticism is firing up in Germany. But the real battle is coming. Expect the catastrophe-crack-heads to go into violent seizures of protest.

"George Monbiot (The natural world can help save us from climate chaos, 3 April), Greta Thunberg and other signatories (Letters, 3 April) are right. Nature can provide effective options to help tackle climate change. Often there is no need for complicated, expensive and unproven technology. As we know from our work in such countries as Bhutan and Costa Rica, some governments are embracing nature-based solutions where natural forests are managed for their key role in storing carbon and regulating water for clean, green hydropower. Policies and investment need to work with local people and focus on linking nature to infrastructure to help avoid catastrophic climate change, protect biodiversity and cut emissions. The real challenge is to align the politics of change to the actions that are needed. While some countries are doing the right thing, in other places (such as Brazil) the politics is going backwards in deeply troubling ways. The international community needs to act to support local livelihoods and enable communities to be good stewards of the natural world. Our lives depend on it.Andrew NortonDirector, International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED)  • Readers seeking a wide-ranging introduction to the practicalities and benefits of rewilding formerly intensive agricultural land in the UK will find lots of interest in the book Wilding, by Isabella Tree – about a live, 20-year-old project on the Knepp Estate in West Sussex, which can be visited. Especially interesting is the information on the role of glomalin in carbon capture and in soil improvement. A natural glycoprotein, it is produced by mycorrhizal fungi from plant roots and is a key soil component. A Defra assessment of the increased carbon storage capacity on this site, in neutral grassland and broadleaved woodland under rewilding, showed a 51% rise compared with the intensive agricultural management of last century. I was pleased to find that there does seem a way to get a grip on climate change alongside reducing emissions, if we can grasp it. We can all do it in our gardens as well – we don’t have to plant trees.Roy RhodesBelmont, Lancashire • This mobilisation to draw carbon naturally from the atmosphere is long overdue. Sign me up! But is it still too narrow? Logically, the more people and places that are mobilised, the more carbon we can extract. But how many of us can access the forest, swamp, coastal margin etc of which George Monbiot writes? Very few. This is still for others to do, not me. Yet here I am in my back garden deliberately burying carbon. I ferment all food waste (no carbon emitted), feed it directly to my soil’s ecosystem (more soil carbon biomass), add wood biochar (permanent carbon sink) to house more soil micro-organisms and retain water and nutrients (for more biomass), then mulch with dead vegetation (protection and food for biomass). This is low-tech, and makes lovely worm-dug growing soil. My point is that we can trap carbon naturally in many ways, some of which fit local resources and local needs like food and sanitation. These lend themselves to community efforts, in every neighbourhood everywhere. Summed together across a country, they’d be as significant as George’s big-ticket items. We can, and should, become the Carbon Preservation Society. This is for everyone – for all those feeling helpless to affect climate change. We are not powerless. Within this new campaign, let’s create a web of local, regional and worldwide carbon preservers. Let the great and the good give the annual prizes!Malcolm FowlesReading, Berkshire • I have supported tree protection and worked to encourage and undertake both small- and large-scale tree planting for all of my professional career. I have undertaken much planting myself in my own semi-rural parish. I propagate trees from our local native, established giants! There are so many issues relating to this work at all levels, including encouraging local authorities and landowners to support, protect and maintain trees on their own land. But, putting that matter to one side, one of my biggest concerns for the last two decades has been the ever-increasing reliance on plastic tree protectors, along with their sturdy tree ties. The result is that we see plastic tubes – either whole or in pieces – contaminating and strangling our planting schemes, littering our landscapes, watercourses, open spaces, highway embankments and verges, existing and new woodlands. This practice must be resolved so that we can have healthy, protected trees but without the plastic contaminating litter residue. I suggest new products, new materials, more input into good planting design and practice, in order to reduce reliance on tree tubes, and much more positive management.Anne WestoverWestover Landscape Ltd • Your correspondents are correct in asserting that planting permanent stands of hardwoods can contribute a great deal to sequestering carbon from the atmosphere. Every hectare of hardwood in a temperate climate with adequate water can accumulate at least 20 tonnes of aerial biomass annually for 30 years – 600 tonnes per hectare. But then sequestration stops on that plot. The trick is what to do next, but the answer is at hand. Simple technologies with very low carbon emissions are available to harvest accumulated biomass, recover most of the sequestered plant nutrients, and densify the remainder to above 1 tonne per cubic metre – the density of water. Provided the right species are chosen, the roots left in the ground will sprout and within two years the carbon-capture process will have resumed as rapidly as before. Pop down to your local coppice to see what I mean. If the densified wood is deposited in the deep ocean, below 1,000m, where it is cold, dark and with little oxygen, it is there for good. Even if some organism worked out how to use the densified wood for metabolism, any CO2 or methane produced would remain a solid, out of the atmosphere for ever. To indicate the enormous volume available in which to sequester carbon in the deep, 1bn tonnes of CO2 deposited there would raise sea level by 2 nanometres. If all the annual CO2 emissions were dealt with in this way, sea level would rise by the thickness of a human hair.Dr Graeme Coles Chairman and technical director, Knewe, New Zealand • The natural climate solutions approach proposed by scientists and activists including Michael Mann, Greta Thunberg and George Monbiot is a vitally important component of our global approaches to tackling climate and ecological breakdown. But carbon sequestration by trees (the removal of carbon dioxide from the air via net photosynthesis), and carbon storage in forest ecosystems (especially soils) are only two of the methods by which sustainable forest management can combat climate change. The third method is the carbon substitution effect achieved by replacing fossil fuels, either directly as bioenergy, or indirectly through use of wood (for example as structural timber) instead of higher carbon footprint materials, such as concrete and steel. In the UK, with only 13% forest cover, we are less than 20% self-sufficient in wood products and thus need to increase all three methods of using forestry to mitigate climate change. Otherwise we are dependent on importing harvested wood from other parts of the world rather than helping restore their forests. Climate-smart forestry is an approach that considers how natural woodlands and commercial forest plantations need to adapt to climate change while maintaining, and increasing, their climate mitigation through individual trees, in the forest and by products from the forest. This needs to be achieved without reducing the other benefits to society that the forest habitat provides, such as flood mitigation, access for recreation and associated health and wellbeing.Dr Andrew WeatherallNational School of Forestry, University of Cumbria  • Conserving natural ecosystems to help mitigate and adapt to climate change is indeed an urgent necessity. A key question is how such places should be managed and secured. The world’s protected area network already covers 15% of the planet’s land surface and its role in defending against climate change is recognised, for instance in a groundbreaking declaration by 18 Latin American countries at the Paris climate meeting in 2015. Additional opportunities include the territories of indigenous peoples, plus many community lands and other natural landscapes. But the survival of all such areas is fragile: national parks and nature reserves are being de-designated or degraded, indigenous peoples forced off their lands and conversion of natural forests has in many areas increased recently. Bold targets for avoiding further conversion of natural habitats are needed. Collaboration between conservation and human rights groups can help to ensure that protection does not further disadvantage the people who live in near-natural ecosystems, who are often among the world’s poorest. Pressure must be kept on governments and industry to honour existing conservation pledges and to increase these to the levels needed to provide a measure of environmental security.Nigel DudleyEquilibrium Research, Bristol • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

"After months and months of picking over the minutiae of negotiations in parliament and beyond, the UK is tired of Brexit. I know I am; you take one day off from following the ins and outs and even though “nothing has changed” for weeks, you’re somehow behind. You know it’s important, but watching politicians and commentators trade macho insults is incredibly tedious. And now there could be European elections on the cards.  A European election might seem like a distraction when it can’t deliver what the country desperately needs: a general election and with it a new government that will fund our schools so they aren’t at the point of collapse and design an economy where the norm is not plummeting living standards and rising homelessness.  European elections are a hard sell. We were told we’d have left the EU by now. A swift, successful departure is what leave MPs kept saying was possible – and it’s what Theresa May said she would deliver. For people who want Brexit over, the last thing they’re interested in is voting for more politicians they don’t even think should exist. But with the Commons in deadlock, elections on the 23 May is where we might be headed. So it seems to me there’s a choice: either the elections end up as a rerun of the referendum campaign – with one side demanding Brexit and crying betrayal and the other rehashing the same uncritical pro-EU messages from three years ago – or we step away from these torturous, well-rehearsed arguments and try something different. Rather than resent the elections, perhaps they could be an opportunity to talk about all the things we haven’t been focusing on because of Brexit. The British left has to engage. We have a pretty good idea what the right will say, focused as they are on ramping up anti-immigrant rhetoric, imperial nostalgia and mythical sovereignty. Their rhetoric poses a very real, violent threat that must be countered. Whether, in the end, we remain just inside the EU, just outside of it or somewhere else altogether, there are issues the left has to consider and bring to the mainstream. It must tap into progressive internationalist movements – including explaining the importance of cooperation with the rest of Europe – and advocate for tackling tax avoidance, climate change, the rise of the far right and the mistreatment of migrants. Last month, right in front of the building where MPs have been plotting their next moves and TV stations have almost permanently set up camp, thousands of schoolchildren gathered in Parliament Square as part of a global movement demanding action on climate breakdown. A few days of news coverage, some tone-deaf comments from Theresa May and the news cycle moved on, but the climate is still breaking down. We need to hear nonstop about Labour’s green new deal and how they are working with people around the world on climate change; about how MEPs might team up with their leftwing allies to develop this – and what this future cooperation might look like. The far right is on the rise and already attempting to commandeer the levers of the EU. Matteo Salvini – the Italian deputy prime minister, who last year said he would expel Roma from his country, where there has since been an intensification of violent anti-Roma racism – is trying to build an alliance of far right parties for the elections. And though far from a unified force, the far-right already has a foothold in Poland, Hungary and Austria and is doing well in other parts of the continent. If it gains more power and is able to wield anti-immigrant politics to promote a racially homogenous Europe, the continent’s borders will become firmer – and member states’ policies will become ever more violent, exclusionary and racist. We need a united, anti-racist, pro-migrant left fighting across and against borders worldwide. But of all the problems at the heart of Brexit, the one that has been most neglected is Britain’s deep and damaging anti-migrant politics. The left needs to take on anti-migrant narratives unashamedly and directly, including during the European elections. Arguing for free movement is one of many starting points. The failure of the Labour party to make the case for this, loud and proud, is hugely disappointing. But if the broader left can keep up the pressure, the leadership has shown it is not above changing course. The Conservative party has been tearing chunks out of itself over Europe for decades and it’s conducting the final stage of that battle while in government, to the detriment of us all. All the while, our slow destruction of the planet accelerates, and inequality and anti-migrant politics grow. There is no quick fix but the left should use everything they can to change the debate for the better. The European elections should be seen not as an irrelevant distraction, but as an opportunity to campaign for a better future. • Maya Goodfellow is a writer and researcher.

"Utah representative Ben McAdams, a Democrat, warned ominously this week that a “day of reckoning is coming”. It’s the kind of sober language typically used to describe a climate crisis which – if we continue on with business as usual – could end human civilization as we know it. McAdams, though, was describing a decidedly less grave threat, if it can be considered a threat at all: the federal deficit.  He and 26 other members of the so-called Blue Dog Coalition – centrist and fiscally-conservative Democrats – are pushing for a constitutional amendment that would prohibit the federal government from running a deficit if there isn’t a war or recession happening. Social security and Medicare would be spared from the brutal spending cuts the amendment would bring about ... but that’s it. At a time when scientists are calling for governments to adopt a “wartime footing” to address the existential threat of climate change, the proposal isn’t just a stupid play into Republican hands. It’s climate denial. McAdams’ proposal emerged after a lengthy fight between those so-called moderate Democrats and the 90 member Congressional Progressive Caucus over a proposed budget measure, which House Democratic leadership moved to cancel a vote on Tuesday afternoon amidst rising tensions. Progressive wanted more domestic spending and less for our already bloated military. Moderates – radically – want to curb spending overall. And for what? There’s nothing inherently dangerous about a growing deficit; vigilante bondholders are not going to come knocking on America’s door threatening our sovereignty. And a country that issues debt in its own currency like the US is never going to face the kind of sadistic punishment the Troika visited upon Greece several years back. Deficits do matter, of course. But what’s important isn’t their dollar value. It’s whether the things that public money is pouring into are actually putting the economy on a stronger footing. Republicans know this all too well. Famed small government deficit hawk Ronald Reagan ran up the third largest debt of any US president, after Franklin D Roosevelt and Barack Obama. And today’s Republican party didn’t bat an eye before passing $2tn worth of tax cuts that mainly benefit the wealthy. Centrist Democrats, meanwhile, paint themselves as the fiscally responsible wing of their party out to curb waste on both sides of the aisle. Yet what’s so responsible about kneecapping the government’s ability to avert $32bn worth of infrastructure damage, $118bn from sea level rise and $141bn in costs due to heat related illness, according to the National Climate Assessment? If there were some foreign invader threatening to inflict this much damage on the US, neither conservative Democrats nor Republicans would bat an eye before throwing as many resources as possible toward fighting them off. Because the threat is posed by climate change – and these politicians’ fossil fuel executive donors – their response has ranged instead from indifference to outright denial. They may not all quibble with the scientific consensus on global warming, but they’re doing everything they can to sabotage reasonable responses to it. Most recently, they’ve taken to pushing back on calls for a Green New Deal – the only proposal on the table that remotely matches the ambition science demands. While Republicans fabricated a $93tn price tag for the Green New Deal, it’s impossible to predict how much any suite of programs will cost until you have something concrete to look at and cost out. What is clear, however, is that any earnest response to the climate crisis will require significant federal investment to do things like electrify large swaths of the economy, scale up renewable energy and invest in communities likely to be hardest hit by a transition away from fossil fuels. Done right, these investments could radically improve Americans’ quality of life and salvage our chance for a livable future. A balanced budget amendment would take away the best tools we have to make one possible. As Republicans pick and choose when to fearmonger about the deficit, Democrats like McAdams continue to describe its growth in apocalyptic terms – all the while ignoring the actual apocalypse the climate crisis could bring about. “It is clear we are on a dangerous and unsustainable course,” he wrote in the Deseret News. “The decisions won’t be easy, but our children and our grandchildren are counting on us to make this right.” If McAdams and other centrist Democrats were actually worried about their children and grandchildren, they’d throw out their amendment and back the Green New Deal that so many young people have rallied behind. For now, they’re more interested in screwing them over."
"The shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, has issued a stark warning before the coming election campaign, declaring the Australian parliament must end the stalemate and back Labor’s climate policy in the event of a Bill Shorten victory, or politicians will betray the next generation. In an interview with Guardian Australia’s political podcast, Butler says Labor’s commitment to reduce emissions by 45% on 2005 levels by 2030 is a “rock solid commitment”, not an “aspiration” or “something that would be nice to achieve” – and he says voters are more agitated now about climate action than he has ever seen during his time as an MP .  Butler says the Morrison government is lining up to deploy “tired old scare campaigns” about carbon taxes in the coming campaign – with Scott Morrison this week characterising the measures this week as a “Borat tax” – “but what I see as I get around the country after a very angry summer … the hottest summer we have ever had … is Australians are sick of it”. He argues voters are in a mood to punish the Coalition if the government defaults to wrecking and hyperbole over the coming weeks. “The consciousness, the level of expectation for this building, for the Australian parliament to do better on climate change is greater than I’ve ever seen – I think it’s greater than it was in 2007. “People are increasingly seeing the impacts of climate change, they are seeing the urgent clear advice from scientists that this is a climate emergency. “We have to stop having these petty political fights. We need to stop responding to Tony Abbott’s playbook and actually start putting some serious policy in place.” Butler indicated Labor would pursue as much of the policy, outlined this week, as it could without triggering “a drawn out legislative battle” – meaning by regulation, and by working within existing mechanisms – and he predicts the Greens will be punished by their supporters if they refuse to support Labor’s climate policy on the basis of insufficient ambition. The Greens outlined its own climate policy before Labor to define some of the boundaries of policy ambition post-election, and have already signalled they could torpedo one element of Labor’s climate plan – allowing heavy polluters to use international permits to meet their emissions reduction targets. Butler says that is a backflip on the position the Greens took during the implementation of the carbon price in the 43rd parliament. “They supported [the use of permits] when we were last in government, it was a central feature of the clean energy package they signed up to … but now, apparently, that’s an abomination. “I think there is a lot of politics going on.” He said if the Liberals lost the coming federal election, and Abbott lost his seat, that could create the conditions for the Liberal party to come back to the table on climate change, and he predicted if the Greens shot down the policy on the basis it wasn’t perfect, “that would be an extraordinary decision, frankly, for the Greens to take”. Butler said the Greens voting with Abbott against Labor’s first climate policy mechanism during the last period in government was one of the factors in shattering the political consensus at the federal level which has prevented policy action for the best part of a decade. The shadow climate change minister says Australia has now lost five years, with emissions rising when they should have been falling. “If Labor is elected at the next election, I think the gravity of responsibility of the next parliament to do something here should not be under-estimated. “If the next Labor government is not allowed to make serious changes in this area, I hate to think where Australia is going to be in 2030. “I hate to think of the scale of betrayal to our children and grandchildren if, for politics, our government, if we are elected at the next election, is prevented from implementing this policy.” Labor’s policy involves boosting the existing safeguards mechanism to impose more stringent pollution reduction standards on heavy emitters, and imposing a new pollution regulation on car retailers “in line with” 105g CO2/km for light vehicles, which will drive the uptake of electric vehicles. The specific timeframes for implementation are not clear in the policy document released this week, and Labor has refused to release a carbon budget making transparent the specific levels of emissions reduction it is factoring in in each sector of the economy. Butler acknowledges that Labor will face lobbying from politically influential stakeholders on its climate commitments if it wins the coming election, but he insists the changes will be implemented, pushback or no pushback. He says a key difference between now and when Labor was last in government is a substantial shift from investors, regulators and lenders to a world where carbon emissions are now considered “a key investment risk”. “Emissions reduction is now no longer an option. Emissions reduction is now a must do for emissions intensive businesses.” Butler says he would like to remain in the climate portfolio in the event of an election win, but adds whether he does is a matter for Shorten – and he repeated his personal opposition to the controversial Queensland Adani coal mine. “I don’t think there’s a case for opening up a new thermal coal mine.”"
"The ALP is preparing to use federal powers under the Water Act and its influence with the two Labor-controlled basin states to drive better environmental outcomes if it wins government in May. The opposition spokesman on the environment and water, Tony Burke, told Guardian Australia he would immediately convene the ministerial council and outline what he wants to achieve.  “If the states refuse to cooperate, I will look at powers in the Water Act,” he said. So far the Murray-Darling Basin Authority (MDBA) has not used all its powers, preferring to work collaboratively with the states. However the act gives the MDBA the authority to take over the planning powers of the states in relation to the river system as well as allowing a greater role in enforcement. Since Guardian Australia investigated the Murray-Darling in March 2018, the health of Australia’s greatest river system, and the $13bn plan to save it, have been thrust into the centre of the national political debate. The drought that began to unfold in early 2018 has become prolonged and highlighted inadequacies in the plan. The most dramatic warning has been the deaths of hundreds of thousands of fish at Menindee. The deaths of 40- and 50-year-old Murray cod, which survived the millennium drought of the early 2000s but perished this time around, horrified Australians and raised serious questions about the management of the river. There are now marked policy differences between the Coalition and Labor at state and federal level over what should happen next under the plan, though both major parties remain committed to retaining the plan itself. The question is: can the basin plan be reformed – and the remaining $4.5bn be spent constructively – without the key stakeholder states and the farming lobby pulling out of the plan? The Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists has warned from the outset that the environmental water recovery target of 2750GL in the plan was a political compromise and is a bare minimum to restore the health of the Murray-Darling River. Since then, serious management failures have led to a systematic weakening of reforms and undermining of the plan, they say. “Without major changes in implementation, it is almost certain that the basin plan will fail,” the group has warned in numerous submissions. The group’s spokesman, Prof Jamie Pittock, said there have been improvements in enforcement in New South Wales after the ABC Four Corners report in July 2017, which sounded the alarm over allegations of water theft by cotton irrigators in the north of NSW. But he said: “The major part of the problem – bad rules in water-sharing plans – remain. NSW and Victoria haven’t changed their attitude towards fixing them.” The most scathing and comprehensive criticism of the basin plan was delivered in February by a South Australian royal commission. It found officials at the MDBA and in government were guilty of maladministration, negligence and unlawful actions in drawing up the multibillion-dollar deal to save Australia’s largest river system. The commissioner, Bret Walker SC, warned the plan’s failure to take account of climate change was “potentially catastrophic”. While the Morrison government and the MDBA dismissed the findings (they had refused to participate in the inquiry) the royal commission heard from many of the leading scientists in the field. There was a distressing consensus in their assessments. Many of its findings were backed up by the Productivity Commission’s five-year review, albeit in more temperate, bureaucratic language. “Deficiencies in the way that governments have approached implementation of the plan have caused considerable concern in many basin communities. This has left a legacy of community distrust, which the commission considers is a risk to effectively implementing the next phase of the plan,” it said. In the fine print, it noted the poor enforcement by states, that new plans to deliver on water sharing were way behind schedule, that programs to find water savings in other ways were highly ambitious and risky, and the MDBA’s evaluation frameworks were inadequate. Then there were two reports – by the Academy of Science commissioned by Labor, and the Vertessy report commissioned by the government – in the wake of the fish kills. Both concluded that low flows had been responsible for the conditions that led to the mass deaths. Australian National University professor and chairman of the Academy of Science’s panel, Craig Moritz, said his review found “there isn’t enough water in the Darling system to avoid catastrophic outcomes”. “This is partly due to the ongoing drought. However, analysis of rainfall and river flow data over decades points to excess water extraction upstream,” he said. A common theme in all of these reports is that flows in the northern part of the system are dramatically reduced compared with historical records, and it cannot be explained solely by drought. The likely causes are climate change, which is changing rainfall patterns, and overextraction by irrigators – possibly in breach of the rules and floodplain harvesting, which involves diverting overland flows into private storages before it even reaches the river. A study by the MDBA identified the problem. From 1990 to 2017, a period which covered the millennium drought, “Some individual flow events in the post-2000 period were seen to be very heavily attenuated in both the Collarenebri-to-Walgett and (particularly) the Walgett-to-Brewarrina reaches, contrary to the established pre-2000 trend,” the study said. In other words, too much water was being diverted from the river. But facing up to this new reality is proving difficult. The Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists argue that the plan can be salvaged but requires governments and regulators to recognise its weaknesses and put the environmental objectives of the plan ahead of politics. Over the past 12 months, there have been developments that are both positive and negative. In the wake of the fish kills, Labor, Greens and minor parties joined forces to make one important change: an amendment that will lift the cap of 1500GL on water that can be bought back from farmers. The cap had been put in place by the Abbott government in 2015 under pressure from the Nationals who feared the economic impact of more buybacks on rural communities. But the change will only be relevant if the government of the day calls more tenders to buy back water or if other measures to reclaim water for the environment, such as the supply projects like Menindee Lakes are unsuccessful, forcing a government’s hand. Burke said the cap on buybacks was never part of the original Murray-Darling Basin Plan. “By removing the cap on buybacks, Labor is removing a legislative barrier to providing more water for the basin, if that is what is needed,” he said. The more serious threats to realising the environmental outcomes are two amendments to the plan, supported by the government and opposition, which reduce the amount of water available for the environment.  The plan always envisaged there could be changes, but the two changes – a 70GL cut to the environmental water target in the northern basin and agreement to allow 605GL of water to be recovered in the southern basin through efficiency projects – are controversial.  Both have drawn almost universal criticism from scientists but were supported by the MDBA and by both major parties. The 70GL is a straight cut that reduces the environmental water recovery target by about 31,000 Olympic swimming pools. “I guess I was surprised by the figure. But the reality is the plan falls over if you do not support the independent process,” Burke said, explaining his decision to support the government. But since the Menindee fish deaths, he said he would “not be surprised if MDBA review the 70GL cut”. The 605GL adjustment in the southern basin is more complex. The idea is that environmental outcomes equivalent to this amount of flows can be achieved by using water more efficiently often through building river infrastructure or removing it. The problem is knowing whether the projects will work. The Productivity Commission described the supply measures projects, as they are known, as “highly ambitious” and rated the risk of failure as “high”.  The Menindee Lakes project, to reduce evaporation by shrinking the lake system, is a case in point.  If the project fails to deliver on its 105GL of evaporation savings, it will mean a shortfall in environmental water that needs to be made in 2024.  Then there is the glacial progress by the states in implementing key commitments under the plan. NSW has been slow on its new water resource plans, leaving in place old plans like the Barwon-Darling water-sharing plan, which have been roundly criticised for allowing pumping by irrigators during low flows at the expense of the environment. Victoria is under fire for its failure to remove or rebuild bridges and roads and other assets that currently prevent the commonwealth environmental water holder from flooding the upper flood plains, which is critical for endangered ecosystems such as red gum forests. “If I win the election, I would want to get the ministerial council together as quickly as possible,” said Burke. “One of the things we need is a clear work plan for constraints removal, particularly in Victoria. “I am determined that I will get constraints removed and I am frustrated by the lack of progress. I would prefer a consensus approach but failure to remove them is not an option.” Burke said he also expected the states to take notice that water-sharing plans underpin the reforms and there will be “no tolerance” for plans that subvert them.

Eco-radical and Green Party Faction leader Jürgen Trittin, who, according to DIE WELT, was outraged:
It is impossible that when Vattenfall screws up once again, the German Pariliament has no emergency back up supply of electricity.”
Vattenfall is the Sweden-based power company that operates some of Germany’s power plants, and probably has nothing to do with the outage that Trittin and Ott find so damn inconvenient.
I say leave the power off and let them use candles and portable toilets.

CO2 being the primary cause of global warming is disappearing – fast. Now a new UNEP-sponsored study says.
Half of the temperature increase in the Arctic can be traced to black exhaust dust (soot).
We’ve always known that CO2’s greenhouse impact on global warming was inflated, maybe 10-fold. The T-Online News here presents a summary of a recent UNEP study written by a German alliance of environmental organisations called Russfrei Fürs Klima, in English: “Soot-Free for the Climate”. T-Online writes:
Because of these new findings, the so-called German Environment Aid group (DUH) is now calling for diesel filters for heavy construction machinery.”
Ed Caryl wrote about black soot’s impacts on glaciers some time back, read Glaciers – The Dark Side.
Okay – the UNEP study says “half the Arctic warming” and not half of the “global warming”. But recall that scientists have long said that global temperature rise would be most apparent in the Arctic. Now that we know half of it is caused by black soot, then it indicates the problem over the rest of the globe is nowhere near as bad.

‘The black carbon settles on snow and ice,’ explains Dietmar Oeliger, transportation expert of the Nature Protection Alliance Germany (NABU). ‘It leads to more absorption of solar heat by ice and snow, and thus melt more quickly.”
and (emphasis added):
‘The UNEP study is so important because it has finally offcially identified soot particles as a climate driver,’ said Axel Friedrich, international transportation consultant. “The detrimental effects of CO2 on climate have been discussed for a long time, while the topic of soot was always ridiculed.’ “
 Soot deposits in glaciers
Of course these concerned environmentalists would like to have us believe that soot is equally as harmful as CO2. But all they have done is convinced me that CO2 is much less a problem then they’ve been claiming.
And another important factor in warming from 1980 – 1998 (there has been no warming since 1998) are the oceanic oscillations, which were in their warm phase from 1980 – 1998. That doesn’t leave much room left for CO2. Call it the incredible shrinking CO2 warming effect.
I think the call for exhaust filters is a reasonable proposal and I’d support it. I’m in favour of less soot in the air that I breathe. Filters wouldn’t be that expensive, and would have a real impact – if the study’s results are true.
Frankly, I think the study is a bit odd in that it places most of the blame on construction equipment. Maybe the environmental groups are trying to shake down the construction equipment manufacturers for money. Factory production and the earlier, very dirty burning of coal by power plants certainly had an impact that was equally great, if not much greater.

"Parliament’s pension fund trustees are to reconsider the rules of their investments to take account of the risk of climate change, in a first for MPs’ finances. While stopping short of a promise to fully divest from fossil fuels, the pledge by the trustees marks an important first step towards assessing and reducing the effect of the pension fund’s investments – which are ultimately paid for by the taxpayer – on climate change.  The move is a victory for a group of MPs from all parties who have long campaigned for changes that would stop the funds – which amount to more than £700m – being invested in companies that promote or benefit from fossil fuels, thus exerting economic pressure on them to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP who has been campaigning for reform of the fund, said: “Protecting the natural world is now humanity’s greatest mission, so this change of tack from the MPs’ pension fund is very welcome. It has taken four long years to get to this point, but the trustees finally now appear to accept that fossil fuels are a risky investment, both for savers and the planet, and this marks a significant change in policy.” Around the world, the divestment campaign targeting investors with large holdings in fossil fuels has gathered pace in the last five years and won notable victories. Last week, Norway’s national oil fund began to refocus on renewable energy. About two-thirds of the UK’s university pension funds, as well as other public pension funds, have also either divested or reformed their rules, though some have retained their fossil fuel focus despite strong public pressure. Other funds to have divested include the Irish infrastructure fund, the New York state pension fund, and in the UK local authorities including Waltham Forest and Southwark. The pensions of MPs are looked after by the parliamentary contributions pensionfund (PCPF). The trustees have written to Lucas, in correspondence seen by the Guardian, to confirm they will reconsider the funding guidelines to recognise the risks from climate change. The trustees have committed to asking their advisers to “prepare a climate change policy” and added that they “do wish to show ambition in this area”. They will formulate a responsible business plan, and by October update the statement of investment principles. They also said divestment would be considered alongside the option of keeping fossil fuel shareholdings in order to have a “voice” on the future direction of those companies, to put pressure on the businesses involved. Five of the top 20 investments made by the fund, representing more than £20m, are in fossil fuel companies including the UK-based BP, which makes up the biggest single shareholding by the fund. Others include Royal Dutch Shell of the UK and Netherlands, and the French company Total. Last December, more than 200 serving and former MPs from all parties, spearheaded by Lucas, called on the PCPF to phase out fossil fuel investment. Lord Deben, chair of the Committee on Climate Change and former Conservative environment secretary, called the trustees’ initiative a “positive step” and said the PCPF should follow scientific advice as the basis of its investment policies. “The PCPF should now adopt a strategy that shifts investment towards companies driving innovation in low-carbon technology, and over time remove their investments from coal, oil and gas altogether,” he said. “Aligning investment with the 1.5C aspiration of the Paris agreement is the best way to protect our prosperity for many generations to come.” Sir Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat former secretary of state for climate change and energy, called on all pension funds to make the shift to investment in renewable energy and other low-carbon efforts. “All pension trustees ought to ensure their investments take account of climate risk, so it’s right parliament should take this initiative,” he said. “The best way is to switch funds from fossil fuels into clean technologies, as these are already highly profitable, but without the long-term carbon risk of oil, gas and coal.” Moves to divest the MPs’ fund have faced opposition in the past. When Liz Truss, one of the names mooted as a possible leader of the Conservative party, was asked by the Guardian whether she supported such a move as environment secretary in 2015, she said she opposed it."
"A US government climate change advisory group scrapped by Donald Trump has reassembled independently to call for better adaptation to the floods, wildfires and other threats that increasingly loom over American communities. The Trump administration disbanded the 15-person Advisory Committee for the Sustained National Climate Assessment in August 2017. The group, formed under Barack Obama’s presidency, provided guidance to the government based on the National Climate Assessment, a major compendium of climate science released every four years. Documents released under freedom of information laws subsequently showed the Trump administration was concerned about the ideological makeup of the panel. “It only has one member from industry, and the process to gain more balance would take a couple of years to accomplish,” wrote George Kelly, then the deputy chief of staff at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, in a June 2017 email. The advisory group has since been resurrected, however, following an invitation from New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, and has been financially supported by Columbia University and the American Meteorological Society. It now has 20 expert members. The panel is now known as the Science to Climate Action Network (Scan) and has now completed work it would have finished for the federal government, releasing a report on Thursday warning that Americans are being put at risk from the impacts of a warming planet due to a muddled response to climate science. “We were concerned that the federal government is missing an opportunity to get better information into the hands of those who prepare for what we have already unleashed,” said Richard Moss, a member of Scan and a visiting scientist at Columbia University, who previously chaired the federal panel. “We’re only just starting to see the effects of climate change, it’s only going to get much worse. But we haven’t yet rearranged our daily affairs to adapt to science we have,” he added. The fourth National Climate Assessment, released on the day after Thanksgiving last year, detailed how climate change is already harming Americans, with sobering findings on future impacts. At the time, Trump said he didn’t believe the report. “The impacts and costs of climate change are already being felt in the United States, and changes in the likelihood or severity of some recent extreme weather events can now be attributed with increasingly higher confidence to human-caused warming,” the report, the work of 13 US government agencies, states. On current trends, the US economy is set to lose $500bn a year from crop damage, lost labor and extreme weather damages, the report found. Rainfall levels and flooding have increased in much of the country, with the amount of the US west consumed annually by wildfires set to increase as much as sixfold by 2050, according to the assessment. But these warnings have been only intermittently heeded in decisions made by cities and states across the US, due to a lack of knowledge, political will or funding. The US has no national sea level rise plan, for example, and the Trump administration has scrapped rules around building infrastructure in areas deemed vulnerable to climate change. These circumstances have led to haphazard planning that results in certain dwellings repeatedly lost to flooding or fire. “We live in an era of climate change and yet many of our systems, codes and standards have not caught up,” said Daniel Zarrilli, chief climate adviser to New York City, one of the few US cities with such a person. “Integrating climate science into everyday decisions is not just smart planning, it’s an urgent necessity.” In its new report, the Science to Climate Action Network recommends the creation of a “civil-society-based climate assessment consortium” that would combine private and public interests to provide more localized help for communities menaced by floods, wildfires or other perils. “Imagine working in state or county government – you have a road that is flooding frequently and you get three design options all with different engineering,” Moss said. “You don’t have the capacity to know what is the best option to avoid flooding, you just know what costs more. “Climate issues aren’t being raised in communities. They may know they are vulnerable but they don’t know whether to use, for example, wetlands or a flood wall to stop flooding. We need to establish best practices and guide people on how to apply that locally. “This is extremely urgent. Every year that goes by means more people losing everything from flooding and fire, including the lives of loved ones. This needs to be addressed as rapidly as possible.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterI wasn’t really following this get-together in Lisbon, but Der Spiegel has just come out with a report about the subject tilted: The Climate War Can Continue, and there are a few interesting points. You could call it the German view. Of course, Der Spiegel used the opportunity to take some cheap shots at the sceptics – calling them conspiracy theorists and grumblers. But nothing we aren’t used to.
Yet, at least Der Spiegel admits that there are indeed “alarmists” on the other side, and that there is no consensus. So the real story here is that the sceptics are presented as a force equal to the warmists, and that it is not 98 – 2.
The fronts are deeply entrenched, pouring oil into the fire
The goal of the conference was to get both sides to take a step or two towards reconciliation. But as Der Spiegel writes, the prospects of that happening are very slim. Some participants in Lisbon even poured more oil into the already hot fire. Der Spiegel quotes Jerome Ravetz:
 The fronts in climate research are fully entrenched, says Ravetz’s diagnosis. The result is a huge credibility problem.'”
Some examples of oil in the fire, quoting Hans von Storch:
‘The sceptic side is comprised of everything from academics to confused grumblers.’ “
That didn’t go over too well with some sceptics. I don’t know if von Storch is the right guy to say such things, as he’s been doing his share of grumbling himself. Der Spiegel also wrote how comments by Steve McInytre also provoked the warmists, Spiegel provides quotes by McIntyre:
“Climate scientists have to be obligated, just like investment bankers, to make the information that support their projections public.’ “
Or else face sanctions:
‘The managers of Enron didn’t go to prison because they blew billions of dollars, but because they deceived investors by withholding information.’ “
Judith Curry on models and consensus:

‘The uncertainties in models are completely inadequately researched, and the established research is trying to hide this from the public.’ “
So the complaints, or provocations as Der Spiegel calls them, continue to be the same: the hiding of data and the inadequacy of models.
Gavin Schmidt chickens out
On Gavin Schmidt, Der Spiegel wtites: “He was invited but he declined to show up, which was probably because Steve McIntyre said he would attend.” Der Spiegel then focused in on McIntyre, recognising his important role in the climate debate and mentions his Climateaudit.org blog and how he found errors in Mann’s hockey stick. Der Spiegel took no cheap shots at McIntyre.
Von Storch on public opinion and ignoring sceptics
As sceptics have known for a long time that opinion and the science is all moving to the state of non-alarmism. Hans von Storch is quoted by Der Spiegel:
‘As knowledge increases, the percentage of people who believe that change is dangerous gets smaller.'”
And of course, the warmists and the alarmists would like nothing better than for the sceptics to go away. Or at least that they be ignored. Hans von Storch had the following to say about that strategy:
We simply cannot ignore the sceptics and think they will eventually go away. We have to discuss with them.’ “
Conference is sponsored by the EU
I wasn’t aware of this, but according to Der Spiegel, the Climate Debate Reconcilaition Conference was also sponsored by the European Commission, which has the official target of limiting global warming to 2°C, an endeavour that has been a favourite target of attack among sceptics.
In conclusion, the two sides were unable to agree on a mutual statement. And so the warmists will continue hoping that the sceptics will go away, or at least be ignored. Unfortunately for the warmists, the sceptics are going to do just the opposite, as surveys have shown. More and more are going to come, and they are going to get a lot louder. So much so that it will be impossible to ignore them.

"Children born today will have to live their lives with drastically smaller carbon footprints than their grandparents if climate change is to be controlled. Fast, deep cuts in global emissions from energy, transport and food are needed to keep temperature rises in check and an analysis has shown this means the new generation will have lifetime carbon budgets almost 90% lower than someone born in 1950. The data dramatically highlighted the burden inherited by today’s children, an issue at the heart of the global school strikes for climate. Another major strike will take place in more than 70 nations on Friday. “Those in positions of power – from politicians to business leaders – that have benefited from a much higher lifetime carbon budget have a duty to act to ensure a liveable planet for current and future generations,” said Jake Woodier at the UK Student Climate Network, which is supporting the strikes. “Without appropriate action, those in power are sacrificing our tomorrow for their today.” The new analysis by the climate analysts Carbon Brief combines data on emissions and population changes with climate models. It then calculates how much the average citizen on Earth can emit over their lifetime to keep temperature rises below 1.5C or 2C above pre-industrial levels, the goal of the world’s nations to avoid climate catastrophe. Previous and existing generations have emitted nearly all the carbon dioxide needed to take the world to 1.5C or 2C, meaning future generations will have to severely cut the emissions from flying, meat consumption and other activities in their lifetimes. The children and young people taking part in the youth strikes (born 1997-2012) will have carbon budgets just one sixth those of their baby boomer grandparents (1946-1964). “As protests by school children increase each week around the world, our analysis starkly highlights the intergenerational injustice of climate change,” said Leo Hickman, editor of Carbon Brief. “If warming is to be limited to safe levels, today’s children are going to have to greatly curtail their own lifetime emissions compared to older generations.” The idea for the analysis came from Ben Caldecott, at the University of Oxford’s Sustainable Finance Programme. He said it is the first systematic use of emissions data to inform the debate about intergenerational responsibility for climate change and had produced some “uncomfortable numbers”. “The purpose is not to fan the flames of rising intergenerational angst, but rather to provide some objective analysis to support dialogue between generations within countries and across them so we can tackle climate change,” he said. “The results will feed into intergenerational equity debates, for example in terms of access to housing, the availability of pensions, rising university tuition fees, changing retirement ages.” There is a currently a wide gap between the average annual emissions of a US citizen (16.9 tonnes) and an Indian citizen (1.9 tonnes). The analysis showing that children born now would have a lifetime carbon budget 90% lower than their grandparents assumes the relative gap would remain. But in a second analysis, Carbon Brief posited a future carbon budget that would be the same for every citizen on the planet. This would mean that the budget for a child born today in the US is even lower, 97% lower than that of that of their grandparents. For someone born today in Europe, their budget would be 94% lower. “That those born today only have a carbon budget a fraction of the size of those from previous generations exemplifies the need for a transformative approach that puts social and economic justice at the heart of plans to tackle the climate crisis,” said Woodier. “We need massive investment in people and planet to transform our economies, and we need it urgently.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe price of bad science. 
First off, I want to thank the readers who have joined in on the CLIMATE BET whereby the winnings will be donated to a charity for children in dire need, yet to be decided.
So far us 11 coolists have bet $300 in total that 2011 – 2020 will be cooler than the last decade.
It seems that our warmist opponent “Robhon” has mustered the courage and revealed his name: Rob Honeycutt. I ask myself where could all that cockiness and confidence come from?
Turns out he’s a regular at the warmist blogs, like Skeptical Science. Anyone that spends time with such sources of “information” undoubtedly will develop the beliefs that he now holds. In fact I found a post Honeycutt wrote himself at Skeptical Science called:
Kung fu climate.
He really believes in that hockey stick. I wonder if he really knows what he is getting himself into with this bet – he has committed $5000! I have no reason to doubt that he is serious about it and that he will pay if he loses. But that’s a lotta money. Either you have to be very rich, or cock-sure you’re gonna win.
The next decade is likely going to teach him a lot about climate science. We’ll see how cocky he’ll be in 10 years. It could be that it will get warmer. But if it does, it will not be because of a few molecules more of a trace gas. No, the odds are that it’s going to cool. As we have seen, more and more scientists are expecting cooling. The ocean cycles have reversed, and so the climate has begun to do the same in tow. The sun is sleepy too.
My bet with a similar warmist five years ago

Exactly five years ago I also made a bet with a warmist who also was cock-sure it was going to get warmer. Like Rob, this person was convinced that man was heating up the planet. But I told him it was mostly due to natural causes, and that we’d see cooling in the years ahead. So we bet as follows:
If the average temperature for the next five years (2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010) is warmer than the average of 2005, then I lose the bet. But if the average of 2005 is warmer then the next five years, then I win the bet.
The amount: If it cooled, then he would pay me 6 bottles of red, dry wine. If it warmed, then I would have to give him 6 bottles of Scottish whiskey (I like a fair bet).
Back then we did not stipulate which dataset to use to decide the winner. But I think using the average of all four, i.e. UAH MSU, RSS, GISS, and HadCrut, would be the way to go.
I haven’t run through the calculations in detail, but I see a slight downward trend. The 2010 El Nino made it really close, but was not enough in the end. As you can see the 2007/2008 El Nino ruined the warming trend (damn models didn’t see that).
Some people have to learn the hard way. Glass of red wine anyone?
—————————————————————-
UPDATE: I don’t want to give the impression that Rob Honeycutt is impolite or anything. He has a view and he rightfully asserts it. So far he has been very polite and cordial here. As I mentioned, I’m just impressed by his confidence.
UPDATE  2: The warmist has conceded defeat (2005 was warmer than the 2006-2010 average) and I have  gotten my bottles of wine. I expect a similar outcome in 2021.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis is a story on how some good ol boys are pushing extreme scenarios to make big money.
Fiduciary duty is getting thrown overboard by banks, insurance companies and investment houses as they race to capitalize on carbon schemes and the “green economy” – all under the guise of “saving the planet”. 
When large financial institutions like banks, insurance companies or investment houses invite leading catastrophists to give speeches for the purpose of spreading fear among clients, and ignore the vast volume of science that indicates the contrary, then they are breaching their fiduciary duty to these clients.
Has bank-sponsored climate-fear-mongering become the new way of exercising fiduciary duty to clients? Seems so.
The OLB invites a climate extremist to speak to clients
A short time ago I got a brochure in the mail from my house bank, the Oldenburgische Landesbank (OLB). The brochure features distinguished speakers from media, politics, industry and science who are slated to give speeches during the year, all part of the OLB Forum. Being both a private and business clientof the OLB, I got this brochure too.
When I looked at the brochure I was dismayed to learn that one of the speakers this year is none other than the Merchant of Doom himself – Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute For Climate Impact Research. He is scheduled by the OLB Forum to give a speech in Osnabrück on October 12:
Die Klmakrise (The Climate Crisis) 
Wednesday, 12 October 2011, Osnabrück, 19:00 h
Speech by Prof. Dr. Stefan Rahmstorf, Director of the Earth Systems Analysis at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, on the state of the science on climate change.
Needless to say, I was not pleased to learn that my house-bank is getting into end-of-the world scenarios and working with such science salesmen. Banks pushing end-of-the-world scenarios, chronic pessimism and fear-mongering are not in my best interest, and certainly not in the best interest of many other businesses.
“What’s going on?” I thought.  Either the OLB is very naive, or is in the scam to make big money. Gee, I wonder which?
My call to the OLB
So I picked up the phone and reached a middle manager (little customers don’t reach the top brass) and expressed my displeasure over their invitation of Rahmstorf. I asked the OLB lady on the phone if the bank was aware of his extreme positions and his scientific intolerance. She said the bank was not aware of anything unusual and that they simply thought the distinguished Professor Rahmstorf would be interesting to have as a speaker. All very innocent sounding.
I explained to her how extreme Rahmstorf views are, but this all seemed foreign to her – after all she’s a banker, and not trained in science. I also sent a few reports and suggestions for alternative speakers that I think ought to appear to balance things out, but got no feedback. Overall I was a dissatisfied with the OLB’s response, attitude and dismissiveness. They just don’t want to be bothered by it. That’s why I decided to do a little research and write this post.
Surely the OLB top management is fully aware of Rahmstorf’s extreme scientific views. His invitation is no accident; it’s by design. Banks are salivating over the prospects of making the big profits that the green movement promises, clients be damned. Let them meet Rahmstorf and get to know the fury of man-made climate change up close and personal.
OLB is 64.3% owned by insurance giant Allianz 
Who really stands to gain from the climate crisis scenario and cutting carbon emissions? Overwhelmingly the answer is: investment banks, re-insurers and financial institutions, among others. They are all maneuvering to cash in big time at the expense of many small businesses and the working class, who will have to pay through the nose. Banks are focused on their interests first and then on the interests of its clients.  That’s the reality. There’s a saying about bankers:
When the sun shines, they give you an umbrella. And when it rains, they take it away.”
The OLB invited Rahmstorf because his horror scenarios help to herd investors in a certain investment direction and mindset. Considering the vast array of investment instruments that the low carbon-economy presents for some, there’s a real incentive to spread doom and gloom over the future of the climate.
The OLB purposely got Rahmstorf for the task of performing his magic with OLB corporate clients. Looking deeper into the OLB, one finds that the staid, conservative bank is majority-owned by insurance and financial powerhouse Allianz. And Allianz’s reinsurance arm Allianz SE Reinsurance stands to profit handsomely from higher insurance premiums based on Rahmstorf’s future climate threats.
But aren’t insurance institutions, banks, etc. obligated to inform their potential clients about the other side of the science, and thus the risks of green investments? Not if they want to make tons of money doing so. They’ll be more than happy to watch clients panic and buy up the green investments, carbon credits and accept higher insurance premiums. So tell the clients only what they really need to know, i.e. the world will end unless you pay green.
Rahmstorf: hired merchant of doom for re-insurers
Stefan Rahmstorf, distinguished professor of climate science of the renown Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research will give them the latest on the state of the climate (crisis).

He’ll instill the fear of catastrophic climate change that’s needed to generate acceptance. Surely they’ll believe him and do what is necessary to save the planet. The problem is that Rahmstorf fancies himself as a prophet who is not to be questioned. And who is going to? And as long as large institutions stand to profit from it all, questions aren’t likely to be raised.
And whenever one sees promotional literature from the world’s largest reinsurer, Munich Re, Rahmstorf’s name appears. He’s the European bank and reinsurer industry’s top man – their salesman for gloomy scenarios. Read klimaskeptiker (German).
With this in the backdrop, the Munich Re has a special fondness for the PIK climatologists. The klimaskeptiker writes:
The climatologists produce the most wonderful horror scenarios, which appear to be indisputable proof and prognoses that man is faced with many more and much worse natural catastrophes in the future. With this seemingly unavoidable and fast approaching catastrophe, politics can be driven and customers can be duped into thinking that higher insurance premiums are essential because the damage will be much higher in the future.”
Also read here a paper written by Rahmstorf for Munich Re called: Abrupt Climate Change (in German).
Surprise! Allianz is trading in carbon too
Moreover, Allianz is heavy into carbon trading. Its website writes:
Carbon markets have grown rapidly in the past few years and play a central role in global activities involving climate change today. In 2008, the volume of traded certificates totaled four billion tons of CO2. The global carbon market will also continue to experience strong growth far beyond the boundaries of the European Union over the coming years.”
Of course banks and financial institutions are allowed to pursue profits and their interests, but must do so while fulfilling their fiduciary duty to clients, and act in the best interest of society. Indeed the OLB, and surely a huge number of other banks with it, are going down a questionable path, especially when one takes a look at the complete body of climate science, and not only the extreme science of Stefan Rahmstorf. For now they are claiming to be working for the good of society by claiming it’s to protect the climate. Of course this is based on dubious science, and they refuse to look at any science that shows the contrary.
OLB and corporate misogyny?
And probing a little deeper into the OLB, one sees they are also neglecting more than just their fiduciary duties to clients, but that they’ve also abandoned their social responsibility to half of the German population (women). It’s indeed quite the good ol boys club. Misogyny is probably too strong a word of course, but when one looks at the top management of the OLB, one can only conclude that top managenment is no place for a lady.
There is not a single molecule of estrogen to be found there. On its Board of Directors, 0 of 5 are women. Its Supervisory Board  is not any better: 0 of 13 are women. And here’s the page with its notable employees, the movers and shakers in the bank: a whopping 0 of 24 are women!
You mean to tell me there is not a single German woman out there that can do the job? No corporation in Scandinavia, North America and in many other European countries would ever get away with this level of chauvinism.
I know of a lot of women’s groups who might not be too impressed by these figures.
It has to be pointed out that the Oldenburg region is a very traditional and conservative area. But we are also living in the year 2011 and not in the Dark Ages. Hard to believe that this absence has gone unnoticed.
The OLB also has an advisory council: here of 61 members only 6 are women. So we’ve got a good ol boys’ club here. After all, they are only helping to rescue the climate. They got Rahmstorf on board to certify the science.
Final comments
Don’t get me wrong. My family has been served very well as clients by the OLB for over 15 years, and we want to continue doing business with the bank. But it is becoming increasingly obvious that the OLB has to change its way of running things. The OLB is not alone here. I’m sure the situation is hardly better at the other German banks. So I’m not advocating clients to boycott. We just want to see BALANCE.
I preregistered to see Rahmstorf’s climate spook-show. If any NTZ readers in the area are OLB customers, do sign up. Who knows, maybe they’ll be a few skeptics there to balance the discussion.

"Academics have mapped out a network of sanctuaries they say are required to save the world’s oceans, protect wildlife and fight climate breakdown. The study, ahead of a historic vote at the UN, sets out the first detailed plan of how countries can protect over a third of the world’s oceans by 2030, a target scientists and policy makers say is crucial in order to safeguard marine ecosystems and help mitigate the impacts of a rapidly heating world. “The speed at which the high seas have been depleted of some of their most spectacular and iconic wildlife has taken the world by surprise,” said co-author Prof Callum Roberts from the University of York. “This report shows how protected areas could be rolled out across international waters to create a net of protection that will help save species from extinction and help them survive in our fast-changing world.” The campaign to protect to protect 30% of the world’s oceans by 2030 was backed by the UK government last year. The environment secretary, Michael Gove, welcomed the report, which is the result of a year-long collaboration between academics at York and Oxford universities and environmental group Greenpeace. “From climate change to overfishing, the world’s oceans are facing an unprecedented set of challenges,” said Gove. “It is now more important than ever to take action and ensure our seas are healthy, abundant and resilient. I join Greenpeace in calling for the UK and other countries to work together towards a UN High Seas Treaty that would pave the way to protect at least 30% of the world’s ocean by 2030.” Experts say that in addition to a wealth of marine life and complex ecosystems, the high seas – those waters beyond national boundaries – play a key role in regulating the earth’s climate, driving the ocean’s biological pump that captures huge amounts of carbon at the surface and stores it in the oceans’ depths. Without this process, they warn the atmosphere would contain 50% more carbon dioxide and become too hot to support human life. However, in recent decades, oceans have faced growing exploitation from a handful of mainly wealthy nations with intensive fishing and deep seabed mining combining with climate change, acidification and pollution to put marine ecosystems under serious threat – with potentially devastating consequences for the survival of humanity. The report breaks global oceans – which cover almost half the planet – into 25,000 squares of 100x100 km, and then maps 458 different conservation features including wildlife, habitats and key oceanographic features. Finally academics have modelled hundreds of scenarios for what a planet-wide network of ocean sanctuaries, free from harmful human activity, would look like. The move comes as the UN is hammering out the details of a new Global Ocean Treaty – a legal framework which would allow the creation of high seas ocean sanctuaries. The first of four UN meetings was held in September 2018, and a final decision on the treaty is expected next year. Report co-author Prof Alex Rogers, from the University of Oxford, said: “Creating marine reserves is critical to protecting and conserving the diversity of marine life. The report puts forward a credible design for a global network of marine protected areas in the high seas based on knowledge accumulated over years by marine ecologists on the distribution of species, including those threatened with extinction, habitats known to be hotspots of biodiversity and unique ecosystems.” Speaking from negotiations at the UN, Dr Sandra Schoettner from Greenpeace’s global ocean sanctuaries campaignsaid climate change, ocean acidification, overfishing and pollution, meant oceans “are under threat like never before”. “We urgently need to protect at least a third of our oceans by 2030, and what’s so exciting about this research is that it shows it is entirely possible to design and create a robust, planet-wide network of ocean sanctuaries,” she said. “This is a blueprint for ocean protection that would safeguard the full spectrum of marine life, help tackle the crisis facing our oceans and enable their recovery.” Schoettner said passing a UN Ocean Treaty next year would be a huge step in creating a sustainable planet as long as it has “the teeth to realise a network of ocean sanctuaries” that were “off-limits to harmful human activities”. “This would give wildlife and habitats space not only to recover but to flourish,” said Schoettner. “Our oceans are in crisis, but all we need is the political will to protect them before it’s too late.”"
"The world faces two existential crises, developing with terrifying speed: climate breakdown and ecological breakdown. Neither is being addressed with the urgency needed to prevent our life-support systems from spiralling into collapse. We are writing to champion a thrilling but neglected approach to averting climate chaos while defending the living world: natural climate solutions. This means drawing carbon dioxide out of the air by protecting and restoring ecosystems.  By defending, restoring and re-establishing forests, peatlands, mangroves, salt marshes, natural seabeds and other crucial ecosystems, large amounts of carbon can be removed from the air and stored. At the same time, the protection and restoration of these ecosystems can help minimise a sixth great extinction, while enhancing local people’s resilience against climate disaster. Defending the living world and defending the climate are, in many cases, one and the same. This potential has so far been largely overlooked. We call on governments to support natural climate solutions with an urgent programme of research, funding and political commitment. It is essential that they work with the guidance and free, prior and informed consent of indigenous people and other local communities. This approach should not be used as a substitute for the rapid and comprehensive decarbonisation of industrial economies. A committed and well-funded programme to address all the causes of climate chaos, including natural climate solutions, could help us hold the heating of the planet below 1.5C. We ask that they are deployed with the urgency these crises demand.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThat’s the headline at the online Die Welt. This according to former German Green Party member Rezzo Schlauch.
And when a Green party member says that, you know it’s going to be really costly – especially for the German state of Baden Württemberg, where the Greens swept into power in last Sunday’s state elections and are set to rapidly shut down the state’s nuclear power.
This is going to be fun to watch, but will be painful for the taxpayers.
Rezzo Schlauch was a German Parliamentarian from from 1994 to 2005, and Green Party Faction Chief from 1998 to 2002 in the Bundestag (Federal Parliament). In the year 2000 Gerhard Schroeder’s SPD/Green coalition government pushed through a law that mandated the winding down of nuclear power.
After Fukushima, everybody wants to shut down the nuclear power plants rapidly, especially the southern German state of  Baden Württemberg. But the hitch is that the Baden Württemberg owns a 45% stake of energy giant EnBW. Shutting down EnBW’s nuclear power plants is going to hurt the state – big time. Why is it these things never get communicated before all these fuzzy warm green save-the-planet schemes get put into action?

According Die Welt: 
In an interview with the internet portal Entermagazin Schlauch said: ‘When you are a shareholder of a company that is up to 50% dependent on nuclear power, and the nuclear power is radically stopped, which is the goal, and must be the goal – then you are destroying capital’.”
Economics learned the hard way. Baden Württemberg ‘s state elections of last Sunday will put a Green Party governor in the capital of Stuttgart – Winfried Kretschmann, who is adamant about shutting down all the nuclear power plants as quickly as possible. Baden Württemberg is Germany’s largest producer of nuclear power.
Schlauch says that the state now faces huge challenges. They have to make up the huge atomic power shortfall quickly, and that is going to be expensive. No problem though. Where there is a state, there are also taxpayers. Schlauch warned:
Of course this is going to cost money that is going to have to be paid by the taxpayer.”
Really? I always thought the sun didn’t send power bills and that money was blowing in the wind. Looks like lots of money is going to get blown. Dear citizens, you voted for this – now live with it.

"Trees growing near the South Pole, sea levels 20 metres higher than now, and global temperatures 3C-4C warmer. That is the world scientists are uncovering as they look back in time to when the planet last had as much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as it does today. Using sedimentary records and plant fossils, researchers have found that temperatures near the South Pole were about 20C higher than now in the Pliocene epoch, from 5.3m to 2.6m years ago.   Many scientists use sophisticated computer models to predict the impacts of human-caused climate change, but looking back in time for real-world examples can give new insights. The Pliocene was a “proper analogy” and offered important lessons about the road ahead, said Martin Siegert, a geophysicist and climate-change scientist at Imperial College London. “The headline news is the temperatures are 3-4C higher and sea levels are 15-20 metres higher than they are today. The indication is that there is no Greenland ice sheet any more, no West Antarctic ice sheet and big chunks of East Antarctic [ice sheet] taken,” he said. Fossil fuel burning was pumping CO2 into the atmosphere extremely rapidly, he said, though it took time for the atmosphere and oceans to respond fully. “If you put your oven on at home and set it to 200C the temperature does not get to that immediately, it takes a bit of time, and it is the same with climate,” Siegert said, at a Royal Meteorological Society meeting on the climate of the Pliocene. He added that global temperature had already risen by 1C since the industrial revolution, when CO2 levels were 280 parts per million (ppm). CO2 was now at 412ppm and rising, suggesting the planet would be locked into rises of 3C-4C in the next few centuries. Ice melting, he said, took even longer and the huge sea level rises indicated by the Pliocene evidence would probably take a few millennia to come about. In the Pliocene a variety of beech and possibly conifer trees grew at Oliver Bluffs, 300 miles from the South Pole. The tree remains had been unearthed as fossils, along with cushion plants and mosses.  Jane Francis, director of the British Antarctic Survey, said: “This is an amazing discovery. They found fossil leaves of southern beech. I call them the last forests of Antarctica. They were growing at 400ppm CO2, so this may be where we are going back to, with ice sheets melting at times, which may allow plants to colonise again.”  The evidence showed summertime temperatures in the Pliocene were a tundra-like 5C near the Pole, compared with -15C to -20C today. The presence of plants showed the Antarctic ice cap was much smaller in the Pliocene and the sea level much higher. “Twenty metres of sea level rise would have a major impact on our all our coastal cities and all our coastal areas where people live,” Francis said. Polar regions were especially important in understanding global climate, she said: “We know that is where the change happens first and where it is most dramatic.” About 100m years ago an even more extreme climate occurred. In the Cretaceous period CO2 levels were 1,000ppm. Antarctica still sat over the South Pole, but the region was warm and covered in great forests, the stumps and soil of which have been preserved as fossils in places like Alexander Island. “If we keep carbon emissions going at the current rate, by the end of the century we will have 1,000ppm,” said Siegert. The low 280ppm level of CO2  in the run-up to the industrial revolution was rooted in carbon being removed from the air by plants and animals and then buried. “It formed coal seams, gas and oil fields. And what we have been doing for the last 150 years is digging it all up and putting it back into the atmosphere, it’s crazy.” One climate peril these emissions ruled out, said Siegert, was a return to an ice age, which had happened several times in the last million years; CO2 was now at too high a level for there to be any chance of a big freeze, said Siegert. “We’ve killed it.”"

The proposed 270 billion per year plan (€10.8 trillion total by 2050) for Europe to reach its target of becoming a low-carbon economy and society presented by Climate Commissar Connie Hedegaard yesterday has received a cool reception.
While the industry says not no fast – it’s too expensive, the environmentalists are complaining that it is not fast enough and does not allow them to take over Europe as its dictators.
The plan presented yesterday in Brussels is widely known as the EU Commission Low Carbon Roadmap, which aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 80-95 percent of 1990 levels by 2050. Interim targets have also been set: 25% by 2020, and 40% by 2030.
Europe’s emissions have gone down by 16% over the past two decades and the EU economy has grown by 40%. But much of that CO2 reduction came from shutting down the old communist mismanaged industry of former Warsaw Pact countries after the Berlin Wall fell in late 1989.
Ridiculous argument
The EU climate commissars are encouraging Europe to take more action, some even resorting to ludicrous logic, like Connie Hedegaard – quoted by Environment News Service:
We need to start the transition towards a competitive low carbon economy now. The longer we wait, the higher the cost will be. As oil prices keep rising, Europe is paying more every year for its energy bill and becoming more vulnerable to price shocks. So starting the transition now will pay off.”
She’s saying: let’s switch over to expensive alternatives right away and really pay through the nose right now. That way we won’t have to worry about paying for higher-priced oil in the future!

And this low carbon-living isn’t going to make Europe more competitive, either. To be competitive energy has to be affordable and its supply steady. It’s not for nothing many countries are cutting back subsidies to wind and solar.
Non-binding
The EU Commission’s Low Carbon Roadmap outlines a vast number of criteria for meeting the the targets: smart meters, renovation of buildings, thermal insulation, energy efficient machines, expansion of solar and wind energy, etc. But environmental groups were disappointed by the plan as a whole. Klimaretter blogsite writes (emphasis added):
The proposals of the Commissar were “unacceptable” said WWF energy expert Regine Günther: ‘The Commission views an emissions reduction of 25% as possible’, but did not make it binding, says Günther. “Without any clear ambitious target requirements, the European economy will lose the competitive leadership in markets for energy efficiency and renewable energy in the near future.’ “
What’s bad news for the eco-dictators is of course good news for EU citizens. Sorry, but many of us don’t think that spending €10.8 trillion for a few tenths of a degree Celsius is worth it. Besides, whatever CO2 Europe saves in the decades ahead will be wiped out by China and India CO2 growth in just a few months.
Meanwhile others are biting off their fingers. Environment News Service:
Friends of the Earth’s Head of Climate Change Mike Childs said, ‘If these plans go ahead, European governments are effectively abandoning any realistic hope of keeping global temperatures rises below two degrees, locking us into catastrophic climate change.’ ”
‘If the EU is serious about tackling climate change it must slash its emissions by 40 percent by 2020, without buying carbon credits from abroad,’ said Childs.”
Words of an eco-dictator.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAccording to a new paper published by the Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestial Physics, it appears the cause behind global warming is a lot more complicated than a few molecules of CO2.
The paper titled Geomagnetic South Atlantic Anomaly and global sea level rise: a direct connection? authored by De Santis et al recently has uncovered an “intriguing and to date unreported relationship between the surface area of the South Atlantic Anomaly of the geomagnetic field and the current trend in sea level rise”.
The abstract starts:
These two geophysical variables have been growing coherently during the last three centuries, thus strongly suggesting a causal relationship supported by some statistical tests.”
According to the paper, the first quantitative evidence of a relationship between the geomagnetic field, external field activities and weather or climate change was given by Wollin et al (1971) and by Bucha (1976, 1978).
The anomaly at an altitude of approximately 560 kilometers, 2007 (Source: NASA).
The abstract states:
The monotonic increase of the SAA surface area since 1600 may have been associated with an increased inflow of radiation energy through the inner Van Allen belt with a consequent warming of the Earth’s atmosphere and finally global sea level rise.”
The good news for the IPCC is that there is little understanding of the connection between the SAA and warming, thus giving them reason enough to just completely ignore it in its next assessment report.

The paper’s abstract:
Although we cannot establish a clear connection between SAA dynamics and global warming, the strong correlation between the former and global sea level supports the idea that global warming may be at least partly controlled by deep Earth processes triggering geomagnetic phenomena, such as the South Atlantic Anomaly, on a century timescale.”
The paper then states that the geomagentic field can modulate charged particles reaching the earth and that the average field strength has decreased substantially over the last 150 years. The paper adds:
This reduction of the field strength may imply an enhanced effect on some climatic parameters, if in fact the energy flux associated with the incoming particles has an effective impact on climate.”
Could this all be just a coincidence? The authors quantified the correlation with two robust tests, and write in their conclusion:
The agreement between global sea level rise and SAA area is spectacular […] a mere coincidence is highly unlikely.”
There you have it. Yet another phenomenon that likely impacts the climate without CO2. Now you understand why in my last post I wrote the IPCC and its 2007 AR4 report are totally obsolete and divergent from reality. The IPCC models are Stone Age. With its focus welded solely on CO2, the IPCC is out to lunch, out of the ballpark – and on a different planet.

Share this...FacebookTwitterActually, who’s counting? It seems a major solar company goes bust every other day.

Odersun – the latest German ghost town. Failed solar company lays off 260 employees.
The latest to bite the dust and add to the rapidly rising sea level of red ink is Odersun (sorry, but even their website is no longer operating)  in eastern Germany, near the border to Poland.
According to Klimaretter (Climate Rescuers) website:
Frankfurt/Oder headquartered solar company must stop operations on June 1. As the dpa press agecny reports, 260 employees were laid off already last week because the company was unable to pay wages. Negotiations with Staatsholding Rusnano as an investor crumbled over the last week.”
Not even the Russians are interested in German state-subsidized industry or companies.

Odersun is just the latest in a long string of spectacular green failures sweeping across Germany, thus vaporising the fantasy of economic revitalization in the former communist East Germany.
Just months ago politicians from every party were promising high-tech jobs and heady times ahead, thanks to the green revolution they boasted to have ushered in. However, very few people expected bitter reality to replace blissful fantasy so quickly. Politicians, once falling all over themselves to be on camera standing in front of humming state-subsidized solar module production lines, are now bolting for the exits, leaving a landscape littered with shuttered factories.
A money abyss
According to the online Potsdamer Neueste Nachrichten:
State of Brandenburg poured tax money to the tune of millions into solar module manufacturer Odersun. The company is now being shut down and its 260 employees will be laid off on June 1. The bankruptcy had sparked a heated debate on the politics of subsidies by the state and especially criticism of economic minister Ralf Christoffers (Left Party) . For years Odersun had been generously supported – with subsidies of more than 10 million euros, a guarantee of 8 million euros, and finally just when bankruptcy appeared inevitable, an emergency funding of 3.2 million euros approved by Christoffers.”
Count it up – well over 20 million euros!
Now that the pigs have thoroughly gorged themselves and left the trough, I wonder who is left to pick up the tab.

"The restoration of natural forests and coasts can simultaneously tackle climate change and the annihilation of wildlife but is being worryingly overlooked, an international group of campaigners have said. Animal populations have fallen by 60% since 1970, suggesting a sixth mass extinction of life on Earth is under way, and it is very likely that carbon dioxide will have to be removed from the atmosphere to avoid the worst impacts of global warming. Trees and plants suck carbon dioxide from the air as they grow and also provide vital habitat for animals. “The world faces two existential crises, developing with terrifying speed: climate breakdown and ecological breakdown,” the group writes in a letter to the Guardian. “Neither is being addressed with the urgency needed to prevent our life-support systems from spiralling into collapse. “We are championing a thrilling but neglected approach to averting climate chaos while defending the living world: natural climate solutions. Defending the living world and defending the climate are, in many cases, one and the same.” The signatories include the school strikes activist Greta Thunberg, the climate scientist Prof Michael Mann, the writers Margaret Atwood, Naomi Klein and Philip Pullman and the campaigners Bill McKibben and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall. Rowan Williams, the former archbishop of Canterbury, Mohamed Nasheed, the former president of the Maldives, and the musician Brian Eno are also among the signatories of the letter, which was instigated by the Guardian writer George Monbiot. The group emphasises that natural climate solutions are not an alternative to the rapid decarbonisation of energy, transport and farming. Both are needed, the campaigners say. The United Nations announced a Decade of Ecosystem Restoration at the start of March. “The degradation of our ecosystems has had a devastating impact on both people and the environment,” said Joyce Msuya, the head of the UN Environment Programme. “Nature is our best bet to tackle climate change and secure the future.” Recent research indicates that about a third of the greenhouse gas reductions needed by 2030 can be provided by the restoration of natural habitats, but such solutions have attracted just 2.5% of the funding for tackling emissions. The greatest impact is likely to come from the restoration of forests, particularly areas in the tropics that were razed for cattle ranching, palm oil plantations and timber. But natural climate solutions must not compete with the need to feed the world’s growing population, the letter says, and must be implemented with the consent of local communities. Effective ways of restoring habitat often overlap with the conservation of wildlife, the group says. Boosting the populations of forest elephants and rhinos in Africa and Asia would help spread the seeds of trees that have a high carbon content, for example, while more wolves would lead to fewer plants being eaten by moose. The fastest accumulation of carbon occurs in vegetated coastal habitats such as mangroves, saltmarshes and seagrass beds, research shows, which also protect communities from storms. Here, carbon can be sequestered 40 times faster than in tropical forests. Peatlands must also be protected and restored, the group says, as they store one-third of all soil carbon despite covering just 3% of the world’s land. Other suggested ways of removing carbon dioxide from the air include burning wood to generate electricity and burying the emissions, but to work at scale this would require vast amounts of land. A website, Natural Climate Solutions, is launched on Wednesday calling on governments to back such measures and “to create a better world for wildlife and a better world for people”. “Our aim is simple: to catalyse global enthusiasm for drawing down carbon by restoring ecosystems,” said Monbiot, who has written a report for the website. “It is the single most undervalued and underfunded tool for climate mitigation.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe photo montage could have been better, I know – but you get the idea.
Funny how Britain’s propaganda unit of the green movement – the BBC – somehow concocted such a picture of the sceptics. Germany’s FOCUS magazine, a proponent of the AGW theory, sees the sceptics in a completely different way – read below.
Obviously, things have gotten awfully bad for the green movement, and especially the BBC, who now finds itself resorting to the dirtiest of tactics – once used exclusively by totalitarian regimes.
Once a premier news organisation, the BBC has reduced itself to being a pathetic caricature of journalism.
Without a doubt the BBC, a public network, has departed from its obligation of fairness and balance, and has assigned itself with the higher mission of “rescuing the planet” and has given itself a role in setting public policy. That is not its duty under its current charter.
It has assigned itself a new job: to isolate the targets and to get the masses to despise them – all on behalf of a virulent green movement. Not unlike Goebbels. When one looks at how the BBC stitched together its recent documentary on climate sceptics, even Goebbels would blush. While Goebbels propaganda was mean and mean, BBC’s is mean and desperate.
The Rupert Murray stitchwork is in the same league as the 1010 clip. Make no mistake, it too will backfire. It will only serve to entertain the greenshirts, and appall the rest.
It is a particularly desperate piece of propaganda, one that I’d classify it as something you’d see from Baghdad Al, Saddam’s Information Minister during the Iraq war, who everyday insisted everything was peachy as Baghdad burned behind him. It should tell you something about how these guys communicate.
Can we trust the news they tells us? Can we trust the science that’s put forward?
Alternative view of sceptics: German FOCUS magazine 
I wish to remind people that there is an alternative view of climate sceptics one that recently appeared in the warmist German news magazine FOCUS. I advise people to read and compare it to the BBC documentary. It’s a completely different picture.
Here it is again (originally posted on January 11, 2011):
===============================================
FOCUS Story On Germany’s Hostile Environment For Skeptic Scientists
What’s going on at FOCUS magazine in Germany? Has it become “fair and balanced”?
An online FOCUS story here about the 3rd International Climate (Skeptic) Conference, which took place in Berlin early last month, got past my radar. Even though it is 3 weeks old, it is still worth writing about. The FOCUS story is dubbed: “Among Doubters”.
Hat-tip: Ike
The story looks in-depth at the climate conference and the overall atmosphere for skeptics in Germany, but does it fairly, something we are not at all accustomed to from the rest of the hostile media here in the Vaterland.
For example not so long ago Die Zeit had a notorious drive-by shooting piece that put the cross-hairs on Fred Singer called “The Merchants of Doubt”, read here.
The FOCUS piece starts out by describing the overall “poisonous” atmosphere that pervaded before the start of the conference. Some German Parliamentarians started their own McCarthy-style inquisition on the sceptic movement in an attempt to intimidate and marginalise it. The inquisition was laced with the term “denier” and had all the usual Big-Oil and Tobacco accusations, read here.
FOCUS quotes EIKE-spokesman Holger Thuss, and comments:

‘Oil money? That would be nice!’, defends Holger Thuss of the European Institute for Climate and Energy(EIKE), with a tone of sarcasm. The think-tank founded in 2007 is headquartered in Jena and is supported only by small donations from private persons and membership fees. After the conference, the institute was penniless.
Being a bit familiar with this institute, I can tell you that it operates on a shoestring and does not have an office, as members appear to work from their homes. Hardly oil-funded. The press has always used this point to ridicule EIKE as post office box operation.
Yet the press, politicians and activists fear the organisation, and are working hard to marginalize it. But so far they’ve succeeded in doing just the opposite.
For most of the media, the 3rd Conference in Berlin was allegedly a gathering of wacked-out conspiracy theorists. But FOCUS found that this was hardly the case:
The approximately 120 who gathered in Berlin were supposedly “climate deniers“, yet hardly gave a conspirator impression. They were predominantly men, mainly of retirement age, with thinned hair and gray scholarly beards.”
As someone in attendance, I was an exception to that – in both respects. And what about all the accusations that we are just a haggle of deniers and flat-earthers? FOCUS quotes Bob Carter:
‘Whoever labels us as climate deniers is not making any scientific arguments, rather political ones’, says Australian geologist Bob Carter in response to such characterisations. When someone calls him a skeptic, then, as a scientist, he is ‘proud of it’.”
FOCUS then reports that almost all the attendees believe in climate change, and the dispute is about the extent of man’s influence, and here writes more about Bob Carter:
The paleontologist examined climate change and changes in sea level over the last 65 million years in numerous field studies – and has detected far greater variations than those of our recent history. The assertion that man is heating the world’s climate with CO2 emissions is fundamentally refuted he claims.
FOCUS also wrote about what happens when scientists do not march in lockstep with the so-called “mainstream” scientists, citing Jan Veizer’s and Nir Shaviv’s breakthrough paper on the impacts of cosmic rays on climate:
‘Practically overnight no one wanted to be seen with me’, bitterly recalls the emeritus Leibniz-Prize winner, who also taught in Germany and in Canada.
FOCUS adds:
Whoever challenges the notion of man-made climate change gets mercilessly punished by the Establishment. So it is no surprise that one hardly finds any young researchers who take a critical and skeptical view, and that mainly retired professors dominated the conference.
Also 38-year old academic high-flyer Nir Shaviv advises his own students on the threat of sanctions and reminds them to be very careful in challenging official climate dogma: ‘Whoever starts questioning is taking the risk of shooting himself in the knee.'”
What a way to conduct science. FOCUS then writes about how some politicians have been at the receiving end of hellfire and brimstone for expressing openeness to non-mainstream views, for example conservative CDU politician Marie-Luise Dött, read here and Free Democrat Paul Friedhoff.
But all the greenshirt intimidation tactics have in the end backfired for the most part. The debate is not ending, as Al Gore demanded in an authoritarian style back in 2006. Science does not stop just because a politician like Gore, who has got a stake in it all, demands it so.
FOCUS ends its piece with the subheading:
No end in sight for this debate”
We have indeed come a long way since the days of “The science is settled”, haven’t we? FOCUS then quotes Bob Carter, who demands a change in political course, and that we ought to get away from the belief that we can restrict temperature increase to 2°C. Carter pleads that governments use taxpayer more wisely.
Why not start in the third world and help the people there get clean water and better sanitation facilities. That would be a good start.“
Kudos to FOCUS. If they keep this up I’ll soon find myself adding widget for subscriptions to FOCUS magazine – and I’m now even considering a subscription to its news magazine.

"The simplest measure of how the mass burning of fossil fuels is disrupting the stable climate in which human civilisation developed is the number of carbon dioxide molecules in the atmosphere. Today, the CO2 level is the highest it has been for several million years. Back then, temperatures were 3-4C hotter, sea level was 15-20 metres higher and trees grew at the south pole. Worse, billions of tonnes of carbon pollution continues to pour into the air every year and at a rate 10 times faster than for 66m years. At the dawn of the industrial revolution, CO2 was at 280 parts per million (ppm) in the atmosphere. By 1958, when the first measurements were made at Mauna Loa in Hawaii, it had reached 315ppm. It raced past 350ppm in 1986 and 400ppm in 2013. The Guardian will now publish the Mauna Loa carbon count, the global benchmark, on the weather page of the paper every day. “When I read the letter from Guardian reader Daniel Scharf encouraging us to include information on climate change in our weather forecasts, we thought it was a fantastic idea,” said the Guardian’s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner. “Levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere have risen so dramatically, and including a measure of that in our daily weather report is symbolic of what human activity is doing to our climate. People need reminding that the climate crisis is no longer a future problem – we need to tackle it now, and every day matters.” While weather changes daily, climate changes over years and decades. So alongside the daily carbon count, we will publish the level in previous years for comparison, as well as the pre-industrial baseline of 280ppm, and the level seen as manageable in the long term of 350ppm. Year-on-year comparisons are important because each year there is a natural rise and fall of CO2 levels, rather like the planet breathing. Trees and plants absorb carbon and release oxygen as they grow, lowering atmospheric CO2. As most plants are in the northern hemisphere, CO2 reaches its lowest level each year at the end of the growing season in October. Then it begins to rise as dying plants decay, reaching a peak in May or June. While the CO2 level is an important and symbolic measure of the global warming caused by humanity, it is a simple one. The increases in temperature the world experiences, and the heatwaves, storms and droughts that strike, also depend on how fast emissions rise or fall and how long they remain at high levels. The 350ppm level was proposed in 2008 by Nasa’s Prof James Hansen as a suitable target. However we measure climate change, one thing is clear: to keep below 1.5C of warming, the aspiration of the world’s nations, we need to halve emissions by 2030 and reach zero by mid century. It is also likely we will need to remove CO2 from the atmosphere, perhaps by the large-scale restoration of nature. It is a huge task, but we hope that tracking the daily rise of CO2 will help to maintain attention on it. When the 400ppm milestone was passed, Prof Ralph Keeling, who oversees the Mauna Loa measurements begun by his father, said: “It is symbolic, a point to pause and think about where we have been and where we are going.”"

I’ve decided to be generous and to move his comment and make it a post. Maybe other readers here can help him (her) out.
Comment by reader JC Smith:
Yes…..global cooling.  Wouldn’t that be nice.  Let’s just ignore the facts, and click our shoes together and tell ourselves that global cooling is in.
For anyone curious about FACTS, you can look at this link at NOAA:  http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/records/
For the last 365 days in the US, the daily high temp records have exceeded the daily minimum temp records by a ratio of 3.3 to 1.0 (29,298 to 8,968 as of 02/03 in the morning).  If you look at just the LAST MONTH…it is even worse.

Over the last 30 days, there have been 2,949 new daily high records (ie highs for a specific day) while there have only been 160 new daily low records.  The ratio is almost 20 to 1, new high records to new low records.
Aberdeen, South Dakota set a new record high for January 5th of 63 degrees which beat the old record or 46 degrees by 17 degrees.  Phillip, South Dakota set a new record high 74 degrees which beat the old record of 46 degrees by 28 DEGREES.  Think about that for a minute.  A new record high which was 28 degrees HIGHER than the old record high for January 5th (http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/post/plains-bask-in-historic-record-warm-weather/2012/01/06/gIQAZleBfP_blog.html).
Global warming has been happening for at least the last 120 years.  For the last 30 years, it has gotten worse.  The last 30 days are “off the charts” as far as record high temperatures go.
So, please show me some FACTS with LINKS, that show me that global cooling is taking place.  I look forward to seeing them.”
Quite the powerful evidence you present here, JC. Even the most talented of defense attorneys surely would be trembling in their shoes just from its sheer caliber.
You’ll get your facts and links. The question is: are you even going to listen?

"Modelling for the Morrison government’s climate policy assumes electric vehicles will make up between 25% and 50% of new car sales by 2030, a similar figure to the target set by the Labor party, which the Coalition criticised this week. Labor’s climate spokesman, Mark Butler, said “it shows how out of touch the Liberals are even with their own department” when it comes to cutting carbon pollution from transport.  Labor’s climate policy, announced this week,  included a target for 50% of new cars sold by 2030 to be electric. The government has said Labor’s reforms could prove costly – the environment minister, Melissa Price, said the party’s stance on electric cars “lacks any credible planning or detail to back up its target”. The Morrison government’s electric vehicles policy has not yet been written but Price said the Coalition was aiming for “25% +” of all new vehicles to be electric by 2030. The environment department told estimates hearings that projected emissions cuts of 10m tonnes through the government’s proposed electric vehicles strategy were based on data indicating electric cars could account for 25-50% of new sales by 2030. The projection, contained in the climate solutions package, was drawn from data prepared for the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation by consulting firm Energeia. “That analysis indicated that electric vehicles could make up between 25 to 50% of new car sales in 2030 if supported by coordination and facilitation of local state and commonwealth actions coordinated through a national strategy,” Kristin Tilley, the first assistant secretary of the department’s climate change division, told the hearing. “Just so I’m clear, the government’s climate solutions policy includes a climate solution package that’s projecting a 10 mega tonnes CO2 abatement number that could come from an electric vehicle strategy, that sees 25 to 50% of new car sales in 2030 as electric vehicles?” the Labor senator Kristina Keneally asked. “That’s right” officials said. Officials told the hearing the government’s electric vehicle strategy hadn’t been written and the announcement in the climate solutions package was that one would be developed. This week’s budget included $400,000 for its development, something that could take until mid-2020. “The hard-right of the Coalition have strangled any effective climate change policy,” said Butler. “That’s why the Liberals don’t have a transport emissions policy, just like they have no broader emissions reduction policy. “A Shorten Labor government will work with Australia’s transport sector to cut vehicle emissions, boost adoption of electric vehicles and help Australians save on their petrol bills.” Labor’s policy also includes a proposal for vehicle efficiency standards, which it originally proposed to impose on car retailers. But it changed course this week and instead will require this of car manufacturers, similar to other countries. Price said the “embarrassing backflip” suggested a lack of planning in the policy. “Rapidly increasing the number of electric vehicles on the road requires a plan for a multi-billion dollar investment in charging stations and supporting infrastructure, and the equity of the associated reduction in fuel excise,” she said. “That’s why the Coalition is making targeted investments in charging stations and creating a national electric vehicle strategy to coordinate federal, state and local government policy. “The Coalition is aiming for 25% + of new vehicles sold in 2030 to be EVs.” Australia lags behind other OECD countries in setting efficiency standards to cut carbon pollution from vehicles, and government modelling shows it would deliver billions in economic benefits, including reduced fuel costs for drivers."
"Announcing new climate change policies is something Australian politicians have learned to fear the most. Over the past decade, climate change politics has knocked off four prime ministers, and split political parties and allegiances apart at their core. The political risks in this election campaign are no doubt even more exacerbated, with many calling this the “climate election”. Nor is this a battle that is limited to the Green versus Labor swing seats. It is perhaps even more acute in key traditionally safe conservative seats. Buoyed by the result in the Wentworth byelection, several high profile independents are taking on Tony Abbott, Josh Frydenberg and Greg Hunt. Central to their campaign is climate change action.  In the last few weeks the major parties have trepidatiously released their climate change policy platforms. The LNP policies reflect a party that needs to be seen to be doing something to fend off the independents. Simultaneously it needs to somehow be seen not to be doing too much to avoid deserting votes on the right. The ALP policies on the other hand reflect a party trying to be seen to be doing a lot to capture the political momentum from the school strike movement, and the broad majority of Australians who want more climate action. On the other hand, being too ambitious gives the Murdoch press the ammunition for headlines it has frothed over for the past decade. Both parties’ climate policies of both parties are dominated by energy and by and large focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Such policies and actions are often grouped in the category of “mitigation”. Mitigation in this case refers to actions that are taken to limit the magnitude or rate of long-term global warming and its related effects. What is missing from both parties’ policy platforms is any substantive commitment to deal with adapting to climate change. Adaptation recognises that even with the most aggressive mitigation efforts, Australian society is already being impacted by a changing climate and will continue to do so. Even among environment and climate groups, adaptation is often missing from advocacy platforms, or a footnote. Perhaps this is because for many climate activists, promoting adaptation sometimes has that feeling that the battle to combat rising temperatures has been lost. Adaptation has long been the poor cousin of climate change policy and funding so perhaps this is no surprise. But what is perhaps more intriguing is that adaptation has often been the area of climate change policy that has had more bipartisan support. One of the first national adaptation strategies came about during the Howard era, and in many states, adaptation activity carried through changes in government more in tact than mitigation. If anything, the 2019 election should highlight the need for adaptation more acutely than any other previous election. The number of weather and climate records surpassed in this last term of government has brought climate change “home” to many Australians. Images of dead fish in the Murray Darling, burning rainforests and button grass plains in the Tasmanian wilderness, coral reef bleaching is front of mind for a large majority of Australians. So are the more personal experiences of hotter and drier conditions and more extreme weather events. No longer an abstract concern for future generations, it is an issue that is affecting Australians now and in major and complex ways. Unsurprisingly it is this dramatic shift from the abstract to the tangible that is galvanising non-traditional political actors to speak up and demand more. Groups like Farmers for Climate Action, the School Strike for Climate movement, and the Climate and Health Alliance are new movements challenging the climate politics of the past decade. Local governments and their communities across the country are on the frontline of climate change impacts right here right now and need federal support. Interestingly, in its 2018 annual survey of Australian attitudes towards climate change, an Ipsos poll found that Australians considered local governments leading when it comes to climate action compared to state and federal governments and industry/business. Infrastructure upgrades to improve resilience to extreme weather events and hotter and drier conditions are obvious needs. Community and social resilience programs to ensure communities are informed, empowered and have capacity to respond to climate change are also crucial. Several programs are under way, led by local governments such as the Ramp Up Resilience project in rural shires in northern Victoria, and the Resilient South project in South Australia. Critically, what is needed most is funding support to local communities to design local solutions to the very localised impacts of climate change already being experienced. This goes beyond disaster relief funding, but takes a more proactive approach so that communities can become more resilient to disasters as they will inevitably unfold. In coming weeks hopefully we will hear both parties reveal the rest of their climate change policies, the much needed adaptation policies. • Rob Law works for the Victorian Greenhouse Alliances, regional networks of local governments working on climate change projects, advocacy and knowledge sharing"

And it is morally questionable that today thousands of tonnes of maize are being taken off the plates of the world’s hungry in order to rescue them from a computer-modelled climate change in 2100.
If that wasn’t bad enough, now the maize that’s left for consumers in Germany is contaminated with cancer-causing Alfatoxin fungus. Bottom line: The good stuff gets burned, and we en up eating the toxic crap that’s left!
As maize farmers in Germany sell their harvests of top quality maize to subsidized biogas plants next door for conversion to biogas fuel, animal feed producers and food processing companies can no longer pay the high local prices and thus have to source the maize they need from foreign countries with low standards and dubious agricultural practices. Result: garbage winds up in the human food chain.
Today, all the major German media outlets are reporting on the discovery of thousands of tons of animal-feed contaminated with Alfatoxin fungus. These animals are for future meat and dairy products consumption.

News magazine Spiegel writes:
In Lower Saxony at least 10,000 tonnes of toxic maize feed are now in the feed chain. The goods originate from Serbia, and according to the Minister of Agriculture they are contaminated with the carcinogenic Aflatoxin fungus.”

The question many are now asking is: What is all this dangerous-grade maize feed from Serbia doing in Germany when so much of it is grown here locally? Europeans are burning the high quality maize and poisoning themselves to protect the climate!
Spiegel reports that up to 3500 beef livestock farms may be affected, supplied by 13 feedmills in Lower Saxony. Overall, up to 45,000 tonnes of feed may be involved.
Spiegel writes that Aflatoxin B1 “is one of the most carcinogenic substances in nature” and that the shipment from Serbia had a concentration that was 10 times higher than the allowable limit. The substance was first detected in contaminated milk.
Authorities claim that there is a little danger to consumers.

===================================
How Much Power Should We Consume?
By Ed Caryl
There have been many suggestions here on this blog, and elsewhere, that the aim of the CAGW hoax is population control.
It is obvious that the poor people of the world produce more babies; witness Africa with a birth rate much higher than the rest of the world but a very low GDP. The Africans would seem to be the model for what the Greens want the world to be: a low carbon footprint. But with their high birth rate and low production, most of Africa teeters on the brink of famine. Unable to afford energy and sanitation, many burn forests and dump their waste untreated into the environment. This would suggest that the “low carbon footprint” model is only a recipe for disaster.
On the other hand, countries with well developed economies have low birth rates but high carbon footprints. If we are to reach a stable population, one that can be sustained far into the future, a world-wide well developed economy will be required.
A well developed economy requires energy. Producing food, goods, keeping people warm or cool, assuring hygiene, and providing transportation for people, food, and products, require energy.
What are the relationships between population growth, energy consumption, and production? First, here’s a chart of electricity consumed versus GDP (Gross Domestic Product) per person for 202 countries. (Source for all the numbers in these charts is the CIA World Factbook.) Electrical power consumption can be considered a proxy for all energy consumption.

Figure 1: Per person GDP as a function of electricity use.
It is clear from Figure 1 that to have a well developed economy with a high GDP, energy consumption must also be high. A rough trend can be seen: each KW hour produces about $10 GDP per person. The average GDP per kilowatt-hour for all countries is $8.31. The ten highest electrical power users per person are: Iceland, Norway, Kuwait, Canada, Finland, Sweden, United Arab Emirates, Luxembourg, United States, and Australia. Oil production in Africa and the Middle East distort some of the GDP numbers.
What does a high GDP do to birth rate?

Figure 2: As per capita GDP rises, fertility rates (children per woman) fall.

In Figure 2, a fertility rate of 2 is the replacement level. Fertility rates below 2 indicate a declining population. Above 2 there is an increasing population. As you can see, most of Africa is poor and pregnant. African countries that are not poor are oil producers like Libya and Nigeria. Most European populations are in decline. The exceptions are Andorra and Gibraltar. Asian countries with thriving economies are below the replacement value. Singapore is the bottom point on fertility with a rate of 0.78 children per woman. South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau are just above that number.
There is a third leg to our stool: the relationship between fertility rate and electrical power. The next chart shows that relationship.

 Figure 3. The more power people consume, the less children they have.
Again, most of Africa, and some of Asia, is pregnant and powerless. It should be clear by now that there is an optimum electrical power and GDP necessary to result in a sustainable, stable population. Those numbers would appear to be about 3,000 KW hours and a GDP of about $30,000 annually per person. The total population is about seven billion. Therefore:
7 billion X 3,000 KWh = 21 trillion KWh.
21 trillion kilowatt-hours would seem to be a reasonable target. The world currently produces 19 trillion kilowatt-hours of electricity. It appears that about 10% more electrical energy, with the accompanying improvement in GDP, primarily in Africa and some parts of Asia, would go a long way toward improving the quality of life and stabilizing population in those areas.
Energy drives civilization. This fundamental should be obvious to all, but apparently has not penetrated the consciousness of Greens, Progressives, and warmist zealots. Man builds cities to concentrate people, jobs, markets, and energy use into more efficient areas. Energy allows more efficient production, including food, technology, housing, and transportation. Cities and energy encourage creativity and innovation. More energy means a higher Gross Domestic Product.

Figure 4: GDP as a function of electrical power usage, for Europe and the Americas.
Figure 4 shows a clear relationship between GDP and electrical power consumption. If less electricity is generated, the cost of electricity will go up (due to the economic law of supply and demand), less will be used, and GDP will go down. The converse is, of course, more desirable: more power and reducing the cost, will result in a higher GDP. High priced wind and solar is not the answer. Let the market decide how to generate more power efficiently.
For those that are screaming “what about carbon footprint!”, the market will very soon take care of that non-problem. We are currently passing the “peak oil” point. Fossil fuels, in the long term, will be a declining portion of our power production. Barring governmental stupidity, nuclear power will be an increasing percentage of energy production.
Due to the fact that carbon dioxide is a vital plant food, as well as a minor greenhouse gas, sometime in the not too distant future we will be developing schemes to keep the atmospheric CO2 level above 400 ppm or higher.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s little wonder that the German public is beginning an uprising against the mandatory fees that every citizen is forced to pay in order to fund the country’s vast public radio and television. Every year the widely hated GEZ shakes €8 billion from Germans. For German readers, here’s a stinging commentary on just how unbelievably arrogant the German public media has become.
But not only are listeners and viewers fed up with the burgeoning arrogance of the public media, but also by their outright deceit and political propaganda, which they feel is necessary to properly up bring citizens.
One reader provides us yet another example of this. Deutsche Welle (German Broadcasting) here provides its readers with the latest “news” on Fukushima. The elitists in the German public media feel it is one of their solemn duties to tell audiences that nuclear energy is evil, kills thousands, and that we are all supposed to hate it.
From the report we see Japan is waking up to the fact that providing power without nuclear plants is not an easy thing after all, and so the country is contemplating a U-turn and returning to nuclear power, less than 2 years after the Fukushima disaster.
Ministerpräsident Shinzo Abe, who took office just a few days ago, says Japan simply cannot afford to stop using nuclear power.
The DW report, whose source is the German Press Agency (DPA) among others, pretty much provides background information on the Abe’s decision. But it’s the last sentence in the DW report that raises eyebrows:
Through the devastating earthquake and subsequent tsunami, the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Northeastern Japan was seriously damaged. There were meltdowns in three reactor blocks; thousands of people died. It was the worst nuclear catastrophe since the Chernobyl accident in 1986.”
Thousands of people died? Really?
Sadly, editors could not be bothered to check if that spectacular number could be right. One place to start a simple fact-check would be Wikipedia, which is known for political correctness. It turns out that the “thousands of people died” claim is totally bogus – deceit fabricated and now being spread by various European media outlets.

Wikipedia writes that of what few deaths did occur, 2 deaths were caused by “sustained multiple external injuries and were believed to have died from blood loss”, and a Japanese research company found that “other deaths were due to the disruption of hospital operations, exacerbation of pre-existing health problems and the stress of dramatic changes in life” and that “the vast majority of people who died during evacuation were elderly. 45 patients were reported dead after the evacuation of a hospital in Futaba due to lack of food, water and medical care as evacuation was delayed by three days.”
Wikipedia then goes on to write about some people being over-exposed to radiation, but nowhere does the report mention “thousands of people died”. In fact, the Wikipedia report writes (my emphasis):
As of September 2012, there were no deaths or serious injuries due to direct radiation exposures.”
It appears that any radiation deaths show up only in models:
According to a June 2012 Stanford University study by John Ten Hoeve and Mark Jacobson, the radiation released could cause 130 deaths from cancer (the lower bound for the estimater being 15 and the upper bound 1100) and 180 cancer cases (the lower bound being 24 and the upper bound 1800), mostly in Japan.”
Quite surprisngly, Wikipedia then writes that nuclear power actually saves and extends lives – commenting on the numbers of people who died or may die from radiation exposure (emphasis added):

These numbers are very low compared to the estimated 20,000 casualties caused by the tsunami itself, and it has been estimated that if Japan had never adopted nuclear power, accidents and pollution from coal or gas plants would have caused more lost years of life.”

So the next time you pick up or hear any report coming from Germany’s elitist, forced publicly-funded media, don’t believe a damn word of it.

Share this...FacebookTwitterPhysicist Dr. Rainer Link brings our attention to the EU’s new 20/20/20 climate scheme designed to inflict intense pain on citizens with literally zero benefits, read it here at his German blog RL Rational (in German).
This 20/20/20 program aims to reduce CO2 emissions by 20% by 2020, and to increase the share of renewable energy to 20% – all to satisfy the needs of those suffering from rescue-the-planet delusions.
The questions of course are: How much is this EU scheme going to cost? And what are we going to gain from it?
The answers are respectively: a fortune and nothing. Next week Connie Heedegard, EU Climate Commissar, will release more on the costs. But this is no big secret. Last week I posted on this here: 15 Trillion Dollar Self Flagellation.
The $15 trillion dollars is of course will incur only if the madness goes uninterrupted until 2050. But until 2020, Dr. Link writes on how accenture and BARCLAYS Bank introduced a study called: Carbon Capital, Financing The Low Carbon Economy, which details the necessary expected costs needed to reach the 20/20/20 target.
Dr. Link then puts together a cost/benefit analysis of the 20/20/20 EU Climate Requirements and comes up with the numbers, read details here (in German).

Total cost of the reductions up to the year 2020: €2.9 trillion
Total CO2 emissions reduction by 2020: 2.2 billion tonnes
That comes to about €6400 per EU citizen. Dr. Link says although that may sound impressive when taken alone, the sheer stupidity and frivolity of it all becomes clear when you compare it to the CO2 emissions growth from developing countries and the rest of the world: Link writes of the 2.2 biilion tonne reduction:
During this time period it compares to a total global emissions of 320 billion tonnes. The global increase in CO2 emissions of 0.5 billion tonnes per year will wipe out the EU CO2 reduction (which will cost 2.9 trillion euros) in just four years.
Dr. Link then calculates how much of a global theoretical temperature reduction this will lead to. Answer:
0.002°C
It would be much cheaper if the EU just bought everyone an air conditioner. That 0.002°C can neither be measured by a standard home thermometer nor perceived by human senses. All because of two fairy tales: 1) CO2 is leading to climate catastrophe, and 2) Europe can save the planet.
Is there any politican left out there who’s got the spine to stand up to this madness?

Share this...FacebookTwitterBenny Peiser alerts us to this excellent feature story brought to you by the UK Spectator on the wildlife devastation being wrought by “climate-friendly wind turbines”. Hats off to the Spectator for this one.
The story just goes to show you how little the environmentalist thought these things out:
1. Wind turbines don’t produce that much electricity.
2. They run on average only at about 20% of their rated capacity.
3. Their lifetimes are turning out to be only half of what was promised.
4. They are turning the landscape into a panoramic eyesore.
5. Now, we see they are killing birds and bats by the millions.
Recall how environmentalists like to think they are intellectually superior to everyone else, and that they rarely make mistakes. At worst, they only have to “adjust” their ideas at times. This assumed intellectual superiority is what drives them.
Well, it now looks like they got some major adjusting to do with their thinking. But I suppose this windmill carnage will be too much for them to cope with, and so they’ll go on denying it and act like they’re rescuing the climate.
How can we expect them to understand the complexities of climate when they can’t even think more than one step ahead?
We saw the same pattern of behaviour with the communists and their economics. Did they change course? Except for China, they all obstinately stayed in acute denial until everything around them collapsed. Expect the same from the kook-green, drugged-up-on-climate-protectionism European governments and media.

Clive Hambler writes (emphasis added):
Though I started out neutral on renewable energy, I’ve since seen the havoc wreaked on wildlife by wind power, hydro power, biofuels and tidal barrages. The environmentalists who support such projects do so for ideological reasons. What few of them have in their heads, though, is the consolation of science.”
One has to wonder which species is more intelligent: birds or environmentalist kooks?
I’ve heard it suggested that birds will soon adapt to avoid turbine blades. But your ability to learn something when you’ve been whacked on the head by an object travelling at 200 mph is limited.”
I seriously doubt that green-kooks are any more capable of learning.

"Toyota has said that it was not consulted on a Liberal party campaign that uses targeted Facebook ads to falsely claim Bill Shorten wants to tax popular car brands including the Toyota Hilux and other utility vehicles. “Toyota Australia were not consulted on the use of the HiLux in government materials.”  The ads – which appeared on Monday – use Facebook ad functionality to target users with an interest in particular vehicle types to make the false claim about Labor’s policy, which includes vehicle emissions standards and a target of 50% of new car sales being electric vehicles by 2030. The Japanese carmaker also said it was on track with global plans to electrify the entire vehicle line up by 2025.  The Coalition is stepping up its attack despite the fact the treasurer and former environment minister Josh Frydenberg has spruiked electric vehicles on the basis they will save drivers money and that vehicle emissions standards are still part of the government’s plan to reduce emissions. The ads, posted by the Liberal party’s official account, state that “Labor’s car tax would mean higher prices on some of Australia’s most popular cars” and encourage users to “sign up to stop Labor’s car tax”. Labor’s electric vehicle policy, released earlier in April, includes only one tax-related measure – a deduction of 20% depreciation for businesses which buy electric vehicles worth more than $20,000. The imposition of an emissions standard of 105g CO2/km for light vehicles is not a tax because it does not raise any revenue for the government. In fact, the uptake of electric vehicles is estimated to cost the budget more than $1bn a year by 2030 in lost fuel excise, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. The Facebook ads target users who have indicate their interest in popular car brands including Holdens, Ford Rangers, Toyota Hiluxes and Mitsubishi Tritons. Libs are now running targeted FB ads against specific car types - which are all available ""interest"" categories for FB ads (I just checked and you can target australians in specific age ranges interested in mitsubishi tritons if you want) pic.twitter.com/p395Ftf8Ti The ads do not contain detailed authorisations, although the Australian Electoral Commission has told Guardian Australia that ads meet their standards if details are posted in the “about” section of the posting page. Other ads on the Liberal party Facebook page suggest that emissions standards “will add up to $4,863 to the cost of a new car”, citing a 2016 report by the Centre for International Economics. An infrastructure department report published in December 2016 estimated that a 105g CO2/km emissions standard phased in from 2020 to 2025 will save $27.5bn in fuel costs and achieve $2.7bn worth of greenhouse gas abatement, for a total $30.1bn saving. It estimated a total cost of $16.2bn to achieve the standard, for a total net benefit of $13.9bn. As recently as August 2017 Frydenberg said vehicle efficiency standards were about “reducing fuel costs and carbon emissions at the same time”. “In Australia in 2016 the average amount of CO2 emitted per kilometre was 182 grams, while the EU is moving to 100g/km by 2021, and in the US the target is 105g/km by 2025,” he said. Frydenberg said if Australia had fuel efficiency standards in line with comparable nations, “estimates of the fuel saving per passenger vehicle could be above $500 per year, or nearly $28bn in total by 2040”. “Given the long distances travelled in regional Australia, the savings could be even greater for people living outside the main cities.” The environment department website states the the emissions reduction fund – the centrepiece of the Coalition’s climate change policy – will provide “support for the uptake of renewable energy and energy efficiency [and] vehicle emission standards”. On Sunday Scott Morrison accused Shorten of wanting to “end the weekend” because the electric vehicles would hurt “Australians who love being out there in their four-wheel drives”. The Coalition was elected under Tony Abbott in 2013 with a fierce campaign against the Labor government’s price on carbon, which it labelled a carbon tax. In 2017 Abbott’s former chief of staff, Peta Credlin, admitted “it wasn’t a carbon tax … it was many other things in nomenclature terms but we made it a carbon tax”. “We made it a fight about the hip pocket and not about the environment,” she told Sky News. “That was brutal retail politics and it took Abbott about six months to cut through and when he cut through, Gillard was gone.”"
"Canada is warming twice as fast as the rest of the world, a landmark government report has found, warning that drastic action is the only way to avoid catastrophic outcomes. “The science is clear – Canada’s climate is warming more rapidly than the global average, and this level of warming effectively cannot be changed,” Nancy Hamzawi, assistant deputy minister for science and technology at Environment and Climate Change Canada, told reporters on Monday.  The report, released late on Monday by Environment and Climate Change Canada, paints a grim picture of Canada’s future, in which deadly heatwaves and heavy rainstorms become a common occurrence. Forty-three government scientists and academics authored the peer-reviewed report. While global temperatures have increased 0.8C since 1948, Canada has seen an increase of 1.7C – more than double the global average. And in the Arctic, the warming is happening at a much faster rate of 2.3C, the report says. While the increased warming in the Arctic is not yet fully understood, snow and ice play a critical role in reflecting the sun’s radiation and heat. But scientists say the retreat of glaciers and disappearing sea ice both contribute to a feedback loop of warming, which is one of the factors contributing to Canada’s disproportionate temperature increase. The report suggests the majority of warming felt in Canada and around the globe is the result of burning fossil fuels. Canada has already pledged to cut emissions by 200m tonnes by 2030 – a cornerstone of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s national climate strategy – largely through a federally mandated carbon tax and shuttering coal-fired plants. Despite the urgency of the report, Canada remains mired in a political battle over climate policy. Trudeau has pushed for a national carbon pricing strategy, and on Monday the federal government imposed the tax on four provinces that refuse to implement one. Conservative politicians have pledged to remove the tax if they win this fall’s general election, arguing that it is too much of a burden for Canadians. But under the current plan, households will receive rebate cheques from the federal government to offset any added expenses from the tax – meaning costs to the average consumer are negligible. The report makes clear that Canada faces markedly different outcomes, depending on the policies it chooses to reduce emissions. Under a scenario in which global emissions are dramatically reduced, average temperatures will rise only 3C across the country by 2100, including the Arctic region. But if countries – including Canada – fail to act aggressively, increases of 7-9 degrees are likely, and the Arctic faces the prospect of 11 degrees of warming. Under the report’s worst-case scenario, the risk of deadly heatwaves increases tenfold bring with it droughts and forest fires. Western Canada has already grappled with two years of record forest fire seasons. The risk of major rain events also doubles, meaning cities will be inundated with catastrophic urban flooding. Access to critical sources of fresh water will also be constrained, due in large part to reduced winter snowfall, which in turn becomes a source of clean water when the snowpack melts. Many of the previously documented effects – melting permafrost, disappearing sea ice and glacial retreat – are only set to intensify in the coming years. “We are already seeing the effects of widespread warming in Canada,” said Elizabeth Bush, a climate science adviser at Environment Canada, told reporters. “It’s clear, the science supports the fact that adapting to climate change is an imperative. Urgent action is needed to reduce emissions.”"
"Sikhs around the world are taking part in a scheme to plant a million new trees as a “gift to the entire planet”. The project aims to reverse environmental decline and help people reconnect with nature as part of celebrations marking 550 years since the birth of the founder of Sikhism, Guru Nanak.  Rajwant Singh, the president of the Washington DC-based environmental organisation EcoSikh, which is coordinating the Million Tree Project, said he wanted to mark the anniversary in a significant way. “Guru Nanak was a nature lover. [He] had talked about nature as a manifestation of God and many of his writings talk about how we need to learn lessons of life from nature.” One of Guru Nanak’s hymns, which many Sikhs recite as a daily prayer, includes the lyrical line: “Air is the teacher, water is the father, earth is the mother.” Singh said he hoped the project would motivate Sikhs – especially the young – to improve their relationship with nature and would be seen more broadly as “a gift to the entire planet”. The Sikh diaspora has taken on the challenge and tens of thousands of trees have already been planted. These are mostly in India – the majority of the world’s Sikh population lives in the state of Punjab, which is planning to plant 550 saplings in every village – but also in the UK, US, Australia and Kenya. Sikh Union Coventry has started planting native trees, shrubs and flowers such as hazel and hawthorn at Longford Park, and is exploring locations in schools, parks and recreation areas. Palvinder Singh Chana, the chair of Sikh Union Coventry, said: “As Sikhs, our connection to the environment is an integral part of our faith and identity. Future generations will benefit from the fruits of our labour, symbolising peace, friendships and continuity for generations to come.” EcoSikh is also working with Afforestt, an organisation that trains people to design and build small native forests that grow quickly and are a sustainable part of the ecosystem. Singh said more than 1,800 of these forests were planned across the world, and that the million tree target would be achieved by the time of Guru Nanak’s birthday in November."

Share this...FacebookTwitterBoy I’ll tell you-  climate science is getting more and more convincing with every passing day.
Remember how we were always told that climate change would impact poor Africa the most…and negatively? The German language Die Presse has an online report called:
Warming: Will Africa starve or flourish?
It’s about the PNAS 28.2 paper just out, which came to the astonishing conclusion that climate change will either have positive impacts on agriculture in Africa, or it will have negative impacts. Not only that, agriculture there will have to adapt to these changes.
How brilliant! It took leading earth-systems scientists from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research to figure that out.
First, recall that the 2007 IPCC Report claimed that crop yields in some countries could get reduced by 50% and that access to food could be put at risk – all because of climate change.
These were the dire projections made just a few years ago. But then came Climategate and the discovery of a series of errors in the IPCC report, and its heavy use of grey literature. Scientists began to doubt. So to get more certainty on the subject, projections were re-evaluated and are now being revamped. The PNAS presents the new certainty.
The new results are out and were produced by a group led by Christoph Müller of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and appear in the PNAS 28.2. The group assessed 20 scientific studies on Africa and its agriculture since 2007. Unfortunately the latest results show everything but consensus and certainty. Die Presse writes:
Müller’s group found that some studies predict agricultural production in Africa will collapse to almost nothing while other studies see blooming agriculture like never before – with crop yields up by as much as 168%.”

Does anyone think these results are going to be of any use for African policy makers? The PNAS 28.2 abstract says:
Despite large uncertainty, there are several robust conclusions from published literature for policy makers and research agendas: agriculture everywhere in Africa runs some risk to be negatively affected by climate change; existing cropping systems and infrastructure will have to change to meet future demand. With respect to growing population and the threat of negative climate change impacts, science will now have to show if and how agricultural production in Africa can be significantly improved.”
Say what?
– Robust conclusions?
– Agriculture everywhere runs some risk?
– Cropping systems and infrastructure will have to change to meet future demand?
– Science will have to show how agricultural production can be improved?
No kidding! Really? Folks, what a pile of scientific crap this is! This report says nothing except confirm that they don’t have a clue about what will happen in Africa and its agriculture. They know less than ever before. Die Presse sums up the rubbish beautifully, describing this paper with an old German saying that is often used for such results:
Wenn der Hahn kräht auf dem Mist
Ändert sich das Wetter
Oder es belibt wie es ist
In English, roughly (doesn’t quite rhyme):
When the cock crows on a pile of shit
Either the weather will change
or it’ll stay as it is.
This means this PNAS paper says nothing. But this is kind of the crap that gets published by “prestigious scientific journals” nowadays. And so Die Presse writes:
The very science that cannot even project what will come in the future is now supposed to tell us ‘if and how’ agricultural production in Africa should adapt and how agricultural yields can be ‘significantly improved’ under the unknown new conditions.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterFirst, a few words about 2011
I don’t want to bore everyone with a long recap of 2011, just a few highlights off the top of my head.
2011 started with the climate bet with Rob Honeycutt and Co. NoTricksZone and the coolists say this new decade 2011-2020 will be cooler than the last decade 2001-2010 (and it looks like 2011 is in the coolist column, though I haven’t run the numbers yet).
Then in March there was Fukushima and the ensuing mass media-driven hysteria that tsunamied over Germany, and led a panicked government to shut down the entire German nuclear industry.
In 2011 we also got to know Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber’s “Master Plan” for transforming global society so that it suits his view of what it should be. Unfortunately it is closed-minded, based on dogma, and has little to do with science. To me what Schellnhuber proposes is nothing less than wild adventurism in the social engineering laboratory. The results of implementing such a plan would be devastating for democracy and overall global social development. It opens the the door to authoritarianism. If anything, the “Master Plan” is a powerful argument why scientists should stay in their labs, and not be left to run society.
In April NoTricksZone got its 1 millionth visit after one year of existence (the 2 million will be reached this month).
The story that got lots a visitors was the weed-covered multi-million dollar solar field. Ironically that photo may someday come to symbolize Germany’s obsessed, misguided and rushed energy-supply conversion which the country is so hell-bent on in achieving – no matter the costs. Globally, except for China, 2011 is the year that solar energy bit the dust.
German doubt over climate science going global in 2012?
The big 2011 highlight for me is one that readers are not aware of. One morning in early September I got an e-mail from geologist Dr. Sebastian Lüning, asking if I’d be interested in translating in English a new book on climate science and energy policy he and Prof. Dr. Fritz Vahrenholt were working on. I immediately said yes.
Over the next three months I used every available hour I could find to do the work. I finished the job just a few days ago, on December 29. The book’s publisher Hoffmann & Campe in Hamburg is now about to start the search for a publisher for the English version. So we’re hoping that Die Kalte Sonne (The Cold Sun) will also soon be available in English for international readers – soon.

German edition can now be ordered here.
Personally I learned a lot from this book. As a layman, I had some general knowledge gaps and gray areas in climate science. This book puts everything in clear perspective and deepened my knowledge. It’s up-to-date and cites many of the latest peer-reviewed papers – more than 800 sources in total. Both Dr. Lüning and Dr. Vahrenholt made an outstanding effort in putting it together. Already it’s starting to stir up controversy here, even though the German version won’t be available until February. It’s light-years more up-to-date than the IPCC 2007 AR4.
When you read Die Kalte Sonne, you really get the sense of how far climate science has advanced since 2007 and how outdated and narrow the IPCC AR4 truly is. Talk about divergence!
Authors forecast cooling for the decades ahead
The book’s authors focus on why the climate catastrophe is not taking place. It takes an in-depth look into the topics of solar cycles, temperature reconstructions, the Hockey Stick, aerosols, soot, fudging, amplification mechanisms, cosmic radiation, magnetism, clouds, UV radiation, ocean cycles, the shortcomings and flaws of the IPCC and their dubious models in particular. The authors also present their own look into the future using a model that considers all important climate drivers. It concludes that the Earth has to reckon with cooling over the coming decades. It’s the most convincing forecast I’ve seen up to now.
I’m very optimistic about the success of the book, and will be following it closely in the weeks ahead.
3rd year of NTZ
I also look forward to starting my 3rd year of blogging, together with the guest writers you have come to know – like Ed, Matti, and Juraj. I hope readers will keep coming back. Wishing you all the best for 2012!

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt Der Spiegel Axel Bojanowski writes a story about a study appearing in the journal Climate Change:  A 101 year record of windstorms in the Netherlands.
The results of the study are revealing. Let us recall that in Germany and within many circles of “experts” the prevailing wisdom is that man-made global warming is leading to more frequent and more severe storms. However, this new study shows that this is a myth. The study’s abstract concludes:
The Netherlands is currently experiencing the minimum aggregate storm damage of the past 100 years, though only slightly lower than a quiet period of 50 years ago.”
And Der Spiegel writes:
Prognosticated climate warming produced fears of more frequent storm surges and flooding. Especially the Netherlands was threatened. Because much of the country is below sea level – higher dikes would be needed to protect the country. However these worries are shown to be baseless a new study in the journal ‘Climate Change’ shows: According to the statistics, the Netherlands is experiencing fewer and fewer storm surges.”
Since systematic records have been kept starting 101 years ago, never have there been fewer storms than in the last 15 years, reports Stephen Cusack of the private research institute ‘Risk Management Solutions’ in London. Not only storms as a whole, but also storms with heavy damages have greatly reduced.”

Now those are results that completely contradict everything special interests like the re-insurance industry have been telling us.
Solar or ocean related?
The abstract provides another interesting observation (my emphasis):
The resulting windstorm loss time-series for the Netherlands contains some interesting features. Annual losses are stable over the whole period and have a dominant cycle with a period of about 50 years.”
The study also says that weak storms were more frequent during the previous lull 50 years ago and that the current lull is somewhat different in character. The journal suspects that this may be due to “a different mix of climate forcing mechanisms in modern times compared to 50 years ago.”
This ought not be a surprise, though. Weather is chaotic and it would be indeed foolish to assume that weather duplicates itself. Change is a natural process. It only proves that climate changes – like it’s supposed to!

"At last, a newspaper prepared to publish CO2 emissions on a daily basis, though unfortunately on the weather page (Why our daily weather forecast now includes a carbon dioxide count, 5 April). What is happening to the climate, and the CO2 emissions causing this, are not related to the weather. The economic section is where CO2 emissions should appear, alongside economic indicators like GDP and stock market prices. This is where the relationship between how we think wealth is generated and the costs of doing so should be made transparent. The thoughtful introduction of a few more headline indicators such as inequality, population numbers for humans/pollinators/dolphins/tigers, forest cover and deaths from air pollution on the same page would make the Guardian a genuinely progressive and even a transformative newspaper.Sara ParkinPrincipal associate, The Sustainability Literacy Project   • It’s great that the Guardian will publish a daily record of carbon dioxide levels, but the place for this is not the weather page. Weather is outside our control. Carbon dioxide levels are our responsibility – the inexorable rise should be (daily) front-page news.Donald SmithHaddington, East Lothian • It is good that you are recognising the climate emergency by posting the daily levels of atmospheric CO2 which are still rising. However, as reported in February, there have been even sharper rises in methane in recent years. Methane and nitrous oxide are much more potent greenhouse gases in the short term, and scientists do not understand the source of these alarming increases. Please would you also report daily methane and nitrous oxide levels as a reminder that urgent action is needed to cut the emissions and levels of these gases too.Dr Andrew BoswellNorwich • I’m delighted to read that the Guardian will now include a carbon dioxide measure as part of its daily forecast. However, as George Monbiot has been saying for years, we urgently need to change the language we are using to discuss the climate situation. The term “climate change”, still being used in your newspaper in this article, gives an inaccurate and far too benign impression of the situation.

Page 2 story in Bild today! The first of a series.

“THE CO2 LIES … pure fear-mongering … should we blindly trust the experts?”

That’s what Germany’s leading daily Bild (see photo) wrote in its print and online editions today, on the very day that renowned publisher Hoffmann & Campe officially released a skeptic book – one written by a prominent socialist and environmental figure.
This is huge. More than I ever could have possibly imagined. And more is coming in the days ahead! The Bild piece was just the first of a series.
Mark this as the date that Germany’s global warming movement took a massive body blow.
Today, not one, but two of Germany’s most widely read news media published comprehensive skeptical climate science articles in their print and online editions, coinciding with the release of a major climate skeptical book, Die kalte Sonne (The Cold Sun).
Germany has now plunged into raucus discord on the heated topic of climate change
What has set it all off? One of the fathers of Germany’s modern green movement, Professor Dr. Fritz Vahrenholt, a social democrat and green activist, decided to author a climate science skeptical book together with geologist/paleontologist Dr. Sebastian Lüning. Vahrenholt’s skepticism started when he was asked to review an IPCC report on renewable energy. He found hundreds of errors. When he pointed them out, IPCC officials simply brushed them aside. Stunned, he asked himself, “Is this the way they approached the climate assessment reports?”
Vahrenholt decided to do some digging. His colleague Dr. Lüning also gave him a copy of Andrew Montford’s The Hockey Stick Illusion. He was horrified by the sloppiness and deception he found. Persuaded by Hoffmann & Campe, he and Lüning decided to write the book. Die kalte Sonne cites 800 sources and has over 80 charts and figures. It examines and summarizes the latest science.
Conclusion: climate catastrophe is called off
The science was hyped. The book started hitting the bookshops today and has already hit no. 1 on the Amazon.de list for environment books. Indications show that it will climb very high in the overall bestseller charts. It’s published by a renowned publishing house and is now sending shock waves through the German climate science establishment. The first printing will produce 20,000 copies. I expect they will sell out rather quickly.
Today Germany’s national tabloid Bild (which has a whopping circulation of 16 million) devoted half of page 2 on an article called:
THE CO2 LIE
Renowned team of scientists claim the climate catastrophe is fear-mongering by politics“

The widely read Bild will follow with the rest of the series in the days ahead. In part I today Bild presents “What the IPCC of the UN doesn’t tell you.” Bild asks “what if the IPCC is wrong? Can we really blindly trust these experts? Are they really independent?”
Bild then writes:
The phenomenal prognoses of heat from the IPCC are pure fear-mongering.”
The Bild series is sure to cause radical environmentalists to seethe and lash out. Expect an all-out assault in the days and weeks ahead. Already the reaction from activists has been swift and virulent – though they have yet to read the book.
They never wanted the debate – and now the dam has broken
And the floods of skepticism are sweeping over the country. Worse, Germany’s flagship weekly news magazine Der Spiegel today also featured a 4-page exclusive interview with Vahrenholt, where he repeated that the IPCC has ignored a large part of climate science and that IPCC scientists exaggerated the impact of CO2 on climate. Vahrenholt said that by extending the known natural cycles of the past into the future, and taking CO2’s real impact into effect, we should expect a few tenths of a degree of cooling.
At a press conference today in Berlin, Vahrenholt, Lüning and publisher Hoffmann & Campe introduced the book and answered reporters’ questions. When asked why Hoffmann & Campe decided to publish “such a book”, the spokesman simply answered that the time is right – and there’s a real audience for the book. Even the weather timing was right! Germany is now experiencing it’s worst cold snap in 26 years. That makes it hard to deny lack of warming.
It needs to be pointed out Vahrenholt and Lüning are not skeptics; they are lukewarmers who have not been able to find any evidence of a coming climate catastrophe. They believe that man should switch to renewables, but do so in a rational manner: “Work fast, but don’t hurry.”
Skeptic readers should not think that the book will fortify their existing skepticism of CO2 causing warming. The authors agree it does. but have major qualms about the assumed positive CO2-related feed-backs and believe the sun plays a far greater role in the whole scheme of things.
The book cites more than 800 sources – including the latest peer-reviewed literature. It includes more than 80 graphics that clearly illustrate that all is not well with the claims made by alarmist science. It is written so that laymen can easily digest the material and it provides a comprehensive overview of the science and where it stands today.
The book has also infuriated the AGW leadership in Germany. For example, academia. University of Osnabrück took the step of dis-inviting Professor Vahrenholt who was scheduled to give a speech on February 8. The University claimed that Vahrenholt’s skeptical views were “provocative”. Also the centre-left SPD party, where Vahrenholt is a member, has been deafeningly silent.
This cat is out of the bag – and it’s not going back in.
The authors have set up a website for Die kalte Sonne here.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAngela Merkel and the German government once declared the lofty aim of putting one million electric cars on German streets in a bid on how to show the world how to be environmentally responsible.

One for the history books. Electric cars cannot compete in Germany – even 108 years later.
But today they admit they will not even come close to reaching this target. In fact experts say Germany faces a new challenge: how to ensure a basic supply of electricity to its homes and businesses this winter, forget about powering a million cars with electricity in addition!
Not long ago, Germany’s energy generation and distribution system globally was second to none when it came to reliability, price and stability, making the country an attractive location for energy-intensive, high-tech industry. Germany was even a net exporter of power.
But then the government and media, having succumbed to mass climate and nuclear hysteria, made a rash, blind leap into alternative energies, particularly sun and wind. Electricity prices have been skyrocketing ever since and the supply of power has become unstable and expensive.
Larger companies are now moving out.
Germany’s power generation and distribution infrastructure has taken a massive hit because of the conversion to renewable energies. In just a few short years electricity has become one of the most expensive in the world and experts are now placing even bets that the grid will not be able to avert a blackout this winter. So far and so fast have the mighty fallen.
The Local quotes the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung:
The hype is over. The high expectations for electric cars, which have no carbon dioxide emissions, has been replaced by huge disappointment, the paper wrote.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe losing side will have to pay up to $5000 to a children's charity,
Warmist and NTZ observer “Robhon” has daringly entered a bet for US $5000 with NTZ and NTZ  readers that the next decade 2011 – 2020 will be warmer on average than the previous 2001 – 2010 decade.
Last update click here.
NTZ and NTZ readers say it will be cooler, or the same.
The loser of the bet will have to pay the amount to a charity for children in dire need, such as Children Hospice International.
The charity orgnaisation will have to be international, support children in dire need and at the same time have low overhead costs.
We want to thank Robhon for accepting this sporting challenge, which is for a good cause. Win or lose – everyone wins.
So far NTZ and readers have pledged about $300.00 (5 Jan 2011), betting that the earth will be cooler or at the same temperature on average over the next 10 years. We would like to get that amount up to the maximum of $5000 that Robhon has committed. Robhon also mentioned that he may find others willing to put their money where their mouths are.
The bet 
If the decade of 2011 – 2020 is cooler or the same on average globally than the decade of 2001 – 2010, then warmist Robhon will pay to charity the total amount this pledged by NTZ and readers until February 1, 2011. The target is $5K.
If the average global temperature for the decade 2011 – 2020 is warmer than the average of 2001 – 2010, then NTZ and readers will pay everything we pledged to the charity.
Which dataset?
It has been agreed to use both a composite of RSS and UAH lower troposphere temperature – close to the earth’s surface. The result will be accepted without quibbling, as it is agreed that it’s the best we’ve got.
How and when to pay?
Payment will be made when the bet is settled, i.e. 2021, or possibly earlier if it’s clear who the winner will be, but only with mutual agreement.
Right now I am only gathering the pledges and putting your username, e-mail address and amount pledged on a list. So if us coolists win, then we will not have to pay. Robhon on the other hand will have to pay an amount that equals the total that us coolists pledged – up to 5000 (five thousand) dollars. If us coolists lose, then each person will have to pay directly to the chosen charity organisation. Even if us coolists lost, I would still make the contribution anyway, simply because I think it’s for a good cause.

You will be asked to pay when the bet is settled, i.e. 2021.
Where, when and how do I make my pledge?
You can pledge by leaving a comment. I will put your username and email address and amount on a list. I will post the list from time to time (without e-mail address of course). Please make your pledges before March 1, 2011.
WHICH CHARITY GETS THE MONEY?
As mentioned above, the charity organisation will be (1) one that both sides agree on, (2) helps children in dire need (3) have low overhead costs so the money really helps and (4) be international.
What happens if the loser doesn’t pay?
If the loser of the bet refuses to pay, then he will be forever regarded as a useless deadbeat loudmouth scumbag with no honour. Ed and Juraj have the bucket of tar and a sack of feathers ready. They will not hesitate to tar and feather anyone – warmist or coolist!
How will we control if someone pays?
I have a list, and somehow we will get a statement from the charity organisation confirming that payment was indeed made.
What if something happens to me and I can’t pay?
Not your fault. You’ll be simply taken off the list and you will be remembered as a generous and honourable person.
So please pledge a nominal amount!
I hope that more readers here will pledge some money for this bet. Again it would be nice to have Robhon pay the full $5000 he has committed, and so I need to get as many pledges as possible. Minimum is $10.
So what is it going to be? Cooler, or warmer?
The bet is on!

101 in Ukraine — 24 in Romania  — 17 in Czech Republic — 11 in Slovakia — 64 in Russia – no end in sight! — Read here (German)
===============================================
Germany’s no. 1 daily Bild (by circulation numbers) reports on the Killer Cold now paralyzing Europe and Asia, and calls it the worst in 25 years. The cold has hit Eastern Europe especially hard, with temperatures plummeting to -30°C throughout the Ukraine and Poland. So far the cold has claimed 139 lives, with 3 in Germany.
Europe's temperatures are forecast to remain 10°C or colder below normal - worst cold in 25 years.

According to the BBC: “In Italy, weather experts say it is the coldest week for 27 years.”
In the Urals and Siberia, the temperature fell to -40C while in the capital of Kazakhstan, Astana, a forecaster told Interfax-Kazakhstan news agency the wind-chill factor meant the real temperature was down to -52C, even though the air temperature was -35C.”
Gas and electricitry supply have collapsed in some areas, leaving many to shiver.
-39°C in Finland
Bild reported Thursday that a new cold record had been set in Finland: minus 39°C was recorded in Northern Finland.
In Eastern Germany, temperatures are forecast to plummet to minus 20°C in the days ahead. According to Helmut Malewski of the German Weather Service: “No warm-up is in sight for the coming 8 days.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterTwo days ago I wrote here about how a scheduled presentation by Professor Dr Fritz Vahrenholt had been cancelled by the University of Osnabrück because of his controversial climate catastrophe skeptical book, Die kalte Sonne, which will be released next week by renowned publisher Hoffmann & Campe of Hamburg.The original public announcement of Vahrenholt’s presentation read: “In the series of presentations ‘University Speeches’ of the University of Osnabrück, Prof. Dr. Fritz Vahrenholt – RWE Innogy, Essen will hold a speech titled ‘The Climate Catastrophe is not Taking Place’.”
However, since the book and controversy have been making waves in Germany, the University of Osnabrück suddenly deemed such climate science skepticism as too “provocative”, and therefore refused to allow the presentation to be made unless a “counter-speaker” and a “competent moderator” were present. But because there was not enough time to organize it, the University cancelled Vahrenholt’s presentation at the last minute.
In the cancellation notification released by Professors Asholt and Altendorf, they claimed they had actually requested the topic of “Options for the Future Energy Supply of Germany”, and that Vahrenholt “surprised” them with the provocative title: “The Climate Catastrophe Is Not taking Place” just 3 weeks before the scheduled presentation.”
BS of course. The U of Osnabrück had known about the real topic long before, and not just 3 weeks ago. And so in an e-mail sent to NTZ, Prof Vahrenholt wishes to set the record straight. He wrote the following to Asholt and Altendorf:
Last year you happily accepted our topic of choice: ‘The Climate Catastrophe Is Not Taking Place’ and we agreed on a date for the presentation. You then informed my assistant just a few days ago, because of pressure from the University management, that I would only be allowed to speak under the condition that I accept a counter-position to be presented at the event, e.g. by Mr. Schellnhuber.”
Also in the cancellation Professors Asholt and Altendorf suggested Vahrenholt had agreed to a new date for the event. Vahrenholt writes that too is false:
We specifically informed you that I would not be available for such an event. And now that I was dis-invited by the University just 7 days before the event was scheduled to take place, I am no longer available for any other event. The entire matter is already bad enough. Hence I request that I no longer be misused as camouflage for the real motive behind my dis-invitation.”
Obviously The University of Osnabrück was less than truthful about the motives behind its dis-invitation. When University professors start distorting stories and camouflaging real motives, then indeed Prof Vahrenholt’s decision to no longer have anything more to do with them is more than warranted.
Makes you wonder if you can believe anything that comes from the two U of Osnabrück’s professors.

"Just when you thought things couldn’t get any messier in the House of Commons, protesters from Extinction Rebellion fetched up in the public gallery on Monday, took off their clothes and superglued themselves to the glass panels. Rumours abounded that they had done so by the buttocks, but in fact it was just their hands. Still, it sounds a bit like that description of resentment: it’s like taking poison and waiting for the other person to die. Whoever it was that ended up getting sprayed with WD40 and taken away by the police, it wasn’t Michael Gove. This manner of nude protest has a fine pedigree, on the following issues. The naked bike ride is a worldwide movement, in which clothing is optional. If you have seen it, you will remember it from the double-take: “Wait, was that person naked?” that happens when naked people are fast-moving. Its mission statement had the original aim to “protest oil dependency and celebrate the power and individuality of our bodies” – a slightly woolly purpose that makes me think that some people just really like being naked on a bike. The Ukrainian protest group Femen made history – and international front pages – protesting against sex tourism, marriage agencies, sexism generally and – by 2012 at Davos – capitalism. I always smelled a rat because they looked so great; true protest would be stripping naked when you look like a mattress stuffed with socks. But maybe that’s a really sexist thing to say. Am I part of the problem? The economist Victoria Bateman started on a different wicket, trying to “punch feminism into economics” by stripping down to her gloves in the middle of a conference. She then shifted on to Brexit and Rachel Johnson followed suit. “I thought it would make a cheeky nib in the Sun,” Johnson tells me. “‘Boris’s sister flashes baps’. I wasn’t even naked! I was wearing a flesh-coloured basque. It was horrific. Overnight, I turned into La CicciolinaThe whole world thinks I got my tits out against Brexit. And I would, if I thought it would help, but I didn’t.”  Not the classic nude protest, but an early example of the anarchic spirit: the Freedomites were Russian emigres who arrived in Canada at the turn of the 19th century hoping to escape religious persecution and soon had a beef with the Canadian government. They also used arson to protest against materialism, which is arguably the most succinct protest of all."
"An abnormally hot summer in Australia ended with the warmest March on record, new data from the Bureau of Meteorology shows. The latest monthly climate breakdown shows that despite two severe tropical cyclones in the northern states, temperatures across Australia were 2.13C above the average throughout last month in part due to an unusually dry summer in Western Australia and the Northern Territory. “One of the standout features of March was there was above-average temperatures just about everywhere; more than 99% of the country,” Blair Trewin, a senior climatologist at the bureau told Guardian Australia. “Really a few things came together: the overall, long-term background trend [of rising temperatures] means you’re starting from a higher base, which increases the probability of records. “Another major factor has been that the summer monsoon season in the tropics has been quite weak. Normally in the tropics in the summer you see fairly regular incursions of rainfall and moisture into the continent. That has been happening in Queensland but not really in Western Australia or the Northern Territory.” The record temperatures in March follow records in January, while February was in the top five on record. Last year was Australia’s third-warmest year on record. It beat out the previous third-place holder, 2017. The 2018 state of the climate report from the bureau and CSIRO found Australia was experiencing more extreme heat, longer fire seasons, rising oceans and more marine heatwaves consistent with a changing climate. So, is this the new normal? “It’s not as if we’re going to see records every month, even in the warmer overall climate we have now,” Trewin said. “This is still a very abnormal summer, when you break the record for the warmest first quarter by 0.9 of a degree, that’s not a small number. It’s been an unusually hot few months, the background warming trend we see in Australia is in the order of 0.1 to 0.2 of a degree per decade. “Even in the climate of 2019 this is unusual, but is not as unusual as it would have been in say 1980 or 1950.” According to the bureau’s report, two severe tropical cyclones – Trevor and Veronica - contributed to very much above-average rainfall in parts of north Queensland, the east of the Northern Territory, north-east South Australia and parts of the Pilbara coast. A wet end to the month brought totals to above average for eastern New South Wales, far-eastern Victoria and south-east Queensland. However the report noted that “unfortunately, the rain needed to reduce significant rainfall deficiencies in drought-affected areas is substantial and will require above-average rainfall over a prolonged period to completely remove deficits at longer timescales”. Trewin said that without those downpours, the overall average would have been higher. “It had a bit of a cooling effect particularly in Queensland, though they still came in with their fifth warmest March on record,” he said. The outlook is not particularly promising either. Trewin said most areas had a “neutral” outlook for rainfall, with the expectation of above-average temperatures to continue."
"Nobody predicted the immense success of Australian Damon Gameau’s 2015 directorial debut, That Sugar Film, a candy-coloured, Supersize Me-esque documentary exploring the effects of consuming sugar while on a supposedly healthy diet. It was a smash hit in its home country, becoming the highest grossing non-Imax Australian documentary in history (since overtaken by Jennifer Peedom’s majestic 2017 doco Mountain). Perhaps we shouldn’t have been surprised. Gameau took an issue relevant across cultures and demographics, and prised it open with a broadly accessible style that neither bored nor talked down to young people – who form much of his target demographic.  The director-presenter inhabited the role of a cool school teacher doing what all cool teachers aspire to do: making education fun. For his follow-up film 2040, which had its Australian premiere this week at the Gold Coast film festival, Gameau turns his focus to the health of the planet, keeping broadly the same upbeat approach. While That Sugar Film contained horrific visions of dental apocalypse that no doubt compelled young’uns to brush their teeth out of sheer, gum-gobbling terror, the overall message remained optimistic – emphasising the power we have to shape our bodies and lives. Similarly, when applying the stethoscope to the earth’s wellbeing, Gameau positions himself as a glass-half-full idealist, with his first mission to convince people that they can make a difference. Dividing his focus into key areas, including renewable energy and alternative transportation, with corresponding on-the-road case studies, he structures the film as a one-way conversation with his four-year-old daughter, who will be 25 when the titular year arrives and, he hopes, part of a brighter and better world. The outlook of the film is refreshing. There’s no shortage of gooseflesh-raising documentaries that tell us, not without justification, that the world is going – or has already gone – to the dogs. “I think there’s room for a different story,” Gameau says, in the garden with shovel in hand, near the beginning of the film. It is peppered with Kids Say the Darndest Things-type interviews – pipsqueaks discussing their ideal solutions to the world’s problems. Presumably Gameau was delighted by the sight of thousands of Australian kids walking out of school last month, protesting against the government’s inaction on fossil fuel emissions. The overarching approach of 2040 is not unlike aTV program, such as Todd Sampson’s Redesign My Brain, in which an engaging host tracks down experts who have spent their lives researching subjects that are relatively new to the presenter. Gameau’s pitch is that he has the skills to distil complex ideas into thoroughly digestible chunks. This is where we see his auteurial voice emerging – creating visual innovations that add some bling to potentially dry subject matter. For instance, he gives interviewees the Honey, I Shrunk the Kids treatment, reducing them to tiny figurines in aesthetically engaging environments –on a Monopoly board or perched atop a shovel. But given the episodic nature of 2040, and the complexity of each topic – all of which could easily form entire documentaries themselves – it is clear that a feature-length film isn’t the ideal format. A television series, with an episode per subject, would make an obviously more accommodating format. Although, given how well That Sugar Film went down, it is hardly a surprise that the producers decided to try and replicate its success. A series would have given Gameau room to expand areas that are largely absent from his remit, such as the hurdles of revolutionising power grids, or replacing all cars with self-driving group rideshare vehicles. Or even, in a perhaps unfathomably optimistic thought, the end of billboard advertising. It’s understandable why the film-maker didn’t want to get bogged down in tackling those awfully adult, awfully sobering ideas of vested interests, which in a nutshell explain many of the aforementioned hurdles. In 2040, Gameau defaults to the position of inspiring people rather than alarming or overwhelming them. You leave the film wanting more, not less, of these sorts of productions."
"The people finally got to have their say on the government’s Brexit deal. In parliament, no less. And what they had to say was that they wanted to take almost all their kit off and protest against climate change instead. Time management. They probably reckoned there was more chance of the world’s politicians agreeing on plans to save the planet than anyone coming up with a Brexit solution that the government was prepared to implement. The protest began three-quarters of an hour into the latest iteration of the indicative vote process, aka IV2, with 12 men and women in the public gallery stripping down to their pants to reveal climate change slogans on bodies that were far from beach-ready. Well, almost all of them. One bloke either lost his bottle or suddenly realised he had come out dressed commando and chose to keep his trousers on. Spoilsport. Most rushed to the front and glued their hands to the glass barrier, while a woman, daubed in grey body paint and wearing a pair of elephant ears and trunk, indulged in some unusual interpretive dance. The police were called but didn’t seem entirely sure where to look. Or touch. So what followed was a very awkward, very British standoff. In its way, the perfect Brexit statement. The dirty dozen would occasionally self-consciously wiggle their bums and then stop, as if waiting for something to happen. Knowing how to end a protest is always much harder than starting one. The police initially appeared to just hope the men and women would get bored and wander off, but once they realised they were going to have to get hands-on, a few officers reluctantly rolled up their sleeves. First to be removed from the gallery was the elephant woman who got carried out horizontally while waving goodbye with her trunk. Eventually, just a man and a woman were left and officials were sent off to find some substance to remove the glue from their hands. That seemed to do the trick and, half an hour after it had begun, the protest was over. All that remained were a few stains on the glass. Twelve semi-naked men and women in their pants was rather more entertaining and no weirder than anything else that happens in parliament these days and a few MPs greeted the disturbance as a welcome distraction. Peter Kyle snarfed about a cheeky intervention, Justine Greening asked him to flesh things out while Nick Boles wondered if Bernard Jenkin was among the protesters. Bernie’s naturism – he’s a legend in his own lunchbox – is by far his cleanest and most endearing pastime. Anything to relieve the tedium. But mostly everyone in the chamber chose to keep their heads down and plod on. IV2 more closely resembled an IV drip of liquid valium with MPs mindlessly repeating what they had said in the first round of debates the previous Wednesday. There was little else they could do. Everything that could possibly be said about Brexit has long since been said. Again and again. The sense of Brexit being an endless loop in space-time is now inescapable. After insisting the prime minister was keen to work constructively with parliament, Andrea Leadsom went out of her to do precisely the opposite by saying that the government would be whipping against the business motion to allow further indicative votes. Time was now of the essence and it was up to the government to run down the clock by failing to get its own deal passed and not up to MPs to try to find some kind of consensus. Thereafter we just got stuck in an existential hell with MPs reduced to playing caricature versions of themselves. Edward Leigh merely suggested that now was not the time for the country to have a general election because the Conservatives would lose, while the Grand Wizard of Mogg himself chose to lecture the house on the meaning of shame.  Having traded his principles for the party line and refused to take responsibility for retweeting far-right politicians, Jacob Rees-Mogg increasingly resembles the badly behaved prep school boy who has been found out by his peers and sent to the naughty step. Edward Leigh was Edward Leigh. That bad. Things did improve when the debate proper began. But only marginally. Most MPs are sick and tired of being sick and tired. No one said anything unexpected or did much to suggest they had changed their minds. No one wanted to be the person who blinked first. Everyone was now waiting on a miracle. That never came. The opposition benches were full at 10pm for the results of the indicative votes. The government benches were barely half-full. It was only Brexit, after all. Yet again parliament was unable to find anything which for which it was in favour. Seemingly natural allies proved to be deadly enemies, as the remainer purists outdid one another to shoot down the possibility of a soft Brexit. The Life of Brian’s Time’s Arrow once again. The People’s Front of Judea versus the Judean People’s Front. First as farce, then as tragedy. Theresa May seemed amazed. Her deal had the flicker of a pulse. Never let the perfect be the enemy of the wee bit shit. For Nick Boles, enough was enough. Having received almost no support from his own party for his common market 2.0 option, he made an emotional speech in which he resigned the Conservative whip. It was the most effective protest of the day."
"Donald Trump’s indifference, punctuated by bursts of mocking disdain, towards climate change has been indulged and even cheered by his supporters. The president has called climate science “bullshit”, donned a coalminer’s helmet at rallies and defenestrated federal rules designed to cut planet-warming emissions. It is becoming harder, however, for Trump to swat away the unfolding crises caused by global warming. American lives are increasingly ravaged by flooding and wildfires and Democrats have seized the initiative with the Green New Deal resolution, which proposes full-scale societal and economic change to eliminate carbon emissions while investing in education, health, transport and a federal jobs guarantee.  Now, younger Republicans are breaking with Trump in an attempt to haul their party towards scientific reality. “There’s disagreement there with Donald Trump,” said Tex Fischer, a 22-year-old conservative Ohioan with a head of unruly hair. “I don’t personally know anyone involved in young, right-of-center politics that doesn’t believe climate change is an issue. “I think conservatives for a long time have been too willing to just let this be a leftwing issue. We can talk about this. Conservatives that care about the environment do exist.” Fischer heads campus operations for the American Conservation Coalition (ACC), a Republican youth group founded 18 months ago but already with a presence in 125 colleges across the US, holding events and organizing campaigns. In January, 41 state college Republican chairs signed an ACC letter to GOP leaders urging “action on clean energy and environmental issues” to ensure “conservative values are not lost on the next generation”. On a recent Monday night, the ACC held a campus event at Temple University to extol the virtues of renewable energy. Temple is a predominantly liberal institution based in a city – Philadelphia – that’s of a similar mien. The panel discussion mustered around a dozen attendees, with one wearing a red “Keep America Great” hat. Young Temple conservatives are “subject to severe ridicule and a lot of vitriol from their peers”, said Christopher Smith, president of Temple’s student Republican group. Smith, who is 20, comes from Allentown, Pennsylvania, and sports a sober combination of navy suit, combed hair and sensible spectacles. “People call you white supremacists, Nazis. We’ve all been called that at some point. It’s not nice.” Very few of these taunts are based upon the sharp differences between senior Democrats and Republicans over climate change, however, pointing to a divide that is partially generational. “Trump’s views are definitely more typical of older Republicans than us,” Smith conceded. Almost 60% of millennial Republicans, a cohort that has never experienced a reality other than of record hot years and collapsing glaciers, agree that climate change is already having some effect on the US, according to Pew Research Center polling. Nearly half believe the government isn’t doing enough to ameliorate the damage. Older Republicans, the core of Trump’s support, are substantially less likely to back these stances and are much more enthusiastic about coalmining and offshore oil and gas drilling, with the latter proposition supported by 75% of boomer GOP voters compared with 44% of millennial Republicans. There is no guarantee, of course, that these positions will remain steadfast rather than shift rightward as the newest generation of GOP voters age. With record numbers of Americans expressing alarm over global warming, however, it may be that flat denial of climate science is becoming unmoored from political expediency. The major divisions occur, crucially, when it comes to how to respond to climate change. While the Green New Deal, spearheaded by the charismatic Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, calls for a “10-year national mobilization” on a scale not seen since the second world war to decarbonize the economy, the college Republicans are far more reticent. ACC literature at Temple University calls for a “broad range of limited government and market-based policies”. A booklet called How to Be a Conservative Environmentalist promotes cutting regulations, as well as subsidies, for solar and wind power and allowing the market to continue to grow the clean energy sector. “With Ocasio-Cortez there is this sort of alarmism, like ‘We’re all gonna die in 12 years,’” said Fischer. “We have a more methodical, slower approach … The conversation has been so politicized and so leftwing-dominated that it has put people off. That gives us an opportunity to offer a sensible alternative.” Much like superstitious actors talking backstage at a production of Macbeth, the protagonists in the Temple climate change event dare not mention the subject of their gathering. “Climate change” is not uttered in an hour of discussion, rejected in favour of uncontroversial bromides such as job-creating “energy diversification”, the conservation accomplishments of Teddy Roosevelt and the national security benefits of American-sourced energy. “We love it when market forces produce a better product, right?” said Chad Forcey, head of a conservative clean energy organization, to vigorous nods as he flicked through slides showing the plummeting cost of solar energy. The Green New Deal, Forcey said, is “ridiculous. They’ve blended it with socialism and identity politics. What we’re trying to do is something a lot more practical.” Trump has naturally gone further, falsely claiming the Green New Deal would mean “no more airplanes, no more cows, one car per family”. Republican alternative plans have sprouted from Senator Mike Lee, who suggested having larger families will somehow solve climate change, and his House colleague Matt Gaetz, whose “Green Real Deal” would slash regulations and set no emissions targets. Ocasio-Cortez dismissed Gaetz’s plan as “just so weak” and “so lame”. A major UN report last year found the world must cut greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030 to avoid calamitous warming, a task that will require an enormous upheaval in the way societies create energy, raise food and transport people. The US has been rattled by record hurricanes and wildfires in the past two years, with government scientists predicting increasingly punishing storms, crop failures and coastal inundation. Thousands of people are set to perish in heatwaves. The US Government Accountability Office calculates climate impacts cost the federal government $350bn in the past decade, with economic losses on course to hit $500bn every year by the close of the century. A modest tax on carbon emissions, backed by some conservatives, is unlikely to be enough to dodge this future. “If there was a free market solution to the climate crisis we would’ve seen it in the last 40 years,” said Varshini Prakash, the 25-year-old founder of Sunrise Movement, the youth-led group allied to Ocasio-Cortez that helped spawn the Green New Deal. “We don’t have decades to wait, we need to do it in the next decade. “People are dying from the climate crisis right now. The truly irrational thing to do would be continue on the current trajectory and allow 150 million climate refugees and the complete obliteration of coral reefs.” Prakash was a campus climate activist herself while at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. “There wasn’t really a robust conversation” with college Republicans on the issue, she recalls. There’s a realization on both sides, however, that the Green New Deal and growing public concern has cracked open the debate, to the odd degree that Trump reportedly will attempt to campaign on climate change in the 2020 presidential election. “Young people see the denialism and corruption of Republicans and the insufficiency of action by Democrats. They are fed up with it and want to call it out,” Prakash said. “This is a generational thing. People saying ‘wait your turn, we’ve got this’ frankly don’t see the urgency because they won’t be around for it. It’s quite obvious that they haven’t got it.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe belief that humans are destroying the climate and that we can prevent “the catastrophe” simply by committing green acts is alive and well – especially in Hamburg, Germany. With a little brainwashing quality education, everything is possible. (Hat-tip Bernd Felsche).

The European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) here tells us how the German city of Hamburg has instituted a climate-education program dubbed: Climate Protection At Schools with the slogan: “Climate – we’re acting!“.
In Hamburg schools of every level are encouraged (er, pressured) to implement their own “climate protection plan”. And by doing so, they can get the official “climate school seal of approval”. For example, here you’ll find the list of schools that have officially become “Climate Schools” for 2012/13.
Criteria for getting the climate school seal of approval include: “drawing up a climate protection plan” along with “deciding on concrete pedagogical targets and CO2 saving goals” and these “targets must be short, mid and long term” and they have to “be backed up by measures, deadlines and responsibilities“, to name a few.
And schools can get the full support from city “advisers” for an entire range of climate protection aspects such as “energy saving, project and team assistance, seminars on climate protection and energy, or curriculum design for elementary schools“.
Sadly, as one plainly sees, climate in Germany is hardly a science, but an increasingly fanatic religion where everyone believes they have a solemn duty to rescue the climate. The masses, which now include very young children, are coerced by a powerful forces that use subtle but effective tactics: play along, or you’ll be marginalized, or worse.

In general children are taught that “being green” is being superior, and thus allows you to lecture the rest of the world. Green supremacy.
In fact, comparing a true climate protection believer to a skeptic in Germany is like comparing a saint to a miscreant. That’s what the green movement is aiming at.
Is it any wonder we recently saw a professor at the University of Graz calling for climate skeptics to be executed?
My, what a tolerant, enlightened and open-minded movement climate change has become. And what a wonderful education for our children.
Now for you children in Hamburg, Germany, be sure to do something for the climate today…just like they do in Britain…no pressure, really:

For first-time viewers of that sick little clip above, please be aware that it was produced by green activists 2 years ago, with the full enthusiasm of green groups all in an effort to coerce people to be green and to prevent the end of the world, as predicted by the PIK Mayan calendar.

Back when I was a boy in the 1960s and 70s, northern New England was as conservative as could be. My home state of Vermont (which is French for “green mountain”) was George Aiken and Winston Prouty country. Back then the revolutionary Yankee-spirit of Ethan Allen, fighter for freedom, was alive – but rapidly dying.
Vermont has long since been overrun by the politically-correct from New York, Massachussetts, New Jersey and other deep blue areas, and has been turned into a socialist cesspool with one of the highest property tax rates in the country and socialist Senator Bernie Sanders.

This all makes the latest news from sister state New Hampshire (home of the White Mountains) all the more encouraging. New Hampshire was also once very conservative – so much so that it’s official motto is still “Live free or die“. Its governor from 1973 to 1979 was Republican “Ax-the-Tax” Medrim Thomson. But New Hampshire too succumbed the same political fate as Vermont, turning deep blue.
But who knows! Maybe the “live free or die” spirit is making a comeback. Let’s hope so. The latest news seem to indicate so. Fox News writes in a piece called:
One Giant Leap Forward -New Hampshire has smacked down Cap & Trade”
The New Hampshire House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly — 246 to 104 – to become the first state to move to repeal an already up-and-running global warming cap-and-trade energy tax scheme.
The Granite State’s repeal appears headed for a similarly veto-proof repeal in the State Senate that will make Governor John Lynch powerless to stop it.”
Emphasis added. Big things often start in New Hampshire – especially presidential things. Let’s hope the Senate makes it something big there, too. New Hampshire’s cap & trade scam is known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), which originated in New Jersey. Its stunning defeat in New Hampshire was led by conservative House Speaker William O’Brien, who, according to Fox News, said (emphasis added):
The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative has always been a backdoor tax increase on the citizens of New Hampshire. RGGI is a perfect example of the cost of regulation to the public. Rarely has a program been as transparent in its attempts at income redistribution.”
The big beneficiaries of RGGI are politically correct corporations and special interest groups. The big losers are consumers. The rejection of cap & trade in New Hampshire sends a strong signal nationally. Fox News writes:

At the national level, it cements the extremely strong opposition to cap-and-trade in New Hampshire and therefore colors how the issue will play in the Republican presidential primaries. In 2008, both parties nominated pro-cap-and-trade candidates for president, and again this year there are a number of pro-cap-and-trade Republicans vying for the nomination. They will have a difficult time explaining to voters why a program that has failed and been overwhelmingly rejected at the state level should be taken national.”
Don’t you love the smell of climate-napalm? Cap & trade gets crushed.
This should lead us to recall how Newt Gingrich cozied up on a couch with Nancy Pelosi in support of regulating carbon. There have been reports about naughty Newt launching a presidential campaign for 2012. Sorry Newt, but you belong on the scrap heap along with Pelosi. You’re not getting my vote.
New Hampshire is a lovely state, especially the northern part with its Presidential Range, which includes Mt. Washington – where the world’s highest ever wind velocity on the planet, 231 miles per hour, was recorded – a climate extreme back in the 1930s when CO2 was only about 320 ppm. New Hampshire is really worth a visit. Vermont is also a beautiful state, but visiting there means you’ll be leaving your money into the wasteful hands of greenie-socialists. Go to New Hampshire instead.

"Every April, rocket-shaped, yellow, nine-inch reproductive shoots of field horsetail (Equisetum arvense), tipped with small cones, erupt through this patch of waste ground beside Mill Road car park on the bank of the river Tyne. They’ll soon wither, after they’ve released their payload of spores. Then forests of green, corrugated stems and whorls of thread-like leaves, shaped like miniature Christmas trees, will rise from their creeping underground stems.  It’s a prehistoric scene that could have been repeated annually since the Carboniferous period, a living reminder of geological events that produced coal, once the mainstay of the local economy. Equisetum is considered to be the most durable plant genus, a survivor of extreme climatic events with an evolutionary history stretching back 300m years, to tropical swamps where its ancestors reached tree-like proportions. Its stems accumulate silica and decay slowly, leaving exquisite fossils. Coal trimmers who, until 50 years ago, loaded holds of colliers a mile upriver from here at Dunston Staiths, shipping 140,000 tonnes of coal each week in the early 20th century, would have had no trouble in matching fossil imprints in their cargo with today’s plants on the quayside. The plant’s tenacious underground stems, almost impossible to eradicate and so infuriating to gardeners, must be one reason why horsetails have survived so long. But when I took a fertile shoot home to examine under a microscope, another became obvious. Overnight, the cone released thousands of spores, each about a 20th of a millimetre in diameter. I scraped some on to a microscope slide and, magnified 400 times, could see that each had four arms wrapped around it. These slender structures, freed at last from confinement and experiencing dry air for the first time, uncoiled into long threads, appropriately called elaters, providing aerial buoyancy to carry their spore away on a gust of wind. The genus Equisetum has already weathered three great mass extinctions that wiped out vast swathes of life on Earth; now, burning coal from those Carboniferous swamps has contributed to climate change and it may be on the threshold of another. But it’s well prepared, with tough subterranean stems and billions of airborne spores that will surely always find safe landfall somewhere."

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s the statement issued by the New York Times itself:
The Times is discontinuing the Green blog, which was created to track environmental and energy news and to foster lively discussion of developments in both areas. This change will allow us to direct production resources to other online projects.”
Why do we suppose this is? Didn’t this part of the Times bring yet more respect and credibility to one of America’s most renown dailies – especially now that”we are all facing a planetary crisis“?
Perhaps a recent Twitter post by NYT environment reporter Andrew Revkin can answer that question. It appears the green pages of the Gray Lady were turning out to be more of an embarrassment than anything. As is the case with any operation that gets shut down, it is because either there’s no longer a demand for it, or other sources are simply doing a much better job delivering.
Recently Andrew Revkin, for example, implied that recent volcano activity was probably the explanation for the stop in global warming over the past years. There’s got to be some explanation. After all, we all know it just can’t be the sun. Here’s what Revkin tweeted:

You can link to the study’s abstract here. Every time they pull the aerosol joker. But even Gavin Schmidt was not impressed by Revkin’s adventurism. Here’s what Schmidt tweeted back:

Yes, indeed it was probably a good time to end the Green blog show, and to “direct production resources to other online projects“.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe situation for German global warming activists is getting ever more hopeless by the hour. Are we witnesing the death of one of the greatest hoaxes of all time? Now that large, major media outlets are putting the CO2 scam under the spotlight, and revealing the CO2 lies, sales of Prof. Dr. Fritz Vahrenholt and Dr. Sebastian Lüning’s skeptic book are skyrocketing.
Number 12 on the overall Amazon.de bestseller list - and still rising.
The new book has skyrocketed up to No. 12 on the overall Amazon.de bestseller list. This really increases the chances that a publisher for an English version book will soon be found.
The warmists can say all they want – once undecided readers read just a quarter of the book, they will already be convinced that there indeed will not be any climate catastrophe. All the facts and data are there – presented so that laypersons can understand it. Global warming in Germany will soon be kaput!

Share this...FacebookTwitterHow about just appeasing the gods with human sacrifices? That could work too.I just heard an interview on German NDR Info public radio with Mojib Latif, of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology. Of course he was brought on to say that the “monster” Yasi “killer” cyclone hitting Australia and the “mega-blizzard” pounding the US and Canada are due to global warming.
The adjectives I use here are what the media today are using. Normally I just let this rubbish go, but he made a couple of points I feel are worth discussing and are indicative of the sad state to which the climate science field has devolved today.
The radio moderator asked him what’s behind these weather extremes? To me, Latif’s answer makes no sense. Maybe much of the audience is not familiar ENSO’s and so maybe that’s why Latif and the media keep getting away with it every time. His answer in a nutshell:
The mega storms can be traced back to the current La Nina, which is a cold surface temperature phenomena in the equatorial Pacific region. But behind that, is global warming.
That’s what he claimed. The weather extremes are caused by cool Pacific waters, which are consistent with global warming. He also reiterated the theory that global warming leads to more extreme storms, even though there is no data to support this. Call it the missing storms. They’re somewhere, and that they can’t be found is a travesty.
Actually, those who are not ignorant in the field know that the opposite is occuring – there are fewer storms today. What’s drastically higher is the media strom hype.
Accumulated Cyclone Energy is near a 30-year low. Where are the missing storms?
The second point I found amazing is Latif’s recommendation when asked if adaptation to climate change would work as a way to cope with extreme weather events. I haven’t yet found an audio link to the radio interview, so I’ll provide what he said in a nutshell:
Adaptation in the end will not work. It will be necessary for man to limit the earth’s temperature rise.”
And how does man regulate Mother Nature? By reducing CO2 emissions of course. That’s the rain dance that will appease the weather gods and make the big storms go away.
Hard to believe this guy is a scientist.

Share this...FacebookTwitterItaly is about to join the growing list of European countries cutting back subsidies to solar and wind energy, so reports the online Berlin TAZ.
A complete stop to solar energy and deep cuts in wind energy: Italy’s government passed a decree that could spell an abrupt end in the recently started renewable energy boom.”
This comes at the heels of a number of countries cutting back on solar subsidies throughout Europe – mainly due to their high costs to consumers and technical problems integrating these sources into the existing infrastructure.
Economics Minister Paolo Romani says that Italian citizens have had to pay 6 billion euros in subsidies so far. The solar subsidies were originally planned for the period from 2011 to 2013, but now will remain in effect only for systems installed before June 1, 2011. The law also stops solar plants with a capacity of over 1 MW from being built in the open countryside due to “landscape protection issues”.
Other countries like Spain have also implemented similar stops to the overly expensive renewable energy sources.
Italian subsidies had guaranteed operators of small-scale systems €0.47/kwh and large scale systems €0.34 /kwh for feeding the energy into the grid. Italy will also reduce subsidies paid to wind power. The leftist TAZ writes:
Here subsidies will be cut by 22%, and done so retroactively and thus apply to systems that are also in operation. This would deal a fatal blow. When the government redefines the subsidy rates whenever and however it feels, it makes reliable investment plans impossible.”
Good riddance to the eyesores that have only drained the pockets of consumers. More reading:

"Donald Trump’s choice to run the World Bank has moved swiftly to allay fears that his appointment will lead to a softening of the organisation’s approach to climate change. In his first day at the helm of the Washington-based institution, David Malpass said helping developing countries cope with global warming would remain central to the bank’s mission.  Malpass also said there would be no change in the bank’s refusal to lend for new coal-fired power plants, despite Trump’s strong support for US coal producers. “Climate change is a key problem facing people,” Malpass said. “It presents specific problems and we are addressing them through adaptation and through meeting our climate change action plan. My expectation is that the bank continues the direction it has been pursuing in terms of those goals.” Malpass was appointed unopposed last week, continuing a tradition that the US gets to choose the president of the World Bank while the Europeans appoint the managing director of the International Monetary Fund. But there were concerns, both among the bank’s staff and campaign groups, that the former US Treasury official would adopt a growth-at-any-cost approach that would downplay the organisation’s recent environmental focus. Bank sources said there was relief when, in an address to staff, Malpass mentioned climate change twice and called the challenge “immense”. The World Bank’s climate change action plan has pledged to increase lending in poor countries vulnerable to global warming, warning that failure to act risks pushing an additional 100 million people into poverty by 2030. Asked at a press briefing about his views on the bank’s anti-coal policy, Malpass said: “The World Bank board and the governors have established a policy on that. I don’t expect a change in that policy.” He added: “The mission of the bank is urgent. There are 700 million people living in extreme poverty and that’s 700 million too many. I want to continue with the mission to alleviate and eliminate extreme poverty and the mission of shared prosperity.” Malpass said his first visit as bank president would be to sub-Saharan Africa later this month and it was worrying that the world’s poorest countries were being affected by the slowdown in the global economy seen since the middle of 2018. “It’s very important that global growth be faster. It is a key part of meeting the challenge on poverty and shared prosperity.” In addition to tackling the problems of climate change, Malpass said it was important that developing countries had robust private sectors and encouraged women to take a full role in the economy. The new World Bank president said there would be an evolution in its relationship with China but no dramatic change. As it grew richer, China would borrow less from the bank and contribute more capital. There had been a shift in the bank’s lending towards lower-income countries with greater needs and away from middle-income countries, Malpass said. “China has not been singled out but the expectation is that countries that have done better will be reducing their lending from the bank.”"
"Media outlets and politicians routinely refer to the “flood” of Central American migrants, the “wave” of asylum seekers, the “deluge” of children, despite the fact that unauthorized migration across the US borders is at record lows in recent years. Comparing human beings to natural disasters is both lazy and dehumanizing, but perhaps this tendency to lean on environmental language when describing migration is an unconscious acknowledgement of a deeper truth: much migration from Central America and, for that matter, around the world, is fueled by climate change.  Yes, today’s Central American migrants – most of them asylum seekers fearing for their lives – are fleeing gangs, deep economic instability (if not abject poverty), and either neglect or outright persecution at the hands of their government. But these things are all complicated and further compounded by the fact that the northern triangle of Central America – a region comprising Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, and the largest sources of asylum seekers crossing our border in recent years – is deeply affected by environmental degradation and the impacts of a changing global climate. The average temperature in Central America has increased by 0.5C since 1950; it is projected to rise another 1-2 degrees before 2050. This has a dramatic impact on weather patterns, on rainfall, on soil quality, on crops’ susceptibility to disease, and thus on farmers and local economies. Meanwhile, incidences of storms, floods and droughts on are the rise in the region. In coming years, according to the US Agency for International Development, countries in the northern triangle will see decreased rainfall and prolonged drought, writ large. In Honduras, rainfall will be sparse in areas where it is needed, yet in other areas, floods will increase by 60%. In Guatemala, the arid regions will creep further and further into current agricultural areas, leaving farmers out to dry. And El Salvador is projected to lose 10-28% of its coastline before the end of the century. How will all those people survive, and where will they go? This September, I travelled to El Salvador to report on the impacts of the US government’s family separation policy. I’d been to El Salvador many times before, but never to the Jiquilisco Bay, a stunning, shimmering and once abundant peninsula populated by mangroves and fishing communities and uncountable species of marine life. It is also one that, like many places in El Salvador, and like many places in the world, is also imperiled by climate change. Rising sea levels are destroying the mangrove forests, the marine life that relies on them, and thus the fishermen who rely on that marine life to feed themselves and eke out a meager economy. I met a man there named Arnovis Guidos Portillo, a 26-year-old single dad. Many people in his family were fishermen, but they were able to catch fewer and fewer fish. The country’s drought and devastating rainfall meant that the area’s farming economy, too, was suffering. The land was stressed, the ocean was stressed, and so were the people. Arnovis got into a scuffle one day at a soccer game, which placed him on a hitlist with a local gang. He had been working as a day laborer here and there, but the drought meant there was less work, and it was hard to find work that didn’t require crossing into rival gang territory. If he did, he would be killed. So he took his daughter north to the United States, where border patrol agents separated them for two months, locking them up in different states and with zero contact. Violence and environmental degradation are inextricably linked, and both lead to mass migration. An unstable planet and ecosystem lends itself to an unstable society, to divisions, to economic insecurity, to human brutality. When someone’s home becomes less and less livable, they move elsewhere. Wouldn’t each and every one of us do the same? This week, the New Yorker’s Jonathan Blitzer published a series of pieces about the impacts of climate change in the Guatemalan highlands, where farmers are struggling to grow crops that they have been farming there for centuries. “In most of the western highlands,” Blitzer wrote, “the question is no longer whether someone will emigrate but when.” A few years ago, I reported from Guatemala’s dry corridor, several hours away from where Blitzer was reporting, where persistent drought had decimated the region’s agriculture, and particularly the coffee crop, on which roughly 90% of local farmers relied. It was a wildly different landscape from the one Blitzer described, but it faced the same problem: if you live in an agricultural zone, come from a long line of farmers and can’t reliably harvest your crops any more, what else is there to do but leave? It’s abundantly clear that climate change is a driver of migration to the US – we have the data, we have the facts, we have the human stories. Still, the Trump administration has done nothing to intervene in this root cause. In fact, the US government has systematically denied the existence of climate change, rolled back domestic regulations that would mitigate US carbon emissions and thumbed its nose at international attempts – such as the Paris accords – to curb global warming. Now, in his latest futile, small-minded and cruel attempt to cut migration off at the neck (something we know is not possible – an unhealthy societal dynamic must be addressed at the root, just like with a struggling tree or crop), Donald Trump announced last week that he would cut all foreign aid to the northern triangle. It’s a punitive move, and one that – just like building a wall, separating families, locking people up indefinitely, and refusing asylum seekers entry across the border – is a petty intimidation tactic that will do nothing to actually curb forced migration. In fact, cutting aid to Central America will do quite the opposite, for as much waste and imperfections as there are in international aid, aid in Central America has been vital for creating community safety programs, job skills development and government accountability standards. It has also helped with drought mitigation and supporting climate-resilient agricultural practices. In other words, foreign aid to Central America – a place unduly hit by climate change – is supporting the kind of climate change resiliency that will keep people from having to leave in the first place. Because people really don’t want to leave their homes for the vast uncertainty of another land, particularly when that land proves itself again and again to be hostile to migrants’ very existence. People don’t want to be raped along the route north, or die in the desert, or have their child ripped away from them by the border patrol, or be locked up indefinitely without legal counsel, without adequate medical care, with no idea what will happen to them and when. Who would risk this if things were OK back home? People like Arnovis leave because they feel like they have to. Eventually Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officials convinced Arnovis to sign deportation papers with the promise that, if he did, he would be reunited with his daughter and returned to El Salvador. But he was shooed on to a plane back home without her. It took a tremendous amount of advocacy, but, after months locked up in the US, she, too was returned home. They are now back together, which is a good thing, but the fundamental problem hasn’t changed: he can’t find work. His society is ill. So is the planet, and the land and sea all around him. Today, there are 64 million forced migrants around the world, more than ever before. They are fleeing war, persecution, disaster and, yes, climate change. The UN estimates that by 2050, there will be 200 million people forcibly displaced from their homes due to climate change alone. Migration is a natural human phenomenon and, many argue, should be a fundamental right, but forced migration – being run out of home against one’s will and with threat to one’s life – is not natural at all. Today, whether we choose to see it or not, climate change is one of the largest drivers of migration, and will continue to be for years to come – unless we do something about it. If we want people to be able to stay in their homes, we have to tackle the issue of our changing global climate, and we have to do it fast."
