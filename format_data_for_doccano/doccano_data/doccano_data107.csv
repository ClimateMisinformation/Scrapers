"The National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s mission to land on an asteroid and its Earth science division both drew angry criticism from lawmakers on Thursday, as administrator Charles Bolden defended the agency on Capitol Hill. At a House hearing on Nasa’s 2016 budget, space subcommittee chairman Lamar Smith criticized what he called “the disproportionate increase” in funding for Earth science research, saying that over eight years almost $2bn had been added to its budget. Smith and other Republicans argued that Nasa should not devote so many resources to studying the climate when it could work on space.  “There are 13 other agencies involved in climate-change research, but only one that is responsible for space exploration,” Smith said. “The administration continues to starve Nasa’s exploration programs to fund a partisan environmental agenda. Nasa simply deserves better.” Bolden, a retired marine corps general and former astronaut, defended the division, saying: “Nasa since its inception has responsibility for exploring the universe and also taking care of Earth, my favorite planet.”  When representative Mo Brooks asked whether Bolden would support moving Earth science research under the purview of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), saying “Nasa is ‘aeronautics and space’, not ‘Earth science’,” Bolden balked.  “There’s no ‘s’ in Nasa for ‘science’ and some think we shouldn’t do science, but that’s absurd,” Bolden said. The administrator bluntly denied that increased funding for Earth sciences came at the expense of other divisions. “We do not divert money from human exploration and science,” he said. Republicans have made a concerted effort to drain funding from government research into climate change, directing most of their wrath toward the EPA, which they argue handcuffs business. While most Republicans support Nasa generally, they have recently taken aim at its Earth science program, which studies rising ocean temperatures, pollution and levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, among other areas. In March, Ted Cruz, chair of the Senate committee that oversees Nasa, sparred with Bolden over the program, saying: “I am concerned that Nasa in the current environment has lost its full focus on that core mission.” Bolden replied: “It is absolutely critical that we understand Earth’s environment, because this is the only place we have to live.”  Bolden also testifed to the same Senate committee on Thursday. He was grilled by senators incensed about whether bases in their states might lose funding in the coming year.  Democrat Barbara Mikulski became particularly curt, pressing Bolden to keep Goddard Space Flight Center – in her state, Maryland – in business. “Satellites are on my mind,” Mikulski said, alluding to Goddard’s satellite servicing program, “and I would like that in the budget.” Bolden caught himself in the middle of an exasperated protest.  “I was about to get cute,” he said.  “Don’t,” Mikulski shot back. Eventually, Bolden accepted the senators’ complaints. “I don’t want you to think that I’m satisfied because I’m not,” he said. The first objective of Nasa’s charter, as laid out by Congress, is “the expansion of human knowledge of the Earth and of phenomena in the atmosphere and space”. House Republicans also criticized Nasa for its “asteroid redirect mission” (ARM), which has the objective of eventually tearing a boulder off an asteroid and placing it in orbit around the moon, where it could then be studied. Smith called the mission “uninspiring”. Representative Steven Palazzo said Nasa had failed to explain a cost, timeline, plan or even justification for the mission. Bolden defended the asteroid mission by saying it was both a step on the path to Mars and an opportunity to “inform our ability to deflect asteroids”. Asked why he had ignored recommendations about the program, he said: “I believe in constancy of purpose.” He was then forced to defend Nasa’s inchoate plans for a manned mission to Mars and did not satisfy the lawmaker’s demands for a “roadmap” for that mission or ARM.  A final point of tension was US reliance on Russian space shuttles to send astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS). Brooks said that since the American shuttle program was cancelled – omitting that it was president George W Bush who scheduled its end – “the US hitches rides from Russia, we are no longer preeminent space program”. Bolden argued that so long as Congress provides funding, the missions will launch from US soil again in 2017, and Nasa will “stop writing checks to the Russian space agency”. Pressed for a backup plan should Russia stop allowing Americans to join its launches, Bolden was stymied – although he did point out that Russia does not want to bar Americans from the ISS and had shown no sign it would do so. The lawmakers however harped on a joke tweeted by the Russian deputy prime minister Dmitry Rogozin last year, about American astronauts reaching the ISS “using a trampoline”. Representative Dana Rohrabacher, who has elsewhere argued in defense of Russia, suggested the US should outsource a mission to Mars to a private contractor, like SpaceX.  Bolden countered that “no commercial company is going to independently go to Mars without support of government”, and said that relying on a private company would slow the mission."
"It’s known as “single study syndrome”. When a new scientific paper is published suggesting that the climate is relatively insensitive to the increased greenhouse effect, potentially modestly downgrading the associated climate change threats, that sort of paper will generally receive disproportionate media attention. Because of that media attention, people will tend to remember the results of that single paper, and neglect the many recent studies that have arrived at very different conclusions.  For example, there have been several recent studies finding that the global climate models that most accurately simulate observed changes in clouds and humidity over the past 10–15 years also happen to be the ones that are the most sensitive to the increased greenhouse effect. For example, a 2012 paper by Kevin Trenberth and John Fasullo concluded, These results suggest a systematic deficiency in the drying effect of either subsident circulations or spurious mixing of moister air into the region in low-sensitivity models that directly relate to their projected changes in cloud amount and albedo … the results strongly suggest that the more sensitive models perform better, and indeed the less sensitive models are not adequate in replicating vital aspects of today’s climate. A 2014 paper led by Steven Sherwood took a similar approach with similar results. The paper concluded,  The mixing inferred from observations appears to be sufficiently strong to imply a climate sensitivity of more than 3 degrees for a doubling of carbon dioxide. This is significantly higher than the currently accepted lower bound of 1.5 degrees, thereby constraining model projections towards relatively severe future warming. Another 2014 paper published by scientists from CalTech and UCLA arrived at a similar conclusion, as lead author Hui Su explains, This study used an index that represents how models capture the observed spatial structure of the Hadley Circulation and associated humidity and cloud distributions. We showed that the inter-model spread in climate sensitivity and cloud feedback is closely related to models’ Hadley Circulation change and present-day circulation strength varies systematically with models’ climate sensitivity (Figure 9). The stronger Hadley Circulation in the models, the higher climate sensitivity the models have (Figure 10). The observed circulation strength is on the high end of the modeled ones. Clouds are a key to determining the Earth’s climate sensitivity. We know that by itself, a doubling of the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will cause about 1.2°C global warming. A warmer atmosphere will hold more water vapor, and as another greenhouse gas, we know that increase in water vapor will roughly double that carbon-caused warming (a “positive feedback”). We also know of some other significant positive feedbacks, like melting ice decreasing the reflectivity of the Earth’s surface, causing it to absorb more energy from the sun. Those who argue that the Earth’s climate is relatively insensitive to the increased greenhouse effect need a big negative feedback to offset those factors we know amplify global warming. Clouds represent the only such plausible mechanism, because we don’t have a very good grasp on how different types of clouds will change in a hotter world. For example, climate scientist contrarian Richard Lindzen came up with what’s known as the “iris hypothesis” in 2001, suggesting that in a warmer world, high cirrus clouds will contract like the iris on an eye to allow more heat to escape. That hypothesis has not withstood the test of time, however, with four studies published within a year of Lindzen’s paper effectively refuting the hypothesis. One recent paper found that even if the iris effect is real, it would reduce the Earth’s climate sensitivity by no more than 20%, still well within the range of possible values outlined by the IPCC. Not only have the aforementioned studies found that changes in humidity and clouds are consistent with simulations from more sensitive climate models, but previous research led by Andrew Dessler and more recently by Kevin Trenberth and colleagues has shown that observed changes in water vapor amplifying global warming as expected, and that clouds are thus far acting to weakly amplify global warming. These observations are inconsistent with the strong cloud dampening effect contrarians need to justify arguments for low climate sensitivity. There have been a few recent studies using what’s called an “energy balance model” approach, combining simple climate models with recent observational data, concluding that climate sensitivity is on the low end of IPCC estimates. However, subsequent research has identified some potentially serious flaws in this approach. These types of studies have nevertheless been the focus of disproportionate attention. For example, in recent testimony before the US House of Representatives Committee on Science, Space and Technology, contrarian climate scientist Judith Curry said, Recent data and research supports the importance of natural climate variability and calls into question the conclusion that humans are the dominant cause of recent climate change: … Reduced estimates of the sensitivity of climate to carbon dioxide Curry referenced just one paper (using the energy balance model approach) to support that argument – the very definition of single study syndrome – plus an interpretation of a second paper whose author objected, saying,  others have used my findings to suggest that Earth’s surface temperatures are rather insensitive to the concentration of atmospheric CO2. I do not believe that my work supports these suggestions, or inferences. As fond as I am of my own ideas, one should resist concluding too much, too soon, from a single study. True skepticism requires considering all available evidence. While some studies suggest that climate sensitivity is on the low end of the estimated range, other studies suggest it’s on the high end. As Andrew Dessler told me, There certainly is some evidence that climate sensitivity may be below 2°C. But if you look at all of the evidence, it’s hard to reconcile with such a low climate sensitivity. I think our best estimate is still around 3°C for doubled CO2. Ultimately when we consider all the available scientific evidence and risk management principles, there’s no case to be made for delaying action to curb global warming. Update: yet another paper has just been published finding that the models that most accurately simulate the observed changes in the Earth’s atmosphere are the ones that are most sensitive to the increasing greenhouse effect.

"Marion Coutts, winner of the Wellcome book prize, has given her full support to the Guardian’s climate change campaign asking the Wellcome Trust health charity to sell off its large investments in fossil fuels. “I support your campaign in every way,” she told the Guardian, after Wednesday evening’s prize ceremony. “We need to think very carefully about how we live and about how we manage our resources. We are clearly not doing things very well at the moment.” More than a dozen other writers and judges honoured by the Wellcome Book prize since 2009 have also backed the campaign, including the chair of the 2014 judges, Sir Andrew Motion. “The Wellcome Trust does magnificent work in all sorts of ways, but its investment in fossil fuels contradicts many of its own policies. By divesting from fossil fuels it would show leadership in keeping with its reputation and ideals,” said Motion. The Wellcome prize, worth £30,000, is for fiction or non-fiction books with a medical or health theme and was awarded to a “delighted” Coutts for her memoir on art, work, death and language, The Iceberg. The book is “wise, moving and beautifully constructed,” said Bill Bryson, the chair of the 2015 judges. At the ceremony in London, Bryson referred to the fossil fuel divestment campaign with a joke, asking just before announcing the winner: “I know there is just one thing you want to hear from me: ‘Am I heavily invested in fossil fuels?’” A series of analyses have shown that existing fossil fuel reserves are several times greater than can be burned if the world’s governments are to fulfil their pledge to keep global warming below the danger limit of 2C. But coal, oil and gas companies continue to spend billions on finding new reserves. A fast-growing divestment movement, supported by the UN and Nobel prize winners, argues that fossil fuel investments are a threat to both the climate and health and also to investors, as action to combat climate change could render the fuel reserves worthless. In 2009, University College London and the Lancet published a report concluding that global warming is the biggest threat to global health in the 21st century. The Wellcome Trust, which considers “climate change to be one of the greatest contemporary challenges to global health”, is the world’s second largest non-governmental funder of medical research, dispensing £727m in grants in 2014. It was a co-founder of the Human Genome Project; it has funded pioneering work on cancer and malaria; and it has been at the forefront of the fight against Ebola. The Guardian campaign calls on Wellcome and the world’s biggest health charity, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, to join over 180 institutions that have already divested from fossil fuels. The Guardian Media Group announced earlier in April that it will divest its £800m fund, the largest to date to sell off all fossil fuels. A Wellcome Trust spokesperson said: “Reducing carbon emissions is of crucial importance, but there are differing views as to how this is best achieved. The network of people with whom the Wellcome Trust enjoys relationships is broad and it would be surprising if this community did not contain a diversity of opinion about fossil fuel investments. We believe engagement rather than divestment gives us the best opportunity for change.” Coutts said: “It has always been a thing that people say – ‘it is better to be inside the camp than outside it’ – but that is not necessarily effective. People can put their money into projects which reflect the current [climate] crisis: humans are eternally inventive.” In 2014, the Wellcome Trust’s £18bn endowment included over £450m invested in the fossil fuel majors Shell, BP, Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton alone."
"It is popularly viewed as one of the greatest environmental success stories of modern times. Exactly 30 years ago, UK scientists announced they had discovered a hole in the ozone layer in the atmosphere above Antarctica. The hole threatened to spread, allowing increased levels of cancer-causing radiation from the sun to reach the ground. Within a few years of the discovery it was agreed to set up the Montreal Protocol, which banned the manmade chemicals responsible for depleting ozone in the upper atmosphere.  But last week, one of the three UK scientists who discovered the hole in 1985 warned that the real lessons of the story had still not been learned. “Yes, an international treaty was established fairly quickly to deal with the ozone hole, but really the main point about its discovery was that it shows how incredibly rapidly we can produce major changes to our atmosphere and how long it takes for nature to recover from them,” said Jon Shanklin of the British Antarctic Survey. “Clearly, we still do not understand the full consequences of what we did then because we are still inflicting major changes on the atmosphere. Then it was chlorofluorocarbons; today it is greenhouse gases.” In 1985, Shanklin was working – “as a general dogsbody” as he put it at the British Antarctic Survey, along with colleagues Brian Gardiner and the late Joe Farman. At the time, there was some speculation that spray cans and supersonic jets such as Concorde might be damaging the upper atmosphere’s ozone layer that protects us from the sun’s ultra-violet radiation. Using a device developed in the 20s, the Dobson Ozone Spectrophotometer, the three analysed amounts of ozone in the atmosphere over the Antarctic. “I was the backroom boy who calibrated the Dobson and fed results from it into our very primitive computer,” said Shanklin. The results revealed major changes in ozone levels over the Antarctic at certain times of the year, but at first the team could see no pattern. “We thought it might just be random fluctuations. Then I did a really careful calibration and found a pattern: every spring a major hole appeared in the ozone layer over the Antarctic, one that was getting bigger and bigger each year. It was Joe [Farman] who worked out that the hole was being created by chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons that were reacting with the ozone.” The team published their results in Nature in May 1985 and their research was later backed by Nasa who used their satellites to confirm the ozone hole’s existence. Other researchers later confirmed that CFCs were the likely culprits and within a couple of years the Montreal agreement led to the banning of the production of CFCs, an example of exceptional international co-operation according to former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan, who has since described it “as the single most successful international agreement to date”. But it was relatively easy to find a substitute for the CFCs – then widely used for refrigeration – that were causing ozone depletion, Shanklin pointed out, and that in turn made it fairly straightforward to establish the Montreal protocol. “We forget that 25 years later there is, in strict scientific terms, no statistically significant recovery in ozone over Antarctica, although there a few signs of improvement,” said Shanklin, who is now 61. “The CFCs we put up there will take a long time to dissipate and it will probably take us well into the second half of the century before the ozone layer recovers fully.” Thus a relatively easily cured atmospheric affliction will still take decades to be corrected. By contrast, the greenhouse gases we are now putting into the atmosphere have no substitutes that have broad political acceptance at present. For good measure, we are also pumping them out on a far greater scale. “The ozone hole story tells us that it is very easy to cause major changes to the atmosphere – it only took about 10 years to develop – but it is very difficult to restore equilibrium,” said Shanklin. “Unfortunately, we don’t seem to have learned that lesson. We are burying our heads in the sand about the changes we’re bringing about. On the other hand, carbon emissions are now on the political agenda, so there is some hope.”"
"The Abbott government approached the University of Western Australia to establish a policy centre headed by Danish climate contrarian Bjørn Lomborg, a spokesman for the university has said, contradicting claims by the federal education minister, Christopher Pyne. A spokesman for UWA told Guardian Australia that the government suggested the Australian Consensus Centre in the second half of last year.  “I can confirm that the university was approached by the federal government,” he said.  That contradicts an earlier claim made by a spokesman for Pyne, who said last week that the proposal for an Australian Consensus Centre was put forward by the “university and Dr Lomborg’s organisation”. The genesis of the centre is not the only area of disagreement between Pyne’s office and the university. A spokesman for Pyne told Guardian Australia on Friday that the $4m funding the federal government would provide was “around a third of the total cost” of running the centre, and that the university would also provide support.  But in a statement posted on its website on Monday, UWA said it would only be providing in-kind support and that financial support would be drawn from corporate sponsors, which the centre would seek to attract, and government grants. “UWA is not providing cash support for the ACC (Australian Consensus Centre) or its projects,” the statement said. “The ACC will always operate within its means and will only undertake additional work beyond the Australia Consensus program funded by the Australian government if external funding is forthcoming.” UWA said the funding target, including its in-kind support, was $13m. If it receives additional funding, the centre will “undertake a broader program of activities” to be determined by its financial partners and approved by the board. The centre is modelled on Lomborg’s Copenhagen Consensus Centre, which was defunded by the Danish government in 2012 and is now based in the US and reliant on private funding. Lomborg, who accepts that climate change is manmade but is famous for saying the challenge it poses has been overstated, told the Freakonomics podcast last year that the centre’s position on climate change was one of the reasons it lost its funding, and it was looking for a “long-term solution”. “One of the things that the Danish government did not like was that we said, ‘Yes, global warming is real, it is a challenge, but the typical way that we solve it turns out to be a pretty poor investment of resources,’” he said. “When there was a change of governments here, we went from a centre-right to a centre-left government, they actually cut off our funding.” UWA’s description of the centre does not specifically mention climate change. It says the centre will apply “an economic lens to proposals to achieve good for Australia, the region and the world, prioritising those initiatives which produce the most social value per dollar spent”. Students at UWA have called on the vice-chancellor not to accept federal government funding for the centre, saying it is “politically motivated.”  Fairfax Media reports that UWA’s academics are also “disgruntled” at the decision to fund the centre amid other cuts, and says leaked talking points circulated to academics by the university’s administrative wing state that the university didn’t plan to spend any money on the centre. The Australian Consensus Centre was announced just a few weeks after UWA confirmed it had defunded its award-winning centre for water research, claiming it was “unsustainable”. The West Australian reports that the centre’s founder, Prof Jörg Imberger, had been stood down pending a misconduct investigation since November and was told this month that he had been demoted."

"As the general election edges closer, it is becoming increasingly rare to hear our politicians agree on any topic, as parties set out distinct offers to voters. So it was welcome that in a joint statement David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg pledged to work towards agreeing a new international deal on climate change; to agree UK carbon budgets in accordance with the Climate Change Act; and to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy and end the use of “unabated coal” in power generation. For me, in my role leading the Church of England on environmental affairs, it was a moment that promoted renewed hope in our joint quest to tackle the environmental challenges facing us, which are the greatest moral challenge of our time. Probably the most profound of these is climate change. It presses hard on all of us, but particularly threatens the world’s poorest and most vulnerable people, as in Vanuatu. We have a duty to help safeguard those least able to protect themselves from the impacts of a changing climate. Tackling climate change is something that needs specific policies. The latest climate science highlights the imperative for the world to move away from the burning of fossil fuels; specifically, 80% of the world’s coal must stay in the ground in order to give a good chance of keeping the global temperature rise under the danger level of 2C. This may not sound like much. But small changes in average temperature can have huge consequences in certain regions. Consider that the global temperature difference between our modern climate and the end of the last ice age is only about 4C-5C, and that the world may well experience warming of similar scale by the end of this century without urgent action to tackle climate change, and both the scale and rationale of the challenge become clearer. In addressing this challenge, developed nations have a moral duty to lead. Britain used to be a major coal-producing nation, and the coal we mined – and the industrial revolution to which it gave birth – has raised living standards in many parts of the world. But climate change now threatens to lower living standards and life expectancy in the poorest parts of the world, where pollution from coal burning is causing premature deaths and illness. This moral duty over climate change is highlighted in the regular round of UN talks. We should not forget that the world’s richest countries have repeatedly affirmed their duty to lead efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions. However, they have not always lived up to their promises – making this one of the biggest bones of contention in the annual UN climate negotiations on which we depend for a global solution to this global problem. Recognising the implications of this, at the Church of England we have begun to put our own houses in order – churches, schools, halls and parsonages - through our Shrinking the Footprint campaign. This aims to cut the carbon footprint of the church’s 42 dioceses and 16,000 churches by 80% by 2050. Increasingly there are calls for the church to disinvest from fossil fuels and invest in renewable energy. A report is expected at General Synod in July. Shrinking the Footprint aims to cut the carbon footprint of the church’s 42 dioceses and 16,000 churches by 80% by 2050 But our political leaders must play their part. If the recent pledge that the leaders made is to be more than just words, it must lead to firm action. One of the simplest and cheapest yet most profound actions that the three party leaders could take is to commit to a date for ending coal-fired electricity generation in the UK. Having accepted the principle, this is the logical next step. The date should preferably be 2020, but certainly no later than 2025. This would show that there is substance behind the leadership that Cameron, Clegg and Miliband have already shown – first as individuals when the Climate Change Act was passed a little over six years ago, and again by signing their recent joint pledge. It is not as though we would be alone. China and India, far less developed than the UK, are taking their own steps to constrain coal burning. But they will depend on it for decades, whereas we do not need to. For a country that built the industrial revolution on the backs of coal miners, such a move would be hugely symbolic. It would also prove emotive for communities here in Britain that have strong heritage links to coal. But the reality is that there are now only a few thousand people employed either in mining or in coal power stations in this country. The time is right to close the chapter on old king coal in Britain. Doing so would reaffirm our leadership on climate change. It would resonate around the world, and raise hopes of achieving the next global agreement on climate change that we need later this year. The science tells us what we must do to address climate change; the moral duty is ours."
"For 13 years, the World Bank’s landmark publication, Doing Business, has ranked countries around the world based on how well their regulatory systems serve corporate interests. But far from merely analyzing the business climate across the globe, the annual report has profoundly affected the way that countries deal with regulation. In 2014 alone, more than 70% of sub-Saharan African governments implemented at least one reform to ease the way for businesses – and, not incidentally, moved up in the World Bank’s ranking. This has resulted in a global competition to lower public interest regulations, diminish environmental and social safeguards, and reduce corporate tax responsibilities – all in the name of doing business.  Dr Jason Hickel of the London School of Economics has called the World Bank’s rankings the “new shock doctrine”. He argues that, with the end of the World Bank and IMF’s structural adjustment programs, the rankings have become the new instrument for driving liberalization reforms around the world.  At the World Bank’s annual meeting last October, I was on a panel that discussed land privatization, one of the major shortcomings of the Doing Business ranking system. Some of my co-panelists gave first-hand testimony about how deregulation and competition to attract foreign investment – encouraged by Doing Business – has fostered large-scale private investment in farmland in developing countries. As corporations and wealthy investors have grabbed millions of hectares, they’ve displaced thousands of small holder farmers and other rural residents.  To his credit, World Bank Group president Dr Jim Yong Kim has acknowledged that large-scale land acquisitions threaten a way of life for thousands. But little has changed on the ground, and the World Bank staff’s response to our panel was dismissive at best. The problem may soon be getting worse. At the behest of the G8, the World Bank is developing Enabling the Business of Agriculture, a new project that will apply the Doing Business approach to agriculture. This initiative, funded by four Western governments and the Gates Foundation, is expected to benchmark 40 countries by 2015. It promotes actions that further undermine farmers’ access to land and will make them even more dependent on corporate producers of agricultural materials. It’s hardly surprising that corporations are constantly pushing for fewer limitations on how they conduct business. But given the impact of this lobbying – as well as the impact that Doing Business has had on regulations around the globe – a fundamental question has emerged about the legitimacy of the World Bank’s list. Is it a true informative project or merely a tool to deregulate business, lower taxes, and shift control of the world’s most fertile land from small holder farmers to large private companies? Clearly, there are better ways to balance the needs of businesses, citizens and countries. I’ve seen first-hand how a high-road approach to environmental and labor standards can be good for people and the planet, as well as the bottom line.  Instead of the Doing Business list, I would suggest a system that ranks corporations on how they impact the people and the communities where they do business. Among other things, such a system would ask about each company’s track record on social factors, like whether they provides good quality jobs and stays in communities. It would look into each company’s environmental impact and sustainability. It would consider whether companies fulfill their promises, strive toward transparency and pay their taxes. And – especially in the case of agribusiness ventures – a truly effective system would ask if companies have shown respect and deference to small holder farmers, agro pastoralists, fishing communities, and indigenous populations. To make this kind of system work, we would need to rethink how we conceptualize value. Shareholder value, of course, would be a major part of this reconsideration, but the larger question of value extends far further.  In some ways, this focus on value is nothing new: companies are constantly rethinking the notion of “creating value”. What’s more, they are also the biggest advocates for using measurements as an instrument for change. They recognize that what you measure influences what you work on.  With that in mind, shouldn’t we encourage a race to the top and not to the bottom? Shouldn’t the World Bank move from Doing Business to creating instead a ranking of corporations that promote fair business? Businesses are competitive by nature, and a competition to be ranked as the best corporate citizen could inspire some of their most creative instincts. Admittedly, there have already been numerous corporate social responsibility rankings, but none have been conducted by an organization with the World Bank’s financial and political influence. It’s hard to imagine how far the impact of such a ranking could extend. On the other side, this kind of ranking could pay dividends for the World Bank, which has steadily lost credibility on the global stage as it has increasingly been seen as little more than an agent of corporate interests. If it hopes to turn this image around, the organization needs to stop pursuing “business as usual” policies.  Doing away with the Doing Business rankings would be a good start, and a great way to send the message that the bank will only put its resources behind corporations that have demonstrated a firm commitment to climate justice and human rights.

" Cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2025 would be an “onerous” task, Australia’s environment minister has said. On Tuesday the Climate Change Authority (CCA) recommended the cut and said Australia should also increase its commitment to cut 2000-level emissions by 2020 from 5% to 19% if it wanted to be taken seriously at the Paris climate change talks in December.   Responding to the CCA report on Wednesday, Greg Hunt said the government was on track to meet the 5% 2020 target, but would not commit to further reductions or adopt the suggested targets, which included cutting levels of carbon pollution by between 40% and 60% by 2030.  “On their own numbers – what the CCA is proposing is not just the largest reduction in emissions intensity in the world – but a third more onerous than any other country,” Hunt said. “We’re currently undertaking broad consultation with the community on the setting of targets for the post-2020 period. The CCA report will be considered as part of this process.” The government is due to announce its post-2020 target in June. The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, reacted cautiously to the CCA report, saying Labor would take the recommendations seriously and be guided by the best science in developing its policy. He declined to say whether Labor would endorse the suggested long-term targets. “The Abbott government is a government of climate sceptics run for climate sceptics and their policies are clearly not going to achieve anywhere near the targets that the rest of the world are addressing,” Shorten said. “We’re working on what our targets should be. We’re interested and most committed to seeing what occurs in the Paris conference and we are certainly ... in the short term demanding the government remove one of the big logjams to a sustainable future for Australian energy... by doing a deal on the renewable energy target.” The Climate Institute research centre said while the report had identified the scale of action required to reach the internationally agreed goal of limiting warming to 2C above pre-industrial times, its recommendations did not go far enough to ensure that would be met. The institute’s chief executive, John Connor, said the CCA recommendations opened the door to more credible carbon pollution reductions, but did not go far enough. “We should be targeting at least 40% reductions by 2025, and 60% by 2030, if we want to help build global efforts that give a strong chance of avoiding 2C,” he said. “In part, the authority is basing its recommendations on a carbon pollution budget that gives a two-out-of three chance of meeting the internationally agreed goal of avoiding more than 2C warming,” Connor said.  “For a country exposed to extreme weather that is being put on steroids by global warming, Australia should be doing more, and encouraging others to do more as well.” The national climate change manager for WWF Australia, Kellie Caught, said the key message from the CCA was that Australia needed to “lift its game if we are to protect the people and places we love”. A joint report from the WWF and the Australian National University’s centre for climate economics and policy released on Tuesday found Australia could achieve zero net emissions by 2050 by harnessing energy efficiency, moving to a zero-carbon electricity system and switching from direct use of fossil fuels to decarbonised electricity."
"The Guardian campaign for ethical investment (Felix Salmon, 13 April) aims to stop fund managers investing in any fossil fuels. This ignores the need to discriminate between them. The greatest threat of a dangerous rise in global temperatures comes from the world’s reliance on burning coal. China and India, for instance, are building three huge coal-fired power stations a week. In the short or medium term, the most effective substitute for coal is gas. The US has recently reduced its carbon emissions more than any other major country, because it has switched from coal to gas through exploitation of its vast deposits of shale gas. Gas can only be a transitional solution because of its carbon content, and there will also be environmental or geological problems in different places. But gas is less than half as polluting as coal and can give us a breathing space, which we need to develop more efficient sources of carbon-free power.Dick TaverneLiberal Democrat, House of Lords  • That the shares of oil and gas companies have significantly underperformed on the market in recent years may help make the case for divestment, as Felix Salmon says. But there are three reasons for caution. First, don’t forget past performance isn’t a guide to future performance. Second, while the halving in oil prices since last June has obviously hit the performance of the sector, some companies anticipate a major recovery in prices. One is Shell, already Britain’s largest company, which agreed last week to buy smaller rival BG Group for £47bn. This deal shows Shell is confident oil prices are going to bounce back. Third, Shell’s BG purchase is expected to trigger a fresh wave of deals in the oil and gas sector. The shares of potential targets will rise accordingly. There are big fees for the investment banks behind these deals.Dr Alex MayManchester • Follow the Guardian letters desk on Twitter: @guardianletters"
"This week we’re focusing on the biggest story in the world - climate change. The planet is reaching crisis point and time is running out to make the changes that are crucial if our planet is to survive (such as keeping fossil fuels in the ground). But what on earth have books got to do with the environment? Stories. The power of a story. As TheBookAddictedGirl blogs:  “It makes climate change interesting. It makes us understand how vital environmentalism is. It makes us think. It makes us act. We need to look at all the mistakes made in books that lead to these dystopian worlds and we need to change them.” So this week we’re celebrating the positive power of stories, whether dystopian YA fiction, picture books, poetry or classic reads, to bring home what we risk losing - and what we can do about it. And it’s International Earth Day on Wednesday 22 April too.  There’s tons of exciting stuff coming up this week - here’s an overview of what’s planned. We’ll be adding live links to this list as features are published so keep checking back.  Monday 20 April Tuesday 21 April Wednesday 22 April (Earth Day) Thursday 23 April Friday 24 April Saturday 25 April Sunday 26 April"
"The Australian government’s Direct Action emissions reduction fund could require up to $1bn of extra funds to meet its carbon emissions reduction goal, according to a Guardian Australia analysis based on initial auction results.  The results of the first Direct Action auction, revealed last week, showed emissions reduction contracts worth $660.4m had been awarded to prevent 47m tonnes of greenhouse gases entering the atmosphere. According to the Clean Energy Regulator, the average cost per tonne of carbon-dioxide-equivalent greenhouse gases in the auction was $13.95. The government has committed to a reduction in emissions of 5% below 2000 levels, with the latest projections putting this amount at 236m tonnes. Although the total amount of abatement in the first auction is 47m tonnes, this includes projects with contract periods that go beyond 2020, so the contribution of this auction towards meeting the 2020 goal is a fair bit lower. If we divide the volume of emissions reductions committed in each project by its contract duration, we can get a figure of volume per year for each. Based on these figures, the total abatement outcome in five years will be 28.4m tonnes. This is only 12% of the government’s goal, with 207m tonnes remaining. With $1.9bn left in the emissions reduction fund, the government could only meet a further reduction of 135m if the price stays at $13.95 per tonne. This leaves a shortfall of 72m tonnes, which would cost approximately $1bn, again assuming no reduction in price per tonne. The results of the auction show the biggest beneficiary of the Direct Action policy so far has been a company called Terra Carbon, which gained contracts for 41 individual projects with an abatement volume of 20.7m tonnes. At the average price of $13.95, this results in an estimated $288m to the company. As for the types of projects, I’ve added the abatement category to each project, based on information from the emissions reduction fund register. The majority of reductions are coming from “avoided deforestation”, but methane capture is also high on the list, particularly if you take the length of the contract into account: You can see my full working, which has been reviewed by a climate policy analyst, here. Please let me know if you spot any errors with the calculations. See also this piece in the Conversation which performs similar calculations, although without a annualised figure for each contract."

"Climate change will have significant repercussions for Australians’ health as warming temperatures fuel extreme weather events, help spread disease and disrupt food and water supplies, according to a report backed by the country’s peak scientific and medical bodies. The Climate change challenges to health report, released by the Australian Academy of Science, warns that vulnerable people, particularly the sick, elderly and poor, will “suffer disproportionately from the worst impacts of climate change.” The report notes that the world will have warmed by “at least 2C compared with pre-industrial times” by the end of the century, leading to heatwaves, droughts, storms and floods that will “lead directly to loss of life and will have a negative effect on the mental wellbeing of communities.” Instances of disease, such as those borne by mosquitoes, are expected to increase as the climate warms, while high temperatures and disrupted water supplies will affect crops. In addition, the warming and acidification of oceans will affect Australia’s fisheries. The report, which is backed by the Australian Medical Association (AMA), makes eight key recommendations, including programs to prevent health impacts upon the sick, the elderly, poor and those in remote communities. It also calls for a new National Centre for Disease Control and a new National Food and Water Commission, to coordinate Australia’s adaption to a changed climate. Funding in agricultural research and development should be increased while greenhouse gas emissions should be cut, the report recommends. The report notes that the IPCC has “high confidence” that Australia will have more frequent heatwaves and bushfire-prone conditions this century, warning that extreme weather is a “particularly serious health issue for Australia”, with the number of heatwave-related deaths in Australian cities set to double over the next 40 years. Meanwhile, Australia could become more susceptible to vector-borne diseases, such as dengue, as well as respiratory diseases as people spend more time indoors avoiding extreme heat.  Conflicts over water in regional areas could flare, the report warns, while Australia could face migrants from Pacific islands threatened by sea level rises. Livelihoods in farming, fishing and tourism could be at risk, potentially deepening inequalities and causing mental health problems. AMA president, associate professor Brian Owler, said the report provided compelling evidence of the significant threat that climate change posed to worldwide health. “There will always be a few outliers, but the overwhelming bulk of the scientific community, including most doctors, think we are well beyond debating whether climate change is an issue,” he said. “The more groups that voice their concerns over these kinds of issues, the more compelling it is for governments to take action.” “This is not something that can be subject to political debate. That’s the whole problem with climate change, it’s a great frustration to many people that this whole climate change debate has been hijacked as a political debate, and unless we get past that and start looking at facing consequences and mitigating the effects of climate change, we’ll struggle to respond to its effects.” Most doctors think we are well beyond debating whether climate change is an issue Dr Ailie Gallant, one of the contributors to the report, said there is still some uncertainty over the severity of problems posed by climate change but that adaptation around food and water will be required. “There is a broad drying trend in the south of Australia, so the type of crops we grow may have to be altered and our diet … may need to change,” she said. “There are all kinds of adaptation strategies which will mean that the things that make up our food basket will need to change.” Bruce Armstrong, emeritus professor of public health at the University of Sydney and fellow of the Academy of Science, said parts of Australia currently unaffected by mosquito-borne diseases could soon start experiencing them as warmer weather pushed them south. “We will experience more extremes in weather like we had in Sydney recently and also more heatwaves and more fire events, all of which have the potential for major health impacts,” Armstrong, a co-author of the report, said. “We need to implement strategies to warn people well in advance so they know what to do, and secondly we need to ensure we can maintain health services and care for those who are isolated and affected.” It would be very difficult to provide those responses without the support of the federal government, he said. It was essential the government release climate science and health data, he said, so that researchers could analyse the impact of climate events in real time.  “Because of the complexities of the state and federal health systems, and the fact that diseases don’t respect borders, we need stronger mechanisms to record what’s going on, and to monitor and research it,” he said. “That’s not going to happen without the support of governments. I hope this report will be a nudge in that direction.” Projections released by the CSIRO and Bureau of Meteorology in January show that Australia is set to have an average annual temperature that is 1.3C warmer in 2030 compared to the average experienced between 1986 and 2005. This will be accompanied by more extreme droughts and less rainfall in the southern portion of the country.  Beyond this, Australia could warm by more than 5C by 2090 if little effort is made to cut the amount of greenhouse gases entering the atmosphere.  Australia, which experienced its warmest and third warmest years on record in 2013 and 2014, respectively, has already warmed by 0.9C since 1910. "

"There’s little that Gary Matthews doesn’t know about the Everglades, Florida’s famed river of grass he’s been exploring since he was a schoolboy. His vast knowledge of the flora, fauna and wildlife of the state’s great wilderness has been built during decades of expeditions into the back country by airboat, swamp buggy and all-terrain vehicle. Proud of his life as a professional outdoorsman, “Gator Gary”, as he likes to be known, enjoys sharing his adventures with the diverse range of clients he takes deep into the Everglades aboard his fleet of airboats, from tourists eager to capture a photo of a hungry alligator to scientists from the US Geological Survey testing levels of pollutants in the water.  Matthews is also a Republican, and might therefore be expected to be cynical of Barack Obama’s flying visit to the south Florida wetlands on Wednesday to deliver a speech on climate change. “How long has Obama been office? And he finally comes to the Everglades now? Where he was on day one?” he wonders. Yet having witnessed first-hand the many negative and human-initiated changes that have impacted the fragile ecosystem of the Everglades over the years, Matthews is at least curious to hear what Obama has to say. Particular problems are polluted runoff flowing south from central Florida’s agricultural and big sugar industries; a 93% reduction in the population of native wading birds and a significant loss of other rare or endangered wildlife, partly caused by mercury poisoning; and more recently the devastation threatened by the increased salination of groundwater linked to sea level rise. “I’m on both sides of the fence,” he admits. “I am as green as you can be, and I am as Republican as you can be, but I will vote for the party that looks out for my children’s children. We have to leave this place beautiful for our grandchildren’s grandchildren.” Matthews does, however, follow a more traditionally Republican line on the cause of climate change broadly similar to that of Marco Rubio, the Florida senator and presidential candidate who doesn’t deny that it exists but doubts that human activity is responsible “the way these scientists are portraying it”. “Man’s influence is there, but what we are seeing is nature,” Matthews insists. “We might be speeding it up, we might be slowing it down, but it’s nature and it’s constantly changing. I am all for forcing people to have solar panels, drive electric cars and stop polluting the air, but it has nothing to do with ice melt. Rubio’s point is correct, but it’s our responsibility as humans who live on Earth to take care of the Earth.” Stretching west across the Florida peninsula from Miami lies the Tamiami Trail, home to many of the airboat operators who, like Gator Gary, earn their living from the Everglades. The names of the various businesses, such as Buffalo Tiger’s, Osceola Panther’s and Tigertails, evoke an earlier era, one of Native Americans paddling wooden canoes gently in harmony with nature, long before industrialisation arrived to spoil it. It’s a tranquil image the tourism industry likes to promote, but the reality is markedly different. Degradation of the Everglades has been going on pretty much unchecked for more than a century, with so many acres of the wetlands drained for agriculture and development since 1900 that now only 50% of the original area is left, according to the US Geological Survey. The surviving 4 million acres, which provide water to more than 6 million people, remain under threat from the influence of sea level rise reaching far inland and saltwater seeping into the Everglades’ porous underground freshwater aquifers, according to the National Parks Service’s own scientists. Rick Tyre, a guide with Coopertown Airboats, one of the “big four” companies with a permit to operate in the Everglades “expansion lands” adjacent to the national park, says it’s an issue that visitors are increasingly concerned about. “We tell them that it’s cyclical, that the water rises and falls in the Everglades with the seasons, but it’s definitely an issue,” he said. “Right now we’re in a drought and the water’s real low, that’s when it’s a problem.” Several days of thunderstorms appear to have marked an early start to south Florida’s wet season, allowing water levels to rise again and the airboat operators to resume full schedules. For Matthews, who says he has lost $18,000 in bookings during the final weeks of the dry season while his boats could not go out, it could not come soon enough. On his first trip back out on Tuesday, Matthews pointed to the disappearance of hardwood hammocks and trees suffering from root rot as indications of changes in water quality in the Everglades. He also believes some of the issues in the Everglades could be fixed with improved water storage and distribution, particularly after storms. Politics, as always, gets in the way. Successive governments, at state and federal level, have cut back funding for restoration measures, and the conservation momentum has stalled. “I’ve watched the Everglades pendulum swing right to left, Republican to Democrat, over and over,” he says. “Everything in the Everglades, every decision is politically motivated, constantly motivated by greed or political mannerisms. “Obama will say whatever’s politically correct to gain votes for his party. [But] there needs to be a unified approach to bringing back nature.” As things stand, Matthews, 63, wonders how much longer the traditional way of life for so many who work in and enjoy the Everglades, the generations of airboaters, hunters and fishermen, will be sustainable. He believes that within 10 years there could be only one airboat company operating with the blessing if park officials. “People want to come to the Everglades to experience what it’s really like in the swamp. We don’t want a time when they’ll have to just look at it on Google Earth,” he said. “But opinion seems to be against outdoorsmen as a whole. Yet it’s not my airboat that’s pumping out all those carbon emissions. It’s Obama’s jet.”"

"The world’s biggest fossil fuel companies are taking a defiant stance against warnings that reserves of coal, oil and gas are already several times larger than can be burned if the world’s governments are to meet their pledge to tackle climate change. Peabody Energy, the world’s largest private coal company, said on Monday that global warming was “an environmental crisis predicted by flawed computer models”. Another coal giant, Glencore Xstrata, said on Tuesday that governments would fail to implement measures to cut carbon emissions. Oil and gas major ExxonMobil said new reserves in the Arctic and Canadian tar sands must be exploited, moves scientists deem incompatible with tackling global warming. The fossil fuel companies rejection of the consensus of governments and scientists that urgent action to cut emissions is needed comes as the G20 group of leading nations launched a joint probe into global financial risks posed by fossil fuel companies investing in expensive projects that could be left worthless by international action on climate change, the so-called “carbon bubble”. The World Bank and Bank of England have already warned of the serious risk climate action poses to trillions of dollars of fossil fuel assets. “A toxic brew of climate denial and environmental irresponsibility is steering Big Coal and Big Oil towards ever greater fossil fuel extraction, and towards an economic precipice,” said Doug Parr, policy director at Greenpeace UK. “The problem is their headlong rush to disaster could drag many ordinary people’s pensions and investments over the edge with them. We can only hope that our political leaders can stand up to the lobbying muscle of fossil fuel companies and their short-sighted recklessness.” Peabody Energy chairman and chief executive Greg Boyce, told a fossil fuel conference in Houston, US, that access to low cost energy was the world’s biggest issue. “The greatest problem we confront is not an environmental crisis predicted by flawed computer models, but a human crisis that is fully within our power to solve.”  He said tens of millions American of parents faced “the terrible choice of putting food on the table, buying medicine or paying for power” and that the problem was even worse for billions of people around the world without proper electricity. “We should not mandate artificial carbon caps, carbon taxes or renewable mandates that will hurt people and cripple economies for negligible environmental benefit,” said Boyce.  “The sudden interest of climate ‘merchants of doubt’ like Peabody in global poverty strikes me as cynical at best,” said Anthony Hobley, chief executive of the Carbon Tracker Initiative, which has pioneered the analysis of carbon bubble. “They are using the world’s energy poor for a game of smoke and mirrors to sow confusion because the facts say otherwise.” Former US vice-president Al Gore has also accused the coal industry of mounting a cynical and misleading campaign. A recent study showed 80% of coal reserves must remain in the ground if climate change is to be tackled. The most recent report from the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, approved by 195 of the world’s nations, concluded that limiting the impacts of global warming “is necessary to achieve sustainable development and equity, including poverty eradication” and that climate change impacts are projected “to prolong existing and create new poverty traps”.  Ivan Glasenberg, the billionaire chief executive of Glencore Xstrata, dismissed concerns that any of its 4.3bn tonnes of coal reserves could be left worthless – or ‘stranded’ – by international action to cut greenhouse gases. He said he did not believe governments would act in the face of growing demand for cheap energy. Speaking at the launch of the company’s sustainability report, Glasenberg said: “Some of our stakeholders are concerned about the future of our fossil fuel reserves; in particular that they may become stranded assets. We do not believe that the global energy reality will economically support carbon measures that would prevent us from fully utilising our fossil fuel reserves.” “Glencore CEO’s statement about the future of their coal reserves flies in the face of recent reports from banks such as HSBC and ignores the concerns of the Bank of England and now the G20,” said Hobley. “It reminds me of similar denials by previous industries in decline from steam locomotion, Kodak film, Blockbuster videos and Olivetti typewriters.” ExxonMobil, Chevron and Shell have also defended their interests by arguing that the only way the world meet it energy demand is by burning fossil fuels. A recent report from Bloomberg New Energy Finance showed that, as costs plummet, global new low carbon energy capacity has outstripped new coal, gas and oil combined since 2013. Also speaking at the fossil fuel conference in Houston, ExxonMobil chairman and chief executive Rex Tillerson called for the exploitation of Arctic oil and gas reserves and the building of the Keystone XL pipeline to bring oil from Canada’s tar sands to the US. He said the pipeline had been delayed by “political machinations”.  Hobley said: “Focusing on high cost high carbon capital expenditure in the Arctic and tar sands makes neither financial or climate sense [so] what possible rational can there be for pouring billions of dollars of shareholders money into them?” The Guardian is running a campaign asking the world’s two biggest health charities to join over 180 institutions in divesting from fossil fuels. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has investments in both Peabody Energy and Glencore Xstrata."
"Something is missing from the British general election campaign. Climate change had its 3.5 seconds of fame during the seven-way leaders’ debate, but has barely been heard of since. Save for the occasional specialist hustings, and the odd supplementary manifesto, climate change – allegedly the defining challenge of the 21st century – is missing in action. But strangely, the problem seems largely one of style rather than substance. Putting the climate-sceptic UK Independence party to one side (the current Department for Energy and Climate Change would be abolished if they had their way), there are no shortage of climate policies in the parties’ manifesto pledges.  So while there appears to be a robust political consensus around the importance of climate change, it is a silent consensus – which from the point of view of public engagement, may as well not be a consensus at all.  One important factor (pdf) known to influence public opinion is whether elite groups (such as politicians and other public figures) give positive or negative cues on climate change. What our political leaders say about climate change matters – especially if they say nothing at all. The silent consensus would be more understandable if the hard work of decarbonisation and catalysing public engagement had already been done. But in fact the opposite is true. The emissions targets and carbon budgets are in place, and the Climate Change Act is written into law. But the transition ahead hinges on a societal transformation, a transformation which isn’t going to catalyse itself. Public support for decarbonising our energy system cannot just be shaken out of laws and regulations like the pennies tumbling out of a piggy bank.  For sure, a silent consensus is better than no consensus. The situation in the UK is not – thankfully – anything like the partisan pugilism in Australia or the US. And even beyond the political pragmatism (that recognises the importance if not the urgency of climate change), there is a stoic sort of climate-realism emerging in the private sector.  As James Murray, editor-in-chief of the influential website Business Green, puts it: “there is a quiet majority who, when pushed, accept climate change is something they will have to wrestle with in the future”. So politicians get it, and businesses get it. But few of them shout about it. And the vacuum created by the election climate silence has consequences.  Studies show that people routinely overestimate the prevalence of climate sceptic views in society, and underestimate levels of support for things like renewable energy. Distorted social inferences like these are fuelled by the absence of positive dialogue on climate change.  In a new guide to talking about climate change to centre-right voters (published by my colleagues and me at the Climate Outreach & Information Network), we tackle exactly this problem. Scepticism about climate change on the right of politics is in part caused by the absence of meaningful narratives and stories that resonate with the values of conservatives.  The less that political leaders talk about climate change, the less chance there is that these stories will flourish. And without an identify that spans the political spectrum, public debate about climate change will continue to be stilted and subdued.  In an article for the New Internationalist magazine, Ben Stewart of Greenpeace made an important point about the way that sensible – even inevitable – climate change policies are ridiculed by the UK media: “When the tabloids published their inevitable feature articles on ‘the Green party’s most bonkers policies’, they included the commitment to phase out coal-fired power stations, as if the recommendation of mainstream opinion in the scientific community is of a piece with homeopathy and astrology.” In short, there is a surreal but concerning double-think at play in the 2015 election: everyone agrees that climate change is a big deal, but serious policies to address it are considered an indulgence of the loopy-left. And a failure of leadership is to blame. Recognising a similar problem in the US, the campaign group ecoAmerica launched an ambitious leadership training programme for prominent voices from faith communities, higher education, and the health sector. Their aim was not to turn existing leaders into eco-champions, but instead to bring their proven leadership skills to bear on climate change – encouraging hundreds of key community voices to talk about climate change in their own words, using values that speak to their own audiences and sectors. As the election debates have shown, powerful leadership on climate change is not well served by quiet agreement. Nor is it a question of getting different leaders singing from the same song sheet. Some passionate disagreement – the antithesis of a silent consensus – would in many ways be preferable, and put climate change where it deserves to be: at the centre (not the periphery) of political debates.

"It started out somewhat awkwardly with speedos, but, as opposition leader, Tony Abbott was a consummate media performer. In the lead up to the 2013 Federal election, he would stand on the factory floor in the signature orange vest and deliver the Liberal party’s narrative to the people of Australia without faltering.  At the heart of his story was the Coalition’s renaming of the Clean Energy Act introduced by the Greens and the Gillard Government in 2011 as the “carbon tax” – giving us the now-famous “axe the tax” slogan. The story was well crafted, the messaging was tight, it had villains in Julia “Juliar” Gillard and the Greens, a hero in Abbott, and it was delivered with precision.  Today we see something different, a far less coherent and persuasive Abbott. Having destroyed the government from opposition, Abbott now provokes one crisis after another. It’s a sure bet that the response to these self-generated crises will be poorly considered, careless, and delivered with aggression and anxiety. The contrast between then and now couldn’t be more marked. Why this shift occurred has been the subject of much analysis, with some excited by the prospect of blaming Peta Credlin. The crucial detail missing is that the Liberal party’s 2013 election victory was the work of external strategists heavily invested in the control of public discourse – and that those strategists are no longer in charge. The architects of Liberal party communications on topics like global warming and refugees are the pollsters Crosby and Textor. Since Howard, they have deployed long-term strategies, spanning election campaign cycles, to shape how we think and feel about society.  At the heart of the carbon tax strategy was a plan to seize control of the national debate on global warming. It is likely this plan was pitched to the Liberal leadership immediately following the election loss in 2010, with the deployment of the strategy highly visible in Abbott’s media shortly after.  Prior to this, at the time Abbott took over the leadership of the Liberal party, the national discourse on global warming was already tipping in favour of the denial industry. Climate science was being used as a device by conservative political parties and big polluters around the globe to drag the debate about global warming away from the topic of big polluters The Liberals’ carbon tax strategy was a more advanced iteration of this global tactic. They exploited the tendency of the clean energy or “climate” movement to frame communications in terms of “carbon”, “emissions” and “moral challenges” – words that don’t tell a story and mean very little to most people outside the movement. The idea of Bjørn Lomborg’s “Big Polluter Consensus Centre”, suggested to the University of Western Australia by the federal government, is the most recent iteration of that strategy. Lomborg, like the Liberals these days, doesn’t engage in “global warming isn’t happening” style denial.  The angle is a more subtle one: “let’s not be faddish, the world is full of problems, we must consider the costs of dealing with them”. Lomborg’s approach has much in common with the strategies of big polluters, and of the Coalition.  First of all, disguise the problem and the villain. Do this by making sure the “climate” narrative isn’t about big polluters making money poisoning air, water, and soil. Then ignore the solution: the fact clean energy is already empowering the world’s poor through locally controlled solar and wind electricity – no coal required.  Crucial to this plan is getting the “climate” movement tangled in talking about the science of “climate” change, policy details of “climate” action, and now Lomborg’s cost-benefit analysis angle. It’s one very round climate circle.  The result is the story about the big polluters, and the solution story about clean energy, get buried in bureaucratic climate talk. The public are left with the story about the costs.  This is something I’ve learned after many years of running focus groups on topics like big polluters, clean energy and global warming: the word “carbon” is something most people can make neither head nor tail of. It confuses the hell out of them.  When you combine “carbon” with a bunch of other terms like “emissions”, “parts per million” and “sequestration”, it means even less to the average soft voter in your focus group.  “Tax” on the other hand, is something that is easily understood. The fact that these same focus groups will tell you that clean energy is an easy sell tells us just how canny the Liberal strategy was.  Every time the words “carbon tax” came out of Abbott’s mouth, he was delivering on this strategy to steer debate away from the inconvenient truth about Australia’s huge coal industry – and the plans of both the Liberals and Labor to expand it and export even more pollution, driving global warming. What was most striking about this strategy was how the Liberals managed to execute it without any effective opposition. Most of the parliament, the media and society bought into the language of “carbon” and “carbon tax”, letting the Liberals frame the debate.  The Labor party are technocratic in their communications and missed the point about “carbon”, language and contesting the narrative. Where the “tax” part of the narrative was concerned, it was as if the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the clean energy target (RET) did not exist. There was no fight on the terrain of narrative. Labor capitulated and embraced the framing of the Clean Energy legislation as a “tax”.  One explanation for why so many other people were wrong-footed by the Liberal plan is that progressive Australia has only recently adopted more contemporary techniques in narrative and language analysis. The Liberals are at least a decade ahead of the rest of the country in the use of these techniques of persuasion. From Tampa and “queue-jumping” onwards, the Liberals have based their marginal seats strategy around systematic approaches to controlling language and the public narrative.  People might dismiss what they’re hearing as nothing more than three-word slogans, but the apparatus is more sophisticated than that. The success of the carbon tax strategy appears to have emboldened Abbott and his pals, and goes some way to explaining the cockiness of this government upon arrival in office. But, crucially, it was political consultants – not Liberal party staffers – who designed the narrative strategies that won Abbott the election.  There is a big difference between the way that strategists and staffers operate. One of the consequences of this is that there’s often a disconnect between what a party says during a campaign and what they say in office. Campaigns also tend to be more coherent. One explanation for this disconnect is that the money comes from different places and is used to hire different staff who use different techniques. Election campaigns are about the big story, framed by pollsters hired by the party. Parliamentary political staffers are taxpayer-funded and focused on the media cycle. The cultures are different and often not in sync. One of the secrets to Howard’s success was that there was no such disconnect. The Liberal party coffers stretched between elections and so did the plan. The line from the prime minister to the pollsters was always open. With the Rudd and Gillard governments there was no line. And it appears that, for Abbott, the line has likewise been closed.  To be sure, Abbott and Credlin did a great tactical job delivering the election strategy, but with the British election in full swing, it appears the pollsters are no longer running the show. And after his big win on climate change, Abbott looks lost without them."
"Japan is proposing to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 26% by 2030 as its contribution to a global summit on climate change in Paris later in the year.  Media reports earlier this month said the country was looking at a 25% percent cut from 2013 levels, up from an earlier target of about 20%.  Japan, the world’s fifth biggest emitter of climate-warming carbon dioxide, has previously watered down emissions targets as the shutdown of its nuclear plants after the 2011 Fukushima disaster forced its utilities to burn record amounts of gas and coal to generate power.  The country’s latest proposal, issued by the industry and environment ministries on Thursday, includes a target to reduce emissions by 25.4% by 2030 from 2005 levels.  But government officials said they would prefer to use 2013 as a baseline, which implies a higher reduction target than other major developed countries.  The European Union has said it is looking to cut emissions by at least 40% from 1990 levels by 2030, while the United States is proposing a 26 to 28% cut from 2005 levels by 2025. From 1990 levels, Japan’s target would represent a mere 18% cut.  “It’s not fair to pick 2013 as baseline since it would ignore all those efforts made by other countries to cut emissions since 1990,” said Kumiko Hirata, coordinator of environmental group Climate Action Network Japan.  “Japan is trying to make its target look bigger by selecting 2013 as a base, when the country emitted so much greenhouse gas,” she said.  Japan’s greenhouse-gas emissions rose to 1.41bn metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), the second-highest on record, in the year ending March 2014, reflecting a rise in coal-fired power after the indefinite closure of nuclear power plants. That was up 10.8% from 1990.  Hirata said Japan will be blamed by global communities not only for a low target, but also for a series of plans by Japanese companies to build coal-fired plants at home.  Japan’s target for emission cuts is based on a proposed new power generation mix for 2030, unveiled by the industry ministry on Tuesday.  The government wants to make nuclear energy account for 20 to 22% of Japan’s electricity mix, versus 30% before Fukushima, with renewable energy making up 22-24%, liquefied natural gas for 27% and coal 26%.  “Japan should set a higher emissions cut target as renewable energy ... can make up bigger portion,” Yukari Takamura, professor at Graduate School of Environmental Studies at Nagoya University, said.  The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Environment have been holding joint panel meetings on the emissions target since last October.  Japan is looking to finalise the plan as soon as possible and announce its carbon emissions targets at the G7 meeting in Germany in early June.  The Paris summit starting in November aims to finalise an agreement as part of efforts to limit global average temperature rises to 2C above pre-industrial times. Separately, a new UN fund intended to help developing nations tackle global warming said the United States and Japan will miss a Thursday deadline to provide billions of dollars to help poorer countries deal with climate change. The Green Climate Fund (GCF), which wants to decide on a first set of projects to aid developing nations before the Paris summit, said donors had signed deals of almost $4bn, 42% of a total promised in November 2014. The signed deals, which lay out a firm timetable for when promised money will be paid, are below the minimum level set by donors, of 50% of the total by 30 April, to start full operations by the GCF. “A lot of progress has been made,” Hela Cheikhrouhou, executive director of the Fund, told an online news conference from South Korea on Thursday. “The work is not finished,” she said, urging governments to speed up contributions to help get on track. Top donors the United States, which promised $3bn, and Japan, on $1.5bn, were not among nations that have signed deals, according to a GCF overview. Cheikhrouhou said no new deals were expected later on Thursday. Britain and Germany led by signing deals covering their full amounts of $1.2bn and $1bn respectively, followed by Sweden, France, Norway and the Netherlands. The fund is intended to help developing nations cut their greenhouse gas emissions by shifting to renewable energies such as solar or wind and help them adapt to changes such as more floods, desertification and rising ocean levels. It has not ruled out funding fossil fuels, if they help towards cleaner energy use. The fund raised $9.35 billion at a pledging conference in November but new cash promised since then, including by Australia, has raised the pledged total to $10.2bn. Separately, Cheikhrouhou told Reuters that the fund was “an essential ingredient of a successful agreement” in Paris. The GCF is meant as one of the main avenues of a 2009 deal to mobilise $100bn a year in aid to developing nations, from public and private sources, to help combat climate change. Cheikhrouhou said emerging economies needed to invest about $2.5tn a year in sectors such as energy, transport, agriculture and industry and an extra $450bn to ensure they were green. "
"The Australian government has awarded emissions reduction contracts worth $660.4m for businesses to prevent 47m tonnes of greenhouse gases entering the atmosphere, in the first round of auctions under its Direct Action climate policy. The federal environment minister, Greg Hunt, said the auctions produced a “stunning outcome” which exceeded expectations. But the Climate Institute has said the first auctions showed the policy would fall well short of meeting even Australia’s “woefully inadequate” emissions reduction target.  The Coalition’s emissions reduction fund, the $2.55bn centrepiece of its Direct Action climate plan, has bought promised carbon abatement at an average price per tonne of $13.95 in the first auction. The fund will distribute taxpayer money for 107 contracts held by businesses and individuals for projects that aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as land regeneration and the capture of gases from agriculture and industry. Hunt said the 47m tonnes of abated emissions outstripped his expectation that “three or four or five million tonnes” might be achieved.  “This is stunning outcome, it far exceeds all of our expectations and it achieves an outcome in the first auctions which is more than four times the entire emissions reduction produced during the carbon tax period at a fraction of the cost,” he said. Hunt said the first round of auctions proved that the Coalition’s policy was a “comprehensive success”, in contrast to Labor’s carbon tax, which he called a “licence to pollute”. But the deputy chief executive of the Climate Institute, Erwin Jackson, said a quarter of the $2.55bn emissions reduction fund had been spent to secure just 15% of the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions needed for Australia to meet its target of a 5% cut by 2020, based on 2000 levels. “Things might get better in future auctions but they’ve already spent a quarter of the money and all the analysis suggests that these prices won’t get significant emissions reductions,” he said. “There is no confidence that we can even meet our woefully inadequate targets with this. “The broader issue is why are taxpayers footing the bill rather than the big polluters doing any of the heavy lifting? The public is bearing the cost here rather than the big polluters.”  A total of 144 projects will be funded, with the largest single contract, for LMS Energy to reduce emissions from four landfill sites, abating more than 3.5m tonnes of greenhouse gas. The smallest project, by Ralvimay Enterprises, is a three-year initiative to prevent the felling of native forests, saving 12,000 tonnes.  Terra Carbon, a firm that provides “market-based solutions for conservation”, scooped up 41 of the contracts awarded. The energy firm AGL was awarded contracts for seven landfill projects. The length of the contracts range from three to 10 years, with seven years being the standard term, according to the Clean Energy Regulator, which oversaw the auctions. The chairwoman of the regulator, Chloe Munro, said there was a “lot of abatement potential in the economy” but the first auction did not give a clear picture of the fund’s capacity to reduce emissions.  The emissions reduction fund was introduced in the wake of the Coalition’s abolition of the carbon pricing system last year. The government has not conducted any analysis to ascertain whether the policy will ensure Australia meets its target of a 5% cut in emissions, although Hunt has repeatedly stressed his confidence the system will work. Numerous independent bodies, including the UN and the government’s own Climate Change Authority, have cast doubt on whether the policy will be enough to deliver the 5% cut without additional regulations or a greater level of funding. Hunt said on Thursday he expected the level of required abatement to fall further due to reducing energy consumption in the economy.  The next emissions reduction auction is expected later this year."

"Three-quarters of known fossil fuel reserves must be kept in the ground if humanity is to avoid the worst effects of climate change, a group of leading scientists and economists have said in a statement timed to coincide with Earth Day. The Earth League, which includes Nicholas Stern, the author of several influential reports on the economics of climate change; Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, a climate scientist and adviser to Angela Merkel; and the US economist Jeffrey Sachs, urged world leaders to follow up on their commitments to avoid dangerous global warming. Spelling out what a global deal at the UN climate summit in Paris later this year should include, the group demanded governments adopt a goal of reducing economies’ carbon emissions to zero by mid-century, put a price on carbon and that the richest take the lead with the most aggressive cuts. In its “Earth statement”, the group said that three-quarters of known fossil fuel reserves must be left in the ground if warming was not to breach a rise of 2C, the “safety limit” agreed to by governments. Johan Rockström, the statement’s lead author, said: “From a scientific perspective, 2015 is a decisive moment. The window to navigate ourselves free from a ‘beyond 2C future’ is barely open. It’s the last chance to navigate ourselves towards a desired future. “It’s so frustrating, because it’s the choice of moving down a business-as-usual route with devastating outcomes for humanity and, at the same time, we have this almost unprecedented opportunity, we can transform the world economy to a fossil fuel-free one and moreover do it in a way that is security and health-wise more attractive.” The statement says that failure by the world to act on climate change would bring is a one in 10 chance of temperatures rising by more than 6C by 2100, a level of risk that would be comparable with accepting 10,000 plane crashes daily worldwide.  Rockström said there was now enough scientific evidence that the world was approaching irreversible tipping points where the Earth’s system begins to accelerate the warming that man has already caused. Methane being released as permafrost thaws and melting ice meaning less solar energy reflected back into space are two examples. “That’s the scientific nightmare,” Rockström said. “You don’t want the Earth to go from friend to foe … this could happen quite soon; we need to bend the curve on emissions over the next 10 to 15 years.” He admitted, however, that there was a significant gap between the group’s demands and what might be achieved at the Paris conference, COP21, with several significant players already playing down expectations. “We’re not at all where we need to be,” Rockström said. Sachs said: “COP21 is the moment of truth, the last chance to stay within the 2C upper limit.”  The statement called for developed countries to help scale up financial aid for developing countries to deal with climate change, and for Paris to agree the beginnings of a strategy to make countries more resilient to the extreme weather a warming world is expected to bring. Brian Hoskins, one of the Earth statement signatories and the director of the Grantham institute for climate change at Imperial College London, said that given the importance of the Paris summit, the attention given to climate change in the UK general election campaign was “pathetic” and “extremely disappointing”. “The contrast between the importance of this year and our election is just stark,” he said. “It seems we go towards the lowest common denominator in such a discussion of this, instead of stepping back and saying what do we want, what is our vision for the country, what is our vision for the world, we’re saying, are we going to get a pack of butter for 20p rather than 30p? It’s a shopping list rather than a vision.” This year’s Earth Day was marked by Barack Obama in his weekly video address. He said he would be visiting the Florida Everglades on Wednesday to see how the environment is at risk from rising sea levels there: “Climate change can no longer be denied or ignored,” he said. "
"  Australia is well placed to reduce emissions at low cost because the costs of carbon-free technologies such as wind and solar have fallen significantly in recent years.  A WWF report produced in collaboration with the Australian National University argues Australia could source 100% of its power from renewables by 2050 – without incurring massive adjustment costs or depressing economic growth – if there were clear and stable national policy settings to support investment in renewables. Australia’s national climate policy does not extend beyond 2020. The current commitment is to cut carbon emissions by 5% below 2000 levels by 2020, although a number of climate experts query whether the Abbott government’s Direct Action policy will achieve that target. The Coalition’s desire to cut the existing Renewable Energy Target (RET) has triggered an investment drought in the sector. Despite repeated pleas from the sector and business groups, the standoff over the RET remains unresolved. The government is expected to set post-2020 emissions reduction targets in June.  Australia has been asked to defend the credibility of the Direct Action climate policy at the United Nations, after several countries submitted questions querying how the policy would reduce carbon emissions. The world’s two largest emitters – the United States and China – joined other countries in challenging Australia about its emissions reduction target and commitment to renewables. The WWF/ANU report contends that Australia is well placed to make an orderly and low-cost transition to decarbonisation if the government can send clear and predictable policy and regulatory signals to the market, and resist special pleading from the owners of carbon intensive assets. The report does not produce new modelling or quantify the costs associated with structural adjustment or abatement, but it synthesises a body of existing research to highlight the fact that it is becoming cheaper to cut carbon emissions. It argues that renewable technology options are becoming cheaper while fossil fuel alternatives remain static, and that emissions growth is beginning to slow, both regionally and globally. It points out that China – the main driver of rising global emissions over the past decade – has entered a period of slowing economic growth “and the country is decoupling economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions, in a deliberate effort to move to a lower-carbon growth model”. One of the major arguments against decarbonisation over the past decade has been the high cost associated with the move away from fossil fuels. The report says the long view now suggests previous work has overestimated the costs associated with reducing pollution. It notes specifically that the costs of solar and wind have fallen much faster than anticipated. “For example, large-scale solar panel power stations are already only half the cost that the Treasury’s 2008 and 2011 modelling studies estimated they would be in the year 2030.” The report says if there were clear and stable policy settings in place to support investment in renewables then Australia could achieve a cost-effective transition to a near-zero carbon system by around 2040. The costs of mitigation would be reduced further if the government allowed the use of international permits. The report’s author, Australian National University associate professor Frank Jotzo, said the evidence suggested deep cuts to Australia’s emissions could be achieved at low cost.  “With our abundant renewable resources we are one of the best placed countries in the world for moving to a fully renewable electricity supply,” he said. “Australia can achieve zero net emissions by harnessing energy efficiency, moving to a zero-carbon electricity system, switching from direct use of fossil fuels to decarbonised electricity, and improving industrial processes.” National manager of WWF, Kellie Caught, said the report sets out what governments need to do. “The solution is clear: set an ambitious long-term goal for reducing carbon pollution, and take decisive action to make it happen.”"
"This week we’re celebrating the positive power of stories, all kinds of stories, to bring home what we risk losing on our beautiful planet - and what we can do about it. Here authors and children’s books site members share the books that made them think. We’ll be feeding this blog with more recommendations all week, so please share yours – and keep checking back.  Frank Cottrell Boyce (whose latest book is the remarkably green The Astounding Broccoli Boy)  The book that made me realise that I was part of the environment was The Ladybird Book of Saints. On the cover was this brilliant image of St Francis releasing the caged birds he had he had bought in the market. For ages afterwards I would go into pet shops and zoos and itch to unlock the doors. In fact there are “freeing the animals” scenes in at least two of my books. There are so many environmental messages about how horrible humans are wrecking the planet - that’s obviously true in a way but this image made me feel that I belonged in the World too and that I could cherish and love it. David Almond, author of Skellig The Promise by Nicola Davies and Laura Carlin. It’s beautifully written, beautifully illustrated picture book. It shows a troubled darkened world being recreated by the human need for greenery, life and colour. Louise O’Neill, author of Only Ever Yours Margaret Atwood’s Oryx and Crake is a speculative fiction novel that is very much concerned with the damage humans are inflicting upon the environment and the possible catastrophic results that could have. Written in 2003, many plot points now seem eerily prescient and it makes for a disturbing, powerful read. Highly recommended for older teenagers.  Site member, Patrick Carl Hiaasen’s Hoot is true to its name in that it’s a supremely funny YA novel, and one that tends to be overlooked. There’s a real environmental streak running through all of Hiaasen’s works and Hoot is no exception, it deals with a Florida teen who bands together with a couple of new friends to stop the destruction of a burrowing owl colony. It’s a lot of fun with a solid conservationist message at its core and an abundance of charm to boot.” Candy Gourlay, author of Shine Long ago I wrote a short story called How to Build the Perfect Sandcastle for Under the Weather, the climate change anthology edited by Tony Bradman. About a white sand beach losing its sand because the sea is heating up ... the same hot oceans that later whipped up the murderous monster that was Typhoon Haiyan in 2013. Perhaps the all too real climate change disaster in the Philippines has made me partial to flood stories. My favorite is Not the End of the World, the lyrical resetting of Noah’s Ark as a Tsunami survival story by Geraldine McCaughrean. Lottie Longshanks, site member The wild series by Piers Torday. So far I have read The Last Wild and The Dark Wild. Kester has the unusual gift of communicating with animals and it is his mission to save the animals from red eye the disease that is slowly killing them. It is a really exciting story and you soon guess who the villains are Selwyn Stone and his lackeys who want to dictate the way that everyone lives. The amazing rubbish dump in the second book in the series really makes you think about the damage that we are doing to our planet. I can’t wait to read the third book in the series, The Wild Beyond.  White Dolphin by Gill Lewis Set in the south West of England the exciting story tells of children who take on the might of a powerful fishing business to stop dredging in the harbour because of the damage it does to marine life. I also love Moon Bear by Gill Lewis. This incredibly moving story shows how deforestation leads to misery for the animals whose habitat was the forest. And finally here is a recommendation for small children I read it to my cousin who lives in Oman when he comes to visit us. Dear Greenpeace by Simon James. Emily writes to Greenpeace to find out how to care for the whale that she thinks she has seen in her pond. Emily’s letters and the lovely replies she receives from Greenpeace will give little children a lot of information about whales. (Also see Lottie Longshank’s poem Our Precious world) SF Said, author of Varjak Paw I recommend Exodus by Julie Bertagna: a brilliantly prescient YA novel about climate change, set in a drowned future world. It’s full of unforgettable visions and characters, and it will stay with you forever! ItWasLovelyReadingYou, site member My book would be Breathe by Sarah Crossan. It made me think about how we take so many things for granted, such as oxygen. You can’t see it, we use it every day, without it we would not survive; yet many people do not really sit down and feel a sense of gratitude for these types of things, becuase we assume we deserve them, we see them as something that will never go away, we just accept it without question. Breathe really made me feel a sense of ‘imagine if we didn’t have oxygen, or we had limited supplies of it-”, it made me question my unconscious detachment from what keeps us alive, and really feel privelidged to have all of these necessities. Katherine Rundell, author of Rooftoppers Cosmic, by Frank Cottrell Boyce. Cosmic is a book that makes the world look like something worth protecting. It’s hilariously funny, and also wise - it makes its readers want desperately to go into space, but also to take care of the world while we’re on it. The Earth is, as one of the astronauts says, “some kind of lovely.” The Last Wild series by Piers Torday - these three spectacular books are about a world decimated by humans, and the possibility of that loss feels very real and urgent and frightening - and they’re also fantastic adventure stories, about bravery and animals and human capacity to do huge good as well as harm. And there’s a bossy talking cockroach.  Site Brahmachari, author of Kite Spirit and Artichoke Hearts For me it has to be The Ring of Bright Water Trilogy by Gavin Maxwell. I fell in love with these books as a child because they are set on the West coast of Scotland - a place I love - where wildlife and nature are the biggest characters. It;s a humbling landscape. If you have a love of the outdoors and really want to study the nature of beautiful, playful otters… and can stand to have your heart broken .... you should read these stories. Although they were written 50 years ago they are as timeless as the shingle beaches they are set on. The author lived and breathed the paradise he went to live in… and so will you when you read these books… and afterwards you can watch the film (tissues at the ready!)  OrliTheBookWorm, site member Breathe by Sarah Crossan is probably the book that’s impacted me the most in terms of the environment - it’s a dystopian novel, with people living in domes due to a lack of oxygen - the raw descriptions and harsh realities were wonderfully done and uttery thought provoking, and made me take a step away from my laptop and have a look outside my window.... It’s a brilliant book, which I guarantee will change your perspective on the environment around us. Piers Torday, author of The Dark Wild trilogy The Animals of Farthing Wood by Colin Dann – the original classic tale of a group of British animals seeking refuge when their precious Farthing Wood is threatened by human development. They overcome incredible obstacles and danger to make it to a wildlife sanctuary. But reading it today there is an extra poignancy - some of the animals in the story, like the red-backed shrike, are now extinct, and others - like the adder, hare and voles - are all under threat. BritishBiblioholic, site member Watership Down by Richard Adams – When the rabbits in Watership Down are forced to leave their home, it is due to its impending destruction by humans. This potentially can be seen as an allegory for the ongoing destruction for the environment in general - and unlike the rabbits, if we don’t save our environment, we won’t be able to find somewhere else to live. Tony Bradman, author of Anzac Boys One of my favourite books about the environment is Oi! Get Off Our Train, a brilliant picture book by John Burningham. It’s about a boy who dreams he’s travelling around the world on his toy train, and each time he stops he picks up animals from species that are endangered because their habitat is being threatened or has been destroyed. Great pictures and the message is delivered with a lot of fun. @GdnChildrensBks Under The Weather anth. ed @tonybradman, climate change. My story Tommy and the Bike Train shows kids what they can do. Sarah Crossan, author of Breathe The Last Wild by Piers Torday - it’s rare for a cli-fi novel to be magical, engaging and affecting, but Torday achieves all of these things. Not only that, but each book in the trilogy gets better. He’s not a writer to watch but one we are already keenly watching. Please share the book that made YOU think about the environment and climate change and we’ll add it to this blog. You can either email on childrens.books@theguardian.com with the heading “eco books” or tweet @GdnChildrensBks.  @GdnChildrensBks The classic, Dinosaurs and all that Rubbish by Michael Foreman. Most eco last line ever: 'Everyone! Everyone!' Beatrice, on email The Word for World is Forest by Ursula Le Guin for fairly sophisticated young readers from about age 13. The indigenous social organization of the very green planet experiencing colonization therein was fascinating, and opens young minds up to understanding the profound disruptions experienced by, as well as the important teachings of native peoples everywhere. Also, The Owl Service by Alan Garner gave rise to surprising conversations with my 10 year-old about landscape, and the connections between culture, history and the environment, as well as the importance to humans of preserving those connections. For much younger children The Giving Tree by Shel Silverstein can seem a little odd viewed from a conservationist perspective, but it inspired lovely conversations about nature and environmental stewardship (“us taking care of nature because nature takes care of us”) with my 4 year-old. Anything by Jean Craighead George.  @GdnChildrensBks Best eco books for children: don't forget Dr Seuss http://t.co/c1t4Yt4Mlt http://t.co/472ErP2YoH @GuardianBooks @GdnChildrensBks Big Bear Hug by Nicholas Oldland - such a well done picture book with an eco message! @GdnChildrensBks The Trouble with Dragons by @DebiGliori and The Berenstain Bears Don't Pollute by Stan & Jan Berenstain #climatechange @kdbrundell @GavJacobson @GdnChildrensBks My 8 yo really liked Jean Craighead George's My Side of The Mountain et seq when he was younger @GdnChildrensBks @davidjalmond @frankcottrell_b Good list, but I'm surprised no one mentioned THE LORAX by Dr. Seuss. It's an eco-classic! @MiriamHalahmy @GdnChildrensBks @davidjalmond @frankcottrell_b Great recommendations. Dr Seuss's The Lorax still resonates. @GdnChildrensBks the cloud spinner by Michael Catchpool @GdnChildrensBks & Window by Jeannie Baker - wordless examination of how humans change world around them as they build, have babies, move on @GdnChildrensBks And the Wizard of Earthsea is all about ""balance"" and equilibrium and taking the time to understand the nature of things Sandra, on email I would strongly recommend the power of Scottish writer Rachel Meehan’s two books, Power’s Out and Water’s Edge. Through her strong characterisation, and the fiesty nature of her principal character Nairne, her hard-hitting story lines play out with force. The unvarnished truth of the implications of relentless climate change is delivered through fast paced adventures, which are compelling reading for young people. Her message is unmissable. @GdnChildrensBks The new & beautiful WHERE'S THE ELEPHANT? by Barroux - a rare picture book about deforestation http://t.co/WyFcfNb6Du Teresa, on emailHave a look at Rachel Meehan’s books – the Waters Edge trilogy. @GdnChildrensBks if you're in it for the long haul- The Obernewtyn Chronicles by Isobelle Carmody...a slow eco burn. @GuardianBooks @GdnChildrensBks Wump World by Bill Peet. @GdnChildrensBks These are Dolly's TOP #EARTHDAY BOOKS! http://t.co/hTuAQSHJAD #gogreen #EarthDay2015 #childrensbooks pic.twitter.com/dKZKNHAGip @GdnChildrensBks @SeaHolding An Australian proto-example of cli-fi maybe - Ruth Park's My Sister Sif? (With bonus mermen) @PenguinBooksAus @GdnChildrensBks @davidjalmond @frankcottrell_b The Story Of the Blue Planet by Icelander Andri Snaer Magnuson is a great book. @GdnChildrensBks Don't forget this one! pic.twitter.com/1JQnVzcdAe Mary, curator, eco-fiction.com Memory of Water by Emmi Itäranta: The novel takes place in the future after climate change has ravished economies and ecologies, and made fresh water scarce. The main character, Noria, is a young woman learning the traditional, sacred tea master art from her father. Yet, water is rationed and scarce in her future world. Her family has a secret spring of water, and, as tea masters, she and her father act as the water’s guards, even though what they are doing is a crime according to their future world’s government, a crime strongly disciplined by the military. Nature’s Confession by JL Morin: The eco-novel is wonderful and reminds me of classic science fiction I watched or read as a kid. It was a genre that fascinated me then, and this book has joined that memory. The novel is epic in that it doesn’t just tell a story (which it does do too), but it puts our very survival into question while romping through the universe or discovering new quantum physics that are both scientific and spiritual in nature. In the meantime, universal symbols are unearthed, codes are investigated, fat corporations are dominating, a romance is blossoming, computers come alive, and native tribes and Nature on another planet bring our own treasured past into the future. Tito intiro Chavaropana by Jessica Groenendijk: Tito intiro Chavaropana means ‘Tito and the Giant Otter’ in Matsigenka. The author, a biologist who has studied giant otters, is now working on a sequel, in which Tito sets off into the forest to hunt a spider monkey and meets a harpy eagle on the way. They become friends but not without a misunderstanding or two!Spirit Bear by Jennifer Harrington: Spirit Bear celebrates a rare and iconic black bear that is born with a recessive gene that makes its coat creamy or white. Also called the Kermode bear, the spirit bear lives in the delicate, rich, and threatened ecosystem of the Great Bear Rainforest in British Columbia, Canada. Jennifer’s story is about the journey of a spirit bear cub that gets lost from his mother and has to find his way back. Rachel, on email I would like to recommend Rachel Meehan’s Water’s Edge and Power’s Out, from the Troubled Times series, published by Cherry House publishing. I bought these books for my son who was around 13 at the time and he gobbled them up, so I took a peek and was hooked from the beginning. I’m a bit of a scaredy cat when it comes to apocalyptic, end-of-world type stuff, so I was nervous about the subject matter, but the stories are so strong, and the lead character is so gutsy, that I was quickly able to put my fears aside and just get lost in the books, the sign of a very good read. I think that these books make the threat of climate change seem very real; they are based on the implications of slow, incremental change rather than something sudden and momentous, which makes them feel that they could be set in a very near future, and that in fact some of the issues touched on in the book are already with us. All the more frightening. I am writing this recommendation as an adult reader, but I think I can say on behalf of my teenage son, with whom I have discussed the books (and he loves them), that the author has a very direct style, generates pace and tension brilliantly and raises very important issues of our time, in a way that is highly readable and has a powerful impact, not just for a teenage audience but for adults too.

"In 2009, nearly half of the world’s new polio cases were in India. The disease which can cause paralysis and death is highly infectious, but by January last year, thanks to a concerted vaccination programme, the country had gone three years without a single case of the virus. It was officially “polio-free”. This immense achievement involved many people, including 2 million vaccinators fanning out across the vast country, but was due in no small part to the determination of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, whose resources helped make those vaccinations possible. Gates himself is now betting on eradicating polio entirely from the world by 2018 – and who would bet against him? The polio story is one of countless other seemingly intractable global problems that the Gates Foundation has set its collective mind and resources to solving – HIV, malaria, sanitation, education, agriculture. All are in Gates’ sights. So why would the Guardian launch a climate change campaign aimed at one of the world’s most valuable and far-sighted organisations? The answer is, precisely because of that far-sightedness. Since mid-March, the Guardian’s Keep it in the Ground campaign, in partnership with 350.org, has been calling on the Gates foundation (and also the Wellcome Trust, another global medical charity) to divest its $43.5bn (£28bn) endowment from fossil fuel assets. That would mean moving $1.4bn from oil, coal and gas stocks into alternatives. The logic is simple, these companies are committed to prospecting for more fossil fuels at a time when proven reserves are already far greater than we can afford to safely burn. We chose to call on the Gates Foundation (which incidentally also funds the Guardian’s global development coverage) precisely because they are one of the good guys. They certainly understand the nature of the climate threat. In their annual letter in January, Bill and Melinda Gates wrote:  “The long-term threat [of climate change] is so serious that the world needs to move much more aggressively – right now – to develop energy sources that are cheaper, can deliver on demand, and emit zero carbon dioxide.” We agree. And we’re asking Bill Gates for leadership on a global problem where leaders are in short supply. That’s where this video comes in. The Keep it in the Ground campaign is a collection of over 190,000 voices from over 170 countries. When we asked those supporters to make a personal message to Bill, the result was an impassioned plea for leadership from around the world. If the Gates Foundation were to divest, it would send a powerful signal to fossil fuel companies and to governments that business as usual is not acceptable. It would also have a huge snowball effect on other organisations currently considering whether to move their own money. In short it would be real climate leadership. Will you lead us Bill?

"The warnings from our most respected scientists are loud and clear and their findings are irrefutable. Science demands that average global temperature rises must stay below 2C if we are to avoid catastrophic climate change. The world cannot wait until 2050, 2040 or even 2030 to act. The World Bank’s sobering report, Turn Down the Heat, told us in 2013 that without serious policy changes the world will warm by an average of 4C by the end of the century. Professor Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, Angela Merkel’s adviser, concludes, “the difference between [2C and 4C] is human civilisation”, and Professor James Hansen warns that even a 2C rise will cause “major dislocations for civilisation”. Every year through subsides UK citizens give £2.5bn in taxes to the oil, gas and coal industries The fossil fuel industry is condemning us to climate disaster: increasing frequency of severe weather events, natural disasters and loss of land due to rising sea levels. “Business as usual” means a 4C warmer world according to the World Bank and PricewaterhouseCoopers – and a 6C warmer world according to the International Energy Agency (IEA) if coal use continues on its current trajectory. We need to stop business as usual and keep fossil fuels in the ground. To prevent climate disaster we must restructure the world’s energy usage. Fossil fuel extraction and use needs to cease, and we must end the estimated $550bn in annual subsidies and embark upon a renewable energy revolution now. Taxpayers around the world are indirectly paying corporations to destroy our planet. Scientists at the Potsdam Institute conclude that if we are to stay below 2C of warming then only 565 more gigatons of carbon dioxide can be emitted by 2050. Fossil fuel corporations have reserves that if burnt would result in 2,795 gigatons of carbon dioxide emissions. This is five times more than the safe amount. We are all hoping that the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference Of Parties in Paris (COP21) in December will deliver the globally binding agreement that is required but I am concerned that there is a serious disconnect between what governments have been negotiating since the COPs began and what the science requires to keep temperatures under a 2C rise.  We need a comprehensive, just and legally binding climate agreement, the transfer of technology to developing countries, adequate adaptation, mitigation and implementation mechanisms, and a forestry agreement with safeguards for communities and indigenous peoples’ rights. According to the 2014 United Nations Environment Programme (Unep) Emissions Gap Report, even if the most ambitious current pledges from countries to cut emissions are honoured, we will still be emitting more than four times the yearly carbon budget for the atmosphere. Many communities are already on the frontlines fighting a losing battle to protect nature, while politicians procrastinate and fail to bring adequate commitments and solutions to the table. In the UN climate negotiations, leaders of the developed world have been seeking to ensure the best “deal” for their narrow national interests, and collectively they have failed to deliver and have lost sight of the reason we so urgently need bold and concrete action. While the world impatiently awaits COP21, our irrational model of development continues unabated. Oil exploration, mining, large-scale agriculture, megadams and logging are causing irreversible environmental destruction and are violating the fundamental rights of communities, indigenous people and individuals.  I have witnessed the environmental devastation that fossil fuel extraction causes. Between 1971 and 1992 in Ecuador, Texaco carved 350 oil wells and dumped approximately 16bn gallons of oil-contaminated water into unlined pits. I saw residents afflicted with leukaemia, women who had experienced spontaneous abortions, and children suffering from skin diseases as a consequence of direct exposure to these toxic waters. What I have seen is just the tip of the iceberg. You may remember the 11m gallons of oil spilled in Alaska in 1989 from the supertanker Exxon-Valdez which devastated one of the most beautiful places in the world, BP’s Deepwater Horizon disaster of 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico where 11 people were killed and 210m gallons were spilled, Shell’s decades of operations in Ogoniland, Nigeria that leak oil and pollute water sources with benzene, and the widespread environmental damage from the Tar Sands in Canada… I could go on and on. We need to keep fossil fuels in the ground and embark upon radical reforms to our model of development, encompassing principles of justice, respect for human rights, good governance, accountability, and environmental protection. Climate change is the overriding moral imperative of our time. It is not just an environmental threat but also a critical human rights issue that impacts every aspect of our lives: peace, security, poverty, hunger, health, mass migration, and economics. I support The Guardian’s campaign calling for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust to divest from fossil fuels because I believe it is critical that we Keep it in the Ground and instead invest in renewable energy. Bill and Melinda Gates and Jeremy Farrar of the Wellcome Trust have a responsibility to avoid catastrophic climate change. I urge them to divest from fossil fuels. Our fate, the fate of our children, grandchildren and future generations is in their hands.  I appeal not only to these two institutions but also to all influential people in charge of charities, universities, religious institutions, pension and financial institutions to divest. The moment has come for you to make a stand."
"Extreme heatwaves and heavy rain storms are already happening with increasing regularity worldwide because of manmade climate change, according to new research. Global warming over the last century means heat extremes that previously only occurred once every 1,000 days are happening four to five times more often, the study published in Nature Climate Change said.  It found that one in five extreme rain events experienced globally are a result of the 0.85C global rise in temperatre since the Industrial Revolution, as power plants, factories and cars continue to pump out greenhouse gas emissions. “A lot of us and our colleagues were surprised by how high these numbers are already now in the present day climate,” said Dr Erich Markus Fischer from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. What represents an extreme day varies depending on the background climate. In the south-east of England, for example, temperatures used to reach 33.2C once every 1,000 days, but are now happening as much as once every 200 days. Future warming will bring a more volatile, dangerous world, even if the world manages to keep temperature rises within a 2C limit to which governments have committed, Fischer’s research found. On average, any given place on Earth will experience 60% more extreme rain events and 27 extremely hot days.  Numbers of extreme weather events spiral even higher at a rise of 3C, a level of warming that the world is on track to exceed with current levels of manmade global greenhouse gas emissions. Drawing links between specific weather events and climate change can erode the sense that climate change is something that will happen in the future, rather than causing havoc in the present. But the science, called attribution, has proved complicated. Peter Stott, a scientist at the UK’s Met Office Hadley Centre, said the new study was an important step in attribution science.  “What has been lacking up to now is a robust calculation of how much more likely extreme temperatures and rainfall have become worldwide.” The study shows warming of the atmosphere increases the number of times temperatures reach extreme levels and evaporates more water from the oceans. It is from this hotter, wetter background that extreme weather events emerge. Longer events, such as heat waves and prolonged rainy periods, will also occur more often. “When we talk about 15-day precipitation or 15-day heat waves rather than one-day cases, one very robust finding is the longer the period the higher the fraction that is attributable to warming,” said Fischer. The study also found that the effects of warming will vary around the world. Weather events at the equator will become more extreme with 2C of warming, meaning tropical countries already dealing with frail infrastructure and poverty will experience more than 50 times as many extremely hot days and 2.5 times as many rainy ones.  But some already dry regions including the parts of the Mediterranean, North Africa, Chile, the Middle East and Australia will experience less heavy rain days.  “In the UK, for a one-in-a-thousand day, which is one in three years, we would probably be well adapted to that,” said Stott. “But I think we’ve shown that we are vulnerable to more extreme situations – those that happen once in a century. For example the wet winter we had in 2013-14. Or indeed the heatwave we had back in 2003 when many vulnerable, eldery people died. But in the tropics, in parts of the developing world, they are extremely vulnerable to one-in-three year events.” Saleemul Huq, a Bangladeshi scientist who has been involved in the UN climate negotiations, said the developing world was already struggling to cope with extreme events. “The increased probability of high rainfall events will enhance the adverse impacts of these events in many parts of the world, particularly for vulnerable communities. For example short bursts of intense rainfall in Dhaka already cause huge traffic jams and misery for its citizens,” he said."
"President Barack Obama used an unusually picturesque appearance at Everglades National Park on Wednesday to draw attention to an ugly problem that he said was threatening the well-being of people in south Florida and around the world: climate change. The president appeared in rolled-up shirt sleeves at a lectern above an obscenely green sawgrass marsh to send a message that “climate change can no longer be denied” and “action can no longer be delayed”. “In places like this, folks don’t have time, we don’t have time, you don’t have time to deny the effects of climate change,” Obama said. “Folks are already busy dealing with it.” The White House arranged the event to mark Earth Day, the annual celebration of the planet begun in 1970. The Everglades is a 1.5m-acre estuary in southern Florida that boasts hundreds of unique species and serves as an essential buffer and filter between inland freshwater stores and the salt waters of the Gulf Stream and ocean beyond. The sea level is estimated to have risen a foot in south-east Florida since 1870, and is projected to come up another 9in to 2ft in the next 45 years, according to the Washington-based World Resources Institute. The drinking water of up to one-third of Floridians is threatened by encroaching seawater in the Everglades, according to White House figures. “If we take action now, we can do something about it,” Obama said. “This is not some impossible problem that we cannot solve. We can solve it.” In making its environmental pitch in Florida, the White House failed to find a local partner in Governor Rick Scott, a climate change skeptic. Scott was invited to meet Obama on the tarmac as the president arrived, but he declined, deputy press secretary Eric Schultz said.  Obama took a dig at Republicans in Congress who refuse to acknowledge climate change, including Senator Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, who earlier this year brought a snowball to the Senate floor to illustrate how cold it was outside. “2014 was the planet’s warmest year on record,” Obama said. “Fourteen of the 15 hottest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century. Yes, this winter was cold in parts of our country, including Washington. Some people in Washington helpfully used a snowball to illustrate that fact. But around the world, in the aggregate, it was the warmest winter ever recorded.” Doug Young, president of the South Florida Audubon Society and a member of the Broward County climate change taskforce, welcomed Obama’s visit, saying the White House had worked with the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact to educate people on the issue. “President Obama is very aware of the problems south Florida faces as a result of the effects of climate change including sea level rise,” Young said in an email to the Guardian. Obama called for $25m in national park restoration and asked Congress to fund conservation accounts. In a conference call with reporters Tuesday, Christy Goldfuss, managing director of the White House council on environmental equality, said the Obama administration had invested more than $2.2bn to protect the Everglades. Air Force One would have consumed an estimated 9,180 gallons of fuel to make the 1,836-mile round trip to the Everglades, however, CBS News reported. Reflecting on the magnificent view behind him, Obama said he hoped one day that his grandchildren might enjoy it – a day in the distant future, he stipulated. “I don’t just want Malia and Sasha to enjoy this amazing view,” Obama said. “I want my grandchildren – a way, way long time from now – to enjoy this amazing view. “It’s an incredible bounty that’s been given to us. But we’ve got to be good stewards for it. We’ve got to take care of it.”"
"Tomorrow, on 22 April, members of the Welsh assembly will have the opportunity to vote for a moratorium on opencast coal mining in Wales. With the existing moratorium on fracking and the demise of the deep coalmining industry, this means that Wales has the possibility of opening a new chapter in its history. It means that Wales could become the first country in the world with substantial fossil fuel reserves to put them beyond use. It’s a moment of global and intergenerational significance, because Wales was the source of much of the coal that fuelled the industrial revolution. Fossil fuels have huge political and psychological significance in Wales.  At a time when the world is crying out for leadership, this is something within the gift of assembly members. In decades and centuries to come, when their children and grandchildren, and their grandchildren, are living in a world changed by climate change, they will owe these legislators a debt of gratitude. Their stance will mean that the world they inherit is so much better than it might have been. It could begin a worldwide movement of countries embracing a new, clean future free of the shackles of fossil fuels. This is their chance. Their chance to make the name of their country – Wales – echo through the centuries.Naomi Klein Author, Bill McKibben Founder, 350.org, Nnimmo Bassey Former chair, Friends of the Earth International, Desmond D’Sa Winner of the Goldman Prize 2014, Ricardo Navarro Winner of the Goldman Prize 1995 , Gareth Clubb Director, Friends of the Earth Cymru, Richard Dixon Director, Friends of the Earth Scotland James Orr Director, Friends of the Earth Northern Ireland, Oisin Coghlan Director, Friends of the Earth Ireland, Andy Atkins Chief executive, Friends of the Earth England Wales Northern Ireland, Richard Solly Coordinator, London Mining Network, Kuba Gogolewski Energy expert, Bankwatch Network, Irena Rogowska President, Development Yes, Opencast No  • On 20 November 2012 the Guardian reported that 1,200 new coal-fired power stations were being planned around the world, including 455 in India, and 363 in China. Little wonder, because on 19 June 2009 you recorded that both countries had two centuries of coal reserves. So, no surprise that on 31 October 2014 you described India’s “dash for coal”, with new prime minister Narendra Modi promising electricity to 400 million within five years. Yet last week, from the comfort of the US, Al Gore called providing the poor with coal-generated electricity “cynical” (Stand up to the fossil fuel fightback – cheap coal is a lie, 17 April). It looks positively different in India. Which is why on 29 October 2012 you observed a “resurgence”, a “renaissance”, a “bonanza”, in coal, with consumption up 8.4% in developing countries. That will continue, not just through new power plants, but because, as you reported on 28 July 2014, “the largest coalmine in Australia” is being developed to export coal to India for the next 60 years. Now the Guardian calls on the world to “keep it in the ground”. That may seem sensible in the west. But China and India, both striving to develop their economies rapidly, aren’t going to forgo such a cheap and accessible energy resource. Similarly, the Guardian supports divestment of energy company shares. That might work on the west’s stock exchanges, but in Asia they run their economies differently. It is time for the Guardian to take off its western blinkers and see fossil fuels as others see them. It will not be pleasant. Coal is driving the world to a climate catastrophe. But it is no use the Guardian preaching renunciation. You would do a better service to humankind by advising the world how to prepare for and adapt to the extreme changes that are certain to hit soon.Jack WinklerEmeritus professor of nutrition policy, London Metropolitan University • While Felix Salmon (Keep it in the ground: Why this is a matter of basic ethics, 13 April) concludes that your campaign remains valid despite concerns about its “idealism”, he struggles to make the investment case for divestment. For many of the investors we represent, the moral case would be justification enough. However, is the investment argument really so strongly stacked against divestment? As managers specialising in ethical and sustainable investment, we have been directly engaged in the issues around fossil fuel investment for almost two decades. With over £700m in funds under management – a significant proportion of which is invested for charitable trusts – we have seen a gradual convergence of the moral and investment arguments in favour of divestment. Salmon notes that fossil fuel investment has not provided attractive returns relative to the market over a variety of periods and highlights this as evidence that the sector is not necessarily a home for “avaricious” investors. While not all investors are necessarily avaricious, many invested because they expected more positive financial returns than have been realised. But is it fair to say that renewables cannot provide the same level of financial returns as the oil and gas sector during “normal” periods of oil price performance? Although at a much earlier stage in its development, there are growing opportunities in renewables to benefit from the positive returns now being achieved not only by manufacturers of renewable energy equipment but also renewable energy generators. Such returns include rising levels of income. The arguments in favour of divestment should consider risk and reward as well as moral judgments. The risks of not being invested are clear: if the oil and gas sector performs well, portfolios without exposure may suffer. However, as noted, positive returns are not guaranteed at a sector level. At a company level, too, expansion into more extreme areas of production is not without risk – as was amply illustrated by BP’s Gulf of Mexico disaster. Should drilling in the Arctic be considered less risky than generating power from wind or solar energy? For investors such as charitable foundations with very long-term time horizons, being late could be just as inexcusable as being early. So perhaps for some investors this is an example of when doing the right thing morally is also the right thing financially.John DavidHead of Rathbone Greenbank Investments • Your article (World Bank ‘increased finance for fossil fuels’, 18 April) was misleading. Here are the facts. World Bank Group fossil fuel financing fell from $2.2bn in 2013 to $1.3bn in 2014 – around a third of which went to relatively low-carbon natural gas projects. There has been zero World Bank Group financing for greenfield coal power for the past four years and that trend is likely to continue. Our financing for renewable energy projects (which includes solar, wind, large- and small-scale hydro, geothermal, and biomass) more than doubled from $1.6bn to $3.59bn from 2013 to 2014. Two-thirds of this energy financing was used to provide affordable and sustainable energy for some of the world’s poorest people in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia – home to most of the 1.2 billion people without access to energy. The Oil Change International (OCI) report upon which your article was based, apparently without question, uses a flawed methodology for classifying energy projects that is neither recognised by industry nor by the World Bank Group. OCI categorises as fossil fuel financing all hydropower projects, whether small or large, as well as all electricity grid and transmission projects. Our support for grid upgrading and transmission projects is designed to improve the efficiency of developing country power systems and help deliver a range of sources of energy – including renewables. These projects, for example, help expand access to energy to the two out of three Africans who currently have no electricity.Anita Marangoly GeorgeSenior director, energy and extractives global practice, World Bank • The Guardian must be congratulated on its informative climate change articles. But what about the rest of the paper? Why devote a whole page to California’s drought (In parched California, there’s still plenty of water for nut trees – and for Nestlé’s bottles, 20 April) without questioning why this is happening? California depends on melting snow from the Sierra Nevadas for much of its water in summer and autumn. This year the snowpack is at its lowest ever recorded, and they had the driest winter ever recorded. Wouldn’t this have been worth mentioning?Maureen EvershedDorridge, West Midlands"

"I just received a notice that made me laugh. The Heartland Institute, one of the groups responsible for misleading the public about climate change, sent out a notice about an upcoming Papal event. The event itself sounds great, it is a workshop on April 28th to address global warming. I have written about the bold action taken by Pope Francis; he is clearly a leader amongst the faith community on this topic which is already having large societal and human health impacts. At the upcoming events, world leaders in science, business, and religion will congregate to work toward solutions to help protect the most vulnerable.  Of course, this is all bad news for those who are trying to sweep the problem of climate change under the rug. That brings us to the Heartland Institute. They are asking their members and readers to tell the Pope that climate change is not a crisis. In an email I received, it is stated that Heartland will be bringing “real scientists to Rome” to dissuade the Pope from taking climate change seriously.  So, who are these “real” scientists that can show us climate change either isn’t happening or isn’t serious? Well, if you’ve followed climate change research over the past few years, you will have noticed that the number of scientists who share Heartland’s view is dwindling fast. The few remaining scientists either aren’t climate scientists at all or their work has been revealed as faulty. Feel free to click on the Heartland list of “experts”. There you will find “experts” such as Steve Goreham, an electrical engineer who wrote a nonsense book on climate change that was filled with factual errors and misinterpretations, as I discussed here. Another so-called “expert” is S. Akasofu who has written an article on climate change that was soundly debunked here.  There are other so-called experts include people such as Paul Chesser who works at the National Legal and Policy Center, Sterling Brunett who is an advisor for the conservative organization ALEC, Marc Morano who spent years working for Rush Limbaugh and was an advisor and speech writer for Senator Inhofe, and James Taylor, who reportedly has degrees in government and law. Perhaps the best known scientist among their list is the famous Willie Soon, who has been in the news lately for working on climate change without properly disclosing funding.  So which of these “experts” will Heartland be sending to Rome to instruct the Pope? I daresay the Pontifical Academy of Sciences is quite capable of serving as a resource to the Pope. They are quite clear in their understanding of the threat of climate change. Their conclusions are backed by scientists and science organizations from around the world.  I teach at a Catholic University. As a professor at such an institution, I am proud that the Pope is living a Catholic mission of caring for those who are being impacted by climate change. It is clear that people of faith around the globe are taking more seriously the impact today’s actions have on future generations. It is hard to imagine a motivation more crucial than that of faith to help us move to rational and just solutions to this common problem. For further perspective, my colleague Dr. Bernard Brady, Professor and Chair of the Theology Department at the University of St. Thomas said,  The sideshow envisioned by these organizations will not detract from the deep concern that Pope Francis has for the truth and how it relates to the environment. The Pope will take the findings of science seriously (see for example the 2011 report from the Pontifical Academy of Sciences), but he will not be calling for policies that “shut down virtually all economic activity around the world.” He is not the “alarmist” that other alarmists may think he is. He will, however, strike some alarms.  He is committed to uplifting the poor and protecting future generations. These are, of course, basic responsibilities of anyone who calls him or herself a Christian. Yet, the problems arising from climate change exacerbate these challenges. He will most likely tell us that we must address climate change in order to more fully uplift the poor and protect future generations. Moreover, the Pope, indeed the Catholic tradition, recognizes the earth as “a gift for which we are all indebted.” It is our “dwelling place” “entrusted to our protection and care.” We are not only “to respect nature” but “to discern in it a grammar written by the hand of God” (Lumen Fidei, # 55).  Pope Francis will probably follow his predecessor, Benedict XVI, recognizing the interrelatedness of climate change with other moral issues and calling for persons, organizations, communities, nations, and indeed the global community, to reconsider established patterns of behavior. Pope Francis is demanding but no ideologue. He will call for, as he always does, “encounter and dialogue” between people of faith and science, states and businesses, poorer nations and richer nations. I expect he will initiate new energy-use policies within Vatican City as an inspiration and symbol to the world on this issue. In June, I will be attending a conference hosted by the US Conference of Catholic Bishops in Minnesota. The conference hopes to reflect on the Catholic social tradition and obtain insights into the interrelationships between human society and natural ecology. Clearly, the Catholic Church is taking this issue very seriously. It’s doubtful the non-experts from the Heartland Institute will sidetrack him."
"Directing proceedings from a stage emblazoned with BP’s green and yellow sunburst livery, chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg appeared aglow with satisfaction at the oil-and-gas group’s shareholder meeting two weeks ago as plaudits rained in from the unlikeliest quarters. Environmentally concerned investors, led by those acting for the Church of England, were queuing up to shower Britain’s biggest fossil fuel company with praise for what they saw as the board’s “completely unprecedented” decision to endorse a resolution tabled on climate change by a coalition of activists, some of whom had links to BP’s fiercest critics. Bill McGrew, global governance manager at America’s largest pension fund Calpers, had flown to London especially. “Calpers says thank you to BP … for its leadership on this issue,” he told the meeting. Helen Wildsmith of CCLA, which manages £1.5bn of funds for the Church of England, said: “I would like to thank you for the constructive engagement we’ve had with BP … the company’s support for this resolution demonstrates both leadership and responsiveness to shareholder concerns.” But a series of Guardian interviews with activist shareholders raises uncomfortable questions about the extent to which leading campaigners collaborated with oil firms behind closed doors, leaving a misleading impression of a dramatic victory for environmentalists. When it came to the voting, the BP resolution — thanks in large part to an endorsement from the board — won near-unanimous support, backed by 98% of shares cast. The result was heralded as a famous victory.  Catherine Howarth, chief executive of ShareAction, whose members include Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, described it as “an important day for shareholder democracy”, adding: “Climate change is everybody’s business, and today proves it.” Five years earlier, ShareAction (then called FairPensions) had led an earlier activist campaign at BP and Shell, forcing climate change resolutions on to the meeting agenda. On that occasion, the resolution had been called for the companies to review their investments in Canadian oil sands. Both BP and Shell responded by advising investors to vote down the proposals. They were duly rejected, each, coincidentally, by the same margin of 94%. ShareAction played only a supporting role in this year’s resolution and a spokesman made clear it had not been involved in discussions with BP. He said the campaign group was proud of the vote, adding: “We’re glad the Guardian is asking questions that prompt all of us to consider what the next generation of investor engagement [with companies] might look like.” Investor-requisitioned ballots are a rarity. Ordinarily, resolutions at stock-market-listed companies are drafted under the authority of the board; few stray beyond the dry and uncontroversial requirements of company law – the re-election of directors, the appointment of auditors, etc – and most pass on a wave of strong support from institutional shareholders. Of those shareholder-generated resolutions that do make it on to meeting agendas, most are drafted by investors hostile to management. Typically they are advanced by financially motivated shareholders seeking to overturn board policy, or even oust directors. But, however unorthodox BP’s vote appears, it looks set to be quickly replicated next month by similar activist interventions at two other oil groups. Landslide votes are expected in the Netherlands at Shell, and in Norway at Statoil, after their respective boards announced support for climate change resolutions tabled by many of the same activists behind the BP vote and almost identical in substance. Each calls for greater disclosures from the companies about how climate change might affect their future business. Revealing Statoil’s support at the end of last week, the company told shareholders: “Statoil’s board welcomes shareholder interest in better understanding the company’s risk exposure and strategic approach to climate change … [and] recommends the general meeting to support the proposal.” But the Guardian has learned that, behind the scenes, it was in fact Statoil which first made contact with the activists, not the other way round.  Wildsmith said: “[Statoil] called us up and said: ‘We’d find it really useful to have a shareholder resolution like this [the BP resolution], can some of your co-filers quickly get themselves together and file something for us?’.” In a statement, Statoil described the conversation differently. It explained that every year it contacts shareholders it suspects might put forward resolutions. This was “to assist them on the practicalities”.  The statement added: “We did not ask for the [climate change] resolution to be filed … [and] how the board would assess the suggested resolution was not part of our dialogue [with activists].”  But Guardian interviews with activist shareholders repeatedly raised questions about the extent to which the shareholder resolutions had been contrived for presentational effect, and whether later endorsements from company boards had been stage-managed. Wildsmith, who led activist efforts that culminated in the BP resolution, told the Guardian activists had received “input” from BP while they were drafting the resolution wording. The campaigners later met with Svanberg in early December and BP had privately signalled in advance it expected to endorse the resolution, she said. Such was the strong agreement between BP and activists on the eventual wording of the resolution, Wildsmith recalled, that an option to drop plans for a vote – instead allowing BP to quietly adopt the agreed measures – was discussed, but rejected. In a statement, BP said: “While there was consultation and engagement before filing, BP did not influence the wording of the resolution, the decision to file was that of the shareholders alone and BP took no decision on whether to support the resolution until after it had been formally and properly filed and carefully considered.” The BP resolution had been filed in January and the company announced the board had decided to endorse it on 5 February — well in advance of the shareholder meeting which took place 12 days ago. Days earlier, Shell had announced that its board was backing a near-identical resolution. Shell declined to answer questions about its dealings with activists. A spokesman said: “Shell has extensive ongoing engagements with investors.”  Wildsmith told the Guardian: “It took two months to write the BP shareholder resolution. Every word has been carefully crafted. We had input from the company … We listened very carefully and thought about what they [BP] were saying.” From the outset, Wildsmith had made clear that the activist coalition she had been building since 2011 wished to create a “new normal” for shareholder resolutions. Proposals from the group were to be deliberately drafted with a reasonable hope of winning board endorsement, in contrast to the traditionally hostile resolutions previously tabled by activists. This new approach was described as “stretching but supportive” of the board. But the climate change resolutions have been accused by some of requiring very little new of BP, Shell and Statoil. One commentary from Reuters’s investment blog Breakingviews argued: “Demands are hardly taxing, so a refusal [by the board] might look defensive.” It added: “The information [demanded in the resolution] will give investors a way to measure progress, but is otherwise pretty benign for now. It’s not as if the coalition is trying to force the company to suddenly change how it does business.” Another source, who was involved in activist efforts, admitted the resolution was “woolly”, with much hinging on how it was interpreted by the companies. A second long-standing shareholder activist not involved in the coalition, told the Guardian the proposals asked companies “to do something that was not particularly stretching and that many companies were already doing”. Ian Greenwood, of the West Yorkshire pension fund, who acted as deputy to Wildsmith on the BP resolution, said it marked “a change in the way [shareholders] do engagement” with companies. “This demonstrates that if you work with the company over a period of years … you can come to something which is actually beneficial to them, and they can demonstrate to the markets they’re doing something that major institutional shareholders think is the right thing to do.” Describing the activists’ private meeting with Svanberg, Wildsmith said: “We met with the chairman of BP right at the beginning of December. Everybody talked about the fact they were going to take it [the resolution] in the spirit intended — which was a big hint that they were going to support it, but obviously they needed to go through board meetings … It’s certainly fair to say that we took away a strong clue; it’s not fair to say everyone shook hands on a deal.” According to Wildsmith, such was BP’s support for the proposal in early December that there was a even talk of ditching the resolution and simply allowing BP to adopt the climate change disclosure commitments without further investor involvement. “We did have that discussion: do we just put the resolution in the filing cabinet now and say it’s done its work? We all decided we needed this moment [at the shareholder meeting] where you get to vote for it. “Resolutions help amplify the voice of the long-term investor because the short-term signals in the marketplace are so strong. Having this vote … stays there on the books, year after year, reminding everybody that us – the providers of capital – are really interested in how this company manages itself through this complex, multi-decade, low-carbon transition to everybody’s benefit.” Wildsmith said she was aware tactics used by her coalition risked being criticised by some investors for being “overly inventive” but nevertheless argued “supportive resolutions” were emerging as a valuable new tool for long-term investors. “We’re trying to do something different here. We’re trying to create a new sort of shareholder resolution – a ‘board-supported shareholder resolution’ … It’s almost everybody saying: ‘The long-term matters here.’”"
"Australia should aim to slash its greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2025, compared with 2000 levels, in order to catch up to other countries’ efforts and prove it is a “good global citizen”, according to a Climate Change Authority review. The CCA, an independent statutory agency that advises the government, also recommended that Australia ramp up its emissions cuts even further by 2030, within a target range of 40% and 60%, again based on 2000 levels. The report restates the authority’s position that Australia should raise its immediate emissions reduction target from 5% by 2020 to 19% by the same year, warning that in the absence of stronger action “the task of achieving credible 2020 and subsequent targets will become progressively more challenging.” The Australian government has issued a discussion paper on what the country’s post-2020 emissions target should be, ahead of crunch UN climate talks in Paris in December. The US has already committed to a 26-28% cut in emissions below 2005 levels by 2025, while the European Union has a goal of a 40% cut on 1990 levels by 2030. China has agreed to peak its carbon output by around 2030, while the UK, Russia and Germany have all also submitted new targets. Australia, by comparison, has missed a UN deadline to reveal its post-2020 emissions target and has faced questions from China, the US and Brazil over the effectiveness of its Direct Action policy, which replaced the carbon pricing system, scrapped by the Coalition last year. The CCA report notes that while Australia contributes only 1.3% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, its fossil fuel-heavy economy is the largest per capita emitter in the industrialised world and that its efforts “should be comparable with those of other wealthy developed countries and free of any special pleading.” The report adds that it is in Australia’s interests to keep to an internationally agreed goal of limiting warming to 2C above pre-industrial times, noting that if this limit is breached, the Great Barrier Reef will be greatly diminished, the number of heatwaves will soar and southern Australia could face an 18% drop in spring rainfall by 2090. Bernie Fraser, chairman of the CCA, said that if the 30% target was adopted, Australia would still be an “outlier” in terms of high per capita emissions but it would gain credibility at the Paris talks. “This would likely be considered the behaviour of a good global citizen, and go some way to answering those who have questioned Australia’s commitment to climate change policy in recent times,” he said. “It would also give Australia the right to expect other countries to behave in like fashion.” However, Fraser said that Australia will have to work hard to catch up with other countries and that failure to beef up the current climate policy – which several experts doubt will achieve the 5% goal – will make it “pretty challenging” for the country to meet a 30% reduction target by 2025. “We are starting behind others in this race and the others aren’t slowing down,” he said. “The US and others are planning to increase the pace of their gallop. “If Australia were to put together an effective package of measures, we could get to the 30% target.” The CCA has previously raised doubts over whether Direct Action, which pays businesses that wish to reduce their emissions, will ensure the 2020 target is met but Fraser said it may be enough due to “slackness” in the economy, which pushes down energy consumption. It remains to be seen how closely the government will ponder the CCA’s recommendations, given that it tried and failed to scrap the advisory body. “We haven’t got a very good strike rate,” Fraser said. “We did recommend a rather more ambitious target than the minus 5%, but that didn’t get much of a run. “We recommended that the large scale renewable energy target scheme remain at 41,000 gigawatt hours and that didn’t get much favour. So that’s two strikes and we’ve stepped up to the plate for a third time. Let’s see what happens this time.” The CCA will produce further reports on the costs and methods of achieving its recommended emissions reduction."
"Shell warned on Thursdaythat further jobs and investment are at risk in the North Sea as it slashed annual global spending by a further $2bn (£1.3bn) and reported a 56% slump in first-quarter profits. The Anglo-Dutch oil group also said there would be no slowdown in its controversial plans to start drilling in the Alaskan Arctic this summer where it hopes to discover large-scale oil reserves alongside evidence of gas found in the past.  Shell accepted the Guardian’s Keep it in the Ground Campaign had raised the profile of climate change but said it believed divestment from fossil fuel companies could be counter-productive. Simon Henry, the chief financial officer, said the planned takeover of rival BG could be a “springboard” for further cutbacks, adding that Shell “is not necessarily a natural owner of assets in the North Sea but there are other companies who may well have more expertise” given the age of those energy fields.  Shell cut 250 jobs from its UK offshore base at Aberdeen last summer and signalled others could go as the oil company announced a further reduction in its overall global spending from $35bn to around $33bn this year. Henry said positive North Sea tax changes by the government and the establishment of a new Oil and Gas Authority had only gone so far. “[Ministers] have to move quickly to make it attractive – at the moment its not.” Hit by a massive fall in oil prices since last summer, Shell’s first-quarter earnings, excluding one-time items, fell from $7.33bn to $3.25bn.  Profits for the first three months of 2015 at Shell’s exploration and production arm plunged from $5.7bn a year to $675m. However, profits from downstream operations - which include refining and other non-production businesses - rose from $1.58bn to $2.65bn . That increase helped group earnings exceed analysts’ average forecast of $2.42bn. Shell’s key international rival, Exxon Mobil, also unveiled a big downturn. Its first quarter earnings slumped46% slump to just under $5bn. That was also ahead of Wall Street expectations, because refining margins benefited from lower input costs - but they were still the weakest figures since 2009. A second US oil group, ConocoPhillips, performed even worse plunging to a $222m underlying loss.  Exxon chief executive, Rex Tillerson, told an industry conference last week that low oil prices are “going to be with us for a while.” Shell’s chief executive Ben van Beurden said: “Our results reflect the strength of our integrated business activities against a backdrop of lower oil prices. In what is clearly a difficult industry environment, we continue to take steps to further improve competitive performance by redoubling our efforts to drive a sharper focus on the bottom line in Shell.  The Shell boss said the business had sold assets worth more than $2bn so far this year “as we successfully reduced our onshore footprint in Nigeria.”  He said Shell was cutting costs and capital spending; and expected to make further savings by “deferring and reshaping new projects.” The items excluded from Shell’s earnings included a gain of $1.4bn from selling operations and a credit of $600m resulting from tax cuts on North Sea operations announced in the budget. BP’s first-quarter results beat City forecasts on Tuesday due to strong downstream business and because it accounted for the full expected benefit of the North Sea tax cuts. Like Shell, BP’s exploration and production business suffered a profit slump caused by the collapse in the oil price. Shell said it would be slowing investment in US shale, Canadian oil sands and Iraq to conserve cash but was determined to press ahead with its plans to take a 25-vessel “armada” to drill in the Chukchi Sea off Alaska in the coming months. Henry said climate change was a “very serious issue” and had noted the divestment push in the Guardian’s Keep it in the Ground campaign. It was up to shareholders whether they bought or sold Shell stock, he said. There was a danger that new investors, he argued, may be less interested in a” grown up dialogue” about global warming. “I’m not sure it’s an improvement in transparency or corporate governance or a proper discussion around the impact of climate change.”"

"The future has a long history in art. Romantic painters loved to picture what the great buildings of their time would look like as ruins. The architect Sir John Soane commissioned the artist Joseph Gandy to paint Soane’s masterpiece the Bank of England not as it looked when spanking new, but as the grand vision of decay it would one day become. Soane’s apocalyptic fantasy of his own building was probably influenced by the French painter Hubert Robert, who in 1796 pictured the Louvre as a roofless ruin overgrown with weeds. The art of Pablo Genovés resurrects and restages such visions of architectural catastrophe. In his series Precipitados, this contemporary Spanish photographer creates grand European interiors – opera houses, libraries, baroque palaces – in which floods of water or seas of sand push against bookcases, inundate staircases, crash into wrought-iron gates.  In one picture, Genovés imagines the sea surging into the Louvre’s Grande Galerie – a direct quotation of Hubert Robert’s sublime dreams. It is his passion for European architecture that makes this horror picture show so distinctive. The power of these photomontages is in the collision of timeless cultural grandeur with overwhelming natural destruction. The imagery is haunting: books and art, memory and history are all about to be lost. There is, of course, one great difference between earlier artistic impressions of the end of civilisation and these contemporary cataclysms. Today, the end of the world as we know is not a romantic fantasy, but a potential reality. Overwhelming scientific evidence minutely charts human-caused climate change. Sombre analyses carefully map the likely consequences of melting ice caps and rising sea levels on a precise timeline. We can’t look at these surreal images as playful acts of imagination; they are reasonable predictions. These nightmares have already been seen, not as art but as news. Hurricane Katrina caused scenes as strange and monstrous as those by Genovés. When part of New Orleans lay underwater a decade ago, photographers did not need any special effects to find apocalyptic images of inundation. Hurricane Sandy afforded similarly stupendous images of devastation on the east coast of the US. The west of England also became a diluvial waterscape in February 2014. Genovés creates haunting visions of apocalypse with the enthusiasm of a consummate catastrophist. But every day the flood becomes less mythic; every day, the evidence grows to make these monstrous images more prosaic. The elemental death of civilisation was once a dark theme for imaginative artists. Today, it is a pressing and all too real emergency that our imaginations struggle to comprehend."
"Invest in renewable energy, protect indigenous land rights, plant drought-tolerant crops, build strong and sturdy housing – the list of ways to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change goes on, but what are the best ways to communicate them? For climate campaigns, the difficulty often lies in representing the full global scale of the issue without appearing too emotive or dramatic. Conversely, those only featuring a small part of the picture can be accused of being too simplistic.  The 2009 film, Lessons of the Loess Plateau, looked at the large-scale environmental restoration project undertaken in northern China. The documentary shows how the stark and dusty wasteland was transformed into a luscious agricultural landscape. Pragmatic and results-focused communications are compelling – the film shows the huge potential of environmental restoration – but with such a complex issue, perhaps a variety of approaches should be used. So what are the most effective ways to present climate solutions? Is it time to change the language used in climate campaigns? What is the role of social media and what innovative tactics are out there? Join an expert panel on Thursday 30th April, 1–3pm BST, to discuss these questions and more.

"Soas University of London has become the first university in the capital and the third in the UK to commit to pulling its investments out of fossil fuels, in what campaigners called a historic decision. On Friday, the institution announced it would divest the £1.5m of its £32m endowment held in oil and gas companies over the next three years to show leadership on climate change. The university has no investments in coal.  The decision rules out future investments in fossil fuels and was approved by the school’s governing body, following an 18-month campaign involving more than 1,000 students and staff. On Monday, 63 Soas staff wrote to the university’s management, backing divestment.  Professor Paul Webley, Director of Soas, said: “Soas is proud to become the first university in London to divest and we hope more universities will follow suit. Divestment from fossil fuels will enable Soas to fulfil its responsibilities as an ethical investor, while continuing to ensure that the school’s investments deliver a financial return.” The university becomes the third in the UK to commit to fossil fuel divestment – following Glasgow and Bedfordshire – as part of a fast-growing global movement. In the US, Syracuse university and the New School in New York are divesting, while Stanford is moving out of coal. More than 220 institutions have now made commitments, including faith organisations, pension funds, philanthropic foundations and local authorities.  Julia Christian, a campaigner Fossil Free Soas, said: “We are so proud to be Soas students, staff and alumni today. The fossil fuel industry is a thing of the past. This is a historic decision, part of a shifting tide away from fossil fuels that is happening across the world as we speak.” Andrew Taylor, campaigns manger at People & Planet, which supports university divestment campaigns across the UK, said: “If you are interested in studying environmental or social justice issues at a university that definitely won’t be investing your fees in wrecking the climate, then Soas must now be one of the top places to do it. Universities that continue to say no to divestment are eroding their legitimacy to teach about sustainability.” In March, the Guardian launched a campaign calling on the world’s two largest charitable foundations to divest from fossil fuels. It asks the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust to move their money out of the top 200 fossil fuel companies and to immediately freeze any new investments. More than 187,000 people have signed the petition. The Guardian Media Group has since announced it will divest from oil, coal and gas companies. Scientific research shows that in order to meet international targets to avoid catastrophic levels of climate change, the majority of proven fossil fuel reserves must remain in the ground. In October, Mark Carney, governor at the Bank of England, warned that “the vast majority of reserves are unburnable”, lending weight to the theory that fossil fuel assets could become worthless and create a trillion dollar risk to the global economy."
"Barack Obama is expected on Wednesday to visit Everglades national park in southern Florida, where administration officials say concerns about changing temperatures and rising sea levels offer the perfect backdrop for the administration to raise an alarm about climate change on Earth Day 2015. Even before the president embarked on the trip, however, the White House found itself answering questions about how it looks politically for Obama to stage a major presidential appearance on environmental issues in the backyard of two potentially strong Republican presidential candidates who have expressed skepticism about climate change. The sense of a building political skirmish was stoked by a pre-emptive attack against the president’s visit by Florida’s Republican governor, Rick Scott, himself a climate change skeptic. Scott released a statement on Tuesday criticizing Obama for failing to “live up to his commitment on the Everglades and find a way to fund the $58m in backlog funding Everglades national park hasn’t received from the federal government”. White House spokesman Josh Earnest sharply objected to Scott’s attack in a conference call with reporters late Tuesday, noting repeatedly that Scott’s office had reportedly banned state employees from using the phrase “climate change” in educational material and other official documents. “The president’s commitment to the Everglades, and fighting climate change, is one that stacks up very well against Governor Scott, particularly when you consider that Governor Scott has outlawed employees of the state of Florida from even uttering the words climate change,” Earnest said. “So it’s a little rich for somebody who’s made that declaration, to suggest that somehow the president has not been sufficiently committed [to fighting climate change].” The skirmish between the president and Scott played out against the broader political backdrop of the 2016 presidential race, in which the former Florida governor Jeb Bush and current Florida senator Marco Rubio are expected to vie for the Republican nomination. Bush said he thought climate change may be real but then claimed wrongly that there is a disagreement in the scientific community about the issue. Rubio has sought to punt on the issue by saying he is not a scientist. Rubio has announced a 2016 presidential bid, while Bush, the brother of George Bush and son of George HW Bush, has built a robust network of donors and advisers, and is expected to announce a bid later this spring. The Everglades, a 1.5m-acre estuary of delicate and shifting ecological equilibrium, has been uniquely affected by climate change. The loss of inland fresh water to rising temperatures has allowed more salt water to move in, while rising sea levels have further injected seawater into breeding grounds and other areas that produce the national park’s unique flora and fauna. The encroaching saltwater has also threatened the state’s drinking water supply. Obama was expected to visit areas of the Everglades where increasing concentrations of salt water had killed the park’s iconic grass and changing temperatures had altered the growth patterns of the park’s mangroves trees, the White House said. It will be Obama’s first visit as president to the national park. The president’s trip was meant to “highlight the value of special and vulnerable places like the Everglades”, said Christy Goldfuss, managing director of the White House council on environmental equality. She said the Obama administration had invested more than $2.2bn to protect the Everglades, and on the occasion of Earth Day would release a new report showing that every $1 of federal money invested in the national park system returned $10 to the US economy in the form of tourism and other benefits. “The Everglades is one of the country’s most unique landscapes and climate change is putting this treasured ecosystem at risk,” Goldfuss said. “This is really ground zero. Rising sea levels lead to shoreline erosion and increased flooding, and as the seas rise, salty ocean water travels inland and threatens the primary source of drinking water for more than a third of Floridians.”  “My expectations are not great – actually [I have] no expectations for funding America’s Everglades projects as part of Everglades Restoration,” said Doug Young, president of the south Florida Audubon Society and a member of the Broward County climate change task force. “But I think it is fantastic that on the 45th anniversary of Earth Day, President Obama is visiting the Everglades and talking about climate change and sea level rise. I would like to think that this is partly due to the Rick Scott and Marco Rubio climate change denial.” In addition to hosting one of the country’s most fragile and celebrated conservation areas, Florida hosts one of the most unpredictable electorates. Victory in the state by a Republican or by a Democratic candidate such as Hillary Clinton, whose campaign is making climate change a central issue, could mean the difference in the race for the White House. But in the call with reporters Tuesday, the White House pushed back against the notion that the president’s descent on Florida had a political edge. “This is not an effort necessarily to go to anybody’s home state,” Earnest said. “This is an effort to raise this debate. And the truth is that those Republicans that choose to deny the reality of climate change, they do that to the detriment of people they’re elected to represent.”"
"Silicon Valley start-ups are proud of their fast-paced culture and being first movers in creating new product categories and markets. UN climate change summits are the opposite: they sit and discuss the risks of being first movers by transforming our energy systems to reduce emissions and protect our planet, but only the proverbial second mouse gets the cheese. Silicon Valley treasures those who take risks, fail fast and iterate – at this year’s Paris climate change summit we need to adopt more of this approach. The stance developing nations often take at international climate negotiations is that the rich got rich burning coal and oil, so why should poorer countries sacrifice their economic development for the good of future generations? Better to get rich via fossil fuels now even if we roast later, the logic seems to go, despite UN envoy on climate change Mary Robinson recently making the case for developing countries skipping straight to renewable power. Meanwhile, coal companies have successfully persuaded some developing countries’ governments to buy into the notion that fossil fuels are essential to tackle energy poverty and US Republicans have long argued the US doesn’t need to tackle its polluters until developing countries cut their own emissions. But the whole debate rests on a falsehood. The reality is that acting to protect the climate does not impose a financial penalty. Being one of the first countries drastically reducing its emissions is not a disadvantage. Both developed and developing nations are moving rapidly to renewable energy sources, not because it is morally the right thing to do, but because it’s the route to prosperity. The numbers show that there is a strong first mover advantage.  South Africa is using solar and wind to meet its capacity shortfalls faster and more cheaply than new coal or nuclear facilities could. This already saved the country $69m (£63m) in 2014, created jobs and local industrial capacity. With proposed coal plants on hold because of their soaring costs, South Africa commissioned 79 renewable energy projects, totalling more than 1GW. That is roughly a nuclear power plant-sized chunk of capacity, but a new nuclear plant would take 10 years to build and cost $6 per watt according to one recent estimate. Coal, long thought of as dirt cheap, comes at $2.30 per watt. In contrast, the Chinese will be selling solar panels for $0.42 per watt this year. South Africa’s renewable capacity will hit 5.24GW within a year, up from nothing in 2012, with another 6.3GW to be commissioned in 2015. No fossil fuel technology can scale this quickly.  Across the Atlantic, Brazil’s commitment to biofuels and hydroelectricity made it independent of imported oil in 2006. Since 2009, Brazil has been adding solar and wind energy, contracting 14GW of wind power at prices below any other option. In 2014, at prices only a bit higher, Brazil also brought on almost 1GW of solar energy. As the severe drought drives Brazil’s electricity prices higher, industries eager to have access to reliable and affordable power are turning to renewables. The biggest user of energy, China, is also becoming the world’s renewable energy powerhouse. Growing its installed solar capacity by two orders of magnitude within only four years, China went from a capacity of 0.3GW in 2009 to 13GW by 2013 and is now preparing to install 17.8GW of new solar energy for 2015.  China burns a lot of coal, but its Green Horizons program has committed to clean the air in its cities and cut carbon intensity by 40 to 45% from 2005 levels within the next five years. So far in 2015, China’s coal imports already fell by 42% compared to 2014. As hundreds of entrepreneurs around the world bring renewable electricity to the poorest people on the planet, at prices less than they had been paying for kerosene or other fuels, the renewable power future is inevitable.  Juan Rodriquez’ company, Quetsol, sells solar electric light to thousands of Guatemalan villagers beyond the reach of the electricity grid. He bundles solar panels, light, and phone charging into a mobile money system that connects poor villagers to modern finance, empowering and enriching their lives. Practical Action, founded by the author of Small is Beautiful, E F Schumacher, has done similar work for years, enabling villagers to preserve food 10 times longer through evaporative cooling, providing irrigation and renewable energy technologies, and locally-developed finance programs. Similarly, SELCO India, a solar electric light company, is delivering a renewable future today, not as aid, but as a $3m a year business with no government subsidies. With 25 centres across India, SELCO has brought to 35,000 homes and businesses inexpensive lighting, communication technology, water pumping, water heating, refrigeration, computing and power for clinics as well as for entertainment. With the ability to light even one bulb, villagers can provide light for silk worms which are needed for silk production, looms, and moveable lights that can go from room to room as needed, providing villagers with an income.  Imagine a world in which no family needs to burn smoky dung or wood or oil lamps for light, where wireless digital communications are available to everyone, and where women and young people have illumination to become literate, and businesses have abundant, affordable power.  Imagine societies that not only save money by investing into renewable energy production, but in doing so decrease their political dependency from oil and coal rich neighbours and improve the physical health of their citizens. This is the real first mover advantage for developing countries. "

"Climate change. We learn about it in school. We see it on the news and nature shows. We’re told it’s coming and it will be irreversible if we don’t do something. But we’re young. Most of us don’t listen, do we? We’re the internet, smart phone, computer generation and most of us aren’t clued up on renewable energy or carbon footprints.  And even when we know all about them, we often don’t think they affect us. I was like that, when I was younger. And then, then I read my first environmental disaster novel - a dystopian.   The idea of a futuristic world devastated by the very things that are affecting the environment now... It was terrifying - the idea that such horror and pain and fear could come from too many cars and forgetting to turn the light off (and cows - don’t forget cows guys: they produce loads of harmful gasses... via a fart!). It was like being really scared in an incredibly vivid way, so unlike all the textbooks I read about the subject before. Yes, school teaches us a lot of things. Algebra. Science experiments. The difference between affect and effect. But when it comes to current events in the world around us, both environmental and political, does anything really beat a dystopian?Everyone should learn from the mistakes made in books - especially dystopias. If you look at the causes that lead to most dystopian societies, the catalyst is generally the destruction of the environment, or a world war or a huge nuclear explosion. All manmade problems - all things we could so easily stop.  The Fire Sermon by Francesca Haig: huge nuclear explosion that destroyed most of humanity. Same disaster for The Handmaid’s Tale by Margret Atwood led to death and sterilisation.  Mass murder and destruction (though rather unspecified) led to The Hunger Games - and really, who wants that to happen? Definitely not me, because seriously, if I was in the Hunger Games, I would definitely die...  Another unspecified disaster created the world of Divergent - and while it looks not too bad to begin with, hello Insurgent and Allegiant...  Huge environmental disasters (like solar flares and tsunamis) caused the Glades from The Maze Runner universe and I don’t know about you, but I really don’t want to get stuck in the Maze...  And in the Chaos Walking trilogy by Patrick Ness, humanity has moved to a new planet and can now hear everyone’s thoughts and is ruled by a creepy cult-like church that committed genocide and invaded other towns and... it’s not good.  The books are good - amazing - but the world... Yep, would not like to live there either... You see, there are so many scary, dark beliefs about what’s coming in the future - all of which are covered in dystopian novels. Nuclear apocalypse. Uncontrollable climate change that destroys the environment. A city full of people with pink eyelashes and blue lips (that one might be less realistic). Zombie rising (again, not so likely...).  And climate change is an issue our generation will need to deal with, not something for the distant future. We’re nearing the end of the world, people! Kidding, kidding. I hope... Seriously, though, the reason dystopia is so huge right now is because it’s just so relevant. I mean, the past is something that’s already been written, the future is the unknown factor: we don’t know what’s going to happen to our environment, if we’ll be able to change it.  And that’s where dystopia come into the equation: they look at all the scary uncertainties we’re worrying about in our time and put them into a devastated future, building a (generally terrifying and evil) society around the disaster. It’s a way of showing the seriousness of environmental conservation, while also helping teenagers and children deal with the harsh facts.  I’m sure we all know that sometimes, it’s ridiculously hard to learn from textbooks in geography lessons. It’s hard to wrap your head around all the facts and statistics and keywords about climate change. And then you read something like Breathe by Sarah Crossan or The Last Wild by Piers Torday and you just totally get it. You completely understand how serious everything is, how badly we need to do something. I mean, who wants to live in a bubble?  Who wants to live in a world where animals have vanished from all but one place? No one! We like real air and we like animals! And this, this is why we need to read dystopians. It makes climate change interesting. It makes us understand how vital environmentalism is. It makes us think. It makes us act. We need to look at all the mistakes made in books that lead to these dystopian worlds and we need to change them.  We need to do everything we can to avoid the apocalypse and we need to learn from books. Recycle. Preserve energy. Don’t set off a nuclear explosion... So now I have a challenge for teenagers and children and parents everywhere. Do something for the environment today. Buy a dystopian. Read it. Understand. Change something. Oh, and buy it as an ebook. C’mon, people. It’s Eco Week."

"Sir David Attenborough, Joanna Lumley, Lily Cole and Thom Yorke are among dozens of celebrities to have called for the re-election of the Green party’s Caroline Lucas, while avoiding any explicit endorsement of the party itself. A statement of support for Lucas has been signed by 40 prominent public figures, including the founders of Lush cosmetics, the Big Issue and Agent Provocateur, who said it was crucial that Lucas retain a presence in Westminster.  But it was made clear that the supporters, who also include the musician Billy Bragg, impressionist Rory Bremner and film director Stephen Frears, were not necessarily backing the Green party nationally, just Lucas as an individual. It reads: “Most of us are not members of the Green party, and many are not much involved in party politics. But we all feel it’s crucial that Caroline Lucas, the Green party’s sole MP at this time, should be re-elected in her Brighton constituency on 7 May. “Over the last five years, Caroline has eloquently addressed many of today’s most pressing issues – from accelerating climate change to sustainable farming, from human rights to a just and sustainable economy. This leadership matters all the more at a time when the mainstream parties are finding it so hard to address these challenges properly. “Regardless of our own political allegiance, we believe that our democracy can only be strengthened by maintaining such a strong and inspirational presence in parliament.” The environmentalist Jonathon Porritt told The Guardian it was his initiative to garner support for Lucas because he had been dismayed by the “aggressive” Labour campaign in her seat of Brighton Pavilion, a key marginal. “The Labour party seem determined to make it one of their battlegrounds, which is very weird,” he said. “And I thought there would be many people who might not wish to explicitly endorse the Greens, or indeed any party, but who felt it was healthy for our democracy to have key voices in parliament, like Caroline. People who are independent, who are trustworthy, who are respected, and who speak like human beings.” Porritt said he didn’t ask whether other Green party members might have objected to an initiative centred on an individual and not the party as a whole.  “This is a marginal seat, Caroline is one of our most talented people and of course the party should – and does – make a special effort to push the case that people should vote for her,” he said. “I could have tried to get a letter together which was generically in support of the Green party, but I doubt it would have got as many names.” Lucas said: “I’m humbled there are so many people who think I’ve done a good job in parliament. I do know that it’s not an explicit endorsement of the party. I don’t know how many of them have read the Green manifesto and many of them might find things to disagree with if they did. But I think what they want to ensure is a strong Green voice in parliament and winning Brighton Pavilion is the best chance for that.” Subtle efforts to put some distance between Lucas and the party could be connected to the unpopularity of Brighton council, which is led by the Greens. The council has been dogged by internal feuds, and residents have suffered severe disruption in waste collection as workers took strike action. The council was ranked 302nd out of 326 local authorities for its recycling credentials, despite pledging that 70% of all domestic waste would be recycled by May 2015.  The seat, which is considered a three-way marginal with Lucas holding a majority of just 1,252 votes, is 19th on Labour’s list of targets. Purna Sen, the deputy director of the Institute of Public Affairs, will contest it for Labour and the Tory candidate is Clarence Mitchell, a public relations adviser notable for his work with the family of the missing girl Madeleine McCann. The Greens’ former national chair Penny Kemp, who is now the party’s communications chief, said it had to be the party’s “No 1 priority” to get Lucas re-elected, and denied there would be any consternation from other Green candidates. “Obviously we wouldn’t want a campaign around Caroline at the expense of other Green MPs, but we haven’t got any,” she said. Bragg, who was closely associated with the Labour party during the 80s and 90s, but endorsed the Liberal Democrats in his West Dorset constituency in 2010, told the Guardian he thought having Lucas in parliament was key to having a real voice on climate change in Westminster. “Would I have signed a statement just endorsing the Greens? Probably not, though I generally support their progressive agenda,” he said.  “This entire election has been focused on growth and the economy, with no mention of climate change or the environment, and if there’s no Green MP in Westminster that will continue.” Sen said: “We can all try and attract our share of celebrity endorsements, we’ve had [mother of murdered teenager Stephen] Doreen Lawrence here and Harry Leslie Smith [the 92-year-old NHS campaigner] but what I’ve been concentrating on is speaking to voters here about the issues they care about.

"Almost half the world’s top pension funds are taking an ill-advised gamble on climate change, according to a financial thinktank. The Asset Owners Disclosure Project’s (AODP) annual index of 500 of the largest global asset owners found that 232 of them had done little or nothing to protect their investments from the financial upheavals predicted due to climate change. Financial experts, including the president of the World Bank and the governor of the Bank of England, have warned that fossil fuel assets are risky investments because their reserves of coal, oil and gas cannot be burned if the world is to avoid the most extreme impacts of climate change. A landmark report in 2013 showed that if these assets became “stranded” – suffering large-scale loss of value – it could destabilise global financial markets. Julian Poulter, the CEO of AODP, said around 50% of assets held by the funds were exposed to some kind of climate risk, but many pension funds and other foundations are ignoring that risk and “betting on business as usual”. He said these asset owners were gambling that nothing would be done to curtail the burning of fossil fuels. “They’re betting around 20-1 that either the fossil fuel company influence will last forever or that their fund managers will bail them out of a crisis – but that didn’t work too well during the last systemic crisis did it?” he said. Funds the AODP termed as “laggards” were those that received a D or X rating. These included the Wellcome Trust and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundations, both of which are the subject of a Guardian campaign requesting that they divest from fossil fuel companies. It also included some of the world’s biggest pension and sovereign wealth funds.  The index found only 1.4% of asset owners had reduced their carbon intensity from the previous year and just 2% have a target for reducing the carbon risk for next year.  UN climate chief Christiana Figueres said the index was an invaluable tool for encouraging pension fund to finance the shift toward a low carbon economy. “Pensions funds and the multi-trillion dollar assets they manage have a pivotal role to play in this transformation. [The AODP index] spotlights those funds embracing transparency and disclosure as a first critical step, alongside those pension funds who are going even further and shifting the mix of their portfolios to ever green, cleaner ones,” she said. Nine asset owners were given a AAA rating, indicating that they had a strategy to protect themselves from climate change and had engaged with companies they own shares in, divested from carbon-heavy assets or hedged against the risk. These included pension funds from the Netherlands, UK, US, Australia, Norway and Sweden. AODP and other experts believe that funds that do nothing to assess their climate risk may be breaching their responsibilities to their members. AODP and environmental law campaigners Client Earth launched a project last week that will assess whether UK pension funds are breaking the law. Ben Caldecott, the director of the stranded assets programme at Oxford University’s Smith School said recent reviews of the law, by economist John Kay and the Law Commission, clearly showed asset owners must account for fossil fuel risk. “In my view that settled it. Clearly fiduciaries can take account of these issues and actually if they don’t take account of material environment-related risks, whether it’s climate change or other factors, then they could be in breach of their fiduciary duties. So ignoring it is not an option,” he said. Kay told the Guardian that remaining invested in fossil fuels and climate-exposed companies was legal, but not assessing the risk may expose pension funds to legal challenges. “The courts will be very reluctant to challenge an honestly made business decision,” he said. “So to say ‘I know there is a very big risk to my beneficiaries and have decided to ignore it’ is problematic. But to say ‘having considered all factors I believe ‘Noxious Emissions PLC’ is an excellent investment’ is not, whether right or wrong.” A representative of Dutch pension fund PFZW, which received a AAA rating, told the Guardian that 7.5% of its assets remained high-carbon and that it maintained fossil fuel investments because they judged it was best for their customers’ portfolios."

"Can fossil fuel companies be transformed into allies in the fight against climate change?  As unlikely as it might seem, a coalition of environmental groups and investors is trying to persuade coal, oil and gas companies to turn away from carbon-polluting sources of energy and invest in low-carbon alternatives.  Ceres, a Boston-based network of investors, companies and nonprofits, and Carbon Tracker, a London-based nonprofit that has popularized the notion of a “carbon bubble,” have organized a new campaign around carbon asset risks.  The campaign aims to get fossil fuel companies first to disclose the risks created by their dependence on carbon-intensive assets, and then, as Ceres puts it, “ensure they are using shareholder capital prudently” in a world that takes “the economic threat of climate change seriously”. Not today’s world, needless to say, but a world that the groups fervently hope will arrive in the not too distant future. The campaign released a letter on Friday from more than 50 global investors, who manage $2tn in assets, calling on the US Securities and Exchange Commission to improve oil and gas companies’ disclosure of climate risks. Climate risks, including the possibility of reduced demand and lower prices for oil, could affect the industry’s profitability and valuations. Particularly if companies find themselves owning “stranded assets” – oil or gas reserves that lose value in a carbon-constrained world.  In 2010, the SEC issued what Ceres then described as ground-breaking guidance that clarified what publicly-traded companies need to disclose to investors in terms of climate-related risks. Since then, according to Ceres, “there has been a lack of meaningful, substantive carbon asset risk disclosure”. So much for ground-breaking. In the new letter, Ceres and its investor allies ask the SEC to get serious about carbon risk disclosure, citing what they call inadequate disclosures from ExxonMobil, Chevron and Canadian Natural Resources as evidence that the agency needs to put some muscle behind its guidance. While this will no doubt keep lawyers busy, the strategy raises a number of questions, chiefly: what’s the theory of change, what’s the likelihood of success and what, ultimately, would success look like? To seek answers, the Guardian spoke with Shanna Cleveland, a Ceres senior manager who works on the Carbon Asset Risk Initiative. If the SEC can be persuaded to enforce its rules, Cleveland said, oil companies will be required to talk publicly about how reduced demand for petroleum, persistently low or even moderate oil prices for oil, and regulation or taxation of carbon emissions would affect their business.  “Right now, companies are not publicly disclosing, in many cases, the assumptions their capital planning is based on,” Cleveland said. “It may be that some just can’t imagine a world in which we don’t get back to $90 a barrel oil.” Oil prices are now in the $55-$60 per barrel range. Over time, the argument goes, better disclosure of climate risks will change the behavior of investors, boards of directors and industry executives, particularly when they make crucial decisions about long term capital investments. Global capital expenditures for oil and gas exploration and production projects are expected to be about $571bn in 2015, according to Cowen and Co’s annual study of 476 oil and gas companies’ capex budgets published in the Oil and Gas Journal. “Investors need to know which fossil fuel companies face the greatest risks in a climate-constrained world,” Cleveland says. “More importantly, if a company actually does the analysis and sees what its vulnerability is, its board of directors should be moved to either consider a new strategy, or understand whether the company is on a trajectory to survive in a carbon-constrained world.” Cleveland is realistic about the limits of this approach. “It’s unlikely that we would convert ExxonMobil into a solar company,” she says. “What we could see is significant reduction in the amount of capital that’s being plowed into these high-cost, high-risk reserves, and a shift of that capital into, at worst, natural gas and, at best, meaningful investment into other energy technologies.”  If ExxonMobil could be persuaded to shift even 5-10% of its capital investments away from high-risk fossil fuel projects and towards low-carbon options, that would matter. ExxonMobil has said its capital spending will be about $34bn this year. There is some precedent for such hopes. When climate regulation loomed during the 2000s, fossil fuel companies invested in renewable energy. From 2000-2010, US oil and gas companies invested roughly $9bn in renewable technologies such as wind, solar, and biofuels – roughly one-fifth of the total US investment in renewables over the same period, according to Pembina, an environmental nonprofit. But Shell and BP, among others, have sold wind and solar units since then, as the political climate shifted. Waiting for the SEC to push the industry will require patience; the agency isn’t known for its speed. Dodd-Frank financial reforms enacted in 2010 required public companies to disclose the ratio between the pay of their chief executives and the pay of their median workers. The rule was left to the SEC to enforce, and five years later it has yet to be put into effect. Nor has the fossil fuel industry been much affected by past shareholder resolutions about climate change from Ceres and its allies. Leslie Samuelrich, president of Green Century Capital Management, a socially responsible investment firm that is divesting from fossil fuel companies, said recently: “There have been no significant direct reductions in the production of fossil fuels achieved through shareholder advocacy over the last two decades – and there are none on the horizon.” Unlike the insider-oriented disclosure and engagement strategy, divestment creates the potential to build a grassroots political movement to support climate action. Samuelrich puts it bluntly: “Why trust dirty energy companies to lead a clean economy?” Of course, Ceres isn’t trusting the energy companies. It’s pushing them, and it’s not alone. A recent analysis by Goldman Sachs found that nearly $1tn worth of future oil and gas projects would not be profitable if oil prices remain below $70 a barrel. The oil companies aren’t likely be swayed by environmentalists, but they just might listen to their bankers. The values-led business hub is funded by SC Johnson.

"A Seattle office building that generates its own electricity, collects its own water and composts all human waste from its restrooms earlier this month won the designation as an ultra-sustainable ‘living building’.  To get certified by what is widely viewed as the world’s most demanding green building certification program, the $32.5m six-story Bullitt Center had to pass a year-long examination of its environmental merits to prove it performs as advertised.   Now comes the hard part: convincing skeptics of the financial benefits of constructing more ‘deep green’ buildings like it.  The nonprofit Bullitt Foundation, which built and owns the office building and is headquartered on the top floor, hopes to convince hesitant developers, institutions and governments to invest in similar structures. This may take considerably longer than it took to get certified. Assigning long term value to deep green buildings is a tricky undertaking, especially because their existence is so new.  Financing has fallen through for multiple projects due in part to a dearth of historical information about comparable properties. The phenomenon of large commercial structures attaining elite Leed Platinum certification or beyond is so recent that researchers haven’t had enough time to assess their shorter term rental and resale performance, says Nils Kok, an expert on green building economics at Maastricht University in the Netherland.  For less strenuous green building projects, however, evidence is mounting that investing in more sustainable structures pays off. In a 2010 study, Kok and colleagues found that buildings that attained Leed Gold status commanded an average premium of 20%. “We do find that greener actually leads to higher premiums on both the rent side as well as the transaction side,” Kok says. As a pilot project to determine the technical feasibility of constructing and operating a nearly self-sufficient office building, the Bullitt’s upfront costs ran an estimated 27% higher than those for a comparable structure built to code. “It’s hard to make a project like the Bullitt look good over a period of just five years,” says Denis Hayes, the foundation’s president and CEO.  For universities, museums, municipalities and organizations looking to build more permanent flagship structures, however, Hayes hopes to make the case that a similar investment will provide ample benefits for decades. In 2014, for example, the Bullitt’s rooftop photovoltaic panels produced roughly 244,000 kilowatt hours of energy while the building used only 153,000 – enough surplus solar energy to power eight homes. If it’s technically possible for a commercial mid-rise in one of the nation’s cloudiest cities to become a net energy producer, Hayes points out, it’s possible nearly anywhere.  The building’s design also slashed its energy demands to less than 40% of a comparable LEED Platinum building and less than 60% of a typical net zero energy building. Based on its better than anticipated energy-saving numbers, a new financial report suggests that the Bullitt could have included fewer solar panels and a smaller steel superstructure and still met its sustainability goals. Other economic calculations have proven more controversial. In 2014, a separate case study commissioned by the Bullitt Foundation and performed by Ecotrust, a Portland-based conservation organization, calculated that six of the Bullitt’s features – from energy efficiency to rainwater capture – could produce as much as $18.45m in public benefits. Some of the numbers rely on hotly debated values, such as a maximum price of $200 per metric ton of carbon emissions averted, and the overall benefits will accrue over 250 years. But Hayes says linking a building’s carbon footprint to economic consequences could help change the initial calculus for bankers and developers.  Kok says he appreciates the attempt to quantify the benefits, but he maintains that some of the hypothetical values – particularly the price of carbon – are unlikely to sway the financial sector. “Can you bank on that? Can you underwrite it? I think it’s very challenging,” he says. Once built, however, Kok says deep green buildings are becoming prized in much the same way that Tesla’s expensive Model S electric car is highly coveted by auto buyers. “These are the new trophy buildings,” he says.  In a separate study, he and colleagues found that law and financial firms, governments and oil and gas companies are among the tenants most likely to lease office space in what’s considered prime real estate. “They want to be in those buildings so badly that they pay a premium rent,” he says. A large law firm renting space in Washington, DC’s Leed Platinum-certified PNC Place, which opened in 2010, even used its new location as a recruiting tool. The presence of high quality tenants, in turn, can reduce the perception of risk and drive up resale values. In October 2014, PNC Place set a new record for the city when the trophy building sold for $392m, or $1,075 per square foot. At the very least, conversations about the value of deep green structures are moving into the mainstream, says Ralph DiNola, executive director of the New Buildings Institute in Vancouver, Washington. By his nonprofit organization’s count, the number of verified zero net energy commercial buildings nearly doubled between 2012 and 2015, while the number of buildings deemed capable of eventually reaching that goal nearly quadrupled. DiNola says accumulating evidence also suggests that well-executed deep green designs can minimize or eliminate additional upfront costs, potentially neutralizing financial concerns. Gary Saulson, director of corporate real estate for Pittsburgh-based PNC Bank, says the new Tower at PNC Plaza, which is slated to open in September, will become the greenest skyscraper in the world – without appreciably adding to the overall construction costs. Unlike the smaller Bullitt, the 33-story tower cannot attain net-zero energy status with existing technology. Nevertheless, a glass ‘double-skin’ facade and a solar chimney will enhance the natural ventilation while other built-in efficiencies could lower water and energy consumption levels by 77% and 50%, respectively. “We think by building the greenest high-rise in the world, we’re really helping to put Pittsburgh further on the map,” Saulson says. “We really hope that we’re able to put a stake in the ground, and then have someone take it to the next step.” This series on bold bets is funded by The B Team.

"Less than two decades ago, Japan positioned itself in the vanguard of the global fight against climate change when it helped broker the Kyoto protocol. Now, though, it is Fukushima, not Kyoto, that has come to define Japan’s energy policy, and with potentially grim consequences for its already stalled attempts to reduce CO2 emissions.  It was telling that in the same week as a court blocked the restart of two nuclear reactors on the Japan Sea coast – citing concerns over their vulnerability to a major earthquake – the government released emissions data showing just how far Japan has regressed since the more hopeful days of the Kyoto summit in 1997. Environment ministry data showed that Japan’s CO2 emissions rose to the second-highest level on record in the year to March 2014. Local media reports said that Japan, the world’s fifth-largest greenhouse gas emitter, aims to reduce CO2 emissions by about 20% from 2013 levels by 2030 – a much lower target than other major developed economies. In earlier climate talks it pledged a more ambitious reduction of 25% by 2020 from 1990 levels. The new targets, if as unambitious as reported, are expected to draw criticism when Japan and other G7 countries meet in Germany in June, and at the UN climate conference in Paris in November. “The Fukushima disaster had a huge impact on Japan’s emissions reduction target, practically and politically,” said Tetsunari Iida, director of the Institute for Sustainable Energy Policies in Tokyo. As Britain and other countries push for more ambitions reductions, Japan has been accused of reneging on its climate change commitments as it ramps up fossil-fuel use, with plans to build more coal-fired plants in the absence of the nuclear option. All of Japan’s 48 working reactors went offline after Fukushima, and attempts by the pro-nuclear prime minister, Shinzō Abe, to push for restarts risk being held up by months, perhaps years, by legal wrangling. “The Abe administration is very close to big industry and the power monopolies and they have very low ambitions in terms of climate change policy,” Iida said. “I expect that the new mid-term target, which has to be announced by the time the G7 meets, will be rather low.” The March 2011 Fukushima disaster shattered the public’s faith in the “safety myth” surrounding nuclear energy, which once accounted for almost 30% of Japan’s energy needs, with plans to raise its share to about half with the construction of more reactors. Keith Henry, an analyst and founder of Asia Strategy, a government policy consultancy in Tokyo, said sensible discussion of CO2 emissions was being lost amid a highly emotive debate over the future of nuclear power post-Fukushima. “Depending on which side you believe, nuclear power is the saviour that will return Japan to a stable, secure energy supply and reduce its balance of payments deficit, or will be the potential source of another nuclear meltdown,” Henry said. “The threat of a nuclear meltdown overrides concerns about an increase in CO2 emissions.” Before an earthquake and tsunami sent three of Fukushima Daiichi’s six reactors into meltdown, nuclear was at the core of Japan’s emissions strategy. But the turning of the popular tide against nuclear has sent policymakers back to the drawing board, and risks leaving Japan’s climate change efforts in tatters. With all of its reactors idle, Japan has been forced to import record quantities of expensive coal and liquefied natural gas (LNG) that have dramatically increased CO2 emissions and, the business community says, are putting the country’s economic recovery at risk. Climate change campaigners have accused Abe and his allies of talking up nuclear power to avoid confronting hard choices about its future energy mix. “The government is using this as an opportunity to make excuses not to do more about CO2 reductions,” said Hisayo Takada, climate and energy campaigner at Greenpeace Japan. “If it did everything possible to tackle climate change, then things would eventually change for the better. But instead, it is hanging on to the old ways of thinking, and barely gives any thought to renewables and energy efficiency. “Is it right to keep spending money on something that is old and has no future, or to invest in something new and watch it grow? The answer to that is obvious.” The industry lobby, too, is pushing to switch idled nuclear reactors back on, despite opinion polls showing that most voters oppose restarts. As long as they hold out hope for even a limited role for nuclear, the impetus for serious investment in renewables will be lost, said Aileen Smith of Green Action. “The utilities are saving grid space for nuclear, which effectively blocks suppliers of renewable energy. In turn, that dampens investment in renewables because investors can’t be sure which way the wind is blowing politically,” said Smith. “It’s clear that far from being good for climate change, nuclear power is actually contributing to higher emissions of global warning gases.” Paul J Scalise, a senior research fellow at the University of Duisburg-Essen in Germany, said the nuclear shutdown and higher dependence on coal and LNG “doesn’t help Japan’s CO2 targets in any way at all. But you have to bear in mind that climate change is a secondary issue for the power utilities. They want nuclear reactors back online for financial reasons.” Scalise, an expert on Japanese energy policy, added: “Japan is stuck in a trade-off between economic efficiency and environmental friendliness, and currently there is no political answer to that. In that sense, Japan is right there with everyone else in having this problem.” Abe’s enthusiasm for reactor restarts is proof that Japan’s “nuclear village” of politicians, utilities and regulators is re-establishing its influence more than four years after Fukushima. But amid public opposition to nuclear restarts and resistance to the extra investment needed to promote renewables, industry’s priority now is ramping up the use of fossil fuels. “The strongest opposition to a major policy shift towards renewables is coming from industry,” said Mika Ohbayashi, director of the Japan Renewable Energy Foundation in Tokyo. “Since Fukushima, the utilities have faced huge difficulties because they can no longer use nuclear, so that they’re losing an important asset. They want to protect their coal use because in the future, nuclear capacity could fluctuate depending on the political situation. “They know that Japan won’t be able to switch all of its nuclear reactors back on, and that means coal is their main concern now.”"
"Students at the University of Western Australia are calling on the vice-chancellor to reject $4m in federal government funding for a controversial research centre. The university announced this month the establishment of the Australia Consensus Centre, which will commission economists to “generate evidence and rational arguments” that will “result in the adoption of smarter, more cost-effective policies”.  Bjørn Lomborg, director of the Copenhagen Consensus Centre think-tank, will play a key role in the research. The Danish author has been internationally criticised for his research, which many believe plays down the effects of climate change. The UWA Student Guild described Lomborg as a “climate contrarian”, and said the $4m in “politically motivated” funding should be rejected. “While Dr Lomborg doesn’t refute climate change itself, many students question why the centre’s projects should be led by someone with a controversial track-record,” guild president Lizzy O’Shea said. “Students, staff and alumni alike are outraged.” The National Tertiary Education Union questioned the Commonwealth funding, saying there appeared to have been no competitive process. Union president Jeannie Rea said the cash “seems to have arisen from discussions between UWA, the government and departmental officials”. Comment is being sought from UWA vice-chancellor Paul Johnson. "

"A group of energy and finance analysts has given companies targeted by the divestment movement – Chevron, ExxonMobil, BP and others – a blueprint for extricating themselves from fossil fuels. Four years ago, a report by the Carbon Tracker Initiative sparked the worldwide movement to persuade colleges, philanthropists and pension funds to divest from the fossil fuel companies. But will the CTI’s new report work? Are these companies even interested?  A lot has changed in four years. The US coal sector, hit by tighter emissions regulations and declining exports to China, is on the ropes. The price of oil has fallen from a high of $115 a barrel last June to $60 a barrel today. Institutions that divested from coal and other fossil fuels before the dive accidentally found themselves occupying both the moral high ground and the bullish side of the market.  Last December, Britain’s climate change secretary said that companies should be required to disclose any large investments in fossil fuels to their investors and this March, the Bank of England warned insurance companies to stay away from fossil fuel investments.  According to CTI’s report, a fossil fuel company trying to prepare for the future – specifically, the future laid out in the International Energy Agency (IEA)’s 2C Scenario – would move away from expensive, high-risk investments in areas like tar sands, ultra-deep water drilling and the Arctic, and focus on diversifying its business models.  It would make new investments in oil and gas only if this fitted in to a future that assumed a lowered demand for its products. It would prepare not just for run-of-the-mill fluctuations in supply and demand, but for “black swan” events, like a sudden move to cap global emissions.  All of this would go against standard practice – historically, oil and gas companies have diversified their portfolios when energy prices have been high, not low.  And so far, investigating climate risk has led to few changes. This January, Shell agreed to test whether its current business model is compatible with the 2C Scenario – while at the same time announcing plans to resume drilling for oil in the Arctic.  A year ago, ExxonMobil agreed, for the first time ever, to study the risks that stranded assets – assets that suddenly lose their value – held to its business model, but then reached the following conclusion: “We are confident that none of our hydrocarbon reserves are now or will become ‘stranded’. We believe producing these assets is essential to meeting growing energy demand worldwide, and in preventing consumers – especially those in the least developed and most vulnerable economies – from themselves becoming stranded in the global pursuit of higher living standards and greater economic opportunity.”  Still, as Rob Schuwerk, the US senior counsel for the Carbon Tracker Initiative put it in an interview yesterday: “We’re dealing with a rather exceptional problem with climate change. And also one where the consequences fall so heavily on a particular sector.”  This reaction on the part of energy companies is not surprising. What remains to be seen is the report’s effect on its other intended audience: investors and regulators. The experience of the Rockefeller family with ExxonMobil suggests that shareholders will have an uphill battle, but Shuwerk has particular interest in ways that rulemaking can pressure companies to plan ahead.  “We’re starting to see regulators take note of the problem,” he says. “Under the interpretation of existing regulations companies should be disclosing more. Companies need to respond to address the risks.” "

"Academics at the University of Western Australia have asked the university to break its agreement with the Abbott government to establish a $13m “consensus centre” with Danish climate change contrarian Bjørn Lomborg. Guardian Australia understands the demand, made by Professor Sarah Dunlop, head of the school of animal biology, and James O’Shea, branch president of the National Tertiary Education Union, was met by “riotous applause” at a staff meeting at the university’s business school on Friday. About 50 staff were turned away from the meeting because of a lack of space in the 150-seat lecture theatre, with one university staffer commenting, “it’s like a Rolling Stones concert in there”. Tensions among staff and students at UWA have been building since Guardian Australia revealed the university had accepted $4m from the Abbott government to set up the Australian Consensus Centre, a copy of Lomborg’s controversial Copenhagen Consensus Centre.  The UWA Academic Staff Association called the meeting with the vice chancellor, Professor Paul Johnson, to address significant concerns among the university’s 4,000 academics that the centre would tarnish its reputation. Those who attended the packed meeting told the waiting media they were critical of Johnson’s response to those concerns, saying he did not accept suggestions the funding was politically motivated and did not think the university’s international reputation would be damaged. Dr Eric Feinblatt, an honorary research fellow with the department of engineering, said as he left the meeting the centre “would not happen anywhere but Australia”. “The only reason it’s happening in Australia is because the policy of the Abbott government makes it a favourable environment,” he said. “This is just a proxy for the Abbott government. And for the administration of the university not to admit that, to deny that, is ridiculous.” Fairfax Media has reported the push for the centre came from within the prime minister’s office. Tony Abbott is a known fan of Lomborg’s work, having praised it in his 2009 memoir Battlelines. Lomborg is best known for his 2002 book The Skeptical Environmentalist, which was the subject of complaints to the Danish Committee of Scientific Dishonesty. In 2009 he was named one of Business Insider’s top 10 most respected global warming sceptics. Feinblatt said the university was hiding behind the methodology of the centre, which is essentially one of cost-benefit analysis. “That’s not a methodology, that’s economics 101,” he said. “What this person is doing is pushing an agenda that the World Bank has pushed, that all sorts of failed development projects have pushed, for the last 50 years. “And they want us to buy into this because they say it’s a cost-benefit analysis? That’s nothing. That’s nothing.” Staff say Paul Flatau, the director of the Centre for Social Impact at the UWA business school and a key negotiator with the Abbott government in establishing the Australian Consensus Centre, told the meeting he should have consulted more broadly before signing the agreement. But speaking to the media after the meeting, Johnson said it was standard practice for decisions like the establishment of a new research centre to be made without consulting the university senate, and there was nothing untoward in this case.  “Paul said he felt that there hadn’t been the degree of discussion that should have taken place,” Johnson said. “My understanding is the dean of the business school did discuss this with the leadership group of the business school. However, it is fairly common that we don’t take forward research proposals, grant proposals, for broad discussion.” Johnson said the university would listen to the views of staff but would not abandon its plans for the consensus centre. “The university has signed a contract with the government,” he said. Johnson said Lomborg had been offered an adjunct role at the university and would not be a member of academic staff, but would be on the Australian Consensus Centre’s advisory board. They are currently hiring a director and the centre is expected to be up and running in the second half of the year. Asked whether Lomborg’s involvement was necessary for the centre to go ahead, Johnson said it was, “predicated on having a working relationship with the Copenhagen Consensus Centre but he is president of that centre, so I would say yes”. He said the response from staff and students had been “passionate” but added “one of the things that we should always avoid in universities is being forced by pressure to resile from our commitment to academic freedom”. Lizzy O’Shea, president of the UWA student guild, attended both the staff meeting and a meeting on Monday where Johnson addressed the student body. She said both meetings were “quite tense”. O’Shea told Guardian Australia students were concerned the association with Lomborg would diminish the value of their degree, and staff were reporting it had already damaged their relationships with research partners and donors. “No one disputes the aims of the centre … but there is no way that they will be happy with having Lomborg involved,” she said. O’Shea said she had been contacted by a number of alumni who were considering pulling regular donations in light of Lomborg’s appointment.  “You sort of think, when the amount of donations to be withdrawn exceeds $4m, do you pull out?” she said. “If I was the VC I would be concerned about year 12 leavers who are picking their uni around this time of year. If you’re looking to do a degree in climate science, do you come to UWA now?”"
"The cornerstone of President Barack Obama’s plan to address climate change is still months away from being finished, but it is already facing a high-stakes legal challenge from critics who want to halt the process in its tracks. A federal appeals court hears arguments on Thursday in two cases challenging the Environmental Protection Agency’s far-reaching proposal to cut Earth-warming pollution from the country’s coal-fired power plants. The lawsuits – one from a coalition of 15 states and another brought by Ohio-based Murray Energy Corp, the nation’s largest privately held coalmining company – are part of a growing political attack from opponents who say the move is illegal and will kill jobs, cripple demand for coal and drive up electricity prices. At issue is whether the EPA has legal authority for its plan under the Clean Air Act. But the agency and environmental advocacy groups have urged the court to throw the cases out as premature, saying legal challenges must wait until the EPA issues a final rule this summer. Opponents concede it is not typical for a court to provide relief before a rule is final, but argue that states and the coal industry already face the prospect of shutting down coal plants and spending other resources in anticipation of the rule. All three judges on the panel hearing the case were appointed by Republican presidents. The EPA rule proposed last year requires states to cut carbon emissions by 30% by 2030, giving customised targets to each state and leaving it up to them to draw up plans to meet the targets. But a backlash has been building. Last month, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, sent a letter urging the governors of all 50 states to defy the EPA by refusing to submit the compliance plans. West Virginia and other states argue that the plan is illegal because coal-fired power plants are already regulated under a separate section of the Clean Air Act. They say the law prohibits “double regulation”. The legal debate focuses on duelling provisions added by the House and Senate to the Clean Air Act in 1990. The EPA says it wins under the Senate language, but opponents argue the House version should prevail."
"Australia has been been asked to defend the credibility of its Direct Action climate change policy at the UN after several countries submitted questions to the Abbott government querying how the policy would reduce carbon emissions. The US, China and Brazil – all large emitters – have joined other countries in challenging Australia on its emissions reduction target and commitment to renewables.  The questions were submitted to the UN framework convention on climate change. Australia has not yet submitted answers to the questions but is expected to do so by the end of May. The paper also questioned whether Direct Action was enough to make up for the Coalition’s decision to axe the carbon price and whether Australia would be able to meet its commitment of cutting emissions by 5% below 2000 levels by 2020. Brazil thinks that target does not aim high enough. “Considering the low level of ambition presented until now, as well as the historical data, does Australia intend to change its unconditional target in order to increase its level of ambition?” it asked. The US has pledged to cut its emissions by up to 28% of 2005 levels by 2025. Australia has indicated it could increase targets further but only if its commitment is matched by developing countries such as India and China, arguing that Australia will be economically disadvantaged if it is forced to cut its emissions when competitors are not. “Australia further indicated that the 15% and 25% conditional targets are based on the level of international action, especially from advanced economies,” China said in its submission. “This ambition level is far below the requirement that Australia set out for advanced economies. Please clarify the fairness of such requirements.” The European Union also asked Australia about its ability to meet more ambitious targets of a 15% or 20% cut in emissions.  Experts warn diplomatic pressure on Australia will continue to build before a major climate change forum in Paris at the end of the year.  The chief executive of the Climate Institute, John Connor, said: “The government’s climate ambition and policies are already being questioned, with a clear indication that our major trading partners do not think that we have a credible policy or pathway for achieving any significant pollution target, or that we’re playing our fair share in the global game. “It is clear from the questions being asked by China, Brazil, the US and the EU that they see Australia’s adoption of the minimum 5% reduction 2020 target as inadequate. The questions being posed of Australia indicate a high level of scepticism on the effectiveness of the government pollution policies.” More questions have been asked of Australia than of any other country, including the US. Both Labor and the Greens have rounded on the government over the questions posed by other countries on Australia’s commitment to help ensure the world does not warm beyond 2C, compared with pre-industrial times. “All the scientists warn of catastrophic consequences for scenarios above two degrees, yet Tony Abbott seems to have casually decided he knows better and dropped that long-held bipartisan commitment,” said Mark Butler, Labor’s environment spokesman. “Today’s reports are likely to be just the beginning of our partners’ and neighbours’ concerns about Australia’s climate action while Tony Abbott continues his determination to do nothing.” The Greens leader, Christine Milne, said it was no surprise the rest of the world was “appalled” by the Australian government’s stance on climate change action. “Australia may stand alone and humiliated, but even worse is that Tony Abbott’s global warming policy protects the profits of the big polluters now at the expense of a safe climate for our children and grandchildren,” she said.  “It is intergenerational theft on an obscene scale.”"
"A US activist group that has received funding from energy companies and the foundation controlled by conservative activist Charles Koch is trying to persuade the Vatican that “there is no global warming crisis” ahead of an environmental statement by Pope Francis this summer that is expected to call for strong action to combat climate change.  The Heartland Institute, a Chicago-based conservative thinktank that seeks to discredit established science on climate change, said it was sending a team of climate scientists to Rome “to inform Pope Francis of the truth about climate science”. “Though Pope Francis’s heart is surely in the right place, he would do his flock and the world a disservice by putting his moral authority behind the United Nations’ unscientific agenda on the climate,” Joseph Bast, Heartland’s president, said in a statement. Jim Lakely, a Heartland spokesman, said the thinktank was “working on” securing a meeting with the Vatican. “I think Catholics should examine the evidence for themselves, and understand that the Holy Father is an authority on spiritual matters, not scientific ones,” he said.  A 2013 survey of thousands of peer-reviewed papers in scientific journals found that 97.1% agreed that climate change is caused by human activity. The lobbying push underlines the sensitivity surrounding Pope Francis’s highly anticipated encyclical on the environment, whose aim will be to frame the climate change issue as a moral imperative.  While it is not yet clear exactly what the encyclical will say, Pope Francis has been an outspoken advocate for action on the issue. In a speech in March, Cardinal Peter Turkson, who has played a key role in drafting the document, said Pope Francis was not attempting a “greening of the church”, but instead would emphasise that “for the Christian, to care for God’s ongoing work of creation is a duty, irrespective of the causes of climate change”. The encyclical is expected to be released in June or July, and Pope Francis is expected to use a planned address before the United Nations in September to discuss the statement. Any push by the Vatican on climate change could prove politically challenging for conservative Catholic lawmakers in the US who have denied the veracity of climate change science and fought against regulations to curb greenhouse gas emissions, including the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, John Boehner. The American Petroleum Institute, the biggest lobby group representing oil companies in Washington, declined to respond directly to questions from the Guardian about whether it was lobbying the Vatican on the issue. But - in a sign of how energy groups and those who oppose greenhouse gas regulations are framing their argument to the Vatican - it said that “fossil fuels are a a vital tool for lifting people out of poverty around the world, which is something we’re committed to”. Heartland has also targeted its argument to appeal to the pope’s views on poverty. It said in a press release that the world’s poor would “suffer horribly if reliable energy – the engine of prosperity and a better life – is made more expensive and less reliable by the decree of global planners”. The group’s trip to Rome is designed to coincide with a workshop hosted by the Pontifical Academy of Sciences on Tuesday called Protect the Earth, Dignify Humanity, which will feature speeches by Ban Ki-moon, UN secretary-general, and Columbia University economist Jeffrey Sachs. The Vatican declined to comment. The Heartland Institute says it is a non-profit organisation that seeks to promote “free-market solutions” to social and economic problems. It does not disclose its donors, but says on its website that it has received a single donation of $25,000 in 2012 from the Charles G Koch Foundation, which was for the group’s work on health care policy. Charles Koch is the billionaire co-owner of Koch Industries, an oil refining and chemicals group, and is a major donor to Republicans causes and politicians. Heartland said contributions from oil and tobacco groups have never amounted to more than 5% of its income."
"The World Bank increased its financing for fossil fuel projects in the last financial year, according to a new analysis, despite repeated calls by its president to end the global subsidies for oil, coal and gas. In a report released on Friday, Oil Change International (OCI) identified $3.4bn (£2.3bn) of loans, grants, guarantees, risk management and equity for fossil fuel-related projects in the developing world in the 2013-14 financial year. This was the highest recorded in four years and up 23% on the year before although the bank said it disagreed with lumping in both direct and indirect funding.   On Monday, the bank’s president Jim Yong Kim told the Guardian “we need to get rid of fossil fuel subsidies now”, echoing his previous comments on such “harmful” subsidies. The World Trade organisation’s definition of a subsidy is a “financial contribution by a government or any public body”, including loans and loan guarantees. Stephen Kretzmann, the executive director of OCI, said: “Bank staff are absolutely right to be concerned about fossil fuel subsidies, but they need to get their own house in order as well. They provided more than $3bn in financing for fossil fuels last year, all of which are clearly subsidies for fossil fuel production. The World Bank should lead by example, not try to hide business as usual.” A World Bank spokeswoman said: “We have seen the [OCI] report and do not agree with the way it characterises our work. Critically, the report uses a completely different way of classifying energy projects to the World Bank Group.” The spokeswoman said the bank’s own assessment showed its support for fossil fuels almost halved during 2013/14, while its financing of renewable energy rose significantly. But the bank admitted that its fossil fuel calculation did not include another tranche of funding for governance, called ‘policy and institutional development’ - part of which supports the burning of fossil fuels. “In countries that produce hydrocarbons, these need to be considered as part of the overall energy strategy. In countries where natural gas is available, the development of this resource often provides a critical alternative to coal-fired power generation,” said the spokeswoman, who added that gas was a “clean flexible fuel”. The bank did not provide an estimate of how much it had put towards the fossil fuel industry through this type of funding. Sasanka Thilakasiri, who advises Oxfam International on economic justice issues, said:“If the World Bank is suggesting that they are investing in fossil fuels via loop holes, this flies in the face of the good things they have been saying in moving towards a low-carbon economy. The World Bank needs to close this loop hole.” “Any sort of lending from public institutions, including the World Bank, is a subsidy,” said BankWatch campaigns director Petr Hlobil, who monitors global financing of fossil fuels. “This is the hypocrisy within the institution.”   The World Bank’s data for 2013-14 shows its fossil fuel funding fell to $1.3bn. At the same time its policy and institutional support more than trebled to $1.6bn. OCI said a $19.8m project in Ghana for “oil and gas capacity building” and one in Mozambique that provided $24.2m to improve the management of coal, oil and gas extraction were examples of finance that could be categorised as policy funding, but facilitated the burning of more fossil fuels. In addition, OCI said it was its view that projects to build transmission lines to carry fossil fuel-generated electricity still constituted support for fossil fuels.  “A lot of World Bank support goes to supporting the infrastructure around the fossil fuel industry, not just generation itself,” said Petra Kjell, environment programme manager at the Bretton Woods Project (BWP), who said the OCI report was consistent with BWP’s previous research into the bank’s patronage of the fossil fuel industry. The bank disputed the claim that financing for transmission was support for fossil fuels. “A significant proportion of bank transmission/distribution financing is used to rehabilitate and upgrade inefficient old grids – improving overall emissions,” said the spokeswoman. Kim has also been a strong advocate for a carbon price. In January at Davos he said “governments must put a price on pollution”. Financial analysts, including Mark Carney the governor of the Bank of England, have warned that a carbon price will render many fossil fuel reserves valueless. Kim himself has described the “systemic risk associated with carbon-intensive activities”.  Yet OCI found the bank had put $643m into projects that contained some element of fossil fuel exploration during 2013-14. The bank’s spokeswoman said: “In some developing countries renewable costs and lack of base load alternatives mean that fossil fuels will remain part of the energy mix. We won’t solve the climate challenge by targeting energy use in least developed countries. The focus should be on the biggest emitters.” The discovery of new reserves in developing countries traps them into an economic model that would be incompatible with a working carbon tax, said Shelagh Whitley, a research fellow at the Overseas Development Institute.  “The World Bank actively shapes energy policies in developing countries and should be backing green and low carbon energy. Instead, the direction of its financial support risks locking the poorest countries into outdated economic models powered by dirty fuels. We could end up with parallel worlds of sustainable, clean energy for the rich and dead-end polluting power for the poor,” she said."

"Increasing use of fossil fuels is disrupting Earth on an “almost unfathomable scale”, a top Vatican official has said, warning that a “full conversion” of hearts and minds is needed if global warming is to be conquered. The statement by Cardinal Peter Turkson, Pope Francis’s point man for peace and justice issues, was made at a Vatican summit on Tuesday, which focused on climate change and poverty. His call for a moral awakening of politicians and people of faith is a likely precursor to the highly anticipated encyclical on the environment, which was drafted by Turkson and which Pope Francis is expected to release in June. “In our recklessness, we are traversing some of the planet’s most fundamental natural boundaries,” warned Turkson. “And the lesson from the Garden of Eden still rings true today: pride, hubris, self-centredness are always perilous, indeed destructive. The very technology that has brought great reward is now poised to bring great ruin.”  Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary-general who delivered the keynote address at the summit, said he believed the pope’s encyclical – coupled with the pontiff’s planned speeches before the UN general assembly and a joint session of the US Congress – would have a profound impact on climate change negotiations. “[The encyclical] will convey to the world that protecting our environment is an urgent moral imperative and a sacred duty for all people of faith and people of conscience,” Ban said. While he declined to comment on any details of the encyclical following his morning meeting with the Argentinean pontiff – the document has already been written and is being translated – he said he was counting on the pope’s “moral voice and moral leadership” to help accelerate talks. Pope Francis’s September address will be the first time any pope has spoken before a special session of the general assembly.  Both Turkson and Ban emphasised that scientists and people of faith were united in their call for action. “Science and religion are not at odds on climate change. Indeed, they are fully aligned. Together, we must clearly communicate that the science of climate change is deep, sound and not in doubt,” Ban said. Turkson called on leaders of all faiths to be good role models. “Think of the positive message it would send for churches, mosques, synagogues, and temples all over the world to become carbon neutral,” he said. “At a time like this, the world is looking to faith leaders for guidance. This is why Pope Francis has chosen to issue an encyclical on protecting the environment at this unique moment in time.” The Protect the Earth, Dignify Humanity meeting has brought about a rare meeting of minds between scientists and religious officials on climate change, even if they frame their arguments in different ways. Teresa Berger, a professor at the Yale Divinity School, said she believed the encyclical would have an overarching theological vision – one of “a God-sustained universe, anchored in a theology of creation as articulated in the biblical witness. And based on this, Pope Francis will probably not mince words, but note as evil, for example, the sin of exploiting the Earth.” Francis has already said he believes global warming is mostly manmade and that a Christian who does not protect God’s creation “is a Christian who does not care about the work of God”. He has also linked environmental exploitation to social and economic inequality, saying: “An economic system centred on the god of money needs to plunder nature to sustain the frenetic rhythm of consumption that is inherent to it.” Activists hope the summit and the encyclical will influence the next round of international negotiations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which will take place in Paris in November. The pope, whose foray into diplomacy helped spur negotiations between the US and Cuba, is expected to address the topic in a speech before the UN in New York in September. Some conservatives in the US, where the Republican party has fiercely resisted attempts to regulate greenhouse gases and questioned the scientific consensus on global warming, have criticised the pope for getting involved in the issue. “Francis sullies his office by using demagogic formulations to bully the populace into reflexive climate action with no more substantive guide than theologised propaganda,” Maureen Mullarkey wrote in First Things, a conservative journal. Another conservative group, the Heartland Institute, which seeks to discredit established science on global warming, held its own meeting in Rome on Monday – and will hold a second on Tuesday – in which officials derided the pope for taking on the issue. “You demean the office that you hold and you demean the church whom it is your sworn duty to protect and defend and advance,” said Lord Christopher Monckton, a prominent climate sceptic and former policy adviser to the former British prime minister, Margaret Thatcher. Monckton’s opinions have been refuted by scientists, who have called his statements “very misleading” and “profoundly wrong”. The summit at the Vatican has been organised by the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, and its stated goal is to help “elevate the importance of the moral dimensions of protecting the environment in advance of the papal encyclical and to build a global movement to deal with climate change and sustainable development”."

"Lord Lawson’s lobby group for so-called climate change sceptics launched an attempt to create a fake controversy about the evidence for rising global temperatures as countries negotiate a new international agreement to cut greenhouse gas emissions. In a press release on Sunday aimed at its cheerleaders in the UK media, the Global Warming Policy Foundation claimed that it was undertaking “a major inquiry into the integrity of the official global surface temperature records”.  It follows allegations by sceptic bloggers that meteorological organisations around the world, including the UK Met Office, have exaggerated the amount of global warming shown in the record of global average surface temperature. The accusations of data tampering relate to the process of “homogenisation” through which the measurements of some weather stations are corrected to take account of inconsistencies caused by factors such as changes in instrumentation. However, scientists point out that many of changes due to homogenisation tend to reduce the amount of warming shown in weather station records. Nasa, the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Met Office, and a few other organisations around the world compile an independent record of global temperature based on the data from the network of weather stations around the world. The World Meteorological Organisation monitors how homogenisation is applied to correct the global temperature record. The move by Lord Lawson’s foundation was widely expected because it casts doubt on the scientific evidence for global warming ahead of the United Nations climate change summit in Paris at the end of this year. In the runup to the UN climate change summit in Copenhagen in 2009, sceptics spread misleading accounts about the contents of emails that had been illegally hacked from the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia. Lawson officially launched his foundation just a few days after sceptics started to disseminate the hacked emails, and cited concerns about the global temperature record in an article published in the Times to publicise his new organisation. Among the false accusations made against the University of East Anglia was a claim scientists had distorted the record of global average temperature. Several independent inquiries concluded that there had been no malpractice, although the scientists were criticised for the way they responded to an aggressive campaign by sceptics to undermine their professional reputations. This is just the latest attempt by climate change sceptics to damage confidence in the global temperature record, which shows about 0.85C of warming since the start of the late 19th century, according to the latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). In 2011 sceptics welcomed the Berkeley Earth Science Temperature project, partly funded by the Charles Koch’s foundation, because it promised to address “the five major concerns that global warming sceptics had identified” in the temperature record. A prominent ‘sceptic’ blogger, Anthony Watts, declared: “I’m prepared to accept whatever result they produce, even if it proves my premise wrong”. However, when the Berkeley project produced similar results to the Met Office and other meteorological organisations, Watts and other ‘sceptics’ rejected the findings. The foundation review is being chaired by Professor Terence Kealey, the former vice-chancellor of the University of Buckingham, which has numerous links with climate change sceptics. Kealey is joined by a number of scientists who have expressed doubt about the consensus on climate change, including Richard McNider of the University of Alabama. McNider co-authored an article in the Wall Street Journal in February which attacked climate models, and criticised the scientific consensus on climate change because it “imperils economic growth and warps government policy making”. The foundation has not indicated how its project on the global temperature record will be funded.  The foundation tries to keep the identities of its donors a closely guarded secret, although Lawson has admitted that many are his wealthy friends. Journalists and campaigners have uncovered that many of the donors have links to rightwing lobby groups, such as the Institute of Economic Affairs. The foundation’s accounts show that more than 95% of the £1.86m it has raised since its establishment have come from its secret donors. Although most of its expenditure has been on its four staff, it spent more than £50,000 on producing pamphlets and other literature in the year ending September 2014. Following a lengthy investigation, the Charity Commission last year concluded (pdf) that the foundation had broken the terms of its registration as an educational charity because it promoted a fixed position on climate change on its website and through its publications. Lawson subsequently launched a lobbying arm, the Global Warming Policy Forum, which will not be bound by charity regulations. However, the foundation continues to promote climate change denial, in apparent breach of the Charity Commission’s rules."
"Fossil fuel companies enjoy far greater access to UK government ministers than renewable energy companies or climate campaigns, an analysis by the Guardian has revealed. Shell, the fossil fuel multi-national, has had at least 112 meetings with ministers since the last general election, and its rival, BP, at least 79 meetings. But this outweighs the number of meetings that ministers granted to renewable energy companies.  Twenty-three leading companies and two trade organisations in the renewable sector were given a combined total of 119 meetings with ministers over the same period.  The analysis found at least 230 meetings with Shell, BP, ExxonMobil, Total, ConocoPhillips, Chevron and the trade organisation Oil & Gas UK during the same time.  Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP in the last parliament, criticised the coalition for giving priority to the fossil fuel giants. “Time and again the government has shown itself to be woefully ignorant and dismissive of the potential of renewables, with policies riddled with contradiction,” she said. “Perhaps if its ministers spent a little more time with the country’s leading scientists and renewables experts, rather than nestled in the pockets of fossil-fuel companies, they’d be a little more enlightened.” The pair of oil and gas giants also secured more than twice as many meetings with ministers as two of their most well-known adversaries, Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, who had 67 meetings with ministers between them. The scale of the lobbying is revealed in a database of meetings that ministers in four Whitehall departments have had with outside organisations – the ministries covering energy and climate change, the environment, business, and the treasury.  The database – compiled by the Guardian – has been drawn from official registers of meetings recorded by Whitehall from May 2010 to June 2014, the most recent declarations.  However the registers make public only uninformative descriptions of what was discussed in the meetings, stating, for instance, that they talked about “energy policy” or “business”.  After the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats formed their coalition government in May 2010, Shell was the the first company through the door to have an “introductory” meeting with Chris Huhne, the then secretary of state for climate change and energy.  During the lifetime of the government, its executives were able to promote the multinational’s interests on a range of issues ranging from climate change to tax.  In two months, July and October 2011, Shell saw ministers at least eight times . That was a year in which the company’s responsibility for oil spills in Nigeria was frequently in the news, as were the company’s interests in Iraq, Kurdistan and Libya. BP’s meetings helped to develop, in the words of a Foreign Office diplomat, the effort to “strengthen the strategic alliance” between BP and the government on global economic and energy issues. The comment, made in documents disclosed under the freedom of information act, was made last year before an annual “high-level” dinner attended by senior diplomats and BP executives.  A BP spokesman said: ”BP is a major UK-headquartered company with significant businesses and investments in the UK as well as worldwide. We employ around 15,000 people in this country and are currently undertaking a multi-billion pound investment programme in the UK North Sea. I was just amazed at their sense of entitlement. They thought the government was there to ease their way “As such, we have regular meetings with various Government departments who are interested in both our business and various issues involving our industry. Many of these are at the Government’s request.” A Shell spokesman said: “Shell is a leading FTSE100 company, and as part of our perfectly legitimate corporate activity we engage regularly with many stakeholders, including government ministers and officials, on a wide range of topics related to the energy industry and Shell’s operations.” The face-to-face meetings with ministers allow the fossil fuel industry to promote their interests. A government source who was regularly involved in the meetings with energy companies described how they vehemently objected to a windfall tax that was suddenly imposed on North Sea oil producers in 2011.  They warned that tens of thousands of jobs in the UK would be lost. “The oil companies were absolutely furious, as they hadn’t known anything about it. They said it had ruined their positions within their [multinational] companies in fighting for investment in the North Sea,” said the source.  The same source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, has been struck by the firms that want to start fracking: “I was just amazed at their sense of entitlement. They thought the government was there to ease their way, not to strike a balance with public concerns.” Senior figures in the renewable industry said they had difficulty securing face-to-face meetings with ministers. One senior person in the renewables industry also described how ministers seemed indifferent to an overseas renewables company that was offering to invest a substantial sum in Britain. “You’d think that would be welcomed, but there was no sign of a red carpet, let alone a cup of coffee. There was an odd atmosphere and they were not really paying full attention.” Another senior executive in the renewables industry blamed Conservative ministers in the Liberal Democrat-controlled Department of Energy and Climate Change for the difficulty in getting meetings. “There was a huge difference with the Liberal Democrat ministers. They were accessible and supportive. We couldn’t have asked for more from them but they did not have the clout to deliver everything,” said the executive.  If Cameron’s serious about keeping people’s energy bills down... he’d put his money – and meetings – where his mouth is Michael Fallon, the energy minister in 2013 and 2014, before he was promoted to the cabinet, was identified by two renewable industry executives as being particularly unwelcoming. One said: “He refused all our meeting requests and flatly refused to engage. He kept finding excuses not to meet.” The other said: “We found it very difficult even to get a meeting with him, even when the issues directly affected his brief as energy minister.”  Environmental campaigners said their access to ministers was diluted as they met the politicians with other campaign groups.  The database shows that more of the meetings that Shell and BP had with ministers were on their own (43 and 33 respectively) compared to Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace. Friends of the Earth had 14 meetings on their own and Greenpeace 11. One campaigner involved in these meetings said the encounters with ministers often took the form of a question and answer session about issues that were topical. Another campaigner, Alastair Harper, a policy adviser at the Green Alliance, said the advantage of a range of environmental campaigns meeting ministers at the same time was that it allowed the campaigners to signal that they had broad support on a particular issue.  Lucas added: “This year, David Cameron dubbed climate change one of “the greatest threats” we faced. But the chasm unearthed here is sadly illustrative of a government out of touch with the vast opportunities offered by the renewables industry. If Cameron’s serious about keeping people’s energy bills down and improving energy security, he’d put his money – and meetings – where his mouth is.” The Department for Energy and Climate Change said it would not comment while the general election was taking place.  • How The Guardian calculated the number of meetings: Every department publishes a record of ministers’ meetings with external organisations. The records are usually published every quarter. The Guardian downloaded all of these since the coalition came to power, in all 116 documents. The information was turned into a database listing every meeting and every organisation. The organisations can either meet with the minister one-on-one, or as part of a larger group.  Often, several organisations take part in the same meeting. For example, BP met ministers 79 times, Shell 112 times, but Shell and BP had 165 meetings together with the ministers. That’s because Shell was present in some of the 79 meetings that BP had, and vice versa. This affects the totals when the figures for individual organisations are added together. "

"The environment minister has defended the federal government’s $4m contribution to establish a “consensus centre” headed by climate contrarian Bjørn Lomborg, saying it is getting “bang for your buck”. The $13m centre is planned for the University of Western Australia’s business school with the commonwealth contributing $4m over four years.  Greg Hunt has defended the decision amid conflicting reports over whether the university approached the government with the proposal or vice versa. “Lomborg is actually an economist of international renown and this isn’t a global warming thinktank as the left portray it. It’s actually an economic analysis unit and thinktank,” he told Channel 10’s the Bolt Report on Sunday morning. “He’s looking at all sorts of economic cost-benefit analysis. The cost-benefit approach is often derided by some of those who are deeply engaged in a political campaign rather than in getting the best bang for your buck.” Hunt’s comments come after a meeting on Friday where academics at the University of Western Australia asked the university to break its agreement with the government to establish the centre. The centre, which was originally established in Denmark before losing funding, is to be co-chaired by Lomborg and the university’s vice chancellor, Paul Johnson. Lomborg will also take up a position as an adjunct professor. It is expected to be running by July. Johnson has stood by the decision, saying the university will not walk away from the centre. “The university has signed a contract with the government,” he said on Friday. Staff at the university, including honorary research fellow with the department of engineering, Dr Eric Feinblatt, have criticised the decision, saying the only reason it is happening is because Lomborg’s views are favoured by the federal government. Johnson had defended not consulting widely with staff before signing the contract for the centre. “My understanding is the dean of the business school did discuss this with the leadership group of the business school. However, it is fairly common that we don’t take forward research proposals, grant proposals, for broad discussion,” he said. Lomborg is not a climate change denier but argues the issue has been treated too seriously and money invested in counteracting climate change has mostly been wasted. He’s an advocate of reducing foreign aid spending on climate projects and argues developing countries need access to cheap fossil fuels."

"Climate change could be affecting the quality of acorn crops from the UK’s oak trees, the Woodland Trust has said. Research using data recorded by members of the public for the trust’s Nature’s Calendar survey of the changing seasons has found that warmer years tend to lead to less synchronised flowering of oak trees, and as a result smaller crops. Professor Tim Sparks, from Coventry University, analysed more than 160,000 pieces of data and found that the more first flowering dates varied, the poorer the acorn crop was. There was a 20% drop in average scores for the abundance of the acorn crop recorded in the Nature’s Calendar survey for every four days’ increase in the variation of first flowering.  With eight of the UK’s 10 warmest years on record occurring since 2002, the trend is likely to continue in coming years, the Woodland Trust said. Sparks said: “This is a preliminary result which requires further study, but there is a significant correlation for both species of native oak. “Synchronised years tend to be those with a later mean flowering date, suggesting warmer years are associated with smaller acorn crops.” Acorns are a primary food source for a number of species including jays, pigeons, deer and squirrels, with some of the species helping disperse the seeds, but synchronised flowering enables oak trees to spread their genes through wind-dispersed pollen. Dr Kate Lewthwaite, Woodland Trust citizen science manager, said warmer springs which “stretch things” so flowering was less synchronised, gave oak trees less opportunity to cross-pollinate over wide areas, reducing the acorn crop. “When you get a cooler year, the flowering dates are more synchronised or similar, which means the cross pollination opportunities are greater,” she said. “Information added to Nature’s Calendar by the public is hugely important in helping us make sense of changes in the natural environment. “Identifying trends like these can also help us better plan for the future, building the resilience and diversity of our precious native woodland.” The public can help record first leafing and flowering of oak trees on Nature’s Calendar, which has information about the changing seasons in nature dating back to 1736, making it the longest biological record of its kind."
"The fossil fuel industry is a bigger threat to global health than tobacco and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust have a moral obligation to divest from it, an international organisation that represents 1 million medical students has said. A letter to the charities from the International Federation of Medical Students’ Associations (IFMSA) called on the charities to drop their fossil fuel company interests, which amount to almost £1.5bn. The students said investments in coal, oil and gas companies were in direct contravention of the solemn Hippocratic 0ath, which doctors take before they begin their service. “Continued investment in the fossil fuel industry violates health workers’ obligations to do no harm and grants the industry the social licence to explore and exploit still further reserves, resulting in catastrophic global warming,” said the students. The IFMSA represents future doctors in 119 countries. The letter was also endorsed by the Australian Medical Students’ Association (AMSA) and Medsin-UK and signed by medical student leaders from across the world – including Bangladesh, one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change. The letter compares the health impacts of tobacco, which kills six million people each year, with the extreme weather, food insecurity, conflict and mental health impacts of the climate crisis. “The threat to public health posed by fossil fuels is even greater [than tobacco],” said the students, who noted the medical profession’s leading role in the tobacco divestment movement. “The arguments that led the health sector to divest from tobacco provide a still more compelling mandate for divestment from fossil fuels. “We share a responsibility to our future patients to address unmitigated climate change – described as ‘the biggest health threat of the 21st century’ – and to advocate for a transition to a healthier, more sustainable economy.” The two charities are among the world’s largest funders of health research and medical aid. The students called on the Gates Foundation and Wellcome to fulfil their role as leaders in the field and drop their shares in fossil fuels.  Lucas Scherdel, national director of medical students’ global health charity Medsin-UK, said: “It’s no longer acceptable for organisations such as the Wellcome Trust and Gates Foundation to benefit from the fossil fuel industry’s profits when they come at such a huge cost to people’s health.” The students call echoes the Guardian’s Keep it in the ground campaign, which has attracted 188,000 signatures from readers asking the charities to divest. Both charities have resisted the calls. In another demonstration of the growing concern of the scientific community towards the investments held by their funders, hundreds of scientists have answered a Guardian call to write to the Gates Foundation and Wellcome expressing their views on divestment. The scientists roundly applauded the positive impact the charities had made on health, particularly in the developing world, but several wondered whether this mission would be undermined by funding the companies that cause climate change, which will hit the world’s poor disproportionately hard. Dr Stephen Webster, director of the science communication unit at Imperial College, said the Wellcome Trust must listen to the growing public concern over fossil fuel companies’ impact on the climate. “With the Guardian’s readers petitioning the Trust so vigorously, we are about to find out whether, indeed, science can listen,” he said. “I think the question to be asked is this: are you convinced that the rationale you apply to the management of your financial holdings does not contradict the reasoning that energises your scientific sponsorship? Or, could it be that, without realising it, you are putting financial return above common sense?” The respondents included scientists who had received funding from both organisations.  Professor Frank Carey, a consultant pathologist who works on Wellcome-funded research at Dundee University, said: “It is time for these organisations to make a global splash – publicly withdraw funds from the oil, gas and coal industry. It is the only way to remain credible and true to your aims. Scientists understand evidence, data and complex systems. We have the ability and indeed the duty to lead the public and influence opinion. We also have a moral need to persuade our funders to join us in changing the world.” Dr Ariel Blocker, who has been accredited by the Wellcome Trust with their high-level investigator award, said the trust had a responsibility to guard against the impact of a “carbon bubble” market crash. “I can not begin to imagine what would happen to biomedical science in this country and also abroad if the Wellcome Trust’s budget were to shrink substantially. Please, please do not take that chance,” she said."

"BP has promised to be more open about its impact on climate change after 98% of shareholders backed a resolution calling for greater transparency at the fossil fuel group.  The company committed to publishing more information on a range of issues, including whether the value of its oil and gas reserves will be damaged by limits on carbon emissions; its investments in low-carbon technology; the scale of carbon dioxide emissions from its operations; the linking of executive pay to greenhouse gas reduction; and its lobbying on climate change.  The resolution supported by the BP board came at the end of a three-hour meeting dominated by a subject that has been largely ignored at such investor gatherings. In a break with convention for oil industry AGMs, Carl-Henric Svanberg, BP’s chairman, devoted the bulk of his opening speech at his group’s AGM to an issue that has historically been consigned to the margins. But while the company’s board promised to be more transparent about the risks posed by the business, BP made clear it would not be providing targets to curb its own greenhouse gas output. “We will focus on emissions, but we are not yet ready to set targets ... it’s not that we are not willing. It is just that it could be counter-productive,” said Svanberg. He insisted that BP was helping the world with its transition to a lower carbon economy, partly through its growing commitment to gas over oil. BP was also campaigning for a global carbon price, putting a higher emphasis on energy efficiency and supported continuing subsidies for renewable energy. “We are taking action on all these areas,” Svanberg said. Bill McGrew, portfolio manager at the California Public Employees Retirement System, a major BP investor and sponsor of the resolution, applauded the directors for supporting the resolution. “BP’s decision to support and recommend the shareholder approval for Resolution 25 is the example for companies to follow.” Later, when asked about pressure from campaigners to divest from fossil fuel companies, which includes the Guardian’s Keep it in the Ground campaign, Svanberg said the approach was wrong-headed. “I think in general, engagement is a much better way forward than to try to exclude people [investors] from your activities.  “I think it is a fundamental wrong belief that we can steer towards a better future by stopping using fossil fuels. If we don’t produce what society demands, we will just end up with shortages.” He went on to argue that it was up to governments and politicians to find ways to tackle these issues. BP was also challenged on its commitment to investing in renewables and about revelations in the Guardian that much research work had been locked away in its own archives. Svanberg insisted that the retreat out of renewable energy, including the sale of the BP Solar business, had been partly forced on it by the “stressed financial situation” resulting from the Deepwater Horizon accident in the US Gulf of Mexico. “After Macondo, we had to make choices. That is why we sold solar, [even though] it was dear to us.” Other renewable commitments were wound down because governments did not come up with the carbon price needed to support them, he argued. Svanberg denied that BP was keeping scientific information hidden away in an archive at Warwick University, saying it was open to everyone. “Nothing is locked away. We share everything happily.” Bob Dudley, BP’s chief executive, said the company’s role was to provide for growing energy demand in as clean a way as possible. “We can offer people energy security and sustainability and can offer shareholders enduring value for many decades to come.” The company had been served with a resolution from shareholders to disclose more about the risks and opportunities surrounding climate change. The shareholder resolution was passed with 98% of the vote, but there were also a number of shareholders who stood up and criticised the company over its involvement in tar sands, in Russia, and continuing problems in the Gulf of Mexico. Derrick Evans, a US Gulf resident, told the AGM that a “secret sauce” of clean-up detergents had left hundreds suffering from growing health problems that were not being addressed by BP’s compensation payments. BP said all the clean-up fluids it had used were agreed by the American regulators and it said it had spent billions helping clean up beaches and help local communities with health and other issues."
"Elizabeth Warren consistently ranks as a leader of the liberal left, but when it comes to climate change the Massachusetts senator and many other prominent Democrats are lagging behind, a new report claims, and are not taking the steps required to prevent the globe from plunging into manmade catastrophe. The report, released on Wednesday by California-based liberal Super Pac Climate Hawks Vote, is the first to rank Senate Democrats’ environmental records not solely on congressional votes, but on their leadership and vocal support for action on climate change. That includes things like how many floor speeches a senator has given on the issue, and how many climate-related bills they have introduced. The report came to some surprising (and not-so-surprising) conclusions about the Democratic party. While some senators scored well on the report’s -100 to +100 scale, most were middle-of-the-pack, and several scored near zero or negatively, meaning they either stayed silent on climate change or actively supported policies that exacerbate it. Some Democrats at the bottom are no surprise. Claire McCaskill, a big proponent of oil production in Missouri, ranks worst. Joe Manchin, the senator from West Virginia who spent the runup to 2014’s elections blasting Barack Obama’s “war on coal” also places near the bottom of the list. But some senators who have been considered leaders of the Democratic party also score low on the list. Despite her national prominence, Warren scored a lukewarm 25. “Some Senate observers have expected Warren to discuss climate change more this year now that she is on the energy and natural resources committee, but so far she’s only made one public statement, engaged in minimal press release work, not written any bills, and cosponsored very few bills,” the Climate Hawk report reads.  Rhode Island’s Sheldon Whitehouse wins top honors on the list for his near-constant support of environment (he’s approaching 100 speeches on climate change). And Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, who is expected to announce his candidacy for president on Thursday, ranks fourth.  His campaign will reportedly focus on inequality, corporate abuses of power, and climate change."

"Every western ghost town is an object lesson. Oregon, with more ghost towns than any other state, has a full curriculum. In the places that emptied out when the railways lost out to highways, we can see how capital and technology, then as now, destroy homes and livelihoods as relentlessly as they build them. In the towns that fell apart when their mine tapped out, we can see that manic boom-and-bust extraction cycles have convulsed the west for its entire history. But there’s one lost Oregon town that gives us a tightly focused image of the future. There are no remains of Bayocean for the visitor to see – they’ve long since been claimed by the waters of Tillamook Bay. Though the wild weather of the Oregon coast administered the coup de grace to the town in the 1950s, in truth, the residents themselves destroyed it by misunderstanding and carelessly tampering with the natural systems that allowed it to exist.   Real estate developers are the American west’s true legislators. In 1906, at the dawn of the era of mass leisure, TB Potter saw the four-mile long spit off the coast of Tillamook and decided that he could make it into “the Atlantic City of the west”.  With his son, TI Potter, he bought up the land for a song, and started transforming it into a holiday destination that would draw people from Oregon and the whole of the west coast.  The main thrust of the plan was selling plots to people who would use them for holiday homes. But he also planned and built a hotel, a dance hall and a heated swimming pool complete with a machine for making artificial surf. The swimming pool, or “natatorium”, was down by the ocean so that people could choose between it and the more bracing Oregonian surf.  He built it, and for a while they came. The first lots were bought by Francis Drake Mitchell, Bayocean’s most enduring true believer, who set up a pharmacy and retail store there. Six hundred more sold to buyers softened up with free travel and boarding, but never quickly enough to keep up with Potter’s voracious needs for cash flow as he tried to keep up the pace of development for what was becoming the largest city on the Oregon coast.  Over the first decade, the haphazard facilities showed the strain of building the place from scratch. The telephone system only connected to other numbers in Bayocean, not the outside world. The badly designed water pumping system yielded only a trickle in some parts of the island. There were concrete roads, but few cars, as there was as yet no road connection from the mainland.  The only means of transport for visitors to get to Bayocean was Potter’s yacht, also called Bayocean, which sailed back and forth from Portland once a week. This trip was occasionally terrifying: passengers had to cross the infamously treacherous Columbia river bar and the mouth of Tillamook Bay, which was also frightening in rough weather.  The residents demanded a protective jetty to smooth this journey. The US army corps of engineers took one look at the bay and said they’d need two. The residents, who had to put up half the cost, would have to shell out over a million dollars, so they settled for one (this still cost each resident $450 – a huge sum in 1917).  This is the way they ended up paying for the destruction of their own property, and the city. The jetty changed the current, which began steadily wearing away the sand on which the whole town rested. The Potter family got out in the early 1920s, as the resort became mired in legal troubles. As early as 1928, when the road was finally built, the seaward side of the spit had been significantly eroded. It didn’t stop.  Every bit of rough weather now posed an existential threat to Bayocean. In 1932, a massive storm destroyed the natatorium. By 1938, 59 homes had disappeared, and residents had long since begun fleeing in earnest.  A few held on, like old Francis Mitchell, the first resident, whose stubbornness is still a local legend. In the early 1950s he was still trying to rebuild the spit with a shovel and a wheelbarrow.  In 1952, the spit became an island, when heavy seas smashed through the barrier, altering the ecological balance of the bay and the estuary that fed into it. In 1953, the post office closed and all residents were evacuated. In 1960, the last house fell into the ocean. Erosion has claimed houses on the coast of the Pacific Northwest since then, and the conditions that bring this about are worsening. Professor Scott Burns from Portland State University says: “Global warming will produce more El Niño events.” For the Oregon Coast, and the north-west in general, that means more storms. Combined with rising seas, that means trouble for beachfront settlements. Burns is one of those urging local authorities to locate all essential services 50ft or higher above the water. They also need to stand up to developers who want to build too close to a coast that will be subject to more erosion than ever.  If we hubristically ignore the natural systems we live, in “we will likely see more Bayoceans in the future”. "

"California would aggressively reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 under a plan announced on Wednesday that steps up the state’s previously established target, which has cut emissions partly by forcing companies to pay for their carbon pollution. Governor Jerry Brown’s executive order is loftier than a federal goal that also aims to curb global warming, but it gives the state more time to achieve it. Brown’s plan lacks specifics, but he previously has cited increasing renewable electricity sources, reducing petroleum use in vehicles, doubling the energy efficiency of existing buildings and make heating fuels cleaner as ways to reduce emissions.  Brown set a target of reducing emissions to 40% below 1990 levels over the next 15 years and called it the most aggressive benchmark enacted by a government in North America. “With this order, California sets a very high bar for itself and other states and nations, but it’s one that must be reached – for this generation and generations to come,” Brown said in a statement. President Barack Obama announced a plan earlier this year to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 26% to 28% by 2025, with 2005 levels as the starting point. California has already moved on its environmental goals, partly through a program that puts a monetary value on carbon emissions. In 2006, then Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed the state’s landmark global warming law, and Brown has aggressively enforced it. It called for reaching 1990 emissions levels by 2020 and 80% below that by 2050. The state’s cap-and-trade program, launched nearly three years ago, offers one of the few real-world laboratories on how to reduce carbon emissions. It expanded this year to fine companies that produce gasoline and other fuels, prompting predictions that consumers will see a spike in prices to cover the costs. Brown said on Wednesday that climate change would factor into government planning, and he ordered state agencies and departments to implement measures to reduce emissions. He also called for the state to identify how climate change will affect infrastructure and industry and what actions California can take to reduce the risks of climate change. The order aligns California’s greenhouse-gas reduction targets with those of leading international governments ahead of the United Nations climate change conference in Paris later this year. The European Union has set the same target for 2030. The latest proposal comes just months after Brown, at his inauguration, challenged the nation’s most populous state to increase renewable energy use to 50% in the next 15 years. Brown’s action comes amid aggressive efforts aimed at fighting the state’s historic drought, which has been California’s primary environmental concern in recent months. The governor’s order was praised by climate researchers and politicians, including the former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg. “California’s 2030 goal to reduce carbon emissions is not only bold, it’s necessary – for the economy and our future,” Bloomberg said in a statement released by Brown. Despite being a political hero to the environmental movement in his first stint as governor in the 1970s, Brown has received harsh criticism from conservationists for his refusal to ban hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, for oil. David Braun, a member of a group called Californians Against Fracking, said the governor’s goal was commendable but insufficient. “To really address climate change in a meaningful way, Brown must ban fracking and other oil drilling methods that endanger our communities’ health, our water and the environment,” the group said in a statement on Wednesday."
