"I was arrested yesterday for blockading Cuadrilla’s fracking site at Preston New Road in Lancashire for more than 12 hours. It was the first day of fracking after a seven-year delay due to earthquakes, powerful local opposition and legal challenges. As a trained paramedic, I have a good appreciation of emergency situations. Climate change is the biggest emergency of them all. I join more than 350 people who have been arrested for disrupting Cuadrilla’s site in Lancashire over the last two years. People driven to take such action range from local councillors to faith leaders, students to grandparents. In the past fortnight, three people were sentenced to up to 16 months in prison for climbing on top of lorries that carried key fracking equipment. I put my body on the line and risked arrest at the entrance of Cuadrilla’s site because the Conservative government has shown nothing but disdain for local democracy, climate science and communities at the sharp end of climate breakdown. More than 200,000 people have signed a petition against fracking. In June 2015, Lancashire county council unanimously rejected Cuadrilla’s application, only to be overruled by Sajid Javid (then the communities secretary) a few months later. The government is currently seeking to fast-track fracking by rewriting local planning rules to make it as easy to build a fracking rig as it is to put up a garden shed. These are desperate attempts to impose a polluting industry on a public who do not want it. When the government and corporations show such disregard for people and the planet, taking direct action like yesterday’s blockade is a moral obligation. Claire Perry, the minister for clean growth and energy, has announced that this week is Green Great Britain Week. This is the same Claire Perry who granted Cuadrilla the final consent to frack and has been a key driver behind government attempts to open up this new fossil fuel industry. It is unconscionable that Perry is persevering with her zealous support of fracking at a time when climate scientists are imploring political leaders to take urgent and unprecedented action to cut greenhouse gas emissions before 2030. Gas-generated electricity has a carbon footprint 50 times greater than onshore wind, and fracked (shale) gas is even worse. Gas is no “bridge fuel” to a low-carbon economy, as Cuadrilla claims. Locking our economy into extracting and burning more gas will only add to emissions and drive us more rapidly towards dangerous climate impacts. It’s wrong to argue that fracking mitigates the risk of the lights going out. Production of gas-powered electricity fell by 5% in the year to 2017, while wind and solar grew by 20%. This year has seen record heat and a series of extreme weather events. While the impacts of floods, hurricanes, heatwaves, droughts and wildfires are beginning to be experienced more frequently in the UK, these events have long been devastating other communities around the globe. We do not have time to hope in vain for politicians or corporations to catch up with the timeline of climate breakdown. In just 12 years our society must radically decarbonise, whether those profiting from the crisis like it or not. Fossil fuel companies such as Shell and ExxonMobil were able to forecast what their extraction would do to our climate as early as the 1980s. Cuadrilla has no excuse now. While governments, the police and the courts defend such corporations in their reckless pursuit of profit, we have no choice but to turn to direct action to stop new fossil fuel infrastructure. This is by no means the end. We still have our friends, our creativity and the determination to blockade a fracking industry that threatens our shared survival. History teaches us that non-violent civil disobedience has a powerful precedent in radically shifting the narrative and bringing about justice. So we will continue, until we win. • Esme North trained as a paramedic and is working in agroecology"
"The UK government is putting the health of millions of its citizens at risk by failing to tackle the country’s air pollution crisis, according the UN’s special rapporteur on human rights and the environment. David Boyd said people’s right to breathe clean air was being violated in the UK and warned the crisis was responsible for up to 50,000 deaths – and devastating the lives of “many millions” more in towns and cities across the country.  Speaking to the Guardian, he said air pollution and climate change were inextricably linked and called on the UK government to take a global lead by introducing new clean air legislation to raise standards, protect its citizens and meet its climate obligations. “The interesting thing about the UK is that the London smog of 1952 was the galvanising event that led to the world’s first Clean Air Act,” said Boyd. “I really feel like we have reached the point again where it is time for the UK to step up and show some leadership.” The intervention follows a slew of new scientific studies over recent months that have highlighted the long-term damage air pollution is doing to people’s health, from asthma to dementia, damage to unborn babies and heart disease. Last month the world’s biggest children’s charity, Unicef, told the Guardian it had refocused its UK operation to tackle air pollution because of the scale of the “health crisis” facing young people in the country. It also follows a landmark UN climate report that warned we only had 12 years to avert disastrous climate breakdown. Boyd said: “Air pollution and climate change are inextricably linked – fossil fuels are by far the biggest contributor to air pollution. But if you flip that around, by dealing with air pollution we are also starting to deal with climate change, and that is a great opportunity as well as a great challenge.” The UK government has been widely criticised by clean air campaigners and environmental groups over what they say has been its failure to tackle the air pollution crisis. It has been defeated three times in court over its plans on the issue and is now one of six countries taken to the European court of justice over their toxic air. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs defended the government’s record, claiming the UK was “acting faster to tackle air pollution than almost every other major developed economy, with an ambitious £3.5bn plan to reduce harmful emissions, an upcoming environment bill which will include provisions to improve air quality, and a commitment to end the sale of conventional new diesel and petrol cars and vans by 2040.” It also called on individuals to take action, from burning only the “cleanest fuels” to “leaving the car at home on the school run”. However, Boyd said ministers were “simply not doing enough”. “The fact that they still have these weak standards and the fact that there are somewhere between 30,000 and 50,000 premature deaths in the UK?” he said. “That should simply not be acceptable in a wealthy, advanced society.” And he warned that the official death toll was “just the tip of the iceberg”. “If you are having tens of thousands of premature deaths,” he said, “you are also talking about millions of illnesses from asthma to lung cancer that don’t necessarily kill you but make lives utterly miserable.” Boyd, who took up his post in August, said the crisis in the UK was part of a global public health emergency that kills between 6 and 7 million people a year. He argued that the “vast majority” of these deaths are preventable “if we put stronger laws, policies and standards in place … we just need the political will.” Children are among the most susceptible to toxic air. Last month the Guardian reported how youngsters in the UK were getting a disproportionate amount of air pollution during the school day. One primary school was found to have levels several times over the World Health Organization limit for the most damaging particulates inside its classrooms. However, Boyd said he remained optimistic that the global air pollution crisis could be overcome, pointing out that repeated studies into the cost of tackling air pollution have shown “absolutely clearly that the net benefits are in the trillions of dollars”. “There is no economic argument against cleaner air – in fact, this is one of those rare instances where our environmental objectives, our economic objectives and our social objectives line up very neatly,” he said."
"The Bank of England has stopped short of forcing financial companies to disclose the potential risks they face from climate change, despite growing calls from campaigners for such action. In a warning to finance firms to vastly improve their planning to safeguard against the financial risks posed by global warming, Threadneedle Street asked companies to “consider the relevance” of disclosing their climate-related risks. The central bank’s prudential regulation authority (PRA), which is tasked with ensuring UK financial sector stability, launched the guidelines for consultation on Monday, in a package of measures designed to coax banks to prepare for the low-carbon economy of the future. The Bank has previously said that only 10% of banks take a long-term view of the risks posed by climate change, while Mark Carney, its governor, has said that failure to adapt would have a “catastrophic impact” on the financial system. The guidelines also come after the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that failure to limit global warming to within a maximum of 1.5C over the next dozen years would significantly worsen the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people. Although opting against mandatory disclosures, the Bank said firms ought to identify a senior manager with responsibility for managing the financial risks posed by climate change, with clear “board-level engagement”. Banks and insurers must also use their existing risk management tools to assess the threat of global warming and should run scenario planning exercises to determine the impact of the climate change financial risks on their overall business strategy. “The PRA will embed these expectations into its existing supervisory framework and expects firms’ responses to be proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of their respective businesses,” it said. Rob Macquarie, an economist specialising in green central banking at the campaign group Positive Money, said the guidelines were a step in the right direction, although he warned they “don’t really measure up to the scale of the challenge”. “The regulator should be going further in laying the ground for mandatory disclosure of climate-related risk,” he said. Other organisations have called for greater action. The Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, an industry body led by Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, has called for firms to publish such risks in their annual public accounts. The House of Commons environmental audit committee told the government earlier this year that reporting climate risks should be made mandatory by 2022, saying that a voluntary approach was unlikely to work over the medium term. Frank van Lerven, of the New Economics Foundation, said: “We need to do much more than simply tinker around the edges with incremental adjustments to finance. “We will need radical disruptive reforms that help reshape finance, so that it can actively help deliver a rapid, sustainable and fair green transition.”"
"From low-emission cows to robotic soil management, the farming industry will have to explore new approaches in the wake of a UN warning that the world needs to cut meat consumption or face worsening climate chaos. That was the message from Guy Smith, vice-president of the National Farmers’ Union (NFU), this week as policymakers began to discuss how Britain can address the challenges posed by the recent global warming report by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).  Farming and land use are set to move to a more central position in the climate debate in the wake of that report, which urged countries to widen their emissions-cutting efforts beyond the energy industry to agriculture and transport. Smith said NFU members were “up for radical thought” because this year’s harvests have been badly hit by the unusually harsh “beast from the east” cold spell in winter and the worst summer drought since 1976. Many British farmers, particularly on the east coast, are working on fields that are already below sea level and dependent on flood defences that are threatened by rising seas. “If consumers want to reduce red meat consumption, farmers will respond accordingly,” Smith told a meeting of politicians and climate experts in parliament on Wednesday, noting that farmers could diversify into other stock and use technology to reduce the carbon footprint of the agricultural sector. Among the possible tech fixes he mentioned were greater uses of satellites and robotics to increase the amount of carbon-absorbing organic matter in the soil and breeding new livestock that emit less methane. Cow farts are a major source of greenhouse gas, but researchers – who collect the gases in bags fitted to cows – have found there is considerable natural variation from animal to animal. If the low-emission cows could be bred with each other, this could bring down these emissions, they say. Researchers in other countries are also looking at changing feed to make cattle less gaseous. British agriculture, which already faces dramatic change as a result of Brexit, is likely to come under greater scrutiny next year when both the IPCC and the UK’s Climate Change Commission (CCC) produce reports on the role of land use in reduce emissions. This touches on several politically fraught issues, including whether to use land for carbon-sink forests, food-producing farms, housing or industry. Smith said he was opposed to any reduction in the productive land of British agriculture. He warned that cuts here could mean an expansion in Argentina or Brazil, where crops and beef are produced in far more environmentally destructive conditions and shipping leads to a much higher carbon footprint. Better, he said, to reduce waste in farms, processing, supermarkets and home. He was supported in this by Ann Jones, a Cumbrian farmer and vice-chair of the National Federation of Women’s Institutes who also opposed changes in tax policy that might accelerate the drive away from meat. “I’d be concerned if we tax red meat,” she said. “It’s food waste that we should be tackling.” Climate scientists said action on meat was important. “The clear message from the IPCC is that diet matters,” said Prof Jim Skea, who chaired one of the working groups on the new UN report. “If we eat healthy meat, we’ll live longer and by the way reduce our carbon footprint.” In light of the IPCC report, Baroness Brown, a member of the CCC, said her group is likely to advise the government to step up its efforts to meet current climate targets, which are currently off course, and to add “an element of more ambition” when it is formally asked for policy recommendations. But she said the committee was unlikely to address fracking, which produces more fossil fuels, or airport expansion, which adds to the carbon footprint of transport. These limitations were criticised by the Green party MP Caroline Lucas. “It’s not good enough for the government to attempt to simply add a green tinge to business as usual,” she said. “This week’s IPCC report couldn’t have been clearer: we need an urgent and complete overhaul of our economic system to avoid disaster – and to create a fairer, healthier, safer society.”"

"How did government respond to the recent scientific conclusion that only “rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society” can deliver the globally agreed target for stopping climate breakdown? In the UK, fracking for fossil fuels was given the green light, plans were announced for a huge new road in the south-east, incentives for electric vehicles withered, the expansion of Heathrow airport is still going ahead and Gatwick airport is trying to expand too by bringing a back-up runway into use. It’s like seeing a sign that says “Danger: vertical cliff drop” and pulling on your best running shoes to take a flying leap. Something isn’t working. The head of the oil company Shell responded to the new climate science warming by clarifying that “Shell’s core business is, and will be for the foreseeable future, very much in oil and gas.” BP announced new North Sea oil projects. Immediate choices are being made with blank disregard to avoiding climate breakdown.  A new line in the sand is needed to underpin the existing climate agreement, to exert influence over the immediate choices of policymakers. At the very least, the science should mandate a moratorium in rich countries on any further expansion of the fossil fuel industry, or any infrastructure dependent on it. Currently, global demand for coal, oil and gas are all growing, with fossil fuels accounting for 81% of energy use. Worryingly, the International Energy Agency projects total fossil fuel use rising for decades still to come, smashing all climate targets. A moratorium could take the form of a fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty. The threat of nuclear catastrophe provides a precedent for how, quickly, to stop a bad situation getting worse. The nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT), agreed 50 years ago between 1965-68, was a triumph of rapid diplomacy, at the height of cold war mistrust, and against an immense security threat (this is a different, far more comprehensive and important treaty than the one with Russia rejected by Donald Trump last week). We could even adapt the classic “three pillar” structure of the NPT. The first is “non proliferation” itself. Climate negotiations and national commitments are not moving fast enough to meet the older 2C climate target let alone 1.5C. The first step in the nuclear treaty process was a stock take of who had what weapons. Why not cut to the chase and agree to assess those fossil fuel reserves which, if burned, would carry us across the 1.5C warming line, and monitor their non-use and any measures likely to lead to the proliferation of fossil fuels? “The fossil fuel industry knows with some certainty future production often decades in advance,” says Carbon Tracker’s Mark Campanale, “What we need is a global, public register setting out who controls the reserves from where the CO2 is coming.” The second pillar of the NPT is disarmament. This means rapid substitution of clean energy for fossil fuels. We know this can be done in ways which would also save tens of millions of lives by improving air quality. But “disarmament” would also be delivered by following the climate scientists’ three point plan for action carrying the “highest benefits”: lowering energy demand, lowering material consumption, and switching to food choices that are low carbon (in other words more plant-based food). The final pillar concerns the promotion of the “peaceful” use of technology. In a climate context, that would mean massively expanding existing initiatives to compensate poorer countries for leaving fossil fuels in the ground, while ensuring access to clean energy and the technology needed for development. Funds could be also redirected from the staggering $10m per minute that governments give in fossil fuel subsidies, according to the International Monetary Fund. Some governments have already proposed moratoriums on coal at national level and there are initiatives such as Powering Past Coal Alliance. As far back as 1988 at the Toronto conference on the changing atmosphere, climatic upheaval was described as a threat “second only to nuclear war”, a sentiment endorsed from the CIA to MI5 and the United Nations. National efforts are crucial, but a new fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty supported by movements calling to leave fossil fuels in the ground, would provide a transparent and fair means to stop climate breakdown. The best way to mark the 50th anniversary of the NPT, would be to begin negotiation of its fossil fuel equivalent. • Andrew Simms is an author, political economist and campaigner.

"Trouble is brewing for the world’s beer drinkers, with climate change set to cause “dramatic” price spikes and supply shortages, according to new research. Extreme heatwaves and droughts will increasingly damage the global barley crop, meaning a common ingredient of the world’s favourite alcoholic beverage will become scarcer. Key brewing nations are forecast to be among the worst hit, including Belgium, the Czech Republic and Ireland. The researchers said that compared with life-threatening impacts of global warming such as the floods and storms faced by millions, a beer shortage may seem relatively unimportant. But they said it would affect the quality of life of many people. “There is little doubt that for millions of people around the world, the climate impacts on beer availability and price will add insult to injury,” said Prof Dabo Guan at the University of East Anglia, one of the research team. “There is something fundamental in the cross-cultural appreciation of beer. “If you still want to still have a couple of pints of beer while you watch the football, then climate change [action] is the only way out. This is the key message.” The research, published in the journal Nature Plants, used climate models to examine the impact of extreme weather on barley yields over the next 80 years. The team then used economic models to estimate the impact on beer supply and price in different nations. If carbon emissions are not curbed, the analysis found that beer consumption will fall by about a third in Ireland, Belgium and the Czech Republic. In the UK, a quarter fewer pints would be sunk, with 14% fewer bottles being opened in the US. In China, now the world’s biggest beer consumer, consumption is forecast to fall by 9%. In Australia, just 7% fewer cold ones would be downed, partly because it is one of few places where climate change may make barley growing easier in some regions. Globally, the cut would be 16%. Even in the best-case climate scenario, with rapid and deep cuts in greenhouse gases, beers drunk in Ireland, Belgium and the Czech Republic would fall between 9% and 13%, with similar drops in Canada and Germany. Looking at the impact on price, the research found that Poland’s beer drinkers would be hardest hit in the worst-case scenario, with the cost rising almost fivefold. In Ireland, Belgium and the Czech Republic, prices would double. These nations would be most affected because they brew and drink a lot of beer and import most of their brewing barley. Only about a sixth of the world barley harvest is used for beer – most is fed to livestock. But the researchers found that the economics of the market mean hungry animals are prioritised when the grain is in short supply. This means disproportionately large decreases in barley for brewing, “ultimately resulting in dramatic regional decreases in beer consumption and increases in beer prices”. “Future climate and pricing conditions could put beer out of reach for hundreds of millions of people around the world,” said Prof Steven Davis, at the University of California, Irvine, and one of the research team. Guan said uncertainties and assumptions made in the study mean the price rises and supply shortages calculated are not intended to be precise predictions but to illustrate the impact of climate change. He said it is clear from the research that global warming will make beer more expensive and less available. Guan suggested beer price spikes and shortages might even affect social stability, noting that the prohibition era in the US saw organised crime supplying illicit liquor. Using other grains such as wheat to brew is unlikely to be an option, as all crops will suffer from extreme weather, said Guan. Nor will what he calls other “luxury essentials” be an alternative source of pleasure: “All these are going to be more expensive – chocolate, coffee and tea – all those crops are going to be suffering.” Prof Richard Ellis at the University of Reading, who was not involved in the research, said: “For beer drinkers, this [research] converts an abstract concept of the future efficiency of cereal production by farmers into the more real future price of beer.” But he said the study might underestimate the consequences of future climate change on barley yields, given significant recent drops in UK yields after only modest temperature rises. He also said the taste of beer could be affected by possible climate change impacts on hop production. One scientist who reviewed the new research before publication told Guan: “I hope Donald Trump loves beer. If he does he may return the US to the Paris agreement.” This, however, may be a forlorn hope: Trump claims to be teetotal."
"The amount of vegetation burnt by fires caused by lightning strikes in Tasmania’s world heritage area has increased dramatically this century, according to new research led by the University of Tasmania. The study, published this month in the academic journal Fire, warns the state’s heritage forests face rising threats because of the tendency toward drier summers and that the probability of “catastrophic” fires could increase as a result of more fuel igniting from lightning strikes.  In 2016, parts of the world heritage area were devastated by fires, many ignited by lightning strikes. Researchers at the University of Tasmania looked at historic fire data collected by the Tasmanian parks and wildlife service from 1980 to 2016. The records detail the number of fires each year, the area burnt and what caused the fire. From the year 2000, they found an increase in the number of lightning-caused fires and an increase in the average size of the fires, “resulting in a marked increase in the area burnt”. Their data shows only a few fires caused by lightning were recorded in the 1980s and 1990s, compared with almost 20 that were recorded in 2015-16. There were major fires caused by lightning in 2000-01, 2006-07, 2012-13 and 2015-16. “Lightning is now responsible for the majority of the area burned in the TWWHA [Tasmanian wilderness world heritage area],” they state. Fire ecologist Jenny Styger, the paper’s lead author, said: “Something changed about 2000. “It was the tipping point at which lightning started to become the predominant cause of fire ignition.” The researchers were unable to determine if the reason for this was because there had been an increase in lightning strikes, or if drier fuel in the world heritage area was making it more likely a fire would start because of a lightning strike. They said this was because western Tasmania does not have reliable historic data on the detection of lightning strikes. But Styger said it was a significant issue because many of the fires in the world heritage area occurred in remote forest with no road access, making them difficult to detect and extinguish. “This is going to impact how we think about fire management for the world heritage area and it’s going to become a much greater threat with climate change,” she said. “It’s going to be a really significant issue going forward because the world heritage area has lots of areas that we don’t want to burn.” In 2016, an Australian Senate inquiry examined the fires in remote Tasmanian wilderness in January and February of that year. The Tasmanian Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson said the new research showed “climate change’s impacts are here now and this is another reminder of the need to urgently reduce emissions”. He said the inquiry had considered whether an increase in fires caused by lightning may have contributed to the destruction in 2016. “To have this confirmed by this study should send shockwaves through the conservation community,” he said."
"Thousands of Central American migrants trudging through Mexico towards the US have regularly been described as either fleeing gang violence or extreme poverty. But another crucial driving factor behind the migrant caravan has been harder to grasp: climate change.  Most members of the migrant caravans come from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador – three countries devastated by violence, organised crime and systemic corruption, the roots of which can be traced back to the region’s cold war conflicts. Experts say that alongside those factors, climate change in the region is exacerbating – and sometimes causing – a miasma of other problems including crop failures and poverty. And they warn that in the coming decades, it is likely to push millions more people north towards the US. “The focus on violence is eclipsing the big picture – which is that people are saying they are moving because of some version of food insecurity,” said Robert Albro, a researcher at the Center for Latin American and Latino Studies at American University. “The main reason people are moving is because they don’t have anything to eat. This has a strong link to climate change – we are seeing tremendous climate instability that is radically changing food security in the region.” Migrants don’t often specifically mention “climate change” as a motivating factor for leaving because the concept is so abstract and long-term, Albro said. But people in the region who depend on small farms are painfully aware of changes to weather patterns that can ruin crops and decimate incomes. Pausing for a rest as the first of the three recent migrant caravans passed through the Mexican town of Huixtla last week, Jesús Canan described how he used to sow maize and beans on a hectare of land near the ancient Copán ruins in western Honduras. An indigenous Ch’orti’ Maya, Canan abandoned his lands this year after repeated crop failures – which he attributed to drought and changing weather patterns.“It didn’t rain this year. Last year it didn’t rain,” he said softly. “My maize field didn’t produce a thing. With my expenses, everything we invested, we didn’t have any earnings. There was no harvest.” Desperate and dreaming of the United States, Canan hit the road in early October and joined the migrant caravan. He left behind a wife and three children – ages 16, 14 and 11 – who were forced to abandon school because Canan couldn’t afford to pay for their supplies. “It wasn’t the same before. This is forcing us to emigrate,” he said. “In past years, it rained on time. My plants produced, but there’s no longer any pattern [to the weather].” US Customs and Border Patrol data shows a surge in outward migration fromwestern Honduras, a prime coffee-producing area, said Stephanie Leutert, an expert in Central American migration and security at the University of Texas. Many of those are farmers or agricultural workers who take to the road when coffee-growing is no longer profitable – such as Antonio Lara, 25, from the Honduran city of Ocotepeque, who joined the caravan with his wife and children, aged six and 18 months.“Coffee used to be worth something, but it’s been seven years since there was a decent price,” he said.Lara said he thought that changing weather patterns had a lot to do with the problem, though he also blamed his plight on greedy bosses and coffee dealers. “I didn’t leave my country because I wanted to. I left because I had to,” he said. A third of all employment in Central America is linked to agriculture, so any disruption to farming practices can have devastating consequences. Since around 2012, coffee plants across Central America have been ravaged by an epidemic called leaf rust, which according to some estimates has affected 70% of farms. Normally, the fungus dies when temperatures drop in the evening but warmer nights are allowing it to thrive, said Sam Dupre, a researcher at the University of Maryland Baltimore County. The impact of climate change on the fungus remains in debate, but Dupre said the situation in Guatemala “shows even without a direct climate change link what happens when these global commodities fail”. “One of the things I found was that people, largely because they weren’t able to pay their debts, to get money for food, they started to migrate,” Dupre said. “People were telling me before the coffee leaf rust hit, we didn’t migrate. Now we do. It’s normal.” A study of Central American migrants by the World Food Program last year found that nearly half described themselves as food insecure. The research found an increasing trend of young people moving as a result of knock-on poverty and lack of work. Climate change is bringing more extreme and unpredictable weather to the region: summer rainfall is starting later and has become more irregular. Drought fuelled by El Niño has gripped much of Central America over the past four years, but the period has been occasionally punctuated by disastrous flooding rains.  As a result, more than 3 million people have struggled to feed themselves. “Coffee and maize are sensitive to temperature and rainfall changes,” said Albro. “If a coffee crop fails you can’t just turn on a dime and do something else, it takes a long time to recover. There have been several lost crops in a row and it’s caused tremendous hardship for small-scale farming.” Farmers first migrate to urban areas, where they confront a new set of problems, which in turn prompt them to consider an international odyssey. “There’s an internal movement where someone will go to, say, Guatemala City and then perhaps get extorted by a gang and then move to the US,” said Leutert. “When they get here they will say they’ve moved because of violence – but climate change was the exacerbating factor.” More than 50,000 Guatemalan families were apprehended trying to cross the US border in the year to October, double the number of the previous year, according to US Customs and Border Protection. People move for a tangle of different reasons, and climate change’s influence is often far-reaching and yet hard to measure, but the World Bank estimates that warming temperatures and extreme weather will force an estimated 3.9 million climate migrants to flee Central America over the next 30 years. This mass movement of people risks destabilising their home countries and presents a challenge for destinations such as the US. The 1951 UN refugee convention sets out clear criteria for the granting of asylum, such as persecution and war, but climate change is not on the list. With an estimated 150 million to 300 million climate refugees set to be displaced worldwide by 2050, a new international framework will be needed to accommodate them. “If your farm has been dried to a crisp or your home has been inundated with water and you’re fleeing for your life, you’re not much different from any other refugee,” said Michael Doyle, an international relations scholar at Columbia University. “The problem is that other refugees fleeing war qualify for that status, while you don’t.” Doyle is part of a group of academics and advocates pushing for a new treaty that would focus on the needs of displaced people, rather than their exact reason for leaving, in order to cover the expected wave of climate migrants. Any reform of the landmark refugee agreement is “quite unlikely at present”, Doyle said, due to the complexity of such a new arrangement, as well as the rise of nationalist governments in places such as the US. “The president of the US is using migrant caravans as a political wedge issue as a way to get elected,” Doyle said. “If we reopen the 1951 convention, it’s more likely to be weakened than strengthened. We aren’t in a state where reforms, however sensible, can be made. There just isn’t the global statesmanship at the moment, nowhere near it.”"
"As Mexico City wakes up on any given weekday, most of its citizens participate in a familiar, survival-of-the-fittest routine: commuting in the car-dependent megapolis. It is one of honking, tire-screeching, yelling chilango curses out of sedan windows and, more recently, glimpsing occasional plants among the sea of grey concrete. The Via Verde project has focused on “turning Mexico City’s grey to green” through the construction of vertical gardens on columns along the Periférico highway, which rings the central city. The photogenic plants climbing up the freeway barriers have featured in countless videos in the local and international media, and often referenced as a sign of the polluted city’s changing priorities.  However, a small but vocal group of activists argues that the government’s support for Via Verde indicates its willingness to double-down on car culture in a city that is already choked with traffic and smog. The “greening” of the highway is simply making car ownership marginally more pleasant, they say. “In Mexico City, almost all of our local pollution and mobility problems can be attributed to the excessive use of private cars,” says Sergio Andrade-Ochoa, public health coordinator for the NGO Liga Peatonal. “We could just plant trees, but there’s a political fear of limiting the space in the city that is currently devoted to cars.” The idea for Via Verde emerged in 2016, when architect Fernando Ortiz Monasterio of the firm Verde Vertical started a Change.org petition to gauge public support. The petition outlines specific goals: promising to “produce enough oxygen for more than 25,000 residents, filter more than 27,000 tonnes of harmful gas yearly, capture more than 5,000kg of dust, and process more than 10,000kg of heavy metals”. The petition also assured supporters of the project’s minimal impact: the vertical garden technology does not jeopardise a wall’s structural integrity, while drip irrigation uses rainwater and other non-potable sources. Monasterio’s friend, the actor Luis Gerardo Méndez, helped publicise the petition and it quickly amassed the 80,000 signatures needed to attract government attention. Verde Vertical was approved. “All these groups were involved in revising this citizen proposal because it sounded like something that would do Mexico City good,” said the former head of Mexico City’s government, Miguel Ángel Mancera Espinosa, in 2016. “Via Verde could simultaneously change the look of the city and help us meet today’s biggest commitment: the fight against climate change.” When it came to funding, Verde Vertical also looked to public opinion. Organisers conducted a survey with various options for funding: government funding via taxes, citizen funding via donations to a public trust, or private funding via corporations (with the qualification that 10% of the columns would be used for corporate advertisement). Private funding won, with almost 47% of the 2,440 votes. Subsequently, a group of eligible corporations invested the 300 million pesos (£12m) needed. Construction on greening the 1,000 concrete columns began later in 2016 and, so far the plants are thriving. Monasterio, sitting at the window of his office overlooking the Via Verde, is pleased with the way things have worked out: “I’m a capitalist-environmentalist,” he says with a laugh. Others, however, are less pleased. The Liga Peatonal says the project has failed to live up to its environmental promises. In a pointed comment piece on the online news site Animal Politico, Juan Manuel Berdeja and Sergio Andrade Ochoa reminded residents that improving air quality and combatting climate change are not the same thing. While plants are crucial for combating climate change, using plants to mitigate air pollution through the process of phytoremediation – changing carbon into oxygen – is more complex. Only a few species have the capacity to purify the air in the way that the Via Verde petition indicated, and the succulents and other plants Verde Vertical favours for their low maintenance needs are not among them. The current Via Verde website has no mention of local anti-pollution benefits, and Monasterio acknowledges that the carbon reduction impact of the project is negligible. Roberto Remes of the city’s Autoridad del Espacio Público says that meeting greenhouse gas and local emissions goals was “never the intention”. One graphic illustrates that building a single Via Verde column costs the same as planting 300 trees. In a city with a deficit of green space, it is a powerful image. While Via Verde is privately funded, it is an effort that the government has eagerly co-signed. The Liga Peatonal is among several activists groups who believe the project is a facelift that distracts from other, less-sustainable actions that the city has recently taken. “There has been a lot of hypocrisy within the government,” says Ochoa. “They celebrate this Via Verde as the project that’s going to create a garden within the city, then they chop down more than 3,000 trees to construct the Mixcoac interchange [recently completed in the south of the city]. “The idea of turning a grey city green feels good to its inhabitants. But in reality it’s just aesthetics. At the end of the day, it’s not going to change the city.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"
"Vital roads, bridges, rail lines and hospitals in the Glasgow area are at significant risk of being damaged or closed by climate change, a major study has found. The study, thought to be the most in-depth carried out for any city region in the UK, said that by 2050 the area will be hit by far more powerful storms, by regular heatwaves and by heavy winter flooding, affecting up to 1.8 million people. That could see hospitals struggling to cope with abnormal temperatures or flooding, long stretches of motorway closed by floods, the West Highland line at risk of closure from coastal erosion and bridges at greater risk from gale-force winds. The review by Climate Ready Clyde, a coalition of six councils, transport agencies, universities and government agencies, covers an area of about 3,400 km2 (1,300 sq miles) and includes major towns such as Hamilton, Motherwell, East Kilbride and Paisley. It was published on Wednesday to mark UN World Cities day. With findings likely to be replicated across the UK, it has warned that failing to adapt and prepare for climate change could cost the Glasgow region several hundred million pounds a year by the 2050s from storm, flooding and heatwave impacts. In a new five-year plan for the region, the group will recommend including better physical and natural flood defences, more air conditioning and ventilation systems, greater tree cover and greater use of green roofs, and wind barriers on bridges. Some councils could seek new powers to issue their own bonds, to raise money from investors to cover the extra costs. If coastal erosion accelerates, several hundred metres of the West Highland line to Fort William will be threatened by the sea along the north Clyde coastline near Ardmore Point, Cardross and Dumbarton. Long stretches of coast have already been eroded significantly. Other sites most at risk include: • the Erskine bridge over the Clyde, which carries 38,000 cars a day, will see “extreme exposure” to stronger gales and could require costly wind barriers • the M74 motorway near Hamilton and the M8 in central Glasgow, used by 97,000 cars a day, is at high risk of flooding • the Royal Alexandra teaching hospital in Paisley is at high risk of surface water flooding and medium to high risk of river flooding • the poorest neighbourhoods of north and east Glasgow are the most vulnerable to the economic and social impacts of heatwaves and flooding Kit England, project manager at Climate Ready Clyde, said the NHS, Transport Scotland, Network Rail and local councils are carrying out more detailed studies to make sure they could forecast risks to their buildings and infrastructure. Glasgow had a hint of the heatwaves to come last June, he said, when temperatures nearly hit 32C, the city’s hottest day on record. A waterproofing membrane lining the roof of the Glasgow science centre melted, while suburban rail lines closed after rails buckled and signalling systems failed. Warning that the poorest citizens are likely to be the worst affected, its assessment assumes that world governments will fail to meet the target to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C recommended earlier this month by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). It has reviewed two scenarios where the world warms by 2C and 4C. Climate scientists forecast that the chances of Glasgow experiencing a summer heatwave by the 2050s will be one in three, compared to 1 in 30 for Aberdeen. Winter rainfall could increase by 50% by the 2080s while sea levels in the Firth of Clyde are forecast to rise by nearly half a metre by the 2080s. James Curran, the former chief executive of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, who chairs Climate Ready Clyde, said warming is already influencing today’s weather patterns. “We know climate change is with us and there is no natural weather left in the world,” he said. “We have to start adapting for it as well as continuing to press the urgent case for reducing carbon emissions and promoting carbon sequestration and so on.” Curran said weather-proofing urban areas would also provide business opportunities and an economic stimulus, offsetting the costs of climate adaptation. The challenge was ensuring all levels of government, transport bodies and businesses collaborated effectively and at a regional level. Network Rail said it spent some £25m a year in Scotland on earthworks and drainage, but added it would need see dramatic changes to the north Clyde coastline before doing work to specially protect the West Highland line."

"A piece of the United States has been dramatically wiped off the map after an island in Hawaii was washed away by a powerful hurricane. East Island, a remote spit of gravel and sand that sat atop a coral reef, has vanished after having this misfortune to come into contact with Hurricane Walaka, an intense storm that surged past Hawaii earlier this month. Scientists have confirmed the disappearance of the 11-acre island after comparing satellite images of the surrounding French Frigate Shoals, part of an enormous protected marine area in the north-western Hawaiian Islands. “I uttered a swear word. I had a ‘holy cow!’ moment, somewhat in disbelief that it had disappeared,” said Chip Fletcher, a professor of earth sciences at the University of Hawaii. Fletcher and his colleagues were in the process of researching East Island through drone videos and taking samples of sand and corals to ascertain the age of the island and gauge its future prospects in the face of climate change. “The island was probably one to two thousand years old and we were only there in July, so for it to be lost right now is pretty bad luck,” Fletcher said. “We wanted to monitor the island so we are disappointed it has gone, but on the other hand we have learned these islands are far more at risk than we thought. I thought the island would be around for a decade or two longer, but it’s far more fragile than I appreciated. The top, middle and bottom of it has gone.” East Island was, at about half a mile long and 400ft wide, the second largest island in the the French Frigate Shoals, an atoll in the far western reaches of the Hawaiian archipelago. Until 1952, it hosted a US Coast Guard radar station. Despite its size, the island played an important role for wildlife, including the critically endangered Hawaiian monk seal, a species that numbers just 1,400 individuals, with many of the seals raising their young on East Island. Green sea turtles, which are also threatened, and seabirds such as albatrosses, which often had their young preyed upon by circling tiger sharks, also depended on the island. “The loss is a huge blow,” Fletcher said. “Little did we know it could disappear so quickly.” If conditions align, an atoll would always be at a small risk of being erased by a powerful hurricane. But climate change is causing the ocean and atmosphere to warm, making storms fiercer, while there’s evidence that hurricanes are moving further north into the latitudes where East Island once lay. Rising sea levels are also eroding away low-lying islands, with several fragments of land in the Pacific vanishing in recent years. “The take-home message is climate change is real and it’s happening now,” Randy Kosaki, a senior official for the Hawaii monument at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told Honolulu Civil Beat, which first reported the disappearance of East Island. “It’s not a hoax propagated in China as some folks have said.” The French Frigate Shoals sits in the Papahānaumokuākea marine national monument, which became the largest marine reserve in the world when expanded by the Obama administration in 2016. The 1,350-mile string of coral islands, seamounts and shoals feature a riot of life, including coral, fish, birds and mammals, many unique to Hawaii.A statement by the federal managers of the monument said that East Island “appears to be under water”, while the neighboring Tern island had its shape altered by the hurricane. “Monument co-managers are working to better understand the implications for cultural resources and wildlife, protected species and their habitat within the Monument,” the statement added. “We will continue to monitor the species and islands to better assess the impacts from the hurricane. Based on the data, managers will determine next steps and management actions.”"
"Scientists this week warned that the latest IPCC report on global warming could be underestimating the impact of “tipping points”, such as the loss of polar ice caps, which might lead to “runaway warming”. A tipping point is the point at which nothing is the same again. The idea became famous with Malcolm Gladwell’s 2000 eponymous book, which informed excited readers that the tipping point of fax machine usage was the year 1987. But what exactly is being tipped? If you have in mind the image of something toppling over, you are not wrong. In the 1890s, the tipping point was the point beyond which a listing ship could no longer right itself, or the point at which – in a machine proposed to weigh the water of a flowing stream – a cup being filled with water would tilt and transfer its contents to the next cup down.  The metaphorical usage, though, has an unhappier origin. Dictionaries tell us that in the 1950s the tipping point was the number of African Americans moving into a neighbourhood that caused white people to start moving out. Given the coming mass migrations from regions made uninhabitable, that painful echo might prove unexpectedly apt to global warming, too."

"Films such as A Plastic Ocean, and the huge success of Blue Planet II, have brought ocean plastic pollution firmly into the popular domain. Plastic has become ubiquitous through the world’s oceans, with fragments found in deep ocean trenches and the Arctic ice sheets. Furthermore, pictures of charismatic animals such as whales and turtles consuming or entangled in plastic provide powerful imagery of the problem to the public. There is no doubt plastic is a big issue. A study in the journal Marine Policy suggests plastic pollution might be reaching a planetary boundary, a term used to describe safe operational environmental limits within which the world can continue to function safely.  Yet, for all the attention given to ocean plastic, it is not the biggest threat to the marine environment. Both climate change and biodiversity loss (much of which is caused by the impacts of overfishing of our oceans) were shown to have exceeded their respective planetary boundaries when the term was first introduced, in 2009. More recent studies also flag climate change and biodiversity as the two core planetary boundaries. Excessively exceeding these for a prolonged period could cause rapid and major changes, such as runaway temperature rises or the collapse of important ecosystem functions. The world’s largest living structure, Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, has undergone successive and large-scale bleaching events in the past few years, with an estimated 50% of coral dead due to bleaching in the past two years. These events, along with degradation of other marine habitats such as kelp forests and seagrass beds, are directly attributable to climate change. The latest official report from the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation suggests that 33% of fisheries are overfished and 60% fully exploited, while a controversial new study contends that more than 50% of the area of the oceans is affected by fishing each year. Nor can the effects of plastic on animal populations and their ecosystems be easily determined. Large plastic items break down into smaller microplastics, and many experts think the effects of these may be less than ingestion of larger items, which can cause choking and block digestive systems. Given these facts, we should ask why overfishing and climate change do not get at least as much attention as plastic when considering the marine environment. We propose this is because plastic pollution provides a “convenient truth”, allowing individuals, corporations and politicians to appear environmentally conscious while ignoring the root of all environmental problems, which is overconsumption of resources. Large-scale technological solutions, such as the Ocean Cleanup project, provide optimism from the concerned, documentary-watching public that the plastic problem is being addressed. Eliminating plastic straws, promoting reusable coffee cups or having a plastic-free supermarket aisle are easy PR wins for large companies that will barely affect profits. These same token gestures not only attract environmentally conscious customers, but make customers feel they are contributing to an environmental solution. In truth, much bigger individual behavioural changes need to be made, such as drastically altering our diets to greatly reduce fish and meat, reducing car and aeroplane use and even reducing the number of children we decide to have. To provide some context, if airlines eliminated single-use plastic, this might save about 20 grams of plastic a person on a typical transatlantic flight. However, each passenger on that plane would be responsible for roughly one tonne of carbon dioxide emissions, around half a million times more greenhouses gasses than plastic waste. Governments have the power to enforce change, but are reluctant to do so. The world is not on target to meet the Paris climate agreement targets to keep temperature rises to 2C. One reason for this reluctance is the neoliberal agenda, which is still pervasive in most western countries. Markets will adjust to consumer demand, but this is too little, too late to address the scale and urgency of the environmental threat. In terms of fisheries, the British government has a real opportunity to change fishing practices with Brexit. However, there is an apparent unwillingness to change the status quo significantly. Some foreign boats will probably be allowed into UK waters, either to secure export rights to those countries, or to sell fishing rights. Ultimately, most governments believe in the need for economic growth, beside which environmental concerns will generally be neglected. While token gestures and technological fixes will have some effect in reducing plastic pollution in the marine environment, as a collective public we need to demand change from large corporations and from governments on all environmental policies. We also need to understand the sacrifices necessary to ensure the future of humanity. At an international level, we need policies and legislation to prevent excessive overconsumption by individuals and companies, including the promotion of open source ideas around product reuse to maximise re-use and recycling of all products. It is also vital that we find alternative metrics to wellbeing, beyond our myopic focus on economic growth, if we are to reduce consumption and achieve global targets on climate, food production and even plastic waste.

"Unless every poll is wildly wrong, Brazil will probably elect a racist, sexist, homophobic advocate of torture at the end of this month. The former army captain Jair Bolsonaro nearly won outright in the first round, securing the votes of almost 50 million people – despite his extreme views being well known. What is less well understood, however, is the catastrophic environment implications of his rise to the brink of power. And in this, Bolsonaro is not unique: around the world, diminishing resources are fuelling a global rise of authoritarian leaders dedicated to doing the bidding of some of the world’s most environmentally damaging interests.  The Brazilian election results were announced on 8 October – just as climate scientists were issuing their most dramatic warning yet that humanity has just 12 years to slash emissions or suffer the consequences of dangerous global warming. If countries do not start planting trees and cutting fossil fuels now, they said, then it will be impossible to prevent a rise of more than 0.5C, which would completely eradicate all of the world’s corals and irreversibly disrupt weather systems, bringing droughts, floods and extreme heat that will push hundreds of millions into poverty. History tells us that when environments deteriorate, societies turn to supposed strongmen and religious zealots rather than smart, pragmatic leaders. That is happening now. In addition to the dictatorships of China, Russia and Saudi Arabia, a growing number of young democracies have relapsed into authoritarianism: the Philippines under Rodrigo Duterte, Turkey under Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Egypt under Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, and next, it would seem, Brazil under Bolsonaro. And underlying this is environmental stress, which has been building for over two centuries. Starting in Britain, the carbon-capitalist industrial model has long been extracting minerals and organic resources, and discharging the waste into the air, sea and land. As more nations developed, they exported their environmental stress to the next country rising up the economic ladder. Now that this paradigm is being replicated by the world’s most populous country, China, there are very few places left to absorb the impact. Competition for what is left is growing. So is violence and extremism. Centre-ground politicians who once talked chummily about “win-win solutions” have been pushed to the sidelines. No one believes this any more. Voters may not see this in environmental terms, but consciously or subconsciously they know something is broken, that tinkering is no longer enough. In the US, with massive support from the fossil-fuel industry, Donald Trump has undermined the Environmental Protection Agency, opened up swaths of national parks to industry, cut pollution controls and promised to pull out of the Paris accord. In Australia, Malcolm Turnbull was ejected from power by his colleagues because he tried to fulfil promises to cut carbon emissions. And now in Brazil, voters are backing a politician who has vowed to pull his country out of the Paris deal, abolish the main government agency tackling deforestation and end the demarcation of indigenous land. Bolsonaro has the backing of agribusiness and mining leaders, who are rubbing their hands in glee at the prospect of an Amazon denuded of its greatest protections. The markets – which are heavily driven by extractive industries – also love him. The main stock index and exchange rate of the Brazilian real spiked after his first round win. An editorial in the Wall Street Journal endorsed him as a “conservative populist”. Such neo-fascist politicians should not be blithely dismissed. They are the hired guns of the industries working against the Paris accord and other international agreements that aim to prevent further environmental catastrophes, which hit the poorest hardest. Their “anti-globalism” is first and foremost anti-nature and anti-future. An extraction-first approach may bring economic benefits in the short term, as cronies and campaign donors clear more forests, open up plantations and dig more mines – but the profits are concentrated while the environmental stress is shared. The great fear climate scientists have is that a warming planet could create feedback loops that will make everything much worse. But there has not been enough study of economic and political feedback loops. How drought in China puts pressure on the Amazon to produce more food and clear more forest. Or how powerful business interests will choose a dictator over a democrat if it means easing environmental controls that threaten their ability to meet quarterly growth targets. We are already seeing a widening gap between politicians and scientists. While the latter urge more ambitious climate action, the former know they will receive more campaign funds if they oppose emissions cuts, support extractive industries and weaken pollution regulations. It is not just dictatorships. Britain is pushing ahead with fracking, Germany with coal and Norway with oil exploration. At some point, voters will realise that ecological stress is at the core of the world’s current woes. The aha! moment may be when water grows prohibitively expensive, or crops fail owing to successive heatwaves, or the refugee crisis sparks war, but at some point the weakness of the strongmen will be apparent, and people will seek change. The danger is, by then it may be too late. Climate and politics alike will have passed a tipping point, leading to social chaos and the morphing of populists into full-blown dictators-for-life. That is not yet inevitable, but the risks are growing. What has become clearer than ever is that the best way to avoid climate and ecological collapse is by voting for leaders who make this a priority. It will be impossible to fix the economy unless you first fix the environment. The global instinct for radical change is right, but unless that is geared towards ecological rebuilding the world’s democracies may go extinct before the corals do. • Jonathan Watts is the Guardian’s global environment editor"
"The thought of rising sea levels and more intense heatwaves are enough to keep you up at night. But while we all know the situation is getting more serious, most of us are preoccupied with work, doctor’s appointments and paying bills – and these immediate, visceral worries win every time. There isn’t much time left to figure out how to bring global warming closer to the forefront of people’s minds and persuade us to reduce our carbon footprints. In fact, we have just 12 years left to keep global warming to 1.5C, according to last week’s landmark UN report. Anything beyond this will massively worsen the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people.  Reducing our meat intake is crucial to avoiding climate breakdown, since food production accounts for about a quarter of all human-related greenhouse gas emissions, and is predicted to rise. In western countries, this means eating 90% less beef and five times as many beans and pulses. Edible insects have been hailed as a solution to both global food shortages and reducing emissions from animal agriculture, but despite the industry’s best efforts, our response when faced with a cockroach is disgust. Even in London edible insects are seen as nothing more than a gimmick, and there are only a handful of restaurants serving them up. But new research from Switzerland and Germany may have found out how to persuade people to eat insects – and it could have a huge impact on lowering human-led carbon emissions. Up until now, retailers and restaurants have marketed edible insects as a more sustainable option and a healthy source of protein. But the researchers explain the problem with getting people to switch to environmentally friendly behaviour is that it often requires foregoing immediate pleasure for distant benefits, and edible insects have been wrongly framed in this way. Before the 180 participants in the study were offered a chocolate truffle filled with mealworms, half of the group were given a flyer saying that eating insects was good for them and the environment, while the other half were told the insects were either delicious or trendy to eat. About 62% of those given health or environmental incentives chose to eat the truffle, compared with 76% who ate the truffle after being told it would taste good or make them trendy. And the latter group rated the truffle as tastier. The researchers concluded that we need to switch the message about saving the planet from altruism to pleasure. They back up their argument with previous studies showing that attitudes based on emotions are more malleable than those grounded in rational claims. The lead researcher, Sebastian Berger, says now that the technology and scale of edible insect farming is improving and increasing prices will start to fall and free up producers to take the study’s findings on board. He cites the food manufacturer Essento Food AG, whichhe says is leading the way in positioning insects as upmarket, delicious food.  He calls this the “sushification” of the mealworm, since raw fish was until 20 years ago also seen by westerners as disgusting to eat.  Veganism, until recently, was viewed as a quirky lifestyle choice or protest, but about 3.5 million people in the UK alone now eat a vegan diet. There are several arguments for swapping meat for plants: health and environmental benefits, and it tastes better. Given the new study, focusing on the taste benefits of plants could be a huge success. Another study found that labelling vegetables with “indulgent” descriptions such as “dynamite chili and tangy lime-seasoned beets” significantly increased the number of people choosing and eating vegetables compared with those given basic or healthy descriptions, such as “lighter-choice beets with no added sugar” or even “high-antioxidant beets”. This is already happening on a small scale, with some vegan restaurants eschewing the “V' word altogether in their marketing and on menus and presenting themselves as equal to meat, not just a healthy alternative, while some are gaining recognition simply for being “tasty”, not “tasty for vegan food”. The US-based vegan soul food restaurant The Land of Kush was voted best restaurant last year by the Baltimore City Paper. As the vegan food industry expands to meet burgeoning demand, millions of pounds’ worth of investment is going into making plant-based burgers taste just as good or even better than the beef burgers we grew up on. But the less said about how our eating habits could potentially save the planet, perhaps the closer we’ll come to actually achieving it. • Jessica Brown is a freelance journalist"

"The Australian government has appointed marine scientist Ian Poiner as the new chairman of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, days after a dire new forecast for coral bleaching was issued. The appointment to the authority, which manages the reef and advises the government on its care, also comes months after the government granted $443m in reef funding to the private Great Barrier Reef Foundation instead of key agencies including the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority.  Another round of mass coral bleaching caused by heat stress has been forecast for the reef this summer by the US National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration. Poiner is a former chief executive of the Australian Institute of Marine Science and the current chairman of the Reef and Rainforest Research Centre (RRRC). He will take over from the outgoing chair and chief executive, Russell Reichelt. The RRRC has been the subject of controversy recently over its management of crown-of-thorns starfish projects on the Great Barrier Reef. “Dr Poiner is a highly respected marine scientist with international science credentials and board leadership experience,” the environment minister, Melissa Price, said on Monday. “He has a long history of involvement in Great Barrier Reef science and conservation, and is a former CEO of the Australian Institute of Marine Science. I have no doubt he will make a significant contribution to the continued health and resilience of the reef.” Price said Poiner had resigned from his position as the chair of the RRRC. The announcement also follows recent calls for improved governance at Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority after the board member Margie McKenzie agreed to resign over potential conflicts of interest in relation to $20m in tenders managed by the body. Poiner said on Monday the authority played an important role in ensuring the reef was protected “by managing the delicate balance between conservation and sustainable use”. “As a scientist, and through my involvement in other science organisations, I have a strong interest in reef health and management and look forward to working with fellow board members,” he said. “I’m particularly interested in how threats are impacting the Great Barrier Reef and what actions can be taken to improve its resilience, which is a key focus of the Marine Park Authority’s work.” The Australian Marine Conservation Society welcomed the appointment but called on Poiner to take an “aggressive conservation stance” on behalf of the reef. “His most urgent and important task is to call on the federal government to undertake rapid and far-reaching action to tackle climate change to protect the future of the Great Barrier Reef,” Imogen Zethoven, the Australian Marine Conservation Society’s Great Barrier Reef campaign director said. “We urge Dr Poiner to tell the minister for environment, Melissa Price, that we stand to lose the reef unless the federal government rules out any new thermal coalmines including Adani’s Carmichael mine and switches rapidly to renewable energy in the next decade.” Poiner has been appointed under new governance arrangements for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, which were recommended after an independent review of the authority last year and took effect on Monday. Among the recommendations were that the position of chair and chief executive of the authority be separated and that the authority’s board should comprise seven members. The review said this should include a CEO and a part-time chair “of integrity, national credibility and standing who would not be perceived as representing a reef interest group”. The government accepted all of the review’s 24 recommendations. Reichelt has led the authority for 11 years. “Dr Reichelt is an outstanding scientist and marine park manager,” Price said. “He has successfully managed the world renowned Great Barrier Reef marine park over a time of significant environmental challenges and has implemented many substantial measures to improve the management of this world famous icon.”"
"Economist Jeffrey Sachs has criticised successive Australian governments for “defending a 19th or 20th century industry” rather than taking decisive action on climate change, saying Australia should be “exporting sunshine, not coal”. “Make a plan, make a timeline, tell the world how you’re going to decarbonise, and then we’ll all be happy to hear from Australia that there’s really a plan,” Sachs said on the ABC’s Q&A program on Monday night. “All we see is one PM after another falling over this issue.”  Also on the panel were UK conservative writer James Bartholomew, Victorian Liberal party senator James Paterson, Labor frontbencher Terri Butler and data science teacher Linda McIver. The debate followed the release last week of an alarming report by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which warned that fossil fuels would have to be urgently phased out in order to achieve a global reduction in carbon pollution of 45% by 2030, the level required to ensure the planet only warmed by between 1.5C and 2C. The Australian government has rejected the warning to phase out coal by 2050. Paterson told Q&A the environment was “one of many priorities” for the Morrison government, with another being power prices. About 60% of Australia’s baseload power is currently generated by coal-fired power generators, but the proportion of renewable energy is increasing thanks to energy auctions in Victoria and South Australia, the Tesla battery in South Australia, and reduced cost of renewable technologies. Labor has committed to 50% renewable energy by 2030. Sachs said the IPCC report showed the world was “running out of time” to avoid catastrophic climate change and blamed corporate interests and the domination of the Murdoch press for “propounding nonsense” and “telling lies” about climate science and policy. He said Australia ought to capitalise on its affinity for solar power. “This wonderful country has so much sunshine, you cannot even believe – you could power the whole world from your desert,” he said. “So the idea that you don’t have alternatives … I don’t know who could possibly believe this. You should be exporting sunshine actually, not coal.” Bartholomew questioned the IPCC figures, saying that he “knew a scientist” who did not agree with it. “The IPCC report is based on thousands of scientific reports,” host Tony Jones said in response to Bartholomew’s scepticism. “Six thousand scientific reports and 91 authors and review editors from 40 countries. I mean, balancing that out against the one scientist you know, does it mean that we have to think about consensus?” McIver said her year 10 students had been modelling data from the IPCC report, and even they could see the figures were robust. “The idea there is not consensus around climate change is outrageous,” she said. The panel also heard from Kevin Muslayah, the deputy principal of Red Rock Christian College in Melbourne’s north-western suburbs, who referred to the yet to be released Ruddock report into religious freedom. Muslayah said his school would like to retain the right to hire, and possibly fire, LGBTI teachers based on “a particular alignment of values”. Butler said there was no justification for discriminating against LGBTI teachers or students, saying: “A gay teacher doesn’t teach gay maths. They just teach maths.” Paterson said legislation before parliament this month would prevent discrimination against students on the basis of gender or sexual identity. He said the government would also move to protect teachers “who are willing to teach the values of that school” but said religious schools should retain discretion over who they hire."
"Climate change is already exacerbating domestic and international conflicts, and governments must take steps to ensure it does not get worse, the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross has said. Peter Maurer told Guardian Australia it was already making an impact and humanitarian organisations were having to factor it into their work far earlier than they were expecting.  “In many parts of the world where we work it’s not a distant engagement,” he said. “When I think about our engagement in sub-Saharan Africa, in Somalia, in other places of the world, I see that climate change has already had a massive impact on population movement, on fertility of land. It’s moving the border between pastoralist and agriculturalist.” Maurer, who was in Australia to speak about the changing nature of modern conflict, said concern about the impact of climate change in the Pacific was “enormous”. He said changing rainfall patterns change the fertility of land and push populations, who may have settled and subsisted in one area for centuries, to migrate. “It’s very obvious that some of the violence that we are observing … is directly linked to the impact of climate change and changing rainfall patterns.” Earlier this month the United Nation’s climate panel, the IPCC, gave the world just 12 years to make the drastic but necessary changes. Its report said emissions had to be cut by 45% before 2030 if warming was to be restricted to 1.5C. At 1.5C, 10 million fewer people would be affected by rising sea levels, and the proportion of the world’s population exposed to water stress could be 50% lower. A 2016 study, which examined three decades of data, determined that a 1C rise in temperatures in a country reliant on agriculture correlated with a 5% increase in migration to other countries. “When [populations] start to migrate in big numbers it leads to tensions between the migrating communities and the local communities. This is very visible in contexts like the Central African Republic, like Mali and other places,” said Maurer. He said it was up to governments, not humanitarians, to develop the policies needed to deal with the “root causes” of climate change. “As a humanitarian I am used to political decisions … never [being] as fast as we hope for them, or as generous or as big, but it’s encouraging an increasing number are recognising the importance of the issue and are taking steps to reduce the impact of climate change on our habitat – the Paris Agreement is an important step forward,” he said. “For us we hope the international community will soon enough take necessary steps, so at the end of the day they won’t have to pay by increasing humanitarian impacts which, again, we already see in other conflicts.” Donald Trump said little about the IPCC report, having already pledged to withdraw the US from the Paris Agreement. This made things difficult for everyone else, Ola Elvestuen, Norway’s environment minister, said last month, but still called for countries to transition away from fossil fuels, embrace electric cars and halt deforestation. The Australian government largely dismissed the IPCC report and its recommendations – which included the rapid phase out of coal – as well as the pleas of Pacific Island nations. Australia has no formal energy or climate change policy, and the Coalition government at one point flagged pulling out of the Paris Agreement. MPs and ministers maintain that Australia is on track to meet emissions reductions targets, despite official government figures on emissions suggesting Australia will not, according to current projections. On Sunday Australia’s treasurer and former energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, rejected the suggestion it should get his government rethink its policies. He said the government did not intend to “reduce emissions at the expense of people’s power bills”. Anote Tong, the former president of Kiribati, was in Australia this week advocating for action. “It’s not about the marginal rise in price or reduction in price of energy, it’s about lives, it’s about the future,” he told Guardian Australia. Maurer said there were now more people displaced than ever before, approaching 70m across the globe. Two thirds are displaced internally, and most of those who fled would go to a neighbouring country. “At the end of the day there is no single policy that allows in any satisfactory way a response to these issues, but there are multiple things which can be done,” he said."
"When I saw the government’s latest energy policy proposal, I was disappointed but not surprised. Just a few weeks ago I was speaking with a few utilities analysts and players, wargaming the absolute worst thing a party with just a few months to live could do to Australia’s energy policy and how far they could roll back some commendable progress to date.  What we came up with revolved around the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission recommendations. They were very sensible but we figured they had substantial scope for selective and perverse implementation. At one point, we joked about the possibility that this good advice could be turned into a policy to subsidise companies that own coal plants and coal. Turns out that is exactly what has happened. It’s worth starting with the original ACCC recommendations and how and why the regulator was trying to achieve greater competition in wholesale electricity markets. The ACCC had opposed the sale of New South Wales’s generation assets to AGL in 2014 over concerns about what it would do to competition. With the benefit of hindsight most would now agree they were absolutely correct in doing so. Their suggestions about limiting further concentration in the market were sound and had precedents elsewhere. The proposed changes to the market operation rules were positive and so was the suggestion that some kind of settled policy to reduce greenhouse emissions would be helpful. And then there was recommendation four, which in essence said the government should offer to underwrite new generation projects by promising to guarantee contracts in their later years at a fixed rate – an idea designed to make it easier for new players to enter a heavily concentrated market. The problem with power markets in general, much like any portfolio, is that diversification reduces risk and to be diversified you have to be very large. As with other capital-intensive businesses it is a hard sector to enter without the capacity to borrow. After a decade or more of climate chaos, a carbon tax and a renewable energy target that has had a few near death experiences in the Senate, Australian banks quite rightly look at lending to this sector with some trepidation compared to other markets. Not losing money does not just depend on the laws of supply and demand but the utterly chaotic behaviour of our politicians. It has gotten so awful that it has earned rebuke from that hotbed of socialism, the Australian Industry Group. On that basis having the government break the deadlock to get more capacity built and ensure some peaking assets are held by someone other than the usual gentailer suspects makes a great deal of sense. So what has the Morrison government’s energy minister, Angus Taylor, done with those largely sensible suggestions to come up with this perverse policy? First, he set a comically low emissions hurdle, apparently suggesting that a project is fine so long as, on its own, it won’t lead to an increase over the emissions target by 2030. This is disingenuous. No single project is likely to do this unless someone is building a very large brown coal power plant. Essentially, it means there is no emissions component to this plan, in direct conflict with ACCC suggestions. Second, it allows redevelopment of existing projects, to extend their life. Which could these be? It is unlikely to be AGL, Origin, Alinta or Energy Australia, who all have commitments to decarbonisation and plans to gradually replace coal with renewables, gas and hydro. It could, however, be Sunset Power owned by Brian Flannery and former National party candidate and LNP donor Trevor St Baker. Third, the divestment proposal would appear to be designed to compel AGL to sell Liddell. St Baker has previously expressed a strong interest in this asset, and he could now also be eligible for a generous loan and off-take agreement from the government. This is a far cry from the ACCC suggestion that getting simple gas turbines in a box and more wind and solar to more players would be a better approach to increasing competition. And the most disturbing thing about current policy is that it is market intervention to the direct benefit of only some apparently favoured players. The sooner this ends – or the government ends – the sooner Australians can look forward to a cessation of this wholesale assault on free markets with integrity, which I vaguely recall were once what the Liberal party stood for."
"One of the classic moments in the Simpsons comes when the venal TV anchorman Kent Brockman sees on his screen an ant crawling across a lens and assumes at once that this is not a negligible terrestrial arthropod but a giant alien descending from space that will become one of “our new insect overlords”, a species to which he instantly and publicly pledges allegiance. The joke hinges on the idea that in real life ants are inconsequential compared with human beings. The world, we feel, could get on perfectly well without them, and still better without mosquitoes or any number of other creepy crawlies. This confidence is quite as mistaken as Kent Brockman’s grovellings. Insects form the greatest part of animal life on Earth, and almost every other kind of animal depends on them – directly or indirectly. They pollinate plants and nourish animals, especially birds. In turn, everything that relies on these plants or animals depends on the insects. And the whole intricate web of interdependent exploitation is collapsing, and has been for decades. We ourselves are part of this web, in the long run quite as much dependent as exploitative.  On the island of Puerto Rico, a rainforest preserved for centuries from human intervention shows a terrifying drop in the abundance and variety of insects. Forty years ago, there were 60 times as many insects on the forest floor as can be trapped today. The bird and lizard species that feed on insects have also been hit, if not to the same extent, falling by between a third and a half over the same period. The same trend is apparent in German nature reserves, where the number of insects appears to have dropped by about 75%; and these are results from places deliberately preserved, so far as possible, from human intervention. The collapse of insect life is obvious to anyone who looks in Britain – butterflies, bees and even the millions of chironomid midges that used to form plumes like smoke around the trees along the shores of reservoirs are all now mostly a memory. Car windscreens and headlights are no longer thickly speckled after any long journey. The causes of this global decline seem to vary with latitude. But they are all, in one way or another, the product of human activity. In the temperate regions insect populations are more adaptable to fluctuations in temperature, but insects must contend with the mass use of pesticides across the bleak monocultures of industrial agriculture, as well as the generalised pollution of the air and water. In the rainforest, where the pattern of losses across species and over time shows that there must be some single vast factor acting on the whole ecosystem, it appears that the main driver is simply the climate catastrophe. The consequences of this collapse lend still more urgency to political efforts to slow and eventually halt climate change; but even as individuals we can follow Candide’s advice and cultivate our gardens so insects can thrive there."

"They couldn’t have been any clearer. If you are worried about climate change, you’ve got to do your bit and reduce your harmful emissions. For some, this will involve switching to an electric car and giving up red meat. For everyone else, there is no excuse not to switch to a green electricity (and in some cases, gas) supplier. And there’s a double incentive to go green – not only does it send the message to the traditional energy firms they have to up their renewable game – it will also, most likely, save money through lower bills.  A British Gas customer, in an average UK home – on the firm’s standard variable tariff – spends about £1,200 a year heating and lighting their home. If they live in a bigger house, or have teenage children, bills will be somewhere in the £1,600- to £2,000-a-year range. By switching to Guardian pick Pure Planet – an independent supplier that offers electricity from 100% renewable sources (no nuclear, either) and “100% carbon offset gas” – that same “average” customer can reduce their bill to about £920 a year, a saving in excess of £250.  Pure Planet is one of new entrants to the energy market, but, unlike some others, this has a big firm behind it – BP has a stake. There are two big caveats. Customers have to manage their account via a smartphone app which will not appeal to everyone. Also, the tariff is not fixed, meaning prices could well go up – other suppliers have recently been raising prices. Pure Planet gets good customer reviews on Trustpilot, and Money has not received any complaints. Pure Planet’s Steven Day says prices across the whole market will likely rise over the next few months, but points out that the new breed of green suppliers will remain among the cheapest suppliers. “Green power is now cheaper than brown and there’s no reason for anyone not to do the right thing and switch over,” he says. If you prefer a supplier you can call – or one that is marginally cheaper – Edinburgh-based People’s Energy offers 100% green electricity but only conventional gas. This will cost the average customer about £900 a year – a £300 saving over British Gas’s standard customer. Again, prices could go up over the coming months. Yorkshire Energy has the cheapest fixed tariff – Green Turtle – fixed until 30 November 2019 at just under £1,000 a year for average gas and electricity usage. Switching supplier is easy and takes about 10 minutes. Dig out a recent bill and do a search using a comparison site such as Energyhelpline.com. Make sure you click on “all plans” to ensure you are shown green deals as well as the suppliers the comparison site may be promoting. "
"On Wednesday I will join hundreds of others in Parliament Square to assert that we will not stand idly by in the face of climate breakdown and ecological crisis. We will affirm a commitment to engage in non-violent but illegal activities to try and force urgent action. Collectively we have signed a declaration to this effect; an Extinction Rebellion against the British government for criminal inaction. Over decades we have all operated in our different spheres of life – whether as journalists, academics, politicians, campaigners and educators – to ring the alarm about the way planetary life support systems are being destroyed. But a powerful alliance of wealthy individuals and multinational corporations, backed by complicit politicians, has subverted the political process and blocked action. This is why, whoever we are and whatever we do, we are coming together now to say we are prepared to engage in civil disobedience to force urgent climate action.  We are prepared to halt lorries entering fracking sites; to stand in the way of bulldozers building roads and block traffic along heavily congested and polluted streets. Direct actions like these have a long and proud history; it’s time to carry them through in a systematic way to protect the climate, and to be willing to be arrested for doing so. So how have we have reached a situation where a law maker like me feels there is no alternative but to become a law breaker? Here my Quaker heritage is helpful. Our thin pamphlet of theological guidance ncludes the useful advice: “Respect the laws of the state but let your first loyalty be to God’s purposes.” As a Quaker, I don’t believe that spiritual wisdom resides in books or rituals but in the still, small voice that tells you when something must change. When the inward light, that I believe we all have within us, prompts you to stand up to a fascist bully or to engage in civil disobedience to halt climate breakdown, you have no choice but to follow. I represent some 5 million people in the European parliament. But who represents the generations as yet unborn that will have no chance of a decent and civilised life unless we act on climate change? Who represents the thousands of species that are becoming extinct during the modern era? A mass extinction that is entirely the result of human actions, and which we are living through almost without noticing? I am proud of the way 50 Green MEPs, of 750 elected across Europe, have achieved policy breakthroughs. Just last week we won a vote on banning plastics and limiting the use of antibiotics on farms. And my work on sustainable finance has a real chance of creating financial incentives to shift investment away from fossil fuels and towards projects that will protect wild habitats. But it isn’t enough. Green voters in the UK are grossly underrepresented because of our unfair electoral system. So British policy on energy and transport is stuck in the past, while other European countries with a strong green contingent in their parliaments are far more advanced in the transition towards a green economy. A spur towards direct action against this government and in defence of our planet conveniently appeared this week. As finance speaker for the Green party, I had called for an emergency budget for the climate, and the party issued a challenge: if the budget offers a single pound to climate-wrecking projects it will have failed. Well, the chancellor didn’t mention climate change once in his statement, and, rather than action to avert climate breakdown, we saw the chancellor accelerate it. He threw £30bn at road building while freezing fuel duty for the ninth year running, meaning this now amounts to a £9bn tax giveaway a year. There was also a sneaky £3bn tax break for oil and gas companies in the North Sea, through the removal of “tax barriers” to investment. This was just the enticement we needed to take the government on. The latest IPCC report and Tuesday’s Living Planet report by WWF, which reveals that wildlife populations have declined by more than half in less than 50 years, show how urgently change is needed. It is no exaggeration to say that our survival as a species is at risk. Enough. Enough of words; of hypocrisy and broken promises. It’s time to act. • Molly Scott Cato is Green party MEP for South West England"
"Among the motivating issues for voters in US elections, the environment is typically eclipsed by topics such as healthcare, the economy and guns. But the upcoming midterms could, belatedly, see a stirring of a slumbering green giant. “The environmental movement doesn’t have a persuasion problem, it has a turnout problem,” said Nathaniel Stinnett, the founder of the Environmental Voter Project, which is aiming to spur people who care about the natural world and climate change to the ballot box. “This group has more power than it realizes. In the midterms we want to flood the zone with environmentalists.”  Any such voting surge would go some way to heeding the increasingly urgent warnings from scientists about climate change. A major UN climate report released this week said the world risks worsening floods, droughts, species loss and poverty without “rapid and far-reaching transitions” to energy, transport and land use. “We show it can be done within laws of physics and chemistry,” said Jim Skea, a coauthor of the exhaustive report. “The final tick box is political will. We cannot answer that.” An obstacle in the US is the large pool of environmental voters who don’t actually vote, according to public records and polls analyzed by the Environmental Voter Project. It estimates more than 15 million people who rank the environment as a top tier issue didn’t vote in the 2014 midterms. Since its creation in 2015, the voter project claims it has increased turnout of target voters by as much as 4.5% in elections. In 2018, it is aiming to reach 2.4 million of these voters across six states as part of a turnout effort that could help swing some key races. An army of 1,800 volunteers will knock on doors, fire off text messages, make calls and send mailouts. The “punchline” of the Environmental Voter Project, Stinnett said, is that it doesn’t talk to voters about the environment at all. It simply tries to get them out to vote. “We are already targeting people who care about the environment, all we want to do is get them to vote on election day,” he said. “Peer and social pressure are the best ways – we will send someone a letter saying ‘did you know 93 people in your building turned out to vote last time?’ We play to societal norms and expectations. “Our focus isn’t to change the outcome of particular elections but there’s no doubt the number of non-voting environmentalists in some districts is so large that they will have an impact. We need to hold politicians’ feet to the fire on the environment, but first of all we need some fire.” Americans of voting age who care strongly about the environment have been unusually reticent to make their voice heard, for reasons that are still unclear. Stinnett said demographics are part of it – the young, Latinos and black people are simultaneously most worried about climate change and least likely to vote – but this doesn’t explain the full story. “It’s hard to figure out why,” he said. “Even among young people, for example, environmentalists are less likely to vote. The environmental movement has done a lot of things to change the way we eat, travel and work, but it hasn’t flexed its political muscles yet. Look at the NRA. Their power isn’t in the amount of money they spend – it’s because if you care about gun rights, you vote like it’s your job. Politicians know that and they are in the business of collecting votes. Why would they spend time on an issue that doesn’t appear to energize voters?” Beyond disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires, most politicians and the media, particularly broadcast news, rarely dwell for long on environmental matters. In 2017, the costliest year on record for climate-related disasters, a total of just 260 minutes coverage of climate change was broadcast across the six major TV networks, according to one analysis. A year prior, no questions on climate change were put to Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton during three presidential debates. Trump has subsequently ignored the issue in office, save the odd disparaging tweet, while overseeing an administration that has systematically dismantled climate, air and water pollution regulations. At first glance, the evidence suggests there will be only a mild voter backlash to this agenda. Voters asked recently by Yale to rank 28 issues placed global warming 15th, behind areas like tax reform, immigration, terrorism, healthcare and the economy. The partisan split is stark, however – while liberal Democrats place global warming fourth out of 28, conservative Republicans rank it dead last. “The issue has become more polarized than abortion in terms of voting priorities,” said Anthony Leiserowitz, the director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. “The most important factor in belief in climate science is political ideology. “It is remarkable that the base of one of the two major parties in the US lists climate change as a top four issue. You wouldn’t have seen that five years ago. But those numbers drop among conservative Democrats and so candidates are afraid to touch it when reaching to the middle. And among conservative Republicans, the issue is just toxic.” In a few close midterm races, this split is evident. In Pennsylvania’s redrawn 10th district, for example, Democrat George Scott, a former soldier and pastor, is up against incumbent Scott Perry. While Scott has said there is an “obligation to our children and grandchildren to take immediate action” on climate change, Perry has done little on the issue other than to attempt to prevent the Pentagon from doing anything related to climate change and seemingly blame God for pollution in Chesapeake Bay. The Environmental Voter Project is targeting 31,292 seldom-voting and non-voting environmentalists in Perry’s district ahead of the election. “This is Trump country and the environment and climate change isn’t a top issue here,” said Alex Bishop, a registered Republican who works in marketing for a tech company. Bishop lives in York, a city in southern Pennsylvania that is a key urban hub in the 10th district, and is involved in outreach to fellow conservatives on climate change. “Even saying ‘climate change’ sets off red flags here so it’s better to connect climate change with other issues, such as immigration or the military protecting fossil fuels. I would say it’s gone from ‘it’s all a hoax’ to ‘maybe something is going on.’ It doesn’t sound like much progress, but it’s slowly turning.” The divisiveness of climate change can be separated from broader environmental concerns over the health of the air, water and landscapes. In Yale’s poll “environmental protection” ranks as a top 10 issue for Democrats and is number 11 for moderate Republicans, a group Leiserowitz describes as comprising roughly a third of the party that follows in the Teddy Roosevelt tradition of fondness for public lands and wildlife stewardship. But in a new political landscape where energizing a core of voters is edging out the desire to reach a diminishing middle ground, climate change is vigorously debated by both sides only during Democratic primary races. This partisan relationship has shown up in Yale’s polling of Republicans. In the two years before the election of Trump in 2016, belief that climate change is happening increased 19% among Republican voters, only to crash once the new president made clear his disdain for climate science and decided to pull the US from the Paris climate agreement. Taken in aggregate, Americans’ belief that climate change is occurring is gradually strengthening, now standing at around seven in 10 voters. Policies to address climate change enjoy surprisingly hefty support – Yale found 85% of Americans support more funding for renewable energy research, 77% want carbon dioxide regulated as a pollutant and nearly seven in 10 want fossil fuel companies to pay a carbon tax. A further 70% of those polled believe environmental protection is more important than economic growth – evidence, perhaps, that the huge swaths of political rhetoric about taxes and jobs is severely out of kilter with the public. “The link between events like hurricanes and climate change is emerging as an idea in Americans’ minds, even as they are swamped by partisanship,” said Leiserowitz. “It’s conceivable climate change will swing future elections but it’s also conceivable we will continue to ignore the issue. After all, it gets almost no ink in the media, so how can we expect people to think it’s important?”"

"Late last month Indonesia was hit by a devastating earthquake and tsunami that left thousands of people dead and missing. This week the International Monetary Fund arrived in the country to hold its annual meeting on the island of Bali. On the day when the IMF issued a warning about trouble ahead for the global economy, the latest report from the UN’s intergovernmental panel on climate change said the world had only a dozen years left to take the steps necessary to prevent a global warming catastrophe. The message is clear for those willing to hear it: get ready for a time when economic failure combines with ecological breakdown to create the perfect storm. Even without the added complication of climate change, the challenge facing the finance ministers and central bank governors gathered in Bali would be significant enough. The IMF has cut its forecast for global growth, but the chances are that next year will be a lot worse than is currently forecast. The risks, the IMF says, are skewed to the downside. You bet they are.  Here’s a brief checklist. For the past 10 years, the world economy has been surviving on a diet of low interest rates and money creation by central banks, but that stimulus is now being gradually withdrawn. In the United States, growth has been further pumped up by Donald Trump’s tax cuts for individuals and companies, but only temporarily. The impact will start to fade next year as higher interest rates start to bite. Trump is already berating the Federal Reserve, America’s central bank, for increasing borrowing costs. In Europe, a colossal row is brewing between Italy’s populist government and the fiscal conservatives at the European commission because the budget proposed by Rome runs completely counter to the EU’s fiscal rules. Officials in Brussels are more worried about Italy than they are about Brexit, and with good reason. Italy’s banks are awash with bad debts and could not survive the sort of financial crisis that appears to be in prospect. It is a much bigger country than Greece, and far too big for Europe to bail out if the worst happens. The standoff between Rome and Brussels is happening as Europe’s growth rate has started to slow. One reason is that its export-driven economies are already being hurt by the early skirmishes in Trump’s trade war. As the IMF noted this week, protectionism is a key risk to global growth. China, the world’s second biggest economy, has always been Trump’s main target, and it has been affected by new US tariffs, as its domestic economy was already slowing. Elsewhere, in the past few months the IMF has been called in to help Argentina, there has been a run on the Turkish lira, and inflation in Venezuela threatens to hit Weimar Germany-style levels. In better times, oil-rich Venezuela might have been well placed to benefit from the rising price of crude oil, which is heading steadily towards $100 a barrel. Every big recession in the global economy has been prefigured by a jump in the cost of crude, which makes it somewhat curious that share prices on Wall Street are so high. Traditionally, stock markets anticipate trouble, but the mood currently is to dismiss higher interest rates, rising oil prices, Italy and trade wars as somehow unimportant. Ominously, next year is the 90th anniversary of the Wall Street Crash. The Great Depression that followed that market meltdown led to new economic thinking. It spawned full employment policies, increased spending on welfare, and a new set of multilateral organisations. Turn the clock forward to 2018 and the parallels are obvious. International cooperation has broken down, economic failure has damaged mainstream political parties, and belief in the invisible hand of the free market has been shattered. But the threat posed by global warming means the current crisis of capitalism is more acute than that of the 1930s, because all that was really required then was a boost to growth, provided by the New Deal, cheap money, tougher controls on finance and rearmament. In today’s context, a plain vanilla go-for-growth strategy would be suicidal. Even so, there are countries that are prepared to self-immolate their economies in pursuit of growth at all costs. America is one. Australia appears to be another. At the other end of the spectrum are those who say there will be a future for the planet only if the idea of growth is ditched altogether. Politically, this has always been a hard sell, and has become even more difficult now that populations in the west have experienced an entire decade of flatlining living standards. In the developing world, the problem has been too little growth rather than too much. Tackling global population growth is a no-brainer from a climate-change perspective, and most of the projected increase comes from low-income countries, most notably in Africa. The reason is simple: poor families have more children. Birthrates fall as countries become richer. Between the two extremes are those who think the circle can be squared by carbon-free growth, made possible by the dramatic fall in the cost of renewable energy. Technology will ride to the rescue, they insist. This sounds like a cost-free (or at least relatively cheap) option, and that’s why almost all politicians pay lip service to green growth. But then they act in ways that make achieving global warming targets harder – by building new roads and expanding airports. And always for the same reason: because doing so will be good for growth. This is called a balanced approach, but it is nothing of the sort. If the IPCC is even close to being right about its timeline, speeding up the transition from fossil fuels to renewables is vital. Can that be done? One of the winners of this year’s Nobel prize for economics – William Nordhaus – says it can, if policymakers get serious about a carbon tax set high enough to price oil, coal and gas out of the market. Here, though, the breakdown in international cooperation and trust becomes really damaging. Ideally, existing global institutions – the IMF, the World Bank, the UN and the World Trade Organization – would be supplemented by a new World Environmental Organisation with the power to levy a carbon tax globally. Even in the absence of a new body, they would be working together to face down the inevitable opposition to change from the fossil fuel lobby. Instead, the response to climate change looks similar to the response to the financial crisis: fail to recognise there is a problem until it is too late; panic; then muddle through. That’s a sobering prospect."
"Far too little is being done to protect people from the heatwaves, storms and floods being supercharged by climate change, according to a high-level international commission. It aims to rebuild the political will to act that was damaged when US president, Donald Trump, rejected the global Paris agreement. The Global Commission on Adaptation is being led by Ban Ki-Moon, Bill Gates and Kristalina Georgieva, CEO of the World Bank. It involves 17 countries including China, India, South Africa, Indonesia, Canada and the UK.  Much more money is being invested in cutting carbon emissions than preparing for the climate change impacts that are already inevitable. More than $380bn (£287bn) was spent on reducing CO2 in 2015-16, compared with just $20bn boosting protection from extreme weather. Former UN secretary general Ban said a step change in adaptation can and must be achieved: “Climate change is happening much, much faster than one may think. [But] where there is political will, anything can be done.” However, he said the international consensus to fight global warming had been damaged by Trump’s actions. On Sunday, Trump questioned whether global warming was caused by human activities, contradicting the long-established conclusions of the world’s scientists. “We were very much united until December 2015 in Paris,” Ban told the Guardian. “Now unfortunately the level of solidarity is being loosened, especially by the Trump administration. Even though it is just one country, it has caused big political damage.” Adaptation measures to safeguard people’s homes, food, water and energy are being implemented in some places, but at far too small a scale, the commissioners said. “Continued economic growth and reductions in global poverty are possible despite these daunting challenges – but only if societies invest much more in adaptation,” said Ban. “The costs of adapting are less than the cost of doing business as usual and the benefits are many times larger.” “We are at a moment of high risk and great promise,” said Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. “If everyone does their part, we can reduce carbon emissions, increase access to affordable energy, and help farmers everywhere grow more productive crops.” “Our climate has already changed. Dramatic weather events and volatile seasons are the new normal,” said Georgieva. “We face a choice: business as usual and hope for the best. Or we act now and build for a resilient future.” The new group is comprised of 28 commissioners, including two national presidents, representing all regions of the globe and all sectors of development and industry. The US administration is not represented but Francis Suarez, the mayor of Miami, is a commissioner. The commission will produce a major report on adapting to climate change for the UN climate summit in September 2019, followed by a year of action to implement its recommendations. “Scientists and economists believe the cost of adaptation could rise to $500bn per year by 2050 and, in the mid-term, $300bn by 2030,” said Ban. This money is available, he said: “I don’t think it is a matter of [getting the] money. The money can be mobilised. If there is political will, I think we can handle this matter.” In particular, the trillions of dollars held by investment managers and insurers should be put to work, Ban said: “We should not expect all this money to come from governments. The private sector has to be fully engaged.” He said 63% of the $380bn invested in cutting emissions in 2015-16 was from the private sector."
"Uber will charge its customers in London an extra 15p per mile on every trip to help its drivers buy electric cars. The ride-hailing app hopes to create a £200m fund from the levy to encourage almost half of its 45,000 drivers to use fully electric vehicles by 2021. The firm hopes its London fleet will be fully electric by 2025.  Uber said the clean air fee would mean an extra 45p on the average three-mile trip in the capital, on top of normal fares, but every penny would go towards helping drivers upgrade their vehicles or other green initiatives should that money not be used. The fund was announced as part of a clean air plan, as Uber continues its efforts to prove itself to Transport for London after it initially  decided not to renew its licence to operate   last year. Uber’s chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, said the initiative, a world first for the company, showed it was committed to being a strong partner in the capital. “It represents our wanting our partnership in London not only to be a strong partnership but trailblazing in solving air pollution, which every great city in the world is struggling with, and our mayor here in London is looking to improve,” he said. However, Khosrowshahi said Uber would continue to resist proposals to make its drivers liable for London’s congestion charge, unless black cabs were also forced to pay. Under Uber’s new scheme, each driver will in effect have their own savings account towards the purchase of an electrical vehicle, based on the number of miles driven. A driver using Uber’s app for an average of 40 hours per week could expect to save about £3,000 towards a new electric vehicle in two years. Uber said it was in talks with manufacturers to negotiate prices and ensure supply, as well as to home vehicle charging suppliers. Khosrowshahi said: “You’re going to see many initiatives but what it adds up to is us moving from being a simple ride-sharing service to transforming to an on-demand mobility service. We ultimately want to be that go-to mobility platform – whether you’re going to move with the car or a bike or ultimately a bus or the tube service. All this is aimed at eventually replacing car ownership itself. “Cars are unused 95% of the time and take up enormous amounts of space, in parking etc – we want to give that space back to the city.” Uber is also offering a diesel scrappage bonus of £1,500 in credit for its app to the first 1,000 people in London to scrap a pre-Euro 4 diesel vehicle. Khosrowshahi said: “It’s our goal to help people replace their car with their phone by offering a range of mobility options – whether cars, bikes, scooters or public transport – all in the Uber app.” The chief executive said he was confident most drivers would take up the chance to spend their clean air fee savings on a new electric vehicle, but the fund would otherwise be used for other green schemes. “We won’t bank it.” The IWGB union, which represents private hire drivers, said: “We are very concerned that this latest PR move from Uber will lure drivers deeper into debt, as they struggle to finance expensive vehicles on below minimum wage income. The answer to London’s growing congestion and pollution problem is for the government and the mayor to resolutely commit to capping minicab numbers in London. “Drivers have long ago given up on Uber to do the right thing and that is why so many will be joining our march next week with other precarious workers, as we get ready to face down yet another appeal from Uber on the worker rights case we already won on two occasions.” The UK government has just slashed its grants for electric vehicles from £4,500 to £3,500 and abolished support for new hybrids, which many Uber drivers use."

"Donald Trump has reiterated his doubts about climate change, suggesting that the climate could “change back again,” and that climate scientists are politically motivated. The US president has long questioned man-made global warming. In an interview with CBS programme 60 Minutes that aired Sunday night, he said that he no longer believes climate change is a hoax, as he tweeted in 2012. “I think something’s happening. Something’s changing and it’ll change back again,” he said. “I don’t think it’s a hoax. I think there’s probably a difference. But I don’t know that it’s manmade. I will say this: I don’t want to give trillions and trillions of dollars. I don’t want to lose millions and millions of jobs.” The White House has previously declined to clarify Trump’s position. He tweeted in 2017 during a cold snap that “perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming.” In the East, it could be the COLDEST New Year’s Eve on record. Perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming that our Country, but not other countries, was going to pay TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS to protect against. Bundle up! Trump has said he will withdraw the US from the Paris agreement, an international pact to limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, cars and industry. His administration is seeking to roll back all of the country’s significant climate efforts. The president’s comments come as the record-breaking Hurricane Michael flattened communities in Florida and barely a week after an international coalition of scientists warned that it will be incredibly difficult to avoid the intensified heat waves, flooding and extreme storms that will come with higher temperatures caused by humans. Climate scientists say hurricanes are likely to grow stronger in warming oceans. Asked about that, Trump said “you’d have to show me the scientists because they have a very big political agenda.” As for melting ice caps and rising seas, Trump said “you don’t know whether or not that would have happened with or without man.” Global temperatures are already up 1C since industrialization. Keeping them from rising more than 1.5C and avoiding environmental catastrophe would require unprecedented action to begin phasing out fossil fuels within the next 12 years, according to the UN intergovernmental panel on climate change. At 1.5C warmer, seas could still rise 26cm to 77cm. Much of Trump’s cabinet has questioned the scientific consensus that humans are causing higher temperatures that pose immediate and growing threats. Trump economic adviser Larry Kudlow and Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida this weekend also questioned how much humans are contributing to climate change. Rubio acknowledged temperature rises and swelling seas but argued inaccurately that “many scientists would debate the percentage of what is attributable to man versus normal fluctuations.”"
"Big business has entered discussions about a self-regulated suite of measures to help Australia meet its Paris commitments, weeks after the Morrison government abandoned the national energy guarantee.  The resources minister, Matt Canavan, accused Australia’s biggest energy companies of interfering in the democratic process, as climate experts and environmental groups lashed the government over the development on Thursday. “We have a demonstrable way in Australia and western society of resolving fraught political disputes about energy. It’s called democracy and I don’t think the corporate sector is a replacement,” Canavan told a Sydney energy conference. The discussions about an industry-wide package to help Australia meet its Paris commitments and provide investment certainty are taking place within the Business Council of Australia’s energy and climate change committee and were first reported by the Australian Financial Review. Quoting industry sources, the paper said the suite of measures would be aimed at curbing emissions, improving reliability and providing investor certainty. Guardian Australia has confirmed discussions for a such a package have taken place. The Business Council of Australia (BCA) was approached for comment. Some experts welcomed news the business community was willing to step up to the plate after the government signalled it would focus solely on energy prices and reliability, and not emissions. But they also lamented the development as a government failure. “This is a sign of just how messed up the politics of climate and energy policy have become,” Frank Jotzo, the research director at the Australian National University Crawford school of public policy, told Guardian Australia. “It shows us just how important it is to the business community to have sensible policy and predictable policy in place. Business would like government to … help that transition along rather than somehow stem the tide in a somewhat chaotic fashion.” Dylan McConnell, of the University of Melbourne’s climate and energy college, told Guardian Australia it was a “reflection of the toxic politics around energy”. “It’s a bit of a concern that we’re potentially heading to a self-regulation model around this,” he said, adding that he was sceptical of the BCA’s credibility on emissions reductions. The Intergovermental Panel on Climate Change warned on Monday that the world had just 12 years to avoid climate change catastrophe. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, on Thursday reiterated his confidence that Australia would meet its Paris commitments, a claim that has been contradicted by a wide range of experts. Erwin Jackson, a senior climate change and energy adviser at Environment Victoria, said the possibility of an industry-led mechanism was “interesting to explore but the core challenge will be ensuring it has broad cross sectoral support”. “It’s a damning indictment of the failure of the Coalition to come up with a credible and enduring climate policy,” he told Guardian Australia. “Business by itself can’t deliver the certainty that the community and investors are going to need to drive the transition.” Jotzo said it was “difficult to conceive of an actual scheme that would be implemented and run by industry alone”. But he said the discussions would send a strong message to the government. “When it comes to to anything that involves financial transactions, you need a policy framework to incentivise that,” Jotzo said."
"The chairman of the Coalition’s backbench energy committee, the outspoken conservative Craig Kelly, says the government needs to axe current subsidies for households and businesses to install renewable energy technology like solar panels. With the Morrison government in the middle of formulating its new energy policy, and with Labor now promising to maintain subsidies for households and businesses to install small-scale renewable energy until 2030, Kelly told Guardian Australia the Coalition needed to wind up the program.  The government’s energy policy rework will take up a number of recent recommendations from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s examination of the electricity market. The competition watchdog has called for the federal small-scale renewable energy scheme (SRES), which provides rebates for installations of renewables, to be abolished by 2021, but it is not yet clear if the government will accept that recommendation. Bill Shorten used an interview with Guardian Australia last week to signal Labor will keep the SRES scheme until 2030 but Kelly declared ahead of the regular meeting of the government’s backbench energy committee: “I think the ACCC report is correct and this scheme should be wound up in its entirety.” The former prime minister Tony Abbott has already prevailed upon the energy minister, Angus Taylor, to axe the small-scale scheme and the federal renewable energy target, which is due to wind down from 2020 will not be replaced by the government. This week, members of the pro-coal Monash Forum are scheduled to dine at parliament house with Trevor St Baker, part-owner of the Vales Point coal generator and founder of the business electricity retailer ERM Power. St Baker has previously signalled interest in pursuing a replacement for the Hazelwood power station if the federal government settles on a favourable energy policy. The government has signalled it wants to encourage new investment extending the life of existing coal and gas plants, and upgrading ageing facilities, with an objective of boosting supply. The Coalition has been on the back foot politically over climate and energy policy since dumping the national energy guarantee, and climate change has been a significant problem for the Liberals in the Wentworth byelection, where the Morrison government faces the risk of losing its one-seat majority in the lower house. Taylor is due to meet with his state and territory counterparts later in October to try and salvage the reliability component of the Neg even though the government has dumped the accompanying emissions reduction target of 26% for the electricity sector. The meeting in late October is expected to consider the future of the reliability obligation and the implementation of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s recommendation that energy companies give consumers a default retail offer. There is expected to be a broad discussion of the ACCC’s recommendations for making power pricing more transparent for consumers. Taylor said the looming talks would centre on “bringing power prices down while ensuring the reliability of the grid”. “Decisive action on key recommendations from the ACCC’s retail electricity pricing report is central to delivering relief to families and businesses.” The ACT’s climate change minister, Shane Rattenbury, told Guardian Australia he was happy to consider the reliability obligation at the looming meeting with Taylor. “The reliability mechanism can probably go ahead in some shape or form,” he said. “We haven’t formed an official view on that yet but, in the broad, I’m happy to consider it. “We will need to see if they have changed the architecture of the scheme and think about how the reliability obligation sits by itself.”"
"Last week, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that under the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, Canada will implement a revenue-neutral carbon tax starting in 2019, fulfilling a campaign pledge he made in 2015. Starting next spring, it’ll no longer be free to pollute in Canada. We’re putting a price on pollution in provinces that don’t yet have a plan to fight climate change. More on our plan to cut pollution, grow the economy & create jobs: https://t.co/VjCNOOKLVB #EnvironmentEconomy pic.twitter.com/b4wFc17Qte  The federal carbon pollution price will start low at $20 per ton in 2019, rising at $10 per ton per year until reaching $50 per ton in 2022. The carbon tax will stay at that level unless the legislation is revisited and revised. This is a somewhat modest carbon tax – after all, the social cost of carbon is many times higher – but it’s a higher carbon price than has been implemented in most countries. Moreover, a carbon tax doesn’t necessarily have to reflect the social cost of carbon. The question is whether it will be sufficiently high to meet the country’s climate targets. The Preamble in the Act is worth reading. It begins by noting “there is broad scientific consensus that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions contribute to global climate change” (this is somewhat understated – carbon pollution is the dominant factor). It also notes that Canada is already feeling the impacts of climate change through factors like “coastal erosion, thawing permafrost, increases in heat waves, droughts and flooding, and related risks to critical infrastructures and food security.” The Preamble also notes that in 1992, Canada signed the UNFCCC whose objectives include “the stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system,” and that Canada ratified the Paris Agreement, whose aims include limiting global warming to less than 2°C above pre-industrial temperatures. Canada’s Paris commitment requires cutting its carbon pollution by 30% below 2005 levels by 2030. Prior to the implementation of the carbon tax, its policies were rated Highly Insufficient to meet that goal. Instead Canada’s emissions were on track to fall only about 4% below 2005 levels by 2030. So, the carbon tax is an important policy to close that gap. Several Canadian provinces have already implemented or plan to implement carbon pricing systems. British Columbia, Alberta, and Quebec already have such systems in place; the Canadian government noted that these provinces were “among the top performers in GDP growth across Canada in 2017.” Provinces whose carbon prices meet the federal standards are already in compliance, so the new law won’t apply to them. Several other provinces (Northwest Territories, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador) have planned or proposed carbon pricing systems that will meet the federal requirements. The federal carbon tax will be applied to the remaining provinces. A $20/ton carbon tax translates into a 16.6 cent per gallon surcharge on gasoline. So, in 2022, the $50/ton carbon tax will increase Canadian gasoline prices by about 42 cents per gallon (11 cents per liter). For comparison, the average price of gasoline in Canada is $1.43 per liter, so that would be about an 8% gasoline price increase in 2022. The price of coal would more than double, with a carbon tax surcharge of about $100 per ton in 2022. Natural gas prices will rise by about 10 cents per cubic meter in 2022 compared to current prices of around 13 cents per cubic meter – about a 75% increase. This will increase demand for cheaper carbon-free electricity. However, Canada already supplies about 60% of its electricity through hydroelectric generation and 16% from nuclear – only about 20–25% comes from fossil fuels. For that reason, only 11% of Canada’s carbon pollution comes from generating electricity. The industrial sector is responsible for the biggest chunk of Canadian carbon pollution (40%). It will not be subjected to the carbon tax, but rather to an Output-Based Allocations system (similar to cap and trade). One key component of the federal carbon tax is that it’s revenue-neutral, similar to the policy proposal from Citizens’ Climate Lobby. All the taxed money will be distributed back to the provinces from which they were generated. The provinces will in turn rebate about 90% the revenues back to individual taxpayers. The rebates are anticipated to exceed the increased energy costs for about 70% of Canadian households. For example, a Manitoba family will receive a $336 rebate in 2019 compared to its increased costs of $232. A similar family in Saskatchewan will receive $598 compared to its higher costs of $403. In Ontario, families will receive $300 to offset its $244 in carbon taxes. And in New Brunswick a $248 rebate more than offsets the average household cost of $202. The rebates will more than double by 2022 as the carbon tax rises, and the net financial benefit to households will grow over time. 6. And more most households, rebates will larger than their carbon pricing costs. Households will see net gains. pic.twitter.com/ThfWoiXY85 The remaining 10% of the tax revenue will provide support to particularly affected sectors like schools, hospitals, small businesses, colleges, and indigenous communities. Diesel-fired electricity generation in remote communities and aviation fuel in the territories will receive full exemption from the carbon tax. The Canadian government recognizes that climate change impacts are expensive: Climate change has already had financial impacts on Canada, and these costs will only continue to grow. In 2016, it was estimated that larger and more intense weather events will cost the federal Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangements program around $902 million each year. The health costs of extreme weather are estimated to be over $1.6 billion a year. The cost of property damages from climate change averaged $405 million per year between 1983 and 2008, but have risen dramatically to $1.8 billion a year since 2009. That number is expected to grow as high as $43 billion by 2050. It would be cheaper to reduce those costs by slowing global warming than to pay for increasingly extreme weather damages. With this carbon tax, Canada is recognizing that reality, and in fact is offsetting the financial impact on its taxpayers by returning the revenue to households. This is an approach that studies have shown can boost the economy because disposable income rises due to the rebate exceeding increased energy costs for 70% of Canadians. Justin Trudeau has shown great climate leadership in following through with this carbon tax. Hopefully Canadians will reward him in next year’s elections. Note: this will be our final entry on Climate Consensus - the 97%. The Guardian has decided to discontinue its Science and Environment blogging networks. We would like to thank this great paper for hosting us over the past five years, and to our readers for making it a worthwhile and rewarding endeavor."
"From the red soil of his hometown in the Western Australian outback town of Wiluna, Michael Jeffery very nearly became a farmer. He opted for being a soldier instead, serving in Malaya, Borneo and Vietnam, where he was awarded the Military Cross and the South Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry. After a distinguished military career, he served as governor of his home state of Western Australia and governor general of Australia – who represents the Queen, Australia’s head of state.  So he doesn’t enter public debate lightly. But he is highly exercised by his latest topic: restoring Australia’s ancient soils. It was a world first when he was appointed by Julia Gillard’s Labor government as the first national soil advocate in 2012 and his term was extended under the former National party leader and agriculture minister, Barnaby Joyce. Since then he has consulted with thousands of farmers, Indigenous land managers, policy makers, students and interest groups across the country. It has taken six years but now he has a very simple message for politicians in his report, Restore the Soil: Prosper the Nation. Australia’s soil, water and vegetation should be declared national strategic assets. “The emerging concept of ‘soil security’ also underpins the world’s six existential challenges: food, water and energy security, climate change abatement, biodiversity protection and human health,” he wrote to the prime minister’s office. “I believe that soil and water security will increasingly underpin global social stability and security.” Some of the recommendations could be controversial for many of Australia’s conventional farmers. For example, Jeffery has urged governments to support farmers to embrace regenerative farming and cut back on agricultural chemical and non-organic fertiliser usage. He believes improving soil health could help draw down carbon to neutralise Australia’s emissions. He wants to see properly funded agricultural education for Australia’s farmers and agronomists as well as soil and water scientists – independent from companies with vested interests. He also wants farmers to be paid a fair price for food. “It’s a no-brainer, there should be no political dissension at all,” Jeffery tells Guardian Australia. “Who is going to knock restoring agricultural landscapes? It’s about what comes out of the soil, like clean water, all our food, timber and fibre at a time when the planet, due to over population and bad agricultural methods is destroying it hand over fist.” Jeffery says improving soil health has the potential to neutralise Australia’s annual emissions of 600m tonnes of CO2 and would allow a more orderly transition to renewable energy sources. “The real fact is undeniable, our country [has] continued to lose carbon due to poor soil and water management,” Jeffery says. “If we don’t go to regenerative agriculture, we will continue to mine soils, particularly of carbon. This is the great loss and it is not being admitted. If you continue to mine carbon, you are shot. “It’s not the total measurement of soil health but it’s a good indicator and it facilitates the retention of water in soil – 50% of our rain is not getting into the soil and that is causing so much of the problem.” “If we get agriculture right, we could pull down as much carbon as we are emitting.” Jeffery’s intervention comes as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned that half a degree of extra warming will affect hundreds of millions of people and called for a transition out of coal power by 2050. The Australian federal government has rejected that call. The deputy prime minister and leader of the National party, Michael McCormack, has said Australia should continue to exploit its coal reserves as his farmer-based constituency suffers through a drought which in some parts of the country has continued for seven years. Jeffery’s policy calls for “reducing or ceasing synthetic chemical inputs” as debate rages in Australia around the use of the common weed killer glyphosate following a US ruling which found it caused the cancer of a terminally ill man. The president of the National Farmers Federation, Fiona Simson, says glyphosate had allowed farmers to embrace minimum tillage cropping systems, which she described as “one of the greatest advancements in agricultural sustainability in recent decades”. Simson says more than 800 scientific studies and reviews, including numerous independent regulatory safety assessments, have affirmed glyphosate is safe and does not cause cancer. She said the product had also been approved for use by every regulator across the world including the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority since 1974. “By managing weeds above the ground, farmers can plough their fields less often – reducing greenhouse gas emissions and maintaining soil health and soil moisture,” Simson said. But Jeffery says the debate over glyphosate, sold under brand names such as Round Up, reflect the need for independent government-funded research and education. “We need independent research separate to that conducted by chemical companies. That’s why you need government-run research stations, in my opinion, with properly trained agricultural scientists,” he says. “We ought to know if it is good, bad, indifferent, OK in little bits.” “If it is causing problems and people are being dishonest then there should be all hell to pay. It is a little like the banks doing things improperly while knowing it. I suspect, in part, if there are companies who do this, they may have to be held accountable for what they have done.” Jeffery also urges consumers and major supermarket chains such as Coles and Woolworths to accept that farmers need to be paid a fair price for food. He described $1 a litre milk as “patently stupid”. “A builder or a plumber or a doctor doesn’t get paid like farmers,” he says. “When Coles says we are driving prices down, in some cases what it does mean is they are helping drive farmers to bankruptcy.” As the drought bites harder in the eastern Australian states, Jeffery says the combined effects of climate change, water mismanagement and land degradation means that looking after Australia’s agricultural soils is essential for the nation’s security. Jeffery has made 10 recommendations, which the government confirmed were under “active consideration”, with the “fundamental aim of restoring and maintaining the health of the Australian agricultural landscape”. They include a national soils policy with a permanent soil advocate, better education for farmers and agricultural scientists, a mandated school garden program and syllabus, funding for case studies in regenerative agriculture, funding for regenerative farm works via Landcare and an annual report on the global state of soil, water and food from an Australian perspective. The policy defines regenerative agriculture as “the application of techniques which seek to restore landscape function and deliver outcomes that include sustainable production”. This could include using more organic composts and fertilisers, slowing the flow of water, fencing off waterways from stock, cell grazing, feral animal control and direct-drilling crops into pasture. Jeffery said support could come in the form of tax deductions for regenerative farmers or the government part-funding regenerative work. “The object is to convince the average conventional farmer to change without being frightened, to show how you can go through a regenerative process and still be economically viable,” Jeffery says. “Farmers can’t do this by themselves, they need the support of government and the public to be the cleanest and greenest they can be.” He said current education programs available were “generally not satisfactory”. The policy states “there is a dearth of information in many areas, and product placement information only in others. Often the advice given is contradictory to best practice or considered by many farmers to be out of date.” Jeffery said government funded research stations were “stressed and stretched” when there needed to be more fully staffed stations where farmers could access the best advice from agronomists, water scientists and soil scientists “who are properly trained”. “That’s part of the problem, for example, the agronomists are often owned by a chemical company, so of course they are going to say you need more of our product.” While elements of regenerative farming have been practised in Australia for decades, it has recently gained more mainstream attention, partly due to the work of Australian scientist and farmer Charlie Massy, who has been critical of “industrial agriculture”. Jeffery said while farming practices have changed over the years, he would like to see a stocktake of farming methods. “I do not criticise industrial agriculture per se because it helped to make Australia a wealthy country,” he said. “[Farmers] did what they had to do at the time with the education they had.” With better agricultural education, Jeffery believes Australia should play a leading role in showing the rest of the world how to manage inherently infertile soils in a difficult climate while building land management knowledge to export along with food. “If we doubled our exports tomorrow, we could feed 60 to 80 million people, but if we exported knowledge, we might help to build feed a billion people,” he says. At 80, his passion for the project is clear. “I was always interested in farming and nearly became a farmer, but I think about our 10 grandchildren, whose lives I’m concerned about in that sense, and their parents and all our children.”"

"The Paris climate agreement set a target of no more than 2°C global warming above pre-industrial temperatures, but also an aspirational target of no more than 1.5°C.  That’s because many participating countries – especially island nations particularly vulnerable to sea level rise – felt that even 2°C global warming is too dangerous.  But there hadn’t been a lot of research into the climate impacts at 1.5°C vs. 2°C, and so the UN asked the IPCC to publish a special report summarizing what it would take to achieve the 1.5°C limit and what the consequences would be of missing it. The details in the report are worth understanding, but there’s one simple critical takeaway point: we need to cut carbon pollution as much as possible, as fast as possible.  Depending on how we define ‘pre-industrial temperatures’ and how fast we keep consuming fossil fuels, we’ll likely burn through the rest of the 1.5°C carbon budget within the next 3 to 10 years.  To stay below 1.5°C, the IPCC therefore concludes the world must embark on a World War II-level effort to transition away from fossil fuels, and also start removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at large scales – anywhere from 400bn to 1.6tn tons of it. Realistically, this isn’t going to happen.  We’re currently on track for more than 3°C global warming by 2100.  We can do better than that if countries ratchet down their carbon pledges and implement more aggressive climate policies, but with some nations moving in the wrong direction, like the US and potentially Brazil electing climate denier presidents, even staying below 2°C is looking increasingly less likely. However, these are somewhat arbitrary targets.  1.5°C is less dangerous than 2°C, which is less dangerous than 2.5°C, which is less dangerous than 3°C, and so on.  Any further warming from today’s already-hot temperatures (1°C warmer than pre-industrial) increases global risks, and staying below any of these temperature thresholds is going to require aggressive climate policies from countries around the world. The answer to the question “what should aim for?” is simple: cut carbon pollution as much as possible, as fast as possible.  Until the world reaches zero carbon, the answer will always be the same.   Carbon Brief created an excellent interactive page detailing the differences in climate impacts between 1.5°C and 2°C, based on 70 peer-reviewed studies.  Generally speaking, the IPCC report finds that “Climate-related risks to health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security, and economic growth are projected to increase with global warming of 1.5°C and increase further with 2°C.” One of the biggest differences between 1.5°C and 2°C is the impact on coral reefs, which support about 25% of all known marine species.  Coral reefs are very vulnerable to the combination of hotter and more acidic ocean waters resulting from carbon pollution.  At 1.5°C, the IPCC estimates that we’ll lose about 80% of coral reefs.  At 2°C, virtually all coral reefs will be gone.   Summers with no remaining Arctic sea ice are also ten times more likely at 2°C than 1.5°C (at least once per decade vs. once per century).  What happens in the Arctic doesn’t stay in the Arctic – disappearing sea ice appears to be connected to the weakening jet stream, which in turn causes weather systems to get stuck in place for extended periods of time.  This can lead to particularly intense heat waves, floods, droughts, and other extreme weather events.  The volume of sea ice in the Arctic has already declined by about 70% over just the past 40 years. The IPCC report concludes that a world with 2°C of global warming will lead to more heat-related deaths, smaller crop yields, worse extreme weather events, slower economic growth, more people in poverty, and increase the population facing water stress by up to 50% compared to a 1.5°C world.  And the impacts will get progressively worse if temperatures warm beyond the 2°C limit. The take-home message is that the faster we cut carbon pollution, the less severe impacts we’ll face.  We’re not yet doing nearly enough, although the Paris agreement was an important first step, and countries that withdraw from it should become international pariahs.  While it’s important to understand the consequences of missing each temperature target, that bottom line will perpetually hold true."
"On the morning that the world’s leading climate scientists warn that the planet has until 2030 to avert a global warming catastrophe, Mary Robinson appears suitably sombre. She wears black shoes, black trousers and a black sweater and perches at the end of a long table at her climate justice foundation, headquartered in an austere, imposing Georgian building opposite Trinity College Dublin. The only dash of brightness is a multicoloured brooch on her lapel. “It symbolises the sustainable development goals,” she says. “It’s the one good emblem that the United Nations has produced, so I like to wear it.” There seems little reason for cheer on this Monday. The landmark report by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has just warned that urgent, unprecedented changes are needed to keep global warming to a maximum of 1.5C; even half a degree beyond this will significantly worsen the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people. Donald Trump, rejecter of the Paris climate agreement, is riding high on the back of Brett Kavanaugh’s elevation to the US supreme court. Britain and the EU are consumed by Brexit. Brazil is on course to elect a president who wants to open the Amazon to agribusiness. Closer to home, the Irish government is flunking its climate policy goals. Now, climate scientists warn that the clock ticks ever closer to midnight.  “Governments are not responding at all adequately to the stark reality that the IPCC is pointing to: that we have about 11 years to make really significant change,” says Robinson, sitting ramrod straight, all business. “This report is extraordinarily important, because it’s telling us that 2 degrees is not safe. It’s beyond safe. Therefore, we have to work much, much harder to stay at 1.5 degrees. I’ve seen what 1 degree is doing in more vulnerable countries ... villages are having to move, there’s slippage, there’s seawater incursion.” Robinson sips a glass of water and sighs. “We’re in a bumpy time. We’re in a bad political cycle, particularly because the United States is not only not giving leadership, but is being disruptive of multilateralism and is encouraging populism in other countries.” This could be the start of a depressing interview that concludes we should hitch a ride on Virgin Galactic’s first trip to space and try to stay there. But it turns out to be surprisingly upbeat. Despite the headlines, Robinson, who served as the UN secretary general’s special envoy on climate change after serving as the president of Ireland and the UN high commissioner for human rights, is hopeful. She has anticipated the IPCC report by writing a book-cum-manifesto, Climate Justice: Hope, Resilience and the Fight for a Sustainable Future, published this week. It tells stories of farmers and activists, mostly women, who tackle climate change in Africa, Asia and the Americas. They are examples of positive change that Robinson thinks can help turn the tide. “I don’t think as a human race that we can be so stupid that we can’t face an existential threat together and find a common humanity and solidarity to respond to it. Because we do have the capacity and the means to do it – if we have the political will.” Climate change may be man-made, but Robinson believes women are key to the solution, through planting trees, recycling waste, eating less meat and a thousand other measures, big and small. “There’s a nurturing quality, a concern for children, that’s very deep in women. And women change behaviour. It’s women who decide what the diet will be. And, of course, in vulnerable countries, it’s women who bear the brunt of climate change.” The former barrister karate-chops the air for emphasis. “I’ve learned from Archbishop Desmond Tutu to be a ‘prisoner of hope’, a great expression that he uses. That means the glass may not be half full, but there’s something in the glass that you work on. Hope brings energy.” So, while the Trump administration withholds leadership and money from the global effort for clean energy – “That’s where it hurts” – the US may yet meet Paris emissions targets, thanks to efforts by We Are Still In, a coalition of mayors, governors, tribal leaders, colleges, businesses, faith groups and investors that is continuing to follow the terms of the agreement. The movement to divestment from fossil fuels is also making progress. “They’ve now moved to trillions being divested. That’s very significant.” Grim scientific prognoses must not paralyse civil society, says Robinson. It must unite, march, organise, pressure politicians. “Feeling a complete inability to do anything – ‘This is too big for me, I give up’ – that’s no use to anybody. [With] despair, all the energy to do something goes out of the room.” Robinson says she is adapting her own behaviour: fewer flights and more teleconferencing; eating less meat as an “aspirant vegetarian”; using public transport, although she confesses to taking taxis frequently. “I talk to the taxi drivers, that’s my compensation. I get them to message for me. Ten years ago, taxi drivers were the most sceptical about climate change. Now, they’re the most keen to get an electric car, or at least a hybrid.” At the age of 73, Robinson has carved out a new role in public life. No longer a high-powered global bureaucrat with a big budget and staff, no longer a head of state trailed by pomp, she instead relies on a formidable intellect, her brand name and her social and political network. You could call it soft power, except Robinson does not do soft. She is friendly and courteous, but the famous iron-grip handshake is still there; so too her antiphathy towards smalltalk. The gaze is direct, the sentences exact. When I go off-topic and ask about Brexit, or the Irish presidential election, there is a tight smile. “We’re straying far from the book, aren’t we?” Supporters and critics have long noted a personal stiffness matched by an unbending commitment to liberal principles. How else would a GP’s daughter from Ballina, County Mayo, emerge in the 1970s as a law professor and outspoken advocate for women’s rights and contraception while other politicians genuflected before the might of the country’s Roman Catholic church? She was denounced from the pulpit and had condoms sent to her in the post. Nominated by the Labour party as a long-shot candidate for the presidency in 1990, she won. It was an astonishing result that prefigured Ireland’s social liberalisation. It enshrined Robinson as a progressive talisman. Kofi Annan tapped her up to become the UN’s high commissioner for human rights in 1997, three months before her presidential term ended. It was a rare misstep. She has expressed regret for letting the then secretary general “sort of bully” her into leaving the presidency early to head to Geneva. Later, George W Bush’s administration bristled at her stance on human rights, Palestine and other issues after 9/11, which contributed to her stepping down in 2002. A year later, Robinson found herself in a Dublin maternity ward holding her first grandchild, Rory. “I was flooded with a sense of adrenaline, a physical sensation unlike anything I had ever felt before,” she writes in Climate Justice. “In that moment, my sense of time altered and I began to think in a time span of a hundred years. I knew instinctively that I would now view Rory’s life through the prism of our planet’s precarious future ... the abstract data on climate change that I had skirted around for so long became deeply personal.” Robinson was struck by the injustice that those least responsible, such as islanders in Kiribati or herders in Kenya, suffered most from climate change, and by the fact that much of the world ignored scientists’ warnings. Her response is to tell the stories of people such as Sharon Hanshaw, a hairdresser in Mississippi who led community recovery efforts after Hurricane Katrina; Constance Okollet, a Ugandan farmer who taught neighbours to plant trees to stop topsoil erosion; and Natalie Isaacs, an Australian entrepreneur who launched an online initiative to help households curb their carbon footprints. “I try to illustrate the hope and the fightback,” says Robinson. “And the need for empathy. We need to have empathy now with those who are suffering ... because that’s where we’ll all be very shortly if we don’t change course.” Robinson wanted to do a documentary to accompany the book, but she was advised instead to do a podcast. “Being of my generation, I said: ‘What’s a podcast?’” she laughs. She agreed. Thus was born an unlikely phenomenon: Mary Robinson, comedian. The former president co-hosts the podcast Mothers of Invention with Maeve Higgins, an Irish comedian based in New York. They banter while discussing climate change and interviewing guests. “People listen through Maeve, through her questions. It’s making it much more real. There’s no doubt that Maeve is drawing me to the dark side. I’m getting funnier because of that.” Higgins does the comedic heavy lifting, riffing and throwing out lines while Robinson plays the straight foil. “I’ve learned that young people now in the United States get their politics from comical programmes,” says Robinson. She alludes to The Daily Show, but mixes up Jon Stewart with Jimmy Stewart and Trevor Noah with Trevor Nunn, which is actually pretty funny. Robinson considers comedy a sensible response to existential threat. “Laughter in a very serious discussion is much more persuasive than if we were all the time serious, serious, serious.” I consider asking her to tell a joke, but my nerve fails; back to business. “We have 11 years to change course and it has to be done with a seriousness of purpose, particularly by governments, because they determine the rules.” Preparations for a conference in Poland in December to ensure implementation of the Paris agreement are not going well, she says: “There’s a lot of arguing around what needs to be done.” She hopes the IPCC report will focus minds. “Future governments won’t be able to do what governments now have 11 years to do. In the future, we will have these tipping points – the Arctic will be gone, the coral reefs will be gone, the permafrost will be dissolving ... all these things will just spin us out of control.” Governments need to end fossil fuel subsidies and increase tax on carbon, she says. “Put a real price on carbon and do it now. These are the levers that move things quickly and get the investment into clean energy. If governments are not capable of being more serious, then they lack moral leadership, which is what we really need now.” Leaving aside the rest of the world, the country outside Robinson’s door challenges her optimism. When Irish civil society marches these days, it is for housing, not climate change. The government hinted that it would increase carbon tax in this week’s budget, but it did not. Climate change has barely registered in the presidential election. Robinson seems unabashed. “In my experience, human rights has always been a struggle. We don’t always keep going forward; there are setbacks and then you dig deeper. You get the prisoner-of-hope mentality and you fight harder.” Climate Justice: Hope, Resilience and the Fight for a Sustainable Future is out now (Bloomsbury, £16.99).

"A maritime climate with wind, sun and waves and an island surrounded by shallow seas with a high tidal range makes the UK probably the best-placed country in the world to take advantage of renewable energy. Britain is already a world leader in offshore wind but has been reluctant to invest in other promising technologies. Underwater sea turbines in particular, wave power and various forms of tidal barrage have failed to be given the political support needed to get them into the mainstream.  In some cases the government is actively discouraging renewables – the onshore wind industry and now solar power. Instead, taxpayer’s money and executive powers are being used to back nuclear power and fracking for gas. With scientists warning that we only have a 12-year window to save the planet from exceeding a dangerous 1.5C increase in temperature neither of these technologies is going to help avoid that threat. There is still time to make a significant contribution to reducing carbon emissions because the renewables that most suit our climate have already been developed and can be installed rapidly. These, plus new battery technology and multiple novel ways of balancing supply and demand including biogas and hydrogen production, make this energy revolution possible. All that is needed is political will. "
"Most of the recent worries over the spread of propaganda have concentrated on the use of social media: WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have all been rightly criticised for their use in spreading misinformation. Less attention, perhaps, has been given to the content of the messages and the strategy behind their use. The template for many modern campaigns of disinformation was invented by the tobacco industry as it fought against the mounting evidence that it was selling a product that killed its users. The “tobacco strategy” as researchers christened it, relied less on outright lies than on confusion and irrelevant truths. For example, the tobacco industry funded first-class research into the harmful effects of asbestos to produce the impression that all kinds of things gave you cancer – so why worry about the ones that give pleasure as well?  Now this strategy has itself been scientifically examined, with disturbing results. Three philosophers of science, James Owen Weatherall, Cailin O’Connor and Justin Bruner, have modelled the ways in which scientific results can influence policymakers. They show that it is perfectly possible over time for almost all the policymakers to end up convinced of something that almost all the relevant experts believe is untrue. This is especially likely if there are propagandists operating for the wrong view and the science is difficult or disputed. This model fits the tobacco controversies very well, but it has obvious further applications – to climate change and perhaps to some political questions too. The fact that the science is difficult and the results disputed does not mean there isn’t a right and a wrong answer. Just because experts disagree in good faith does not mean that they are all equally likely to be right. Tobacco is in fact a lethal drug. The world is in fact warming very dangerously as a result of human actions. But the process by which scientists reach consensus on these matters is slow, and prone to misinterpretation from the outside. The paper shows that when neither the scientists nor the policymakers have access to all available research – which is true of all important questions – they rely on their social networks to sample the knowledge for them. This sample can be biased either at random or as the result of deliberate action. Propagandists for one side or another can present decision-makers with a flawed picture of the state of knowledge. This is much more effectively done – their models show – by omitting unhelpful results than by inventing helpful ones. The tobacco companies sponsored lots of research but only published the findings that helped their cause. Unscrupulous journalists may make this worse by withholding from their readers stories that spoil the picture they want to present. But even some non-partisan reporters may run into another danger. Attempts to present “both sides” of a question when there is no real dispute among experts can be just as deceptive as outright propaganda. Either way, the public is misled and the wrong decisions are made. This isn’t an easy problem. We need experts to make judgments about which problems are contested and which stories are significant, but what happens when these judgments are rejected? Reaching the truth demands a community of trust, and to build this is a project for everyone involved, not just for experts. Experts deserve to be believed because they are unlike the rest of us – they are in the relevant fields better at finding the truth. But in reality they will be believed only to the extent that they are seen to share our moral values and concerns."
"Progressive thinktanks and investor groups want the Australian government to model the economic effects climate change will have on Australia under 1.5C and 2C warming scenarios. This week the new Treasury secretary, Phil Gaetjens, told a Senate estimates hearing the department had done no modelling that compared the difference in economic impacts of 1.5C of warming and 2C. “We do not do modelling on that,” Gaetjens said. “There wouldn’t be any information in a quantitative sense that I could provide at the moment.” At the same time, in an open letter in the health journal the Lancet, 22 prominent scientists and health professionals have criticised the Australian government for dismissing the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s recent 1.5C report. “The Australian government’s contemptuous dismissal of the latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), including the panel’s recommendation to dramatically reduce coal power by 2050, is unacceptable,” the letter, published Thursday, states. Australian scientists and health professionals were dismayed at the government’s “ongoing stance to disregard the consensus of the world’s leading climate scientists” as well as “any idea of duty of care regarding the future wellbeing of Australians and our immediate neighbours”, the letter said. The authors include Prof Fiona Stanley and Nobel laureates Peter Doherty and Tilman Ruff. They say Australia is more exposed to the impacts of climate change than other OECD countries and the government “must commit immediately to embrace strategies of energy generation that do not put more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere”. One of the letter’s authors, Prof Peter Sainsbury, said: “We were just horrified by the Australian government’s response to the report and that’s why we chose to write the letter. “Everyone who has been paying attention over the last 25 years knows climate change is an environmental issue but it is also a health issue. “The health implications, which are not well recognised, will be catastrophic.” Environment Minister Melissa Price said it was “absolutely false” to say the government had dismissed the findings of the IPCC report. “We have consistently stated that the IPCC is a trusted source of scientific advice that we will continue to take into account on climate policy,” she said. “The content of the report has been misrepresented. It is also imperative to understand this report makes no recommendations and is not policy prescriptive.” Emma Herd, the chief executive of the Investor Group on Climate Change, who was one of the voices calling for economic modelling comparing 1.5C warming impacts to 2C impacts, said similar work was already being done in other jurisdictions, including by the Bank of England, and by China, New Zealand and many European jurisdictions. “Increasingly we’re seeing financial regulators in many jurisdictions are very active in looking at the economic implications of climate change,” she said. Herd said while the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission were actively looking at the potential impacts on entities they regulated, this work was not on an economy-wide scale. “Given the release of the 1.5-degree report, we would think this would be an area where Treasury would have a role to play,” she said. Richie Merzian, the director of the Australia Institute’s climate and energy program, said Treasury had modelled the impacts of different emissions reductions targets on Australia’s economy, but modelling of what the country would look like under different scenarios was lacking. “The Treasury has played a useful role in modelling the impact to the Australian economy of different climate action scenarios,” he said. “It has the capability of modelling the economic impacts of Australia under a 1.5, 2 or 3-degree world. All it’s missing is the political instruction from the government to do so.” In comments to Fairfax Media the environment minister, Melissa Price, said it was “absolutely false” to suggest the government had dismissed the IPCC’s findings. “We have consistently stated that the IPCC is a trusted source of scientific advice that we will continue to take into account on climate policy,” Price said. Guardian Australia approached Price and the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, for comment."
"Farmers around here are itching to go after that amber wave of soya beans, but there was that 5in rain a couple of weeks ago and then a 7in rain, and it drives even the retired guys batty. Those beans aren’t worth much at the elevator thanks to a Trump trade war with China, but they’re worth even less getting wet feet in a pond that was a field which the glacier made a prairie bog some 14,000 years ago – until we came along and drained it.  This year, crops in north-west Iowa are looking spotty. Up into Minnesota they were battered by spring storms and late planting, and then inundated again in late summer. Where they aren’t washed out, they’re weedy or punky. If you go south in Buena Vista county, where I live in Storm Lake, the corn stands tall and firm. Welcome to climate change, Iowa-style. It’s the least debated issue of the midterm political season. The weather is the top topic of conversation at any cooperative elevator’s coffee table, along with the markets. Everyone knows that things have been changing in sweeping ways out here on the richest corn ground in the world. It’s drought in the spring and floods in the fall – what were considered 500-year floods in Cedar Rapids and Des Moines 30 years ago are now considered 100-year floods. Iowa has been getting soggier in spring and fall, with scary dry spells interspersed, and more humid at night by as much as a third since 1980. Everyone knows it has been getting wetter and weirder, especially Dr Gene Takle, a climate scientist at Iowa State University who contributed to reports for the Nobel peace prize-winning IPCC. Takle predicted 20 years ago the floods we see today, already linking it to climate change back then. Farmers just saw ponding and called the tiling company to install more. We’re on our way to doubling the size of the northern Iowa drainage system in the past 30 years as the upper midwest has grown more humid and extreme. This drainage system is delivering runoff rich in farm fertilizer to the Mississippi river complex and the Gulf of Mexico, where the nitrate from Iowa and Illinois corn fields is growing a dead zone the size of New Jersey. The shrimping industry is being deprived of oxygen so Iowa farmers can chase 200 bushels of corn per acre – and hope against hope that corn will somehow increase in price as we plow up every last acre. That flow also is creating a toxic source for Des Moines Water Works, which is facing up to $100m in improvements to remove agricultural chemicals from the Raccoon river that supplies 500,000 thirsty denizens. The waterworks sued our county over it, along with two others, but a federal judge threw out the case because you simply can’t sue an Iowa drainage district. And that means that there is no way to regulate agriculture as it responds to extreme weather and market consolidation that seeks immediate return. Meanwhile, those huge rainfalls on exposed black dirt wash it to the vales even from the flat ground of our neighborhood. We are losing soil at two to three tons an acre a year. Nature can regenerate the soil at only a half-ton a year. So we are washing our black gold down the river four to six times faster than we can regrow it. Because we have less soil, the corn and soya beans are starting to show it in lower protein in the kernel or pod. Corn is yielding higher starch content, notes agronomist Dr Rick Cruse of Iowa State. He adds that wheat production in China is falling because of degraded soil wrought by extreme weather and poor stewardship. It follows that overall corn yields, or at least relative value for the most-used crop in the world, will decline. Here, this year, we see it in variable crop yields from township to township. It is starting to factor into land prices, which is the foundational wealth of the upper midwest and especially in Iowa. The University of Minnesota forecasts, based on research at Nasa, that Iowa corn yields could drop in half within the next half-century because of extreme weather and soil depletion. Yet nobody is talking about it. We expect that the chemists and geneticists will handle it and keep those yields ramping up come hell or high water. Down in Kansas, they are resigned to the fact that the water will be gone sooner rather than later. The high plains are locked in drought. You used to run a calf on 40 acres of prairie grass; now it takes 100. Depending on the source, you will hear that the Ogallala Aquifer slaking the huge cattle feedlots from Amarillo to Dodge City will be drunk dry in as few as 20 years. It’s down 150 feet at Dodge City since 1950. The Ogallala can’t take much of a recharge there. And the demand on the rivers is just as great. “Everybody acknowledges that those cattle will just move to another area,” said Don Blankenau, an attorney for the state of Nebraska, in its compact with Kansas that regulates the Republican river from which cattle and corn irrigators draw from ever-lower flows. But it’s not a part of the political conversation per se. Nobody is talking about climate change in their campaigns, or the implications for food production near-term, or how water will be handled in fast-changing conditions. It is one of those electric rails, because so much money is wrapped up in the corn-ethanol-meat-soya bean complex as it stands. Farmers are taking action on their own, after losing money six straight years in Iowa and wondering where the corn ethanol bubble of 2008 went. They are starting to look into cover crops like rye to protect the soil and hold nutrients in place during these increasingly harsh flushes. They also can help store moisture by building soil tilth to ward off dry spells, which could span decades. “You have flavors of the Dust Bowl,” Takle said, sprinkled by torrents in the future. Another soil scientist, Jerry Hatfield of the National Lab for Agriculture and the Environment in Ames, told my reporter son Tom that we can make agriculture resilient to a changing climate. But it will take a transformation in thinking that is not yet reflected in the political conversation. Few politicians in the five states around here are talking about regulating agriculture in an era of warmer and wetter nights and long droughts. Yet farmers are paying attention. Hatfield says that conventional producers in the Raccoon river watershed are starting to focus on profitability reports from sustainable agriculture groups like the Practical Farmers of Iowa. They advocate a rotating crop-livestock land use with more diverse plantings that can restore soil and make farmers more resilient – and get them off that expensive chemical jones. Because, the government doesn’t appear equipped to deal with it. The state of Iowa and the state of Ohio each spend about a dollar per acre per year on water and soil quality – on land that costs up to $10,000 per acre. Politicians are still talking bioswales and mini-marshes when we all need to be thinking, at least, about retiring a third of the land in the upper midwest from corn and soy rotations. That isn’t something that the ag supply chain – controlled by the Koch brothers, Bayer-Monsanto and Dow-Dupont – can readily accept, because to give up acres is to give up revenue. And they happen to control the political infrastructure in the Corn Belt. But at some point the construct fails. In western Kansas, they’re having a tough time growing corn even with irrigation and chemicals. It is getting so warm that the plant simply cannot service itself. Without more urgency, the problems will continue to grow worse than soya beans standing in six inches of water waiting on a combine to sweep them up. The fellows around the coffee maker know it. And so do the people down in Des Moines trying to make a safe cup of coffee, along with Amarillo ranchers. The politicians just haven’t caught up. • This article was amended on 24 October 2018.

"One of the world’s leading climate scientists has launched a scathing attack on the government’s fracking programme, accusing ministers of aping Donald Trump and ignoring scientific evidence. James Hansen, who is known as the father of climate science, warned that future generations would judge the decision to back a UK fracking industry harshly.  “So the UK joins Trump, ignores science… full throttle ahead with the worst fossil fuels,” Hansen told the Observer. “The science is crystal clear, we need to phase out fossil fuels starting with the most damaging, the ‘unconventional’ fossil fuels such as tar sands and ‘fracking’.” Hansen has also written to the UK energy minister, Claire Perry, to underline his objections, warning that the decision was a serious policy error that would contribute to “climate breakdown”. His intervention came as the first fracking operation in England for seven years – which had been due to get under way on Saturday in Lancashire – was postponed until Monday because of bad weather. It also followed the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report last week that warned the world has only 12 years left to avoid catastrophic climate change, calling on governments to take radical and far-reaching measures to decarbonise their economies. Last week it emerged that Perry was considering relaxing rules on the earthquake limits on fracking, making it easier for companies to push ahead at sites in England. But in his letter Hansen warned that young people could inherit an environment “out of their control” if fracking was pursued. “If the UK were to join the US by developing gas fields at this point in time it will lock in the methane problem for decades,” he wrote, adding that fracking would fatally undermine the UK’s attempt to fulfil its climate obligations. “The fossil fuel companies are well aware methane is a potent greenhouse gas, and yet they seem willing to continue on a path which can have disastrous consequences for our grandchildren,” Hansen said. The Conservative party’s fracking programme – which aims to release fossil fuel gas from wells at sites across England – has been dogged by criticism from environmentalists as well as fierce local opposition. There is a moratorium on the practice in Scotland and Wales. Last month three environmental activists were jailed for their part in a direct action campaign at the Preston New Road fracking site near Blackpool in Lancashire. The Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE), which obtained a copy of Hansen’s letter, said it was “imperative that the government heeds the advice, concerns and warnings of leading scientists over fracking”. “The severity of the warnings from the IPCC report underline why fracking is a dead duck,” said Tom Fyans, director of campaigns and policy at the CPRE. “We must speed up the transition to renewable energy – we have absolutely no time to mess around introducing a new carbon-emitting fossil fuel industry.” The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy defended its support of the controversial energy source. “Shale gas has the potential to be a new domestic energy source, enhancing our energy security and delivering economic benefits, including the creation of well-paid, quality jobs,” it said in a statement, adding it would respond to Hansen’s letter “in due course”. It pointed out that the UK’s Committee on Climate Change “recognises that natural gas can help the UK meet its 2050 carbon emissions reduction target” and that since 1990 the UK has “cut emissions by more than 40% while growing our economy by more than two thirds; a feat unmatched by other G7 countries”. However there is growing disquiet in Tory ranks about the government’s fracking plans. Almost two dozen Conservative MPs are reported to be opposed to fracking and willing to “destroy the government’s majority” if ministers seek to push proposals to relax rules through parliament. Fyans said it was essential that the government listen to the “views and concerns of communities who will see their local environment industrialised” if fracking goes ahead. “The current proposals to fast-track fracking through the planning system, which the government are consulting on, will take local people’s voices out of the discussion,” he said. “Whether or not you agree with fracking, it is a fundamental democratic right for people to be able to voice their concerns – we cannot deny communities this opportunity.” The pressure is also building from the scientific community. The IPCC report called on governments to take radical action to decarbonise their economies. And in his letter Hansen warned that any politicians or officials who push ahead with fracking would bear “disproportionate responsibility” for the consequences. “I urgently call upon politicians of any persuasion to reflect on the peer-reviewed scientific information that is readily available and which clearly points to the need to rapidly phase down fossil emissions,” he wrote. “A task made much more difficult and probably implausible if the world exacerbates the problem by expanding fossil fuel emissions via fracking technology.”"
"It is depressing to think that for the first time since the return of democracy in 1985 Brazilians have elected a far-right president of the republic. Jair Bolsonaro, a seven-term lawmaker and former army captain, represents a clear and present danger not only to his country but to the planet. At home he has defended dictatorship and torture and joked about killing his leftwing opponents. He has a history of denigrating women, gay people and minorities. The president-elect promises to bring order by spreading chaos with a relaxation of gun laws. This will cost lives in a country that already records more than 60,000 murders a year. In a familiar but chilling pattern, Mr Bolsonaro successfully pitched himself as the anti-establishment candidate, appealing to voters fed up with political graft and violent crime. There’s every reason to think that Brazilians who voted in haste for Mr Bolsonaro will repent at leisure. Mr Bolsonaro’s programme, if taken seriously, and his environmental utterances, if taken literally, amount to a threat to humanity. Brazil’s new president takes office in January, in charge of the world’s lungs, the Amazon, and the world’s breadbasket, the Cerrado savannah. He will be able to decide the course of the battle against climate change at a critical point. The signs are not good. It is thought that we have 12 years to prevent the dangerous destabilisation of Earth’s climate because of the way we live. Our patterns of existence have already led to widespread annihilation of wildlife, a disaster so large that it threatens civilisation. Yet Mr Bolsonaro’s key election pledge was to put his presidency behind Brazil’s huge agri-corporations. He favours business over biodiversity and calls for pro-market ways of exploiting Brazil’s natural resources, notably coming out against the policy of reserving the 12% of the country’s land for indigenous tribes. The far-right president-elect has also promised to weaken the enforcement of environmental laws, while criminalising activism. It is a package of measures that will not reform the model of capitalism that is slowly boiling the atmosphere, but turbocharge it.  Mr Bolsonaro says he will not scrap the Paris climate agreement, where Brazil set itself ambitious climate targets, as long as he gets assurances that his country would not cede sovereignty to native tribes or international jurisdiction over the Andes mountains, Amazon rainforest and Atlantic Ocean. This is a contradiction that will prove impossible to resolve: Mr Bolsonaro’s policies will help pave over the rainforest – with new highways and dams promised in the Amazon basin – and make it all but impossible for Brazil to reduce its carbon footprint. Until now Brazil has been, on balance, a moral force for the environmental good: largely resisting siren calls to exploit its vast natural resources for shareholder value, while bringing together rich and poor nations during climate talks. It was the frontrunner to hold the next UN climate talks. Now, instead of helping, the world’s fourth largest democracy looks like it will do irreparable harm. With the US administration run by climate-change sceptics and China tacking away from its green stance, Europe must take a lead. The EU has a hand to play with Brazil. Deforestation is largely driven by demand for land to grow soybeans – exported to feed livestock – and to expand cattle farms. The EU is the biggest foreign investor in Brazil. Latin America’s largest economy is the biggest exporter of agricultural products to Europe. There is a strong case for new European laws to guarantee that no products or financial transactions linked to the EU lead to deforestation, forest degradation and human rights violations. If the EU acts the UK should follow suit to curb Mr Bolsonaro’s worst environmental instincts, which are a menace to everyone on the planet."
"Major climate science reports usually pass by largely unnoticed, but in the wake of the latest IPCC report a number of journalists laudably grilled Republican lawmakers about its findings. While their responses were predictably terrible, it’s nevertheless crucial for journalists to hold GOP politicians accountable for their climate denial and policy inaction. Donald Trump’s answers were particularly ignorant and nonsensical in his 60 Minutes interview with Lesley Stahl.  None of the Republicans exhibited Stage 1 climate denial (denying that it’s happening), but several remain in Stage 2 (denying humans are responsible). Trump was the worst of the lot, telling Stahl: Something’s happening [with the climate] and it’ll change back again … I don’t know that it’s manmade. Earth’s climate isn’t magical. Each of its changes has physical causes and will only “change back” if something causes them to do so. Trump’s claim is akin to arguing that if he gains 50 lbs by eating McDonald’s fast food every day he’ll eventually ‘change back’ to his less obese self. Doing so would require a physical cause, like a change in diet. Fossil fuels are the climate’s greasy fast food. Similarly, Trump’s top economic advisor Larry Kudlow said to George Stephanopoulos on ABC’s This Week: how much of [climate change] is manmade, how much of it is solar, how much of it is oceanic, how much of it is rain forest and other issues? I think we’re still exploring all of that. And Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) told CNN’s Jake Tapper: I can’t tell you to what percentage of [climate change] is due to human activity Climate scientists can. It’s 100% since 1950. For @marcorubio @jaketapper and anyone else, it’s a good thing that scientists have indeed already looked at how much recent trends in climate are due to human activity. https://t.co/h5xLrvY41O[narrator: it was all of it] This is settled science, about which there’s a 97% expert consensus. But of course, Republican politicians prefer the beliefs of the less than 3% of contrarian climate scientists. When Stahl pressed Trump on the conclusions of expert climate scientists, Trump cited some “scientists” whose opinions he prefers. We have scientists that disagree with [human-caused global warming] … You’d have to show me the [mainstream] scientists because they have a very big political agenda The only ‘political agenda’ of the climate scientists writing the IPCC reports is to accurately communicate our understanding of climate science to policymakers. The latest IPCC report cited over 6,000 scientific studies. Marco Rubio used the same tactic as Trump, saying: And I think many scientists would debate what percentage is attributable to man versus normal fluctuations Trump’s Fox friends also echoed this sentiment: Kilmeade on Stahl’s climate change question: “She really believes in global warming, and that’s fine,” but “I don't think you should bring your point of view” in b/c “there’s other scientists” and “the role of man has not been unveiled to a way in which the president accepts.” pic.twitter.com/gVzajMwIpb There are of course “other scientists.” The question is why we should believe the tiny minority of contrarians are right and the 97% of climate science experts who are convinced by the evidence that humans are driving global warming are wrong. For example, one of deniers’ favorite contrarian scientists is Richard Lindzen, formerly of MIT. Last week, Lindzen told the Daily Mail “Warming of any significance ceased about 20 years ago.” That’s Stage 1 climate denial and a ludicrously wrong assertion: Richard Lindzen tells @DailyMailAU, ""Warming of any significance ceased about 20 years ago"" https://t.co/XkVKFAVtqKReality tells a very different story: pic.twitter.com/HwR48KROE6 So yes, there are scientists who disagree with the magnitude of the human contribution to global warming. And those scientists often deny even the most basic facts and data. They’re the fringe who reject the vast majority of the available scientific evidence. After denying that we know humans are driving climate change, the Republican politicians shifted to economics denial, with Trump again the worst of all: I don’t want to give trillions and trillions of dollars. I don’t want to lose millions and millions of jobs. I don’t want to be put at a disadvantage. Rubio similarly said “I’m also not going to destroy our economy.” But Trump and Rubio seem to think that any efforts to cut carbon pollution will destroy the economy, and that’s just willful ignorance. As Senator Mike Rounds (R-SD) said: We ought to be talking about the things that we can do and still maintain a strong economy, because we’re not going to be able to address it unless we keep a strong economy Rounds is right. Republicans ought to be looking for policies to address climate change that will maintain a strong economy. But with a few exceptions, they (including Mike Rounds, who’s voted against the climate 100% of the time) are not. Kudlow noted: Bill Nordhaus from Yale got a Nobel Prize on his own economic work with respect to climate change … I respect that he’s a really brilliant guy. In 2012, Nordhaus wrote an editorial entitled, “Why the Global Warming Skeptics Are Wrong.” In that piece, he noted: the cost of waiting fifty years to begin reducing CO2 emissions … is $4.1 trillion … Current economic studies also suggest that the most efficient policy is to raise the cost of CO2 emissions substantially, either through cap-and-trade or carbon taxes … The claim that cap-and-trade legislation or carbon taxes would be ruinous or disastrous to our societies does not stand up to serious economic analysis. It’s ironic that Trump says he’s worried about losing trillions of dollars as the economist who his top economic advisor cites as a brilliant expert says that waiting to cut carbon pollution would cost trillions of dollars. The latest IPCC report cited a study finding that 1.5°C global warming would lead to climate damage costs of $54tn, 2°C of $69tn, and 3.7°C of $551tn. We’re currently on track for 3.4°C warming by 2100, and the Trump administration is doing everything in its power to increase carbon pollution and global warming. For perspective, the $551tn estimated cost of climate damages at 3.7°C far exceeds the current global wealth of around $100tn. On the other hand, climate policies need not be expensive. Studies have shown that a revenue-neutral carbon tax could grow the economy and create jobs, for example. And as California has demonstrated, smart climate policies are entirely compatible with economic growth. George Stephanopoulos also asked Senator Jeff Flake (R-AZ) if Republicans are going the wrong direction on climate change. Flake responded: I think so … but there are things that we can do and should do and I think Republicans need to be at the forefront if we want to keep our place and keep our seats While Flake is right, his climate voting record is almost as bad as Mike Rounds’ and on par with Marco Rubio’s. They all voted to confirm Scott Pruitt to head the EPA, tried to block the Clean Power Plan, voted against establishing a climate change education grant program in American schools, and voted against an amendment acknowledging that climate change is real and that man-made pollution is a significant contributor. Flake is notorious for sounding reasonable and then refusing to use his considerable power to act on those reasonable comments. He’s all talk and no action. But he’s right that if the GOP remains the stupid party of climate denial, it will suffer long-term electoral consequences. Marco Rubio tried to sound like a reasonable voice on climate change despite his science denial by pointing to legislation he’s helped advance on sea level rise adaptation. But as renowned glaciologist Lonnie Thompson put it, “the only question is how much we will mitigate, adapt, and suffer.” We certainly will have to adapt to and suffer some serious climate change consequences, but the more we mitigate the problem up front by cutting carbon pollution, the less we’ll need to adapt and suffer. Today’s GOP has gone all in on maximizing climate suffering."
"Activist shareholders in Australia’s largest independent coalminer are expected to vote in record numbers on Thursday to demand Whitehaven Coal aligns its long-term company strategy with the Paris climate agreement. Guardian Australia understands the group Market Forces has secured support from some superannuation funds and large overseas investors in Whitehaven for three resolutions that will be put to the company’s annual general meeting in Sydney.  Will van der Pol, a legal researcher and campaigner at Market Forces, said investors had been “receptive” in recent discussions. One non-binding advisory resolution calls on the company to disclose climate change-related risks to shareholders, in line with recommendations of the Financial Stability Board’s taskforce on climate-related financial disclosures. Another proposal says that shareholders call on the board to make strategy and capital expenditure decisions “consistent with the climate goals of the Paris agreement” in order to safeguard the longer-term success of the company and respond to risks and opportunities posed by climate change. “We move this resolution in order to ensure our company is protected from stranded asset risks, and poised to take advantage of regulatory and market changes as international action is taken to satisfy the goals established by the Paris climate change agreement,” a supporting statement says. “Given the higher stranding risk of coal assets over oil and gas, coal producers should be acting more urgently than other fossil fuel producers. “Presently, Whitehaven Coal does not appear to have its strategy aligned with a scenario consistent with holding global warming below 2C. We consider this dangerous, given it amounts to second-guessing the ambition of 197 nations that signed the Paris agreement.” Any substantial level of support would be significant, considering Whitehaven is a pure-play coalminer. The company released a statement to the ASX on 5 October that indicated it would consider climate risk reporting in 2019, a move interpreted as a concession to activist shareholders. It followed an Australian Securities and Investments Commission report last month critical of the level of climate risk disclosures by companies. “Whitehaven is committed to playing a role in reducing carbon emissions ... by promoting increased use of Whitehaven’s high-quality, low-emissions coal,” the company said in its statement to the ASX.Whitehaven’s future planning is based on the “New Policies Scenario” of the International Energy Agency, under which coal demand to Asia would double by 2040. Under that scenario, global warming would increase to about 2.7 degrees above pre-industrial levels by 2100. Under a Paris baseline scenario modelled by the IEA, international demand for thermal coal would halve by 2040.Van de Pol said the resolutions at Thursday’s Whitehaven AGM were “an opportunity for investors to make their mark and say this is exactly what we expect companies to be doing”. “These sorts of resolutions are about the long-term sustainability of these companies,” he said. Climate activists have increasingly switched from the coalface to the boardroom in recent years, where campaigns for large investors to divest from fossil fuels have gathered pace. At last week’s AGM for the Queensland-based freight rail company Aurizon, investor proxies asked repeated questions about the company’s role in hauling coal and its potential to support operations in the Galilee Basin. The Aurizon chairman, Tim Poole, told the meeting the company’s coal freight rail network had a higher risk profile than other utilities and that the company was concerned about “stranded asset risk”. “At some point in the next 50 years, renewable energy might be such that we might not be hauling as much thermal coal as we are today ... part of our system might not be required,” Poole said."
"The shallow seas around Britain absorb tens of million of tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year, scientists have discovered. This plays a critical role in stabilising the country’s ecology and in lessening the impact of carbon emissions. But researchers warn that shelf seas are increasingly vulnerable to climate change and the impact is likely to worsen. In particular, rising temperatures and increased numbers of intense storms threaten to disrupt the coastal regions’ ability to absorb carbon dioxide. This could accelerate climate change, they state in Shelf Seas: The Engine of Productivity, published this week.  “The seas round Britain are some of the best-studied in the world,” said one author, Phil Williamson of the University of East Anglia. “Yet we are only just finding out how its many complex processes fit together.” UK shelf seas have an average depth of 80 metres and cover 1.6m sq km, an area nearly six times Britain’s land area, and are worth £47bn to the economy. By comparison, the entire north-west European shelf sea covers 3.2m sq km, adds the report on the UK Shelf Sea programme. Although shelf seas comprise only around 7% of the world’s oceans, they support more than 90% of global fish catches. However, they are coming under increasing stress from overfishing, pollution and trawling of the seabed as well as increased shipping, the erection of offshore wind farms and the construction of oil rigs. All these activities have impacts on the battle to limit global warming. According to the report, the north-west European shelf sea – half of which is made up by UK coastal waters – absorb 15-40m tonnes of atmospheric carbon dioxide a year, “the equivalent of between 10 to 25% of all UK carbon emissions”. Some of this carbon is held in the water above the seabed but most – 70% to 88% – has been found in the top 10cm of sediments that make up the UK shelf seas floor. If this carbon is released the consequences could be severe. According to the report, the potential release – from direct human action and indirectly from global warming – of the carbon dioxide in the north-west European shelf sea could result in around £9bn of damage over the next 25 years, much of it in the UK. The report also highlights the dangers posed by trawling, the most widespread human activity in Britain’s shelf seas. Weighted nets dragged across the sea floor kill many more forms of marine life than the fish they are designed to catch. Crucially, the researchers found that a single, initial trawl of a new seabed zone causes most damage while subsequent trawls do less. That means that full exclusion zones – in which no trawling is allowed – will have a greater benefit than allowing different levels of trawling in different zones. This “suggests there should be an all or nothing approach to marine protection zones”, said Williamson. We would like to hear from you if you are taking part in any of the

"Anote Tong has had quite a week. The former president of Kiribati has been in Australia to advocate for more robust action on climate change, which threatens to wipe out his Pacific home within a matter of decades as sea levels rise. But on Wednesday he got caught up in controversy when reports emerged that Australia’s environment minister, Melissa Price, allegedly told him it was “always about the cash” when Pacific Islands leaders came to Australia.  As a result, Tong has become hot property. When we meet in the late afternoon the next day he has been on the go since 4am with interviews and meetings. While Price’s alleged comments have given him prominence, they have also threatened to derail his message about the impact of climate change on Kiribati and what countries such as Australia should be doing to help. Tong says he did not hear the comments Price is alleged to have made at a restaurant. “I do have a hearing problem. I’m a free diver and I lost my hearing [in one ear],” he says. “If it was true that those were the comments then I would not be happy.” Mostly, Tong just wants to move on. “We’ve gone beyond that, I don’t want to go back. I’ve had a call from the minister, which I thought was very gracious of her to do that, just saying if I have offended you in any way I assure you it was not my intention.” Tong has other criticism for the environment minister and her colleagues. He was angered by their reactions to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report last week, which said the world had just 12 years to limit global warming to a maximum of 1.5C. Price said it would be “irresponsible” for Australia to commit to phase out coal by 2050, while the deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, said Australia would not change policy based on the recommendations of “some sort of report”. “I was not happy. I was very disappointed when the credibility of the report was being questioned, because there is no alternative science being put forward and what’s at stake is not minor,” said Tong. “It’s not about the marginal rise in price or reduction in price of energy, it’s about lives, it’s about the future.” If Australia, which has been criticised by its Pacific neighbours for failing to take more concerted action to reduce emissions, does not change its tone, Tong says it is in danger not only of losing its position as a regional leader but of being welcome in regional organisations at all. “When countries in the region do things that are not proper, like have a coup, we expel them from the regional body … When you believe somebody is destroying your future and your home, what should you do?” For Kiribati, the impacts of climate change are being felt acutely, with increased storms and flooding. Rising sea levels mean it is inevitable the island will disappear, says Tong. “If it doesn’t happen in 20 years’ time, it’ll happen in 50 years’ time or in 100 years’ time.” When people have to leave Kiribati, Tong does not want them to leave in an emergency situation or as climate change refugees – a term he dislikes. Instead, he says, governments should be training people in countries such as Kiribati that are feeling the brunt of climate change so they can get jobs elsewhere, which Tong calls “migration with dignity”. “We have more than enough time to make our people qualified,” he said. “It has already worked. We had a Kiribati-Australia nursing initiative, where our young people were trained in Queensland and they found jobs in Australia.” By one estimate from an Oxfam report last year, the sea-level rise resulting from 2C of warming could submerge land that is currently home to 280 million people. Each year from 2008 and 2016 an average of 21.8 million people were reported as newly internally displaced by extreme weather disasters such as cyclones. Tong says Kiribati and other countries like it are “owed” the resources to train their people so they can relocate. “If I drop a tree on your home and I come to you and say ‘where are you going to live?’ [you’re] going to say: ‘I’m going to live with you until my home is fixed.’ That’s the normal thing, isn’t it? Otherwise I think I take you to court. Now we don’t have that remedy, but I think the principles are essentially the same.” "
"Incentives for consumers to buy hybrid and electric cars rather than diesel or petrol alternatives have been slashed by the government, adding thousands of pounds to the price of a new low-emission vehicle. Car manufacturers said the decision was an “astounding” move. It comes only three months after the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, published a Road to Zero strategy to curb vehicle emissions by promoting greener cars and three days after the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change called for an urgent switch to electric vehicles. The plug-in car grant, which since 2011 has knocked £4,500 off the purchase price of a brand new electric vehicle, will be cut in early November by £1,000, while incentives of £2,500 to buy new hybrid cars will be abolished altogether. The Department for Transport (DfT) has not confirmed how long the grant for electric vehicles will be available but says it will support the purchase of 35,000 zero-emission cars, likely to run early into the next decade. More than 160,000 new cars have been eligible for the grant since its inception, of which around 100,000 were hybrids, a total subsidy to date of around £600m. The DfT said that because plug-in hybrid models, such as the the Mitsubishi Outlander, were now established and popular among consumers, it was focusing its attention on zero emission models such as the Nissan Leaf and BMW i3. Hydrogen fuel cell cars will also remain eligible. To qualify, vehicles must have CO2 emissions of less than 50g/km and be able to travel at least 112 km (70 miles) without any CO2 exhaust emissions. Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), said: “We understand the pressure on the public purse but, given the importance of environmental goals, it’s astounding that just three months after publishing its road to zero strategy, the government has reduced the incentive that gives consumers most encouragement to invest in ultra-low emission vehicles. “Removing the grant for plug-in hybrids is totally at odds with already challenging ambitions for CO2 reduction and sends yet more confusing signals to car buyers.” Hawes said manufacturers had invested billions in new technologies but plug-in hybrids remained less than 2% of overall sales and warned that removing upfront purchase grants could have “a devastating impact on demand”. Car dealers said the decision risked undermining progress in the low-emission sector. Sue Robinson, the director of the National Franchised Dealers Association, said it was “extremely disappointing”. The AA said its research showed the vast majority of drivers cited the purchase price as the main obstacle to owning an ultra-low emission vehicle. Jack Cousens, the AA’s head of roads policy, said: “The government wants to end the sale of petrol and diesel cars but scrapping grants for low-emission cars may well stall their progress.” Any rush by consumers to buy while the grants are still available at the current rates could result in the 9 November deadline being brought forward, the DfT said. Darren Shirley, the chief executive of Campaign for Better Transport, said it was “the wrong signal for the government to send”. He added: “Plans to ban petrol and diesel cars are an important step towards cleaner air but electric vehicles play a vital role and help is needed in making them more affordable in the short term.” Around 35,000 Outlanders are now on UK roads, the most popular model of hybrid to have benefited from the grant until now. More than 40,000 cars so far this year have qualified for the grant, up 23% from last year, according to SMMT figures. Just over a quarter of those are pure electric vehicles, which will remain eligible for the reduced funding. The DfT said it would also establish a £2m fund to subsidise new e-cargo bikes, offering up to £5,000 for businesses who replace older, polluting vans with the zero-emission cycles."

"I have to take issue with Jo Steranka (How you can do your bit in the war against climate change, Letters, 18 October). Dishwashers are typically much more efficient than hand washing in terms of energy and water consumption. Research carried out by Christian Paul Richter (Usage of dishwashers: observation of consumer habits in the domestic environment, International Journal of Consumer Studies, 2011) on 200 households in Germany, Italy, Sweden and Britain, found that households with a dishwasher used on average 50% less water and 28% less energy per cleaned item than households that didn’t own a dishwasher. Even so, a higher degree of sustainability was identified because 20% of dishwasher cycles were not fully utilised and 52% operated at a temperature that was higher than necessary. Furthermore, Jo Steranka states that “opinion pieces don’t help if they don’t offer practical solutions”; er, has she tried digging up a paved garden? Getting around a city (that isn’t London) without a car? Not buying new clothes until the old ones wear out? Get real, Jo! (Although I do agree about buying local produce and turning off the lights at bedtime – are there people who don’t?)  Finally, let’s put the blame where it really belongs: the fossil fuel industry, big energy companies, the City and their mates in parliament who give us warm words and sympathy whilst blocking any real progress on climate change.Eric BanksHuntsham, Devon • Colin Ferguson’s defence of the dishwasher (Letters, 19 October) is misguided. Washing by hand uses less water if you use a washing-up bowl. A dishwasher only does better if one washes under a running tap. But he makes the common mistake of treating flow, not stock. A dishwasher embodies significant energy and raw materials, and needs to be disposed of and replaced. Life cycle analysis figures have been used to justify dishwashers, but these usually assume that hand washing is done under a hot tap run at full blast for a prolonged period, and completely ignore the environmental impact of the electronic and plastic components.Clare HayCambridge • Once built and installed, a dishwasher may well use much less energy and water than washing by hand, but how does it compare when the extraction of raw materials, the making and assembling of its component parts, and delivery into the home are taken into account?Michael RobinsonBerkhamsted, Hertforshire • Please can someone explain to me how washing up by hand (one bowl of hot water, dishes washed in order of cleanliness, obviously, possibly another bowl for extra dirty saucepans, after soaking) can ever use more water and energy than a dishwasher, which swishes around for an hour or so, at temperatures that make contents too hot to handle when finished? I cannot understand the comparison. But then I am a devoted hand washer-up.

"Donald Trump sat down for a wide-ranging interview with 60 Minutes, in which he was pushed on China, Russia, climate change, his mockery of Christine Blasey Ford, and whether, as he came toward the end of his second year in office, he had any regrets. Here are eight key takeaways: Interviewer Lesley Stahl began by talking about the recent season of hurricanes, including Hurricane Michael, which devastated Florida last week, claiming at least 19 lives. She asked Trump whether he still thinks climate change was a hoax and while he said he did not think climate change was a hoax, he also told her that did not think it was man-made, or would have permanent impacts. “I think something’s happening. Something’s changing and it’ll change back again. I don’t think it’s a hoax, I think there’s probably a difference. But I don’t know that it’s man-made,” said Trump. Trump also accused scientists who say hurricanes are getting more frequent and intense because of climate change of having “a very big political agenda”. Asked about Jamal Khashoggi, Trump said that if the attack was found to be a state-sponsored murder, there would be “severe punishment” for those involved, saying there is “something really terrible and disgusting” about murdering a reporter – a view Trump himself said people might be surprised to hear from him. But, when asked whether he would consider stopping sales of weapons to Saudi Arabia, Trump seemed unwilling. “I tell you what I don’t want to do. Boeing, Lockheed, Raytheon, all these com(panies) – I don’t want to hurt jobs. I don’t want to lose an order like that. There are other ways of punishing.” Trump was repeatedly and expressly asked whether he would reinstate the policy of separating immigrant parents and children at the US-Mexico border, but would not give a straight answer, saying “we’re looking at a lot of things.” When pushed, Trump said: “You can’t say yes or no. What I can say is this: There are consequences from coming into a country, namely our country, illegally.” I will be interviewed on “60 Minutes” tonight at 7:00 P.M., after NFL game. Enjoy! Stahl brought up Trump’s now infamous speech at a political rally in Mississippi in which he mimicked Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who testified before the Senate judiciary committee that Brett Kavanaugh attempted to rape her when they were both teenagers. Trump said if he had not made that speech, “we would not have won” and defended Kavanaugh as an “extraordinary” man. “Why did you have to make fun of her?” asked Stahl. “I didn’t really make fun of her,” Trump replied, adding he thought Ford had been treated “with great respect” despite the fact “there are those that think she shouldn’t have”. Trump said he suspects his defense secretary, General Jim Mattis, might be a Democrat and “could be” heading for the exit. Responding to a question about whether Matthis was going to leave, Trump said: “It could be that he is. I think he’s sort of a Democrat, if you want to know the truth. But General Mattis is a good guy. We get along very well. He may leave. I mean, at some point, everybody leaves. Everybody. People leave. That’s Washington.” Trump said that while he thinks he has a “great cabinet” there are some people he’s not happy with. He agreed with comments made by his wife Melania in a ABC interview last week, that there are some people in the White House who weren’t trustworthy, saying: “I’m not a baby. It’s a tough business. This is a vicious place.” Trump reiterated his standard foreign policy views: China is bad, the EU treats the US like chumps, Trump will stick with Nato as long as other countries pay more towards it, Russia might have meddled in the US election but they’re not that bad, and he has “great chemistry” with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Trump accepted that Vladimir Putin was “probably” involved in assassinations and poisonings. As for Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, Trump said he believed they meddled, but China meddled, too. “And I think, frankly, China is a bigger problem,” said the president. The tone of the interview was often tense, with Trump telling Stahl at one point “I’m president and you’re not”. While Trump was not as openly hostile to Stahl as he has been to some other journalists, he rarely let her get out a full question, before jumping in to begin his answer or contradict her, meaning the transcript makes for fairly choppy reading. Finally, the president revealed his capacity for self-reflection and humility when Stahl asked him if there was anything he wished he hadn’t said or done in his almost two years in office. One regret sprang quickly to mind: the press’s treatment of him. “So when I won the presidency – the press treats me terribly – I thought very strongly that, you know, the one great thing will happen is the press will start treating me great. Lesley, they treat me worse. They got worse instead of better. Very dishonest.” Stahl pressed: but is there anything you regret? “I regret that the press treats me so badly,” he said."
"Opening in the week the UN has made dire warnings about climate change, Clare Duffy’s two-hander about an ecowarrior and her conservative mother could hardly be more timely. It pits Neshla Caplan, as a young activist preparing to join a Greenpeace-style protest at an Arctic Circle oil rig, against Jennifer Black as her head-in-the-sand mother, who would sooner her daughter put the safety of her family before that of the planet. For all its topicality, however, Arctic Oil skirts around the issues before being diverted into a schmaltzy generation-gap drama. Every playwright needs a reason to keep their characters on stage and Duffy’s solution is unambiguous: the older woman lures her daughter into the bathroom, locks the door and swallows the key. It’s only the first of a sequence of events which, however unlikely, have the merit of keeping the two women in the same place, the better to vent their pent-up frustration and explain their political perspectives.  On a northerly island made wealthy by oil-company investment, one woman’s idealism and campaigning zeal is set against the other’s history of compromise. The conflict is in their maternal instincts: one to nurture the environment, the other to nurture her family. For all the vigour of the performances in Gareth Nicholls’s carefully modulated production, the 75-minute play relies too much on withheld information, retrospective arguments and the settling of old scores; too little on the fertile debate about whether to be passive or active in the face of global catastrophe. After a sequence of melodramatic twists, it makes the sentimental bonding of mother and daughter seem more important than the destruction of the planet. At the Traverse, Edinburgh, until 20 October."
"Rebecca Solnit’s article (Don’t despair: history shows we can still save the planet, 15 October) is another version of “Please someone else sort this out!” The hope on offer is that groups as yet unformed will emerge to save us from global catastrophe. Today’s green organisations and political parties don’t have any answers. If they did, they would tell us all what to do. Neither do governments or big business. Why? Because they are only responding to our demands for cheap goods, easy living and endless economic growth in the rich countries of the world.  Only we the people can prevent catastrophic climate change in our lifetimes. Here are seven things that we can do now: 1. Never buy anything new until the old one breaks, including clothes. You’ll reduce demand for materials, their transportation around the planet and the pollution when they go to landfill. 2. Get rid of your dishwasher – it wastes energy and water. 3. Dig up the pavers and plant a garden. You’ll help prevent flooding. 4. If you live in a city, why do you need a car? Get the bus, cycle or walk. Hire a car to go on holiday. 5. Turn off the lights at bedtime. 6. Buy local produce; cut down food miles. 7. Persuade your neighbours to do the same. Opinion pieces don’t help if they don’t offer practical solutions.Jo SterankaClacton-on-Sea, Essex • Rebecca Solnit is right to be optimistic about the future even if it won’t be easy to reduce our dependency on fossil fuels. Wind and solar plant can now generate cheaper electricity than coal or gas, if only because wind and sunlight are free. Furthermore, as the cost of battery storage falls, renewable energy will become increasingly competitive to the extent that those, like Donald Trump, who try to support hydrocarbon technology will actually handicap their own economies and make them less competitive in future. Rolling out renewable energy capacity is not just about protecting the environment but also about running a successful economy in the 21st century.Liam O’KeeffeAbinger Hammer, Surrey • The battle between public broadcasting and news and entertainment provided by organisations using cloud-based technologies is not only commercial (Update law to keep us top of TV listings, say public broadcasters, 15 October). And it is not only culture and democracy at stake here. The cloud is a euphemism for lots of Earth-based energy-hungry servers, and streaming accounts for a big fraction of internet traffic already. In the light of climate scientists’ ever more urgent calls for drastic reductions in dangerous emissions, champions of public service broadcasting should add its modest call on future precious electricity to its case.Sara ParkinSustainability Literacy Project • It is “great, so very great” that after three of the most damaging hurricanes in US history, President Trump is at least acknowledging that climate change is probably a “real thing”, if not yet believing it is manmade (Trump says climate change is no hoax, but claims ‘it will change back again’, 16 October). Yet he goes on to berate climate scientists for “having a political agenda”. If only as many politicians had a scientific agenda, we might actually be able to get something useful done.Andrew TinsleyHenley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire  • Your profile of the Institution of Engineering and Technology’s report on the urgent need to retrofit thousands of homes to meet the Uk’s climate targets highlights the government’s failures (UK’s housing stock ‘needs massive retrofit to meet climate targets’, 11 October). However, putting the focus on retrofitting social housing is misguided. As our recent report on poor condition housing in the north shows, the highest level of non-decent poorly insulated homes is in the private sector - mostly among older homeowners. The social housing stock is in a much better state than the private rented or owner-occupied homes.Paul HackettDirector, the Smith Institute • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

"Countries that may not be thought of as climate leaders are emerging at the front-lines on responding to climate change. One great example is Iran. I have the fortune of performing water-use research with a number of scientists in Iran. And I can assure you they are thinking about, planning, and taking action to reduce the impacts of climate change and ecological destruction. One example of an Iranian leader is Dr. Mohammad Taghi Sattari who is an Associate Professor of water engineering at the University of Tabriz. He recently wrote a report about an effort in Iran to handle their water availability crises. It probably doesn’t surprise people that Iranians think about water availability; it is a country with limited rainfall. And the concurrence of three issues (water management, growing population, and climate change) make this is particularly challenging problem. In 2017, the Iranian government released a report from the Strategic Studies Center that showed water availability is viewed as the second-most important national issue. Statistical data from the Iranian government’s Power Ministry and from the World Bank predict that Iran is soon to enter a broad and extensive water crisis. If the crisis is not properly managed, there will be both direct and indirect economic costs, social upheaval, and security consequences. According to the published data, in 2014, the annual rainfall in Iran averaged 228 mm (less than a foot). This is 1/5th the world-average rainfall. As a country, Iranian’s rainfall put them in the 163rd position. Dr. Sattari believes that even though the amount of rainfall in Iran is very low, proper management could enable it to match the needs of the country. In the past few decades, Iran has moved to more substantial agricultural development. Some of the newer cultured crops are water intensive, for instance watermelon. An astonishing 92% of the country’s water is devoted to agriculture (compared with approximately 70% for other developing countries and only 40% for developed countries). In an effort to more efficiently use water in Iran, many large dams have been built. These dams have led to an explosion in agricultural production but have also caused unintended consequences for downstream water rights and water availability. The result is that agricultural water has been made so cheap that it is being used in very water-intensive crops. The exported crops are being sold for less money than the water they hold. Simply put, Iran is exporting water via its watermelons. But there is hope. The president of Iran, Dr. Hassan Rouhani has identified water as the nation’s second-most severe threat. This means that Iran’s government is taking the problem very seriously. The country is developing a people-centered water management system that brings together administrators, economic experts, and politicians to make informed decisions. Part of the effort is through water education – teaching people how to use water most efficiently. Also, latitude is being given to people to design, adjust, and implement water resource policies. Iran is exploring different water-management technologies that will better handle the intermittent rainfall. I have seen these technologies and have worked with researchers to publish performance results. It is exciting work. Make no mistake, Iran’s water problem is a real and crises are coming. But the country is devoting the entirety of its national energy to solve the problem. The area I am particularly interested is Lake Urmia. It is a critically important lake near the Turkish border. Approximately 70% of the surface area of the lake has disappeared; the shores are replaced by beds of salt. I spoke to my colleague, Dr. Sattari about his work and he said, I am an associate professor at the Department of Water Science and Engineering in University of Tabriz. At my university, research on water resources management, especially in the Urmia Lake drought crisis, is one of the most important research topics. Several research teams are working hard in this area. The topics of the thesis of Msc and PHD students will be rooted in this direction and the results of this research will be published in the most reputable and specialized journals of the world. The Urmia lake basin and its salvation are the main goals of our independent research. I and my colleagues believe that we can overcome these crises and once again return the Urmia Lake to its previous state. How nice to have an optimistic view in these trying times. Working together, scientists and decision makers around the world can make this planet a better place. For the people living around places like Lake Urmia, their fate is in the hands of people like Dr. Sattari."
"The Australian Conservation Foundation will target three marginal seats in Victoria and Queensland in a bid to push “middle Australia” to demand more action on climate change, its chief executive has said. Kelly O’Shanassy made the comments at the National Press Club on Tuesday, unveiling the environmental group’s election action plan to break the political deadlock over climate change.  The ACF will target the Victorian seats of Chisholm, currently held by Liberal MP Julia Banks, and McNamara, held by retiring Labor MP Michael Danby, along with Bonner in Queensland where the incumbent is Liberal MP Ross Vasta. Banks has announced she will not recontest her seat as a Liberal, leading to speculation she could run as an independent; while McNamara will likely be a repeat of the three-cornered contest between Labor, Liberal and the Greens at the 2016 election. O’Shanassy said the group chose the “middle Australian marginal seats” because it wanted to “move the country forward on climate change”. One third of voters in the seats had climate change as their top concern,a dynamic the ACF hoped would create a “race to the top” on climate policy. Climate policy is set to be a key issue in the 2019 election, with Labor promising the national energy guarantee or something similar to achieve a 45% reduction in carbon emissions from electricity by 2030, and the Greens promising to push Labor to be “as ambitious as it possibly can be”. On Tuesday, the University of New South Wales released a report, commissioned by the mining union, calling for a new federal government authority to manage the closure of coal power plants rather than leave the timing and conditions to power companies. Australia has 23 coal-fired power stations forecast by their operators to be closed by 2050. The report argues the government should manage the transition by creating an energy transition authority, investing in public sector infrastructure to generate employment and promoting new hubs for hi-tech industries and services. The Morrison government has stared down calls from Coalition conservatives to withdraw Australia from the Paris climate agreement and abolish small-scale renewables subsidies, but has shelved the emissions reduction component of the Neg and refused to rule out measures to support new coal-fired power stations. O’Shanassy took aim at Scott Morrison for claiming Australia will meet its 2030 climate targets “in a canter – despite the evidence showing otherwise”, the environment minister Melissa Price for saying that getting rid of coal to save the Great Barrier Reef was a “long bow” and Bill Shorten “ says coal will be part of our future”. O’Shanassy said Morrison was “harming his constituents and all Australians and doing so with his eyes wide open” by “dismissing climate change [and] being a spruiker for the coal industry”. “Right now, it doesn’t look good. Australia is in a climate policy deadlock. We are nowhere after two decades.” O’Shanassy said the blame should lie “at the feet of the pollies” but the environment movement is also “a little culpable” for “missteps”. In response to a later question, O’Shanassy said she was referring to opposition to Kevin Rudd’s proposed carbon pollution reduction scheme, which was blocked by the Greens and Liberals, and not opposition to the Turnbull government’s Neg. She said the Neg “would’ve reduced the amount of clean energy in Australia” which made it a “bad, bad policy”, so the ACF resolved to not oppose the Neg architecture and instead encourage states and the next federal government to raise the emissions reduction target. O’Shanassy said the ACF will make the 2019 election “the climate election” so the major party with “the strongest climate policy” would win. Its policy aims are to “repower Australia with clean electricity by 2030”, move towards zero net pollution before 2050 and prevent new coal mines. The ACF aims to have one million conversations with voters about climate change, including 15,000 in its three target seats. It will distribute scorecards rating parties’ policies but will not tell people how to vote. O’Shanassy said that “asking nicely with policy in hand and evidence that stacks up” had failed to guarantee climate action, so the ACF was now focused on developing community campaigns to “move stubborn governments” and inflict “electoral pain” on parties without a proper climate policy."
"Interview with the energy minister Angus Taylor and Guardian Australia political editor Katharine Murphy. The discussion follows government announcements on measures to reduce power prices, including a “last resort” divestiture power to break up power companies, and mechanisms to boost investment in new electricity generation. I’ll get on to today’s announcements [about measures to lower power prices and increase investment in generation] in a second, but first, what are you doing with small-scale renewable energy scheme (SRES)? Labor has now said it stays until 2030.  AT: There’s no plan to change the SRES. The SRES and the large-scale renewable energy target are around until 2030. They fade between now and 2030, there’s decline as technology continues to improve. That’s our position. You are not going to scale SRES back, you are not going to change it? AT: The deeming rates fall every year between now and 2030. We are not proposing to change that. That’s designed to ensure the subsidy comes off as technology continues to improve. Now to divestiture, it’s often quoted, but never sighted. We haven’t seen this, the legislation … AT: We are very clear there will be a legislative package coming forward this year. I’m not being unnecessarily combative, there’s a sharp end to the question. You are absolutely confident you have the power to do this? AT: Look there’s a series of powers we’ll be putting in a legislative package this year. Divestiture is one of them. It’s a last resort. A lot of this is about saying to the industry we want to see the right behavior, the right outcomes. Then we won’t need to wield the big stick. But we want to see the outcomes. Look, when industries behave badly, one of two things discipline them: competition is always the best, the alternative is regulation. As a utility sector, there is a responsibility to customers which is above and beyond and we want to see that over the coming months. You are confident you have the power to do it? AT: We will put in place a legislative package. Do you expect to be challenged legally in the event you ever use this power? AT: I can’t predict what people are going to do. We want to see the ACCC and the courts with the appropriate set of powers to use if necessary. My strong hope is it will not be necessary, but we’ve got to see the outcomes. If you impose a divestiture power for the power sector, why not other sectors? AT: This sector has seen some extraordinarily poor economic outcomes. We’ve seen people hit with very significant penalties for late payments well above the cost of the payments. We’ve seen market practices which the ACCC outlined in detail in their report, which are completely unacceptable. We’ve seen rapid escalation in standing offers, doubling in Victoria in four years, for people just because they are loyal. This stuff has got to stop. It is a utility sector and an essential service that Australians rely on and there hasn’t been enough competition to get the discipline that’s required. So one of the things we want to do is enhance the level of competition and we will use regulation if we have to. What’s the trigger for forcing divestiture? AT: It’s a last resort. Yes, but what’s the trigger? AT: The issue is have we got enough capacity and supply in the market to meet customers’ needs, and are companies in the sector thwarting that, are they deliberately taking anti-competitive action to withdraw supply from the market to drive up prices. So the trigger is competition? AT: It’s competition and supply. The two are related. But [the behaviour has] got to be extreme. It’s a last resort, but we will use it if we have to. Competition is the trigger, and withdrawal of supply .. AT: Obviously price is the outcome of that. Competition and supply, leading to higher prices, is the ill we are focused on here: lack of competition and lack of supply leading to higher prices and a loss of reliability – that’s what we are concerned about here. This can play out as extreme penalties for customers, it can result in wholesale prices that are too high, it can result in retail prices that are too high, it can result in a failure to participate in the market, and we’ve seen that in South Australia. There’s been very little trading in the wholesale market which makes new entry extremely difficult and that contributes to higher prices. Indemnity? Will the commonwealth indemnify some projects [it supports with the new investment mechanisms] against future carbon risk? AT: What we are saying is the risks that government needs to absorb to get investment in reliable generation, we will look at absorbing. We need the investment. So yes, is the answer? AT: It depends on the circumstances. I am not going to anticipate how to bank these projects. What I am going to say is projects need to happen. We’ll leave it to the experts and the bankers to work out how best to get that happening with the least impact on the public purse. You are open to indemnifying these projects? AT: I’m saying we will look at whatever risks that can’t be managed by the companies that need to be managed to get investment. We need reliable baseload power, but our focus is on getting prices down and ensuring we get a reliability outcome. There are some risks that investors can absorb, there are others they may not be able to absorb. We will look at those risks as we do the work, but the key here is not to anticipate. My experience is when you anticipate the banking, you get it wrong. So maybe, is the answer. AT: I’m saying I’m not going to anticipate the banking. You want me to tell you what the banking is going to be and no one who knows anything about it will anticipate the banking. We’ll look at the projects … And maybe you’ll indemnify future risk … AT: We’ll look at the risks and we’ll seek to minimise the risks to the commonwealth. What investors are most concerned about is political risks. There’s many types of investments, public private partnerships, where government plays a role. This is not new. It’s a very old mechanism for the public to work with the private to make sure investment happens. We will go down that path and we’ll put experts in, an appropriate team, to assess the projects. You do acknowledge that creates a risk for taxpayers. AT: We are going to do everything we can to minimise the risks. The government is well-positioned to manage some risks and the commercial sector is well-positioned to manage others. The new government discussion paper makes it clear the underwriting mechanism could apply to retrofitting existing projects. How is that new generation? AT: It’s new generation if it would otherwise be gone, that’s the point. What we want is additional investment, new investment, that will mean we get capacity we wouldn’t otherwise have. So the real world scenario here is sweating the assets? AT: If it’s an existing site and a new facility that may or may not be interesting. If you want a really good pipeline of projects, you don’t close down your options, you look at the broadest range of options available. We do want competition. We do want new entrants. That’s an important criteria. Obviously a new entrant does have an advantage coming into this market. New entrants are more aggressive in their pricing behaviour in many cases. Creating new competition is going to be a good thing. But retrofitting does apply in some circumstances? AT: We are not ruling it out. In the discussion paper one of the criteria is the project should be unlikely to result in an increase in emissions to a level not more than minus-26%, right? You can drive a truck through that wording but let’s assume that wording is there in good faith, why not keep the national energy guarantee target? AT: We are very confident we are going to get to 26% well ahead of time. The numbers are clear. There will be a 250% increase in renewables in the next three years. We are going from 17.5 terrawatt hours to 44.4 on the Energy Security Board numbers, and since that work was done there has been almost 1,000 megawatts of new renewable capacity has been added to the pipeline. We are very confident we will get to 26% in the early 2020s. Then why not keep the target if you are going to get there anyway? AT: Labor want a higher target. We are not going to facilitate that in any shape or form. Labor want a higher target. We’ve committed to 26%. We think that’s a fair share for Australia. Australia has a very good track record on meeting our targets. Twenty-six per cent is achievable and we are not interested in upping that, because all Australians will pay a lot, particularly in sectors like agriculture and transport. We are not going to load the gun for Labor to have a much higher target. Friday’s energy ministers’ meeting: The Victorian government is four days before caretaker. They won’t agree to anything. AT: We need a final decision in December on the reliability obligation of the national energy guarantee for 1 July implementation. We will be making sure the remaining work that needs to be done is being done between now and December. We are confident states will support this in December. We are going into summer. Victoria is almost 400 megawatts short of capacity to be avoiding blackouts this summer. We want to see Victoria doing the right thing and we’re sure they will as we go into summer. What about the ACCC stuff. Don’t you need their cooperation? AT: There are two ways of doing it, one is through the states and the other is by the commonwealth. We’ve said that we are very open to doing this through the states but it needs to be done properly. Proper benchmark price. Proper reference price. Standing offers coming into line with the reference price. If that is done right we are very happy for that to be done through the states, but we are prepared to override them. Do they need to agree on Friday? AT: We would like to gauge whether the states want to do this cooperatively. We’d like them to, but we are determined to get this done, and we’ll do it ourselves."

"The relentlessly corrosive nature of political debate about climate change can sometimes mask that this is a golden moment for the clean energy industry in Australia. A near-constant stream of investment announcements suggests a barrier has been knocked down such that leading renewable technologies, so long dependent on public subsidies, have assumed market supremacy.  In the Pilbara, Macquarie Bank has joined a proposed $22bn project that plans to use solar and wind to run local mines, create “green” hydrogen energy for north Asia and possibly export electricity to Indonesia. In regional South Australia, the British billionaire industrialist, Sanjeev Gupta, has said he considered building a coal plant to run the Whyalla steelworks he bought last year, but decided it was cheaper to throw roughly $1.5bn at solar, pumped hydro storage, battery storage and co-generation (creating energy from waste gas) as he adopts his “green steel” model. Outside Townsville, zinc refiner Sun Metals recently opened Australia’s first large-scale solar farm built by a major energy user to service part of its own needs and feed the grid. The Clean Energy Council lists 69 large-scale projects across the country that have recently reached “financial close” and are either under construction or presumably about to be. They should mean $15.6bn investment and add 10,978 megawatts of renewable energy capacity to the system. These projects – just those the council knows of – are in addition to the 30 new clean energy plants that started operating in the first nine months of the year. Contracts are being signed at historically cheap prices – a reported $52 per megawatt-hour for the giant Stockyard Hill wind farm in central Victoria, for example. Meanwhile, rooftop solar panels are being installed at an astonishing rate. In May, the head of the Australian Energy Market Operator, Audrey Zibelman, said six panels were going up across the continent every minute, adding the capacity of a large coal power station each year. The consumer watchdog recently recommended incentive schemes for small-scale systems be wound back. Some in the energy industry have suggested there will soon be more solar power coming into the grid than Australia can use but a new study by consultants Green Energy Markets, which examined the amount of solar power expected every 30 minutes out to 2021, rejects this idea. The energy minister, Angus Taylor, says the federal incentive scheme will stay. The investment avalanche is driving an unprecedented transformation of the electricity grid. At the time of writing, clean energy had met 21.8% of national electricity market demand over the past week, suggesting the country is on the cusp of meeting the 2020 renewable energy target of about 23% ahead of schedule. The Clean Energy Council’s chief executive, Kane Thornton, says the momentum is massive; Green Energy Markets suggest it could mean renewable generation hits 33.3% by 2020. Analyst and advocate Simon Holmes à Court says it is likely as much clean energy capacity will be built over the next two years as over the previous 40. In July, the market operator found a business-as-usual path, without policies ramping up, was likely to lead to about 46% clean energy by 2030. It underlined the hollowness of the government’s now-dumped pledge to introduce a national energy guarantee to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from electricity by 26% below 2005 levels over that timeframe, and implied Labor’s 50% renewable energy target would take little effort. (Both targets are less than the change in coal use the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change suggests is necessary for Australia to play its part in limiting global warming.) But while the direction is clear, the picture is murkier than this moment suggests. There are signs investment may soon slow markedly. Most of the investment is being driven by the renewable energy target, which peaks in 2020 and stays at that level for the following decade. The spending to meet the target has come in a rush lately, mainly because then-prime minister Tony Abbott commissioned a review by businessman and climate sceptic Dick Warbuton, who wanted to end it. The uncertainty triggered an investment strike that lasted the better part of two years before the target was ultimately reduced. But the target has done its job. With no policy to replace it, the incentive to build clean energy plants is expected to fall off significantly. This is already being seen in wholesale energy futures markets, where it is playing a role in prices trending upwards again. There is consistent evidence, from the market operator down, that it is cheaper to build variable clean energy with “firming” support than alternatives. New performance standards requiring investors in areas flooded with renewable energy to install expensive grid-stabilising technology needed to smooth the transition are not expected to change this. But demand for electricity is barely growing. Without a policy that gives the industry a map for when new clean generation will be needed, new plants are unlikely to come online until coal plant owners announce more closures. There are exceptions. Tristan Edis, a Green Energy Markets analyst, points to companies signing contracts with state governments: Victoria recently announced six wind and solar farms had won contracts under its first renewable energy tender after a similar round for battery storage, and Queensland has promised to soon follow with the result of its auction. Also, some large energy users with deep pockets may build or fund their own generation needs to hedge against market costs, as Sun Metals did in Queensland. But these are investment spikes, not maps. “Beyond that there is no appetite for the major energy retailers to do deals, so I expect we’re not going to see the large-scale investments,” Edis says. “Instead of seeing thousands of megawatts of new capacity a year we may see a few hundred.” Other energy system experts agree. Holmes à Court, from the Energy Transition Hub at the University of Melbourne, says it is little understood that consumers are no longer subsidising new developments under the renewable energy target through their bills. Long-term pricing contracts being signed between wind and solar farm owners and energy retailers are now setting such low prices that large-scale generation certificates – documents that retailers must buy and hand in to the government as proof they are meeting their renewable obligation – are effectively being thrown in for free. The target’s role recently has been to provide investment confidence to ensure that long-term contracts are signed. Holmes à Court says without it or a new policy to replace it uncertainty associated with selling electricity on the spot market could increase the risk margin on finance or make a project “unbankable” until the next coal plant closes and pushes up the wholesale electricity price. AGL has announced it will shut and replace its Liddell black coal plant in NSW in 2022 (and copped no shortage of opprobrium from the Coalition for doing so). Yallourn, a brown coal station in Victoria, could be squeezed out by the large-scale solar rush already announced in that state. But in terms of closures that will spark new investment the timeframe is unclear, especially given the government hopes to extend the life of existing coal plants and possibly underwrite new ones. This is why interested parties from across the spectrum – the energy industry, business, consumer and welfare groups and climate activists – have been united in calling for a bipartisan policy. While Taylor has dismissed claims the government should try to eliminate uncertainty as naïve, and the gap between the major parties has widened to a gulf since Scott Morrison replaced Malcolm Turnbull, those invested in the debate want the best chance for the transition to happen as smoothly and cheaply as possible for everyone. “Basically, as Audrey Zibelman says, we can have a managed transition or a chaotic disruption,” Holmes à Court says. “In a chaotic disruption people get hurt, whether they are consumers, employers or prime ministers.”"
"Let’s start with a letter. Not, on this occasion, from Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells, but from Helpful of Clacton-on-Sea. Jo Steranka wrote in to suggest seven specific ways that people can help in the struggle against climate change, environmental degradation and global warming. Of course, individual actions are hugely important. But so is the work being done by scientists, social entrepreneurs, innovators and activists. And this week we had a little something from each. In the Amazon, as deforestation continues apace and the frontrunner in Brazil’s presidential race eyes another swathe of destruction, we found scientists embarking on the long job of putting trees in the ground rather than taking them out. It’s too early to say whether this is the start of something. But reforestation is catching on around the world: from New Zealand to China, from Europe to west Africa, people are planting hundreds of millions of trees. They’re planting trees in India, too (remarkably, to celebrate the birth of girls) – but not nearly enough to make a difference to smog season, which is about to start in earnest. The reason air quality gets so bad at this time of year is partly down to the burning of farmland, to get rid of crop residue once the harvest is in. A number of enterprises have spotted a business opportunity in buying up the biomatter and turning it into useful stuff, as Rishika Pardikar found out. On the subject of making good use of the things that everyday folks leave behind, the Dyson awards published their shortlist of quixotic, sustainable inventions this week. Read all about them here. The best: a fork made out of potato peelings. Solar-powered cooking pots seem like a good idea, particularly when they can charge your phone. Thanks to BBC World Hacks for this one.

"Hundreds of millions of pounds must be spent on the UK’s draughty housing stock to meet the government’s climate change targets, with progress so far too slow to make the difference needed. Repairing existing homes to a high standard, with insulation and renewable energy technology, would cut consumer bills and bring health improvements, a new report shows.  Domestic housing accounts for about a fifth of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions, mostly from heating and hot water. But attempts to bring these down have largely failed, prompting renewed calls from experts for a national programme of home improvement that would make dwellings low-carbon for the next 30 years. New research by the Institution of Engineering and Technology and Nottingham Trent University has found that meeting government targets of 80% cuts in greenhouse gas emissions by mid-century would require sweeping policy change. “A national programme for a one-off deep retrofit [of all residential property] is needed,” said Marjan Sarshar, professor of sustainability and the built environment at Nottingham Trent University. “Costs will come down as we build up the supply chain capacity.” The report’s authors suggest starting with social housing, which makes up about 4.5m homes. By engaging a whole locality at a time, the costs can be brought down and retrofit schemes carried out more efficiently. It can cost about £17,000 to retrofit a standard house. The benefits go beyond emissions savings, also including lower energy bills, warmer homes and a much-decreased burden on the NHS, which currently spends about £1.4bn a year treating conditions that arise from poor housing. Costs for ongoing maintenance, amounting to £5.2bn a year for social housing alone, would also be drastically cut or eliminated by a one-off “deep retrofit” for most residential buildings. Social housing tenants spend £4.2bn a year on energy, a big chunk of most household budgets, which would also be much reduced if their homes were insulated and fitted with renewables such as solar panels. Insulation for roofs and walls, new windows and doors, small-scale renewable energy such as solar panels or district heating systems, are the basic techniques. But instead of deploying them piecemeal, as in the past, the government should start a system of “deep retrofits”, by which each dwelling would receive a one-off refurbishment covering all the needed improvements and make the homes fit for the next 30 years at least, the report found. The technology, materials and skills needed for these deep retrofits are all available and well understood, but the UK’s failure to put them into practice has prevented the development of a large industry carrying out such work. Successive government attempts to solve the problem have run into problems and been abandoned. The Green Deal, for instance, which supplied loans and grants to people to have insulation installed, was scrapped after only a few years and has not been replaced. Public perception of the value of insulation took a blow when the Grenfell fire, in which 72 people died, exposed the risks from flammable cladding on tower blocks. However, high-quality cladding and other retrofit technologies should be a priority, and a public information campaign to engage householders could allay people’s concerns, the experts said. “We need to reassure people that there are safe solutions,” said Richard Miller, director of Miller-Klein Associates and a lead author of the report. “There is a job to be done.” Retrofitting a typical house can take several weeks, but the residents can remain living there throughout. Many people are reluctant to take on the inconvenience and cost of such building work but the government could offer incentives and subsidies, which along with the savings on energy bills could make the proposition more attractive. The report’s authors also called for cities to get involved by setting up programmes to retrofit properties street by street. The barriers to retrofitting at present were found to be a lack of customer demand, because the energy savings were not enough to tempt people to do the work; lack of government policy; high costs because of the lack of demand; and the difficulty for households of gaining the initial finance needed to embark on the work. Houses built now, even if they are constructed to a high standard, will make up only a fifth of the housing stock by 2050, the experts found, so retrofitting existing buildings must be the priority."
"Sea water encroaching on the Everglades will hamper decades of work by a government program to reverse manmade damage to the vast, fragile ecosystem at the tip of Florida, according to a new report published on Wednesday. The federal, multibillion-dollar Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan, authorized by Congress in 2000, was designed to redirect fresh water, reducing sea water incursion in a long-term effort to bring the tropical wetland ecosystem back to the way it looked in the early 20th century, before influxes of people to southern Florida drained much of it for development. The region, known as the “river of grass”, is less than an hour’s drive from Miami but is home to mangrove forests and cypress swamps housing alligators, orchids, storks and ibises, as well as threatened species such as the Florida panther. But it has long struggled to recover from water diversions for agriculture, swelling communities and other forms of environmental degradation, such as fertilizer runoff.  Now a new report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine warns that rising global temperatures are also changing the Everglades in ways the state and federal government must consider, including changing rainfall patterns and accelerating sea-level rise. “It is clear that the Greater Everglades of 2050 and beyond will be much different from what was envisioned at the time of the [plan],” the biennial report says. The committee of independent scientists charged with advising the government says it’s time to re-evaluate the program, to consider what climate change will mean for the “interrelated challenges of restoring the natural system, providing flood protection, and meeting the water demands of a growing population”. The committee chair, Bill Boggess, said current project plans did not adequately consider a range of possible sea levels. Sea levels were 3in above the 1993 average last year and will continue to go up, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “Analyzing that what’s being built and being designed is robust to those conditions is really what we’re encouraging,” Boggess said.  Randall Parkinson, a coastal geologist focused on climate change adaptation at Florida International University, said the recommendations were likely to change how experts in south Florida are thinking about and proposing restoration projects. The assessment will go to the US Army Corps of Engineers and Interior Department and the South Florida Water Management District. “Somehow, someone has to decide how much water will it take to get them back to being able to keep pace with sea-level and how do we monitor that to know how to change that over time, as may be necessary,” Parkinson said. “It would have been a huge challenge just to restore [the Everglades] if the climate and everything was in a steady state, but it’s not: it’s a moving target and it’s moving in the direction that increases the challenge.”"
"As many as 28,000 jobs will be lost in the north of England in the next 12 years under the government’s drive towards a low-carbon economy, a thinktank has warned. The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) said in its report that the region could be at the heart of a “clean energy revolution” – with a potential for 46,000 new green jobs – but instead faced economic decline under current plans.  Luke Murphy, an associate director at IPPR and co-author of the report, said: “With nearly half of the UK’s renewable energy being produced in the north, it is clear that the region is ideally placed to deliver a green jobs revolution of 46,000 new jobs by 2030.” Murphy described the move towards a low-carbon economy as an “urgent necessity” to limit the impact of global warning. He urged ministers to commit to a more ambitious decarbonisation policy “where communities are protected from decline” which he said must be at the heart of its industrial strategy. The north of England produced 48% of the UK’s renewable electricity between 2005 and 2014, the report said, yet the region is also home to the largest number of coal and gas power stations in England. The report, published on Monday, calls on the government to “learn from the mistakes of the past” and avoid a repeat of the catastrophic economic decline that followed the closure of coal, steel and shipbuilding industries across the north since the early 1980s. Yet, the thinktank said, proposals to limit the damaging effect on communities and help workers retrain were not mentioned in the government’s industrial or clean growth strategies. The report concluded: “If the government continues to ignore these workers, there is a real risk that the transition to a low-carbon economy will result in jobs losses or the forced acceptance of low-quality jobs, an increase in people on welfare benefits and an increase in local deprivation.” Josh Emden, a research fellow at IPPR and co-author of the report, said: “The government must learn from the mistakes of the past and ensure that this time there is a just transition into the low-carbon energy sector and beyond, for workers in the north of England who have powered the UK for decades. “The good news is that the opportunity is there for the north of England to become a powerhouse for the UK once again, provided the government takes the critical policy action needed.” The government is reviewing its target to cut greenhouse gases by 80% by 2050 in the wake of a landmark report by the UN intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) earlier this month. Leading climate change experts warned there was only 12 years for global warming to be kept to a maximum of 1.5C, beyond which even half a degree will significantly worsen the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people. A government spokesperson said: “The move to a cleaner, greener economy is one of the greatest opportunities for our country.  With the potential to create 2 million new jobs by 2030, clean growth is a key focus of our modern industrial strategy. “Last week, we celebrated our first Green GB Week, showcasing the benefits clean growth will bring to all parts of society – from new businesses and jobs to leaving our environment in a better state than we inherited it.”"
"Since we launched this series six months ago, we’ve been inundated with questions from readers about what can be done to address ever-increasing population growth around the globe. The world’s population is on track to hit 8bn in 2023, and almost 10bn by 2050 – all of which means an increasing strain on resources, and more destruction of our natural environment.  The urgency was emphasised this week when a landmark UN report indicated that we have little more than a decade to take decisive action to confront global warming. As ever, there are crumbs of comfort. In climate news, a Berlin startup has offered €1m (£870,000) to save the ancient Hambach forest from coal mining – and they are not the only tree huggers we have met this week. In southern Africa, Nicola Davis reported on how effective family planning services and contraceptive education has caused a country with one of the highest fertility rates in the world to decisively reverse the trend. Of course, not everywhere is overpopulated. Some states still feel they need all the people they can get. In Guinea-Bissau, Ruth Maclean found there is no panic about population growth – in fact, there is room for more people to be welcomed. About 7,000 refugees are due to become newly minted citizens. For those refugees still stranded in European camps, such as on Lesbos, the upside can seem pretty much non-existent. But Lorenzo Tondo has found a heartwarming story in the shape of an Iraqi-Danish man, Salam Aldeen, who has built a playground for 3,000 children stranded there.

"Known for their distinctive long horns, the Ankole cattle of western Uganda have evolved over millennia to withstand their harsh environment, with its lengthy dry spells and abundance of local maladies such as trypanosomiasis, a disease spread by the tsetse fly. But after flourishing for almost 10,000 years, the Ankole have begun to rapidly disappear. Farmland is dwindling in Uganda due to the expanding human population, and Ankole require vast areas to graze. Local herders have responded to the pressure by replacing them, cross-breeding Ankole cattle with industrial species such as the European Holstein. But while these hybrids gain favourable genetic traits from the Holstein, producing more milk and meat, and requiring less land to keep, there is a hidden cost.  The genetic adaptations which enabled the Ankole to survive in such a harsh climate are diluted in the new hybrids, which lack the immune capabilities to resist local diseases. Instead of reaping profits, the herders now spend much of their money on antibiotics and pesticides to keep the animals healthy. In Burkina Faso, farmers who made similar decisions in recent years have lost almost all of their livestock to disease. But this problem isn’t restricted to impoverished African nations. Across the UK and much of the rest of the world, the cattle farming industry is facing increasing challenges due to environmental pressures as well as the consequences of genetic selection programmes aimed at increasing income. Research has shown that between 2000 and 2014, nearly 100 native livestock breeds worldwide became extinct, as farmers attempted to boost falling profit margins by either cross-breeding or replacing them altogether with a small handful of industrial breeds. “If we don’t do anything to change this, it could spell long-term disaster for the farming industry particularly in the context of climate change,” says Catarina Ginja, a researcher in biodiversity and genetic resources at the University of Porto’s Cibio-InBio laboratory. “The industrial breeds may not be capable of resisting new disease epidemics, which could arise as the climate warms over the next century. “We already had some alarming examples of how vulnerable these breeds can be to a deadly pandemic in the recent past, for example the mad cow disease outbreak in the 1990s, although that was unrelated to climate change. It’s a serious concern.” The reason why industrial breeds are particularly vulnerable to new bacterial or viral infections is because they have very little genetic diversity compared with local breeds, due to decades of inbreeding. Ginja estimates that for breeds like the Holstein, millions of these cows originate from a mere handful of bulls. Over the past 15 years, this has been exacerbated by the advent of genomic sequencing. Breeders can now specifically select cattle with combinations of genes that are known to optimise milk and meat production, and because these are the only animals in the herd that are allowed to mate, over time the entire population becomes descended from a few individuals. This year scientists from the Netherlands published a study showing that genetic diversity in Dutch cattle populations has dropped alarmingly over the past three decades due to such breeding programmes. But because breeders are solely prioritising genes which improve milk and meat yields, any unusual genes which may have offered immune protection against infections become lost. In addition, inherited disorders caused by a single mutation are far more common, as all the animals are effectively related. A common problem for Holstein cattle breeders is Bovine leukocyte adhesion deficiency (Blad) which can spread from one individual bull. Cattle with Blad are prone to recurrent infections and heal very slowly. “Breeders want to produce more and more, and they now know what genetic traits to favour in the population, in order to increase meat or milk production,” says Stéphane Joost, a researcher at École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne, who chaired a recent European research project on the future of farm animal genetic resources. “But it’s like capitalism in general. They become too extreme. The key is recognising there are limits which are not to be passed.” Breeders are aware of these potential problems, but they try to compensate for it in different ways, rather than changing their overall strategy. “They try to negate any health problems that emerge by giving specific vitamins and drugs to the animals,” Joost says. “And if it’s too expensive to cure them from a particular disease, they let them die. They also buy frozen semen from different banks across Europe, which contains the original genetic material of the species, and inject that into females in the herd at regular intervals to try to maintain the genetic diversity at a certain level.” However, buying semen and drugs is expensive. This means that keeping cattle farming economically viable is a very fine balance. As an example, one study last year showed that while the volume of milk produced by European dairy farms had increased in recent years, profit margins had fallen as production costs - ranging from labour resources to cattle feed – were rising far faster than milk prices. The study showed that in 2013, dairy farms in Slovakia were actually losing €165 per tonne of milk produced. As a result of this, any unforeseen events can cause major problems. Joost points out that this year’s abnormally hot European summer has caused considerable problems for cattle farmers across the continent. They have been forced to spend heavily on air conditioning units to regulate the temperature and humidity for their herds. “Because they’re not very adaptable, they can’t handle consistently high temperatures,” he says. “Unless their environment is artificially cooled, their stress levels rise, they start to weaken, their metabolism slows down, the combinations of different hormones begin to change, and they become less productive. But the artificial cooling also costs a lot.” As the effects of human-induced climate change take hold over the next century and temperatures rise, some scientists fear that the cattle farming industry could be heading for disaster, unless steps are taken to improve the genetic diversity of these animals. “Most of the world will face increasing aridification, and droughts,” says Professor Mike Bruford, a molecular ecologist at Cardiff University who co-ordinates the ClimGen project, an initiative looking into ways to increase the resilience of livestock to climate change. “The current industrial breeding programmes may not be sustainable as temperatures and the amount of forage available change.” But at the same time, going back to solely using local breeds simply isn’t a sustainable option for many farming businesses. The economic returns are not viable, and the carbon footprint from rearing them is extremely high due to the large amounts of land they need. An advantage of breeds like the Holstein is that they require relatively little space. “The carbon budget of cattle production is already enormous,” Bruford says. “This is because of the amount of land being occupied for forage rather than absorbing carbon, as well as the infrastructure needed to produce beef and milk. From a carbon perspective, the most environmentally friendly way to farm cattle is intensively with industrial breeds.” However, scientists believe that the same genomic sequencing tools which have accelerated the inbreeding crisis in industrial cattle, could actually solve some of the problems that farmers are likely to face on a warming planet. These tools are increasingly able to be used to identify other important traits, for example combinations of genes relating to heat tolerance and the immune system. This could help industrial breeds deal more rapidly with environmental change, as well as produce sufficient milk and meat. “These traits can be conserved and prioritised in these animals in parallel with the genetic traits relating to milk and meat production,” Joost says. However, Bruford points out that implementing these strategies will take careful planning and may need to be regulated by national authorities to ensure that the cattle farming industry survives in the long-term. “Farming is a private enterprise, people are there to make money as well as provide food so this kind of genetic selection in cattle breeding needs to be very carefully co-ordinated going forwards,” Bruford says. “Farmers need guidance from the government. For too long, we’ve let them get on with it and haven’t provided adequate support. If you don’t have a strategy, then you’re left with cattle that are productive but aren’t well adapted to their landscape, and that’s when problems arise.”"
"We, the undersigned, support the call for the UK and other OECD governments to negotiate a fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty to complement the Paris agreement on climate change, as proposed in your article “We need a fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty – and we need it now” (theguardian.com, 23 October). The latest report from the IPCC shows we cannot afford to burn the vast majority of remaining reserves of fossil fuels if we are to keep warming below 1.5 or even 2 degrees. A new line in the sand is needed. We support an agreement with a moratorium on any further expansion of the fossil fuel industry in rich countries, together with a fund to support renewable energy development in poorer countries to reduce the need for fossil fuels, paid for by redirecting the staggering $10m per minute that governments currently spend on fossil fuel subsidies. The best way to mark the 50th anniversary of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty would be to begin negotiation of its fossil fuel equivalent.Bill McKibben Founder, 350.org Naomi Klein Writer and activist Caroline Lucas MP Green party John Sauven Executive director, Greenpeace Craig Bennett CEO, Friends of the Earth Ann Pettifor Prime Economics Leo Murray 10:10 • The letter (27 October) from eminent academics and others is right in asking for “a credible plan for rapid total decarbonisation of the economy”. It is also right to demand that the government “tell the hard truth to its citizens”. This hard truth should not only apply to the effects of climate change but to the necessary measures to mitigate it. An example measure would involve a great deal of rationing akin to that in wartime. For instance; petrol and diesel cars could be restricted to use only every other day, natural gas for central heating could be rationed to that required to heat an average house to 20 degrees, or even less. Even electric cars could be affected, it may be impossible to recharge batteries when there is a windless night. The green lobby spells out the hard truth on the effects of climate change but fails to spell out the harsh measures necessary to mitigate it.John Huggins (Independent consultant; formerly director of gas transportation for British Gas), London • Count me in for the extinction rebellion. I fully support the aim of “rapid total decarbonisation”, and the need for credible plans. They will succeed when there are millions of accompanying individual decarbonisation plans being implemented by each and every one of us. And we can start now.

"New York is suing the oil giant ExxonMobil in a lawsuit that claims the company engaged in a “longstanding fraudulent scheme” to downplay the risks posed to its business by climate change regulations. The legal action, launched by New York state attorney general Barbara Underwood, alleges that ExxonMobil deceived its investors by hiding the true extent of its financial exposure to laws aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions.  Exxon provided “false and misleading assurances” to shareholders that it had factored in climate regulations and that its vast reserves of oil and gas weren’t at major risk of being left as stranded assets, New York’s lawsuit claims. Senior executives, including former chief executive Rex Tillerson, who was briefly US secretary of state in the Trump administration before being abruptly fired earlier this year, took part in this facade, the lawsuit states. The suit, lodged in the New York supreme court, comes after three years of investigation into Exxon by attorneys general in New York and Massachusetts. Exxon has previously attempted to block an investigation into its practices, claiming its first amendment rights were being violated. Underwood said: “Investors put their money and their trust in Exxon – which assured them of the long-term value of their shares, as the company claimed to be factoring the risk of increasing climate change regulation into its business decisions. Yet as our investigation found, Exxon often did no such thing. “Instead, Exxon built a facade to deceive investors into believing that the company was managing the risks of climate change regulation to its business when, in fact, it was intentionally and systematically underestimating or ignoring them, contrary to its public representations.” New York’s lawsuit paints a picture of corporate malfeasance whereby Exxon told investors it was applying a “proxy cost” to its extraction of fossil fuels to account for the risk of governmental action to address climate change. In practice, the lawsuit alleges, Exxon applied much lower proxy costs than it initially stated, essentially assuming that existing climate regulations would remain in place, unchanged. This led to inaccurate information about investments in major projects, such as Exxon’s oil sands operations in Alberta, Canada, the lawsuit states. Canada has recently outlined a national plan to put a price on carbon dioxide pollution in a bid to reduce emissions. Exxon’s role in covering up the impact of climate change has come to light in the recent years, with the company aware for decades about the consequences of burning fossil fuels only to downplay this in public. The company now says it accepts climate change is real and a threat, even pledging $1m toward a campaign to put a price on carbon. This support comes with the caveat that mounting lawsuits aimed at making Exxon pay for damage wrought by climate change are dismissed. In July, a federal judge kicked out a lawsuit lodged by New York City that took aim at the five major oil producers, including Exxon. The New York state lawsuit does not concern the impact of climate change, but rather Exxon’s role in communicating the risk of climate regulation to investors. “Big oil may finally face some consequences for its role in wrecking the climate,” said Bill McKibben, co-founder of climate campaign group 350.org. “The New York attorney general is standing up for investors who may have been swindled, and indirectly for the seven billion of us who will suffer from Exxon’s lies.” Exxon was contacted for comment. Attorneys general in California and Illinois, asked if they would join the New York suit, said they planned to take a “close look” at the securities fraud law the state is suing under. The case, “has been a topic of mutual conversation among various state AGs, and we are all going to take a close look at the filing,” California attorney general Xavier Becerra said. California would need to consider how its own laws apply, Becerra said. In Illinois, the power to join this type of case lies with the secretary of state, attorney general Lisa Madigan explained. She said: “The overall message here is that Exxon and others that were really at the forefront of causing climate change conditions in our country and around the world long knew that this was taking place and withheld that information to the detriment of not just their investors but ultimately all of us around the country.”"

"Floridians are staring down a very powerful Category 4 typhoon that is causing extensive damage. The high winds, heavy rains, and storm surge will cost billions of dollars. We know that climate change is making these storms stronger. The storms feed off of warm ocean waters, and those waters are much warmer now because of climate change. I have written about the science in more detail here and here. But basically, Michael strengthened because it passed over really warm waters. Waters that were hotter because of human-caused warming.  Predictably, the hurricane strengthened as it hit shore. As I write this, Michael is coming ashore and the pressure is still falling (low pressures in a hurricane signify a stronger storm). It appears that Michael may have the third-lowest pressure for a hurricane hitting the USA. It is a wonder that a state like Florida, which will get pummeled by Michael, could vote for someone that denies climate change. Think of how backwards the situation is – the Florida Department of Environmental Protection has reportedly been banned from using the terms “climate change” and “global warming”. This policy reportedly went into effect when Florida elected a science denier, Rick Scott, to governor. Rick Scott has been condemned by people in Florida for his backward stance. It is climate denial like his that has contributed to the suffering of residents in the state. It’s not that my colleagues haven’t tried to help Governor Scott understand how his policies hurt his state. A few years ago, scientists met with him and urged him to take climate change seriously. He remained silent. It isn’t that the local media hasn’t tried. Major newspapers have called upon Rick Scott to take action on climate change. But to little avail. Maybe it’s because Rick Scott invests in companies that oppose climate change regulations? It isn’t that his political opponents haven’t tried. Recently, Florida Democrats petitioned Rick Scott to acknowledge climate change. Fortunately, while Rick Scott is now running for Senate, he’s being challenged by Democrat Bill Nelson. He understands science and believes in facts. Nelson writes, Climate change is real, and we must take action to protect ourselves. Denial of this scientific reality is simply not an option, especially in Florida. Rick Scott isn’t the only politician from the state of Florida to reject science and diminish climate change. Senator Marco Rubio has as well. Florida voters could put an end to this nonsense. In the current race for state Governor to succeed Scott, Republican candidate Ron DeSantis is ignoring science. He recently claimed that climate change is not an issue for states to mitigate. Say what? Let’s hope Ron DeSantis loses. His opponent is Andrew Gillum, who is clear as day when he says, Climate change is real, it is impacting Floridians directly, and we will not be silenced on the matter. When I’m Governor, we will not just talk about climate change -- we will put Floridians to work to make our state more energy independent and resilient and transform our state into the Solar Capital of the United States! But it’s not just Florida; there are other states getting hit by Hurricane Michael that are also led by climate deniers. For instance, Georgia will be hit by Hurricane Michael. One of the senators there, David Perdue, congratulated President Trump when he pulled out of the Paris Climate Accord. Georgia’s other Senator, Johnny Isakson also denies the science. He too supported President Trump’s reckless actions. At the congressional district level, the denial continues. Republican Representative Barry Loudermilk was pleased when President Trump walked away from the Paris Agreement. His opponent, Flynn Broady trusts and understands science, however. His position could not be any clearer as he writes, We have the technology and knowledge to develop and place into practice renewable energy sources, reduce carbon emissions, and move our energy needs away from carbon fuels. We owe it to the world to participate in the Paris Agreement and the Kyoto Protocol. As the leading industrial nation we must lead the effort. Climate deniers will try to say this article is gleeful about a hurricane. It is not. First of all, this hurricane and all hurricanes that hit land can cause death and destruction. I pray that people heed warnings and get out of the way. I hope people stay safe, regardless of their understanding of climate change and its effect on storms. Second, elections have consequences and if we as a society want to create a better world and reduce climate change, we have to vote for people who understand science, who believe in facts. Climate deniers are making these storms worse by stopping action on climate change. What the hell do we expect to happen when the deniers are writing the laws? Third, for those who say “taking action on climate is too expensive”, how about you add up the worldwide costs of climate inaction over the past decade. My response to you is, it’s too costly to do nothing. Fourth, what the hell happened to the Republican Party? The GOP formerly thought of itself as the party of intellectuals. How did you become a party where denying science is a litmus test? Where are the Republicans who actually understand climate change and care about it? If you can find one, tell me. Maybe I’ll even write about them on this site. Finally, climate change is only starting. It will continue to get worse and worse. And that means storms will get worse, droughts will get deeper, flooding more severe, and the costs will go up. What we are seeing now and what we’ve seen over the past decade is just a small taste to come of what the future will bring if we don’t take this problem seriously. Good luck Florida and Georgia. My thoughts are with you. See you on the other side."
"The energy minister, Angus Taylor, has signalled the Australian government could indemnify new power generation projects against the future risk of a carbon price, and says it could also support the retrofitting of existing coal plants. In an interview with Guardian Australia, the man dubbed the “minister for getting power prices down” by the prime minister, Scott Morrison, has also committed to keeping current subsidies for households and businesses to install renewable energy technology like solar panels until 2030, and insists Australia’s electricity sector will reduce emissions by 26% on 2005 levels in “the early 2020s”.  Taylor on Tuesday outlined a range of measures the government wants to implement to help lower power prices, including cajoling retailers into offering customers out-of-cycle price cuts so consumers could experience hip-pocket relief by January, ahead of the next election. He also foreshadowed policy interventions to boost investment in new “reliable” power generation, including providing a floor price, contracts for difference, cap and floor contracts and government loans. Morrison held out the prospect of government support for new coal-fired power stations “where they meet all the requirements” of the yet-to-be finalised mechanisms to boost investment in new electricity generation. One of the key problems preventing private investment in new coal-fired power generation is proponents have struggled to get finance because they are unable to predict future carbon risk, particularly given Australia’s decade-long partisan standoff over emissions reduction policies. Taylor told Guardian Australia the government would look to remove the risks stopping investment in new power generation. “I’m saying we will look at whatever risks that can’t be managed by the companies that need to be managed to get investment. “What we are saying is the risks that government needs to absorb to get investment in reliable generation, we will look at absorbing. We need the investment.” Asked whether he acknowledged that would expose taxpayers to risk, Taylor said: “We’ll look at the risks and we’ll seek to minimise the risks to the commonwealth.” The concept of the government underwriting new investments in power generation in order to boost competition in the market was originally recommended by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission but with tightly defined criteria. The government is pursuing the ACCC’s general principle, but writing its own rules. The ACCC was focused on encouraging new market participants, but the energy minister said the government could back the retrofitting of existing power plants to extend their operating life. Asked how retrofitting an existing plant was bringing new generation into the market, he said: “It’s new generation if it would otherwise be gone, that’s the point. “What we want is additional investment, new investment, that would mean we get capacity we wouldn’t otherwise have.” Business is extremely wary of the government’s plans to impose price regulation in the energy sector, and about oft-repeated public threats by the government to wield a “big stick” – introducing divestiture powers to break up power companies engaging in price-gouging. The chief executive of the Business Council of Australia, Jennifer Westacott, warned on Tuesday that “ad hoc intervention in the energy market, such as underwriting generation investment or forced divestment, is sending a signal to the world that investing in Australia comes with considerable risks”. “In the long term this will only result in less investment in energy generation, less reliable energy and ultimately higher prices,” the BCA chief said. Taylor told Guardian Australia he was confident the government had the power to legislate to force divestiture, and a toughening of regulatory options was required because of poor market conduct. Asked whether he expected legal challenges from power companies in the event the government ever used the divestiture power, he said: “I can’t predict what people are going to do.” Asked what trigger the government planned to use to break up badly behaving power companies, Taylor said it was a lack of competition and deliberate withdrawal of supply. “The issue is, have we got enough capacity and supply in the market to meet customers’ needs and are companies in the sector thwarting that, are they deliberately taking anti-competitive action to withdraw supply from the market to drive up prices?” Stakeholders in the energy market are also enormously frustrated with the Coalition’s chopping and changing on energy policy, which culminated in the ditching of the national energy guarantee’s 26% emissions reduction target. Taylor insists the electricity sector will hit 26% well before 2030. Asked why the government ditched a target it was going to easily exceed, the minister said: “Labor want a higher target. We are not going to facilitate that in any shape or form. “We are not going to load the gun for Labor to have a much higher target.” Energy ministers will meet this Friday for the first time since the Morrison government grounded part of the Neg. Taylor wants to sound out his counterparts on whether they will agree to roll out new price regulations in the electricity market, or whether Canberra will force the change by overriding them. The Victorian energy minister, Lily D’Ambrosio, has warned she has no intention of agreeing to anything on Friday, given the state is days away from entering caretaker mode ahead of the state election. COAG energy council is becoming Groundhog Day - here we are three federal energy ministers later, and the Liberals still don’t have a national policy to reduce emissions. (1/2) Taylor also wants them to agree to preserving the reliability obligation of the Neg – a requirement on energy retailers to supply sufficient quantities of dispatchable power to the market, with a final decision on that required by December."
"Bahrain – one of the world’s most oil-rich nations – has applied to the international Green Climate Fund for $9.8m for its National Oil and Gas Authority, raising questions over whether taxpayer-funded assistance for poor countries is reaching its intended targets. The kingdom has requested funding for water conservation work to be carried out by its national oil and gas company, which it says is necessary to protect against water scarcity in future – a problem that is likely to grow worse around the world as a consequence of climate change.  The UN’s Green Climate Fund (GCF) channels taxpayer funds from rich countries, including the US, the UK, further EU member states and others, to developing countries that would otherwise struggle to invest in low-emissions technology and infrastructure to adapt to a warming world. About $10bn has so far been pledged, including $1bn from the UK. However, Bahrain’s proposal has come in for heavy criticism, and experts are concerned that it will encourage other oil-rich nations to come forward with proposals that will benefit their fossil fuel industries under the guise of adapting to the impacts of climate change. They are worried that there are too few safeguards to GCF funding. Lutz Weischer, team leader for international climate policy at Germanwatch, an environmental NGO, said: “The GCF was given the mandate to promote a paradigm shift to low-carbon and climate resilient development pathways [which mean] transitioning away from coal, oil and gas. A project that would make a country’s water supply dependent on continued oil and gas production is clearly not in line with the mandate.” Channelling money from the GCF to a fossil fuel company would be “perverse”, added Mohamed Adow, international climate lead at the charity Christian Aid. “Surely the oil companies should be cleaning up their own polluted water?” An independent technical assessment found several flaws, and even suggested that fixing leaking pipes could be a more efficient way of making Bahrain’s water supply more resilient. The GCF board, which is to consider a raft of proposals from various countries, will be asked to approve the application as soon as Thursday morning. Whether it does so will be a key test of the fitness of the fund and its governance, according to observers. Adow said: “This funding would not only undermine trust in the GCF, it would also set a bad precedent for other proposals involving fossil fuel companies looking to leech off the fund’s resources.” Wael Hamidan, executive director of Climate Action Network International, said: “The notion of leveraging public money targeted at climate action to support fossil fuel companies is absurd and misguided at best. The only justifiable reason for assisting fossil fuel companies should be to transition fully into 100% renewables as a matter of urgency – and even that could be funded through these companies’ enormous profits.” A GCF spokesman told the Guardian: “This is one of 20 project proposals to be considered by the GCF board this week. The project will not finance any fossil fuel operations, but targets water shortage resulting from climate change. No project funds will be used for profit generating activities, and only lower income households and public buildings (mosques, schools) will be provided with water saving devices and greywater recycling systems. The proposal is brought to us by UN Environment, one of our project partners (Accredited Entities). It has been recommended for approval by our Technical Advisory Panel, subject to certain conditions.” The GCF said its mandate was to support developing countries in their transition to low emission and climate resilient pathways in support of the Paris agreement. “Project proposals have to be approved by the GCF board, which makes decisions by consensus between its 24 members, equally representing developed and developing countries. All project proposals coming to the board are subject to assessment from our independent technical advisory panel,” said the spokesman. A spokesman for Bahrain’s environment council said: “Bahrain’s application to the Green Climate Fund is about addressing the severe threat posed by global climate change to the kingdom’s freshwater supply. The impact of rising temperatures and increasing saline intrusion is expected to reduce Bahrain’s freshwater resources by between 50 to 100 million cubic metres of water per year in the short-term, well above the global average and posing a unique risk to the kingdom’s water security. “As a committed signatory to the Paris agreement, the kingdom has already taken significant steps to counteract the impact of climate change, including the development of a new national water strategy. We now seek assistance from the GCF to help support these critical interventions.” The criticism is a fresh headache for the embattled GCF, which has struggled with management dramas, including the resignation of its executive director and the collapse of a crucial board meeting over the summer. Rich and poor countries on the board are divided over framing new processes to raise funds, and donors have expressed private frustration at the slowness of its processes. Previous funding rounds have also attracted criticism, including a controversy over the proposed funding of megadams. The GCF was set up under the UN climate negotiations to provide a channel through which rich country governments can fulfil their obligations, agreed in Copenhagen in 2009 and subsequently under the Paris agreement of 2015, to provide finance to developing nations. The taxpayer funds, including nearly $5bn from EU member states, are supposed to help poor countries cut greenhouse gas emissions and cope with the impacts of climate change. The US pledged $3bn to the GCF and delivered $1bn under Barack Obama’s presidency, but Donald Trump is seen as unlikely to fulfil the remainder of the commitment. He has begun the process of withdrawing the US from the Paris agreement. The Bahrain case throws light on the murky world of climate finance, by which private investors and governments mobilise funds for projects and technologies to cut greenhouse gas emissions and develop the resilient infrastructure needed to cope with a warming climate. According to pledges made at Copenhagen in 2009 and renewed in Paris, at least $100bn is supposed to flow from rich to poor nations a year by 2020, in order to help the poor to cut emissions and cope with the impacts of climate change. Most of this is likely to come from the private sector rather than taxpayer funds, but the sources and recipients of all such funding in the private sector are difficult to account for. The GCF was supposed to help the governments of developed countries by providing a set of rules and bureaucracy which could administer funding efficiently to recipients in line with the donor country aims. However, its problems leave major questions over the future of publicly funded climate finance hanging. • This article was updated on 18 October 2018 to clarify the nature of Bahrain’s funding request"
"The late Prof Mick Moran, who taught politics and government at Manchester University for most of his professional life, had, according to his colleagues, once had “a certain residual respect for our governing elites”. That all changed during the 2008 financial crisis, after which he experienced an epiphany “because it convinced him that the officer class in business and in politics did not know what it was doing”. After his epiphany, Moran formed a collective of academics dedicated to exposing the complacency of finance-worship and to replacing it with an idea of running modern economies focused on maximising social good. They called themselves the Foundational Economy Collective, based on the idea that it’s in the everyday economy where there is most potential for true social regeneration: not top-down cash-splashing, but renewal and replenishment from the ground upwards.  Foundational activities are the materials and services without which we cannot live a civilised life: clean, unrationed water; affordable electricity and gas without cuts to supply; collective transport on smooth roads and rails; quality health and social care provided free at the point of use; and reliable, sustainable food supply. Then there’s the “overlooked economy” – everyday services such as hairdressing, veterinary care, catering and hospitality and small-scale manufacturing – which employ far more people, across a wider geographical range, than the “high-skill, hi-tech” economy with which recent governments have been obsessed. For the Foundational Economy authors, focusing on the fundamental value of invisible and unglamorous jobs “restores the importance of unappreciated and unacknowledged tacit skills of many citizens”. It’s a way of looking at economics from the point of view of people rather than figures, and doing something revolutionary (yet so blindingly obvious) in the process. What is the point of “growth” if the basic elements of a decent life are denied to a large and growing number? Because everybody has these everyday needs, their provision is not – or ought not to be – specific to one or a few regions, and is comparatively resistant to automation. If applied by government as a central plank of industrial strategy, prioritising the foundational economy could fundamentally transform people’s quality of life outside London and the south-east – which would be the direct opposite of the dire “northern powerhouse” template that has only created even more cynicism. Visions of an economy run for social good, rather than individual gain, are being developed by Labour through a series of regional workshops on the “new economics”. As the examples of Preston, Enfield and Oldham councils have shown, it hurts nobody to bring services back into local authority control and to divest from the outsourcing firms whose own definition of “growth”’ is extracting profit from social misery. Any future government will have to take this vision seriously. Take Jeremy Corbyn’s promise of “a million climate jobs” at last month’s Labour conference, which could be a conservative estimate for the task at hand. In 2012, Oxfam reported that 4.7m jobs could be supported and £280bn added to the economy if the government invested in retro-fitting the entire existing housing stock for lower energy consumption. (It could also save a total £8.7bn a year from our domestic fuel bills.) Our homes are the most expensive to heat in Europe, and the oldest, with more than 60% built before 1960. A change in thinking is urgently required to bring about a permanent and ongoing renewal of the foundations of a good society. This brings to mind a long-buried yet prescient quote by Raymond Williams. In his 1960 novel Border Country, he describes a character witnessing “a slow and shocking cancellation of the future” in the wake of the 1926 general strike. This quote has been leapt upon in recent years by a reinvigorated and youthful left. It’s as though, nearly 60 years later, we’ve woken up to the idea that a better future can be reinstated, but that we have to get it back ourselves. Restoring decent basic services for everyone, then keeping the bar high for everyone, is a task akin to painting and repainting the Forth Bridge, and this alone is enough to keep millions of people in stable, valuable work. For a future better than the one we’re dreading, we need to start rebuilding the foundations now.  • Lynsey Hanley is a freelance writer and the author of Estates: an Intimate History and Respectable: Crossing the Class Divide"
"When queried about the most recent IPCC report, Republican lawmakers delivered a consistent, false message – that climate scientists are still debating whether humans are responsible. The previous IPCC report was quite clear on this, attributing 100% of the global warming since 1950 to human activities. As Nasa atmospheric scientist Kate Marvel recently put it, “We are more sure that greenhouse gas is causing climate change than we are that smoking causes cancer.” Donald Trump articulated the incorrect Republican position in an interview on 60 Minutes:  We have scientists that disagree with [human-caused global warming] … You’d have to show me the [mainstream] scientists because they have a very big political agenda To paraphrase, ‘I know scientists. I have the best scientists.’ And of course Trump thinks he has “a natural instinct for science” which, as astrophysicist Katie Mack noted, is not a thing: There is no ""natural instinct for science."" This is not a thing. There is curiosity, there is exploration, and there is the desire to learn & grow & test one's naive notions against cold hard data. Believing in a ""natural instinct for science"" is anathema to everything science is Numerous papers have shown that over 90% of climate science experts agree that humans are the main cause of global warming since 1950, and when considering peer-reviewed papers, the consensus exceeds 97%. And yet as surveys by Yale and George Mason universities have found, only about 15% of Americans are aware that the expert climate consensus exceeds 90%. More recently, the Yale and George Mason team broke down American’s perceived expert consensus by their ‘Six Americas’ categorizations: The Alarmed are fully convinced of the reality and seriousness of climate change and are already taking individual, consumer, and political action to address it. The Concerned are also convinced that global warming is happening and a serious problem, but have not yet engaged the issue personally. Three other Americas – the Cautious, the Disengaged, and the Doubtful – represent different stages of understanding and acceptance of the problem, and none are actively involved. The final America – the Dismissive are very sure it is not happening and are actively involved as opponents of a national effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. As would be expected, the Alarmed and Concerned have the highest perception of the expert consensus, with the Dismissive having the lowest, and the Disengaged not having much of a clue about the level of agreement. However, the important finding in the Yale and George Mason survey is that even Americans who are Alarmed and Concerned about climate change badly underestimate the level of expert agreement on its human cause. Some have argued that efforts to communicate the consensus won’t work – that Americans’ opinions on climate change simply break down by political ideology (realism on the left, denial on the right) and in our age of ‘alternative facts,’ new information doesn’t change peoples’ beliefs. However, numerous social science papers have found that the perceived consensus acts as a “gateway belief,” meaning that when people are aware of the high level of expert agreement on human-caused global warming, they’re more likely to accept that reality and support policies to address the problem. The Yale and George Mason data also support the notion that political polarization isn’t the only problem here. If it were, the Alarmed and Concerned would realize there’s a 97% expert consensus on human-caused global warming. Instead, they think it’s only 84% and 73%, respectively. That tells us the 97% consensus figure just hasn’t been effectively communicated to the public, and therefore consensus communication will make a difference. In fact, a 2017 study showed that communicating the 97% not only increases perceived consensus across the political spectrum, it makes a bigger difference in conservative perceptions and thus shrinks the partisan gap. And in a follow-up study, the scientists showed that consensus messaging also increased acceptance of human-caused global warming, even among conservatives. Expertise matters, and people rightly trust experts. But of course, that’s exactly why Donald Trump wants to confuse the public about the 97% expert climate consensus."
"Fifteen environmental protesters, who blocked the roads outside the Houses of Parliament in the first stage of an “escalating campaign of civil disobedience” have been arrested. More than 1,000 people from the newly formed Extinction Rebellion group issued a declaration of rebellion in London’s Parliament Square on Wednesday in an effort to draw attention to the unfolding climate emergency.  The group, that included families, pensioners and teenagers, then sat down in the road blocking traffic at one of London’s busiest intersections for more than two hours as speakers from different faiths, Green party politicians and journalists warned about the unravelling environmental crisis. Green MEP Molly Scott Cato told the crowd: “We are here because we have a deep love and spiritual connection to the planet. “We must rise up. When the law tells you to support something that your deep inner voice is fundamentally against, you should take non-violent direct action.” Other speakers included Guardian columnist George Monbiot and Green party MP Caroline Lucas. The protest came a day after a stark warning from scientists that humanity has wiped out 60% of mammals, birds, fish and reptiles since 1970 – a level of extinction that experts warn threatens the future of human civilisation. And earlier this month the UN warned that there are only 12 years left to prevent climate catastrophe. Wednesday’s protest was due to be a symbolic start to a campaign of civil disobedience that organisers say will bring large parts of London to a standstill next month. The group had expected a few hundred people to turn up but more than 1,000 arrived and after a show of hands it was decided to block the road outside parliament. Some of those involved locked themselves together, while others linked arms as the police moved in. Felix, 28, was one of those who had chained himself to a fellow protester. He said the disruption, which saw parts of central London come to a standstill, was justified. “The disruption we are causing today is nothing to the destruction that our governments are unleashing by not taking serious steps to stop the ecological crisis. I have never been to prison before but I feel I have to try and do something.” The group is planning a campaign of mass civil disobedience starting next month and promises it has hundreds of people who are prepared to get arrested in an effort to draw attention to the unfolding climate emergency. It will culminate with a sit-in protest in Parliament Square on 17 November and a series of planned occupations of London bridges. The “rebellion” has been backed by almost 100 senior academics from across the UK, including Rowan Williams, the former archbishop of Canterbury. In a letter published in the Guardian last week they said the failure of politicians to tackle climate breakdown and the growing extinction crisis means “the ‘social contract’ has been broken … [and] it is therefore not only our right, but our moral duty to bypass the government’s inaction and flagrant dereliction of duty, and to rebel to defend life itself.” Organisers said Wednesday’s turnout showed the strength of frustration and the desire to do something to tackle the ecological crisis. And they predicted widespread disruption next month. “People are no longer prepared to sit back and watch our politicians and corporations drive us off the cliff of ecological destruction,” said one of the organisers, Gail Bradbrook. “This is an emergency situation and it needs an emergency response.”"
"In his recently published posthumous collection of articles and essays, Brief Answers to the Big Questions, Stephen Hawking forecast that genetic editing techniques will give rise to a breed of “superhumans” – “a race of self-designing beings who are improving at an ever-increasing rate”.  In 2017, the professor told Wired magazine that the AI “genie is out of the bottle”. He was fearful that developments in artificial intelligence will give rise to “a new form of life that will outperform humans”. To ensure humanity’s survival, the theoretical physicist thought we would have to colonise other planets and solar systems. “Spreading out may be the only thing that saves us from ourselves. I am convinced that humans need to leave Earth,” he told an audience at a Norwegian science and arts festival in 2017. Hawking also had concerns about climate change, which were amplified by the election of Donald Trump as president in 2016. “Trump’s action [pulling out of the Paris agreement] could push the Earth over the brink, to become like Venus, with a temperature of 250C and raining sulphuric acid,” Hawking told BBC News. He also thought that should we make contact with extraterrestrials the outcome might not be positive. In 2010, he told the Discovery Channel: “If aliens visit us, the outcome would be much as when Columbus landed in America, which didn’t turn out well for the Native Americans.”"
"The connections between County Clare, Ireland and La Guajira, Colombia may not be entirely obvious at first glance. Yet the regions are linked through a shared commodity: coal. Extracted in one region and burned in the other. Coal extraction in La Guajira has a dirty secret, which I’ve witnessed first-hand: it is connected to a system of production entrenched in violence, bloodshed and environmental destruction.   Since 2001, almost 90% of coal burned at Moneypoint power station in County Clare in the west of Ireland has come from Colombia. Two-thirds of it was purchased from Cerrejón mine in Colombia’s northern department of La Guajira.  Spanning 69,000 hectares – around three quarters the size of county Dublin – Cerrejón is one of the world’s largest open-pit coalmines. It is also linked to well-documented environmental and human rights abuses for over two decades.  Ireland’s largest electricity-generation station, Moneypoint, is owned and run by the Electricity Supply Board (ESB) utility company. Because the ESB is majority (95%) state-owned, the Irish government has a duty and responsibility to challenge and try to prevent adverse human rights impacts connected to the company’s fuel purchases.  As the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights put it, Businesses have a responsibility for human rights impacts that are directly linked to their operations, products or services by their business rela­tionships, even if they have not contributed to those impacts. I’ve seen the impacts. On two separate Witness For Peace delegations to La Guajira, human rights campaigners and academic researchers, myself included, documented human rights violations and the socio-environmental devastation inflicted on communities in Cerrejón’s mining zone. Our newly published study reveals that inhabitants of La Guajira have become victims of coal mining, instead of beneficiaries. It also reports parallel injustices among communities affected by fracking in Pennsylvania.  ""Embodied energy injustices: Unveiling and politicizing the transboundary harms of fossil fuel extraction and fossil fuel supply chains"". New paper with @jenniecstephens & @stephmalin_soc Thread (1)https://t.co/Sl0lf6nLqy pic.twitter.com/XDfoECqjSv Cerrejón mine has displaced thousands of historically marginalised indigenous Wayúu, Afro-Colombian and campesino communities by physical force, intimidation, coercion, and through the contamination of drinking water and farmland. Cerrejón mine uses over 17 million litres of water a day, but the average person has access to just 0.7 litres. Official displacement follows a Colombian legal procedure called “expropriation,” where the state approves or participates in the removal of populations in zones designated for natural-resource extraction or megaprojects. But the involvement of the Colombian government does not necessarily make the displacements just or nonviolent.  In 2001, for example, the Afro-Colombian town of Tabaco was bulldozed and its residents forcibly removed by state security forces to allow the Cerrejón mine to expand. A Colombian Supreme Court order called for the community to be resettled. Following an independent inquiry in 2008, Cerrejón mine signed an agreement for the reconstruction of Tabaco. Ten years later, Tabaco residents have yet to be resettled.  In the neighbouring department of El Cesar, three Drummond mine union leaders were murdered in 2001. More recently in La Guajira, activists who resist Cerrejón’s expansion plans have received renewed death threats.  Despite the 2016 Colombian Peace Agreement, there has been a spike in assassinations of social leaders nationwide. At least 123 were murdered in the first six months of 2018. The chronic lack of transparency in energy supply chains shields coal-importing countries, shareholders and consumers from the horrors of outsourced fossil-fuel extraction impacts. Last week, transnational human-rights group London Mining Network brought threatened community leaders to testify at the AGM of Cerrejón’s co-owners, BHP. Impacted communities seek corporate accountability, and they want the international community’s help.  Calling for the ESB to stop buying coal from Cerrejón mine may initially wash the Irish government’s hands of its blood coal. But this would neutralise the government’s current purchasing power and influence to advocate for peaceful and just negotiations that guarantee basic human rights for displaced communities. Instead, the Irish government should first bring the concerns of Colombian and international human rights organisations to the Colombian government, Cerrejón mine, and its owners BHP, Glencore Xstrata, and Anglo American. It should call for Cerrejón to acknowledge its responsibility for the destruction of Tabaco, and to carry out a just resettlement per the independent inquiry that the mine itself called for. That Ireland is still burning coal – the same week climate scientists warned that the world has just 12 years to get control of climate change – is nothing short of reckless. But then, this is a government whose annual budget on 09 October failed to introduce even a modest carbon tax as a step to reducing Ireland’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  The government’s plan of replacing Moneypoint power station with a liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility, supplied via fracked gas from the US, would replicate Ireland’s complicity in human rights violations. Methane and other GHGs leaked by natural gas pipelines and facilities warm the climate as much as coal in the short term. New fossil fuel infrastructure with 30-40 year lifespans is not the answer to Ireland’s coal problem.  Even if the Irish government stops buying Cerrejón coal, it still has a responsibility for what has happened in the past. It must repair the damages done to those harmed by climate change, by coal, and by the impacts of the transition, such as the loss of jobs for fossil fuel industry workers. Only the government can make a just transition a reality.  The International Energy Association says that “Ireland’s location at the edge of the Atlantic Ocean ensures one of the best wind and ocean resources in Europe.” A clean-energy economy can happen. An Irish energy revolution can happen. But not without government help.  Annual €200m–€600m fines for not meeting EU green-energy targets may change the government’s tune. If they don’t, maybe the Climate Case Ireland legal action will.  Noel Healy (@DrNoelHealy) is an Associate Professor of Geography at Salem State University.

"Melissa Price has said she can’t “recall the complete conversation” in which three witnesses say she disparaged Pacific nations to the former president of Kiribati but maintains the version provided by Labor’s Pat Dodson is incorrect. Under fire from Labor for misleading the House, the environment minister qualified her remarks that she “100% disagreed” with Dodson by adding in question time on Thursday that she did not recall the entire “very pleasant and light-hearted conversation”.  On Wednesday the senator  wrote to the minister declaring he was “appalled” by her remarks to the visiting Pacific official Anote Tong on Tuesday night during a chance encounter at a Canberra restaurant. Dodson says he introduced Price to Tong at the restaurant and she then said: “I know why you are here, it’s for the cash. For the Pacific, it’s always about the cash. I have my chequebook here, how much do you want?” Dodson’s account was backed by another witness, Phil Glendenning, the director of the Edmund Rice Centre and the president of the Refugee Council of Australia. He told Guardian Australia the Labor’s senator’s account of the incident was “150% correct”. On Thursday Tong told ABC Radio National that he was a little further from Price than his dinner companions but their accounts were accurate from what he had heard. “I do have a bit of a hearing problem but certainly the account they shared with me was not different,” he said. Tong said he wanted to put the issue behind him and move on, so as not to take the focus away from his work lobbying Australia on the issue of climate change. In question time, Labor’s climate change spokesman, Mark Butler, asked Price: “Given it’s been 24 hours since the minister misled this House, will the minister now comply with the ministerial standards and correct the record?” In response, Price gave her account of the encounter that she had “stumbled across Senator Dodson” – whom she said she considers a friend - and went over to say hi. “He said to ‘come and meet my guests’ which I did do and I was introduced to the former president of the republic of Kiribati, President Tong, to whom we had a very pleasant light-hearted conversation. “I don’t recall the complete conversation but what I do know is when I looked at the letter from Senator Dodson which describes the conversation, I know that is not the conversation.” Price said she had called Tong after question time on Wednesday. “What I said to him is I don’t agree with the words that were reflected in the letter,” she said. “But if – if – I have caused any concern then I’m very sorry about that. And he accepted my apology.” Price noted that Tong had subsequently said they should put the matter behind them. “We agree with that because this government greatly values our relationship with our Pacific nation neighbours,” she concluded. Labor also targeted Price over an earlier answer to parliament that administration costs for the $440m grant to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation are capped at 5%, 0r $22.5m. On Thursday Price said the figure of 5% was correct, but added that a capped amount of interest earned on the grant principal can also be spent on administration. “The maximum amount that the foundation may use for administration including the interest component is a total of $44.3m,” she said."
"On a recent overcast October afternoon, yet another section of West Cliff Drive, the premier seafront street in Santa Cruz, California, was roped off as workers toiled to prevent it from crumbling into the Pacific Ocean. The erosion gnawing away at this prized road, and the famed surfing beaches it overlooks, is emblematic of the relentless threat that climate change poses to California’s coastline. As the sea level rises and storms of growing strength smash into the coast, the golden sands and beach properties that have come to define the state are at risk.  “I think with every coastal road in California, you’re going have to think about relocating it,” said Gary Griggs, an earth sciences professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz. West Cliff Drive, which sits on an elevated bluff, hugs the coast near Santa Cruz’s 111-year-old boardwalk en route to a nature reserve thick with eucalyptus. The street’s beach houses and towering villas are regularly valued beyond $2m, with some vacant plots of land fetching $1m. “Coastal property values are way inflated, factoring in all the risk involved,” Griggs said. “West Cliff Drive is the place to be now; lots of people who made money in Silicon Valley have moved there.” Santa Cruz sits on the northern lip of Monterey Bay, which is losing several feet of beach a year. Sections of the cliffs beneath West Cliff Drive are abutted by piles of rocks, known as riprap, placed as a last-ditch attempt to stem erosion. There is only one house on the ocean side of the road, and its owners moved in recently. “They didn’t have any idea what they were getting into,” said Griggs, who is doing consulting work for the owners amid a tussle with authorities over riprap earlier put in place without permission. “The seawater keeps rising. In the long run, the main beach in Santa Cruz will certainly be lost, if nothing is done.” Similar challenges are sprouting up along the California coast, particularly in the south of the state. Up to two-thirds of southern California’s beaches will completely erode by the end of this century if there aren’t “large-scale human interventions”, according to a major report released by the state government in August. Around $48bn worth of property will be at risk should the swelling sea level increase beyond 4ft. “If we continue the path we are on there will be significant loss of beaches,” said Madeline Cavalieri, a program manager at the California Coastal Commission. The response to morphing coastlines will have to involve a combination of “protection, accommodation and retreat”, she added. This scenario is particularly painful for a place like Santa Cruz, which draws its cultural and economic strength from its beaches and pounding waves. According to local lore, three visiting Hawaiian princes introduced surfing to the city in 1885, when they rode the waves in longboards milled from local redwood. Surfers from around the world now descend upon Santa Cruz to spots such as Steamer Lane, where a rip hurtles into a sandstone bluff that has been in retreat since the last ice age and is now guarded by an array of rocks. A former lighthouse, now a surfing museum, overlooks surfers scrambling over the rocks and into the foaming water. “If you ask a surfer, it’s very apparent that climate change is real and is happening right before our eyes,” said Nick Muchas, who has lived and surfed in Santa Cruz for the past 15 years. Muchas frets about surfing spots that will suffer as the coasts recede, leading to overcrowding at the better areas, as well as the impacts on land. “West Cliff Drive is our cherished road, it’s our treasure chest, and every winter we can see the whole cliff is becoming more unstable,” he said. “When the surf and spray comes over it, I’d say it’s treacherous.” Erosion has shaped California’s coast since long before mass industrialization started pumping planet-warming gases into the atmosphere. A rock arch near the lighthouse collapsed in the late 19th century, with just a stump remaining now. A separate rock formation, known locally as “the old shoe”, is now more like the bottom of a heel. But climate change is accelerating this process. According to a city climate plan, more than 70 Santa Cruz buildings are expected to be at risk from flooding within 12 years with 4in of sea level rise. By 2100, this grows to 390 residential and 65 commercial properties, along with seven miles of roads. This would come with “high rates of beach and coastal bluff retreat”, the document states. “It’s really hard to say right now what that means, but we do know that tourism is a major driver of our economy here locally,” said Tiffany Wise-West, the sustainability and climate action manager for the city of Santa Cruz. “What if [residents] do have to move at some point? We already have an affordable housing crisis here in Santa Cruz.” Along about a tenth of the California coast, the response to this threat has been to erect seawalls or dump protective rocks. While this may buy time for expensive low-lying infrastructure – waste water treatment plants, power stations, the airports at San Francisco and San Jose – the barriers can exacerbate the loss of beaches. As the sea level rises, beaches would naturally migrate inland with the retreating coastline. But fixed points such as seawalls prevent this shift, trapping and in effect drowning the sand as the sea rises and storms take their toll. Roads, sidewalks and buildings also provide a barrier, which presents a conundrum for cities such as Santa Cruz that want to avoid the opposing financial cataclysms of losing their beaches or having to relocate buildings and people en masse to safer ground inland. The hard choices won’t be deferred for much longer. California’s coastal commission has been pushing Santa Cruz to come up with an erosion plan for West Cliff Drive and the city is turning to residents for feedback. More defences may be erected; some areas may have to be abandoned. The state is keen on “green” solutions – seeding wetlands or other vegetation to slow the tides – but that is tough to do in Santa Cruz, with its steep cliffs and hefty waves. The retreating coastline isn’t the only climate challenge Santa Cruz, like many coastal locations, is facing. Heatwaves threaten the sick and elderly, while lengthening wildfire seasons risk choking the city with smoke. The city, already unaffordable for many residents, could see a future influx of people seeking to escape from baking temperatures inland. “I would say we are on the leading edge in terms of understanding our risks and being proactive and addressing them,” Wise-West said. “It’s a pretty daunting topic, though.”"
"Australia’s chief scientist says the question facing the nation’s energy future is not about renewables versus coal but how best to create “a whole-of-economy emissions reduction strategy”. In a prerecorded interview with Sky released on Sunday, Dr Alan Finkel responded to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s report, which warned that greenhouse gas pollution needs to reach zero by 2050 if the world is to have any hope of stopping global warming at 1.5C.  Finkel said for Australia that did not mean debating pro- and anti-coal stances but using all available technologies to create the best outcome. “I feel we’ve got to focus on outcomes,” he said. “The outcome is atmospheric emissions. We should use whatever underlying technology are suitable for that. “People paint themselves into an anti-coal corner or a pro-coal corner but the only question of relevance is to look at the atmospheric emissions.” The IPCC report was largely dismissed by the government last week, including by the deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, who referred to it as “some sort of report”.

Finkel told Sky the report also said “that we need to look at things like coal-fired power with carbon capture and storage associated with it” and the issue was not as black and white as was being presented. In an op-ed published on the Conversation website on Friday, Finkel said there was “no time for fatalism” and urged “all decision-makers, in government, industry and the community to listen to the science”. “We have to look squarely at the goal of a zero-emissions planet, then work out how to get there while maximising our economic growth,” he wrote. “It requires an orderly transition, and that transition will have to be managed over several decades. “That is why my review of the National Energy Market called for a whole-of-economy emissions reduction strategy for 2050, to be in place by the end of 2020.” Finkel said no option should be ruled out “without rigorous consideration” and he again repeated the importance natural gas would play in the transition. “The IPCC has made the same point, not just for Australia, but for the world,” he said in the op-ed, adding: “We have in Australia the abundant resources required to produce clean hydrogen for the global market at a competitive price, on either of the two viable pathways – splitting water using solar and wind electricity, or deriving hydrogen from natural gas and coal in combination with carbon capture and sequestration. “Building an export hydrogen industry will be a major undertaking. But it will also bring jobs and infrastructure development, largely in regional communities, for decades. “So the scale of the task is all the more reason to press on today – at the same time as we press on with mining lithium for batteries, clearing the path for electric vehicles, planning more carbon-efficient cities, and so much more.” Finkel recommended that the government establish a clean energy target in the review he handed to the Turnbull government last year but faced immediate opposition from pro-coal backbenchers, including Tony Abbott and Craig Kelly. Those divides within the Liberal party room were a trigger for the leadership spill that ended with Malcolm Turnbull being dumped as prime minister, after the debate about the government’s proposed energy policy conflated with leadership tensions. It ended with Turnbull quitting parliament and the death of the national energy guarantee, with Scott Morrison ruling out legislating any emissions reductions targets in favour of maintaining them in policy. The prime minister has continued to insist that Australia will meet its Paris emissions reduction targets “in a canter” despite not having any legislated roadmap to cut atmospheric pollution."
"This week came the news from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that we are screwed. I wish I could be more optimistic. I wish I could hold out some hope that things are about to improve. But I look at actions by governments around the world, and the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison governments, and I find the ability to retain a positive outlook smothered in the face of feckless indifference and wilful ignorance. The IPCC report is not actually, as some would have you think, a prophecy of doom – it is a call for action. Rather than talking of what will happen if the planet warms by 2C above industrial levels, its focus is on how much lower the risks are if we limit it to 1.5C. And the good news is this can actually be done. The bad news is we need to do it by 2030 and it is going to cost, on average, about US$2.4tn every year until 2035 – equivalent to 2.5% of the world GDP. For Australia, that translates to around $46bn – the same amount the government spends on the aged pension. Even if we argue that as we only contribute about 1% of total global emissions we should only contribute 1% of the US$2.4tn cost, we are chipping in $33bn a year in Australian dollars – or equivalent to the combined amount spent this year on the NDIS, Newstart and the childcare subsidy. Not cheap. But keeping temperatures at 1.5C reduces the risk of, for example, all of the Great Barrier Reef dying (we’re still likely to lose 70% to 90%). Our farmers would certainly notice the difference as the reports suggests that biome shifts in Australia (which would see our arid, temperate and tropical regions shift) “would be avoided by constraining warming to 1.5C as compared with 2C”. In a pure dollars sense, the report notes that “the economic damage in the United States from climate change” is around 1.2% of GDP per 1C increase. So it is pretty clear that limiting the temperature rise to 1.5C is worth it. The problem is it is harder to achieve. It requires, for example, reducing emissions to zero by 2050 rather than 2075. And that is tough to do, especially when you have governments like our own that are already fudging their ability to reduce emissions by much lower amounts than what would be required. As we saw earlier this month, the government tried its best to hide the latest greenhouse gas emissions data and, since then, has done nothing but try to con voters that all is well. On Monday, the environment minister, Melissa Price, in an excruciating interview on the ABC’s AM program, refused to say she thought the IPCC report was reliable and boasted that “emissions per capita were at their lowest level in 28 years”. This was repeated by the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, who took it further by bragging that “what we’ve done on climate is seen that emissions on a per capita and GDP basis have come down to their lowest level in 28 years. That’s the record.” The reality of the IPCC report is that we can limit the damage from climate change but it is going to be hard and it is going to be expensive. What an idiotic thing to brag about. Every government every year since 1990 has been able to say that emissions per GDP are at their lowest level – they haven’t gone up once! Bragging about having reduced emissions per GDP is like boasting that today you are the oldest you have ever been. Reducing emissions per capita (or per GDP) has never been the issue. The only reason people look at that figure (as I did a few years back) is to compare it across nations to contrast greenhouse gas dependency and efficiency. In 2016, Australia had the fifth-highest total emissions in the OECD – behind the US, Japan, Germany and Canada. But, on a per capita basis, guess what? We’re No 1. So if Frydenberg, Price and the prime minister want to talk about emissions per capita, talk about that. Or maybe they can brag about the fact that in 2014 our emissions per capita were 5.5% higher than that of the US but in 2016 they were 12.6% higher. The problem is our government, like the Trump White House and Republican party in the US, consists of two types of people – climate change deniers who are so ignorant they truly do think it is all a UN hoax and those who are willing to enable the deniers for political gain. A choice between the ignorant and the feckless. And it really doesn’t matter which category the prime minster, treasurer or environment minister are in, the end result is the same – climate change policy cons that will not deliver what they say they will. Take the prime minister’s line that we will reach our Paris targets “in a canter”. How, pray tell, will we do this? Well, he told ABC’s Sabra Lane that “this is the advice that we’re working through as a government. But what it’s based on also is we’ve crossed a threshold point, Sabra. No longer in order to see large investment in renewable technologies do you need these heavy subsidies, because it’s now making economic sense all on its own.” In other words, he would have us believe that nothing more needs to be done, it will all happen because of market forces. Even more laughably, Morrison suggested that we would meet our commitments because “we’ve still got the small-scale RET and the large-scale RET programs, they remain in place”. Yes they remain in place but, as the minister for energy, Angus Taylor, recently told parliament, “the truth of the matter is that the renewable energy target is going to wind down from 2020. The target reaches a peak in 2020 and we will not be replacing that with anything.” So Morrison’s two major programs that he believes will help us reach our emissions reduction target by 2030 will end in 2020. But, you know, trust him! Morrison “believes” that “we’re going to meet those targets comfortably”. Faith can move mountains and now apparently also reduce emissions. The reality of the IPCC report is that we can limit the damage from climate change but it is going to be hard and it is going to be expensive. That has always been the biggest con from the Liberal party since Tony Abbott took over – the suggestion that reducing emissions can be done without any pain and little cost. If that were the case, no one would be worrying about it – it would have already have been done. But the con artist always tries to sell the line that the difficult can be done with ease – just trust him, you can get something for nothing. And all the while something nags you, because you think it sounds too good to be true – and it is. The IPCC report makes clear that this government’s con job on climate change must stop, and that not only is the time running out to do something about emissions but that the time to put up with climate-change deniers and their enablers in governments around the world is over."

"A whole new fossil fuel industry will launch in the UK on Saturday when energy giant Cuadrilla starts fracking for shale gas. This follows the defeat of Lancashire resident Bob Dennett’s attempt to block fracking in his local area with a court injunction – and comes just six days after a landmark report from the UN’s IPCC warning that we have just 12 years to prevent catastrophic climate breakdown. I can’t deny the fracking decision is a devastating blow for everyone in the UK who cares about our future and our democracy.  Monday’s IPCC report was unequivocal: renewables need to supply 70-80% of our energy by 2050 to avoid disaster, and by 2030 we must be well on the way to meeting that target. The government should be urgently repealing restrictions that have effectively banned the cheapest clean energy – onshore wind – and reinstating support for solar. They should be dramatically reducing our reliance on coal, oil and gas, too. We simply don’t have time to be distracted by building a whole new fossil fuel industry – in economic terms or in terms of our carbon budgets. But there is still hope. The fight against fracking has united people like no other British movement against environmental destruction in recent years. And we’ve had significant success. The government has been doing everything in its power to force this new industry through for five years. But it’s been seven years since any part of the UK was last fracked. Around the clock for half a decade, local communities are all that have stood in the way of ministers seemingly hell-bent on tearing up our climate targets and fossil fuel corporations determined to prise every penny of profit from our warming planet. Thousands of people have bravely put themselves at risk to prevent, delay and obstruct the frackers. Thanks to them, in Yorkshire, Third Energy has given up its plans to frack after failing to pull together the financial backing to win planning permission. In Lancashire, local councillors refused to allow Cuadrilla to frack at Preston New Road – but the government stepped in and trampled all over local democracy. Ministers are getting themselves into deep political trouble as they ramp up efforts to further overrule local communities – with increasing numbers of their own MPs now threatening to vote down plans to make fracking as easy as building a garden shed. And when a judge sent three peaceful anti-fracking protesters to prison last month, people from all walks of life condemned their harsh sentences and sent messages of solidarity. At a time when our country can feel very divided, the movement to protect our environment is uniting people. Drilling may start in Lancashire, but now is not the time to give in. Fracking is at the front line of the struggle to totally transform the future. A new mass movement for climate justice can shut Preston New Road down – and make sure it is the last ever fracking site in this country. It can block airport expansion, too, and together we can stop HS2. With bold, positive campaigns we can unite communities around calls for clean, safe streets that prioritise people over cars. We can win a public transport system fit for the 21st century, and investment that creates hundreds of thousands of green jobs. The IPCC made clear that nothing short of totally reimagining our economy will deliver a safe climate. The frackers might have won this round – but if we use the moment to unite behind the common and inextricably linked causes of social and environmental justice, we can still prevail. • Caroline Lucas is Green MP for Brighton Pavilion"
"A new group of “concerned citizens” is planning a campaign of mass civil disobedience starting next month and promises it has hundreds of people – from teenagers to pensioners – ready to get arrested in an effort to draw attention to the unfolding climate emergency. The group, called Extinction Rebellion, is today backed by almost 100 senior academics from across the UK, including the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams. In a letter published in the Guardian they say the failure of politicians to tackle climate breakdown and the growing extinction crisis means “the ‘social contract’ has been broken … [and] it is therefore not only our right, but our moral duty to bypass the government’s inaction and flagrant dereliction of duty, and to rebel to defend life itself.” Those behind Extinction Rebellion say almost 500 people have signed up to be arrested and that they plan to bring large sections of London to a standstill next month in a campaign of peaceful mass civil disobedience – culminating with a sit-in protest in Parliament Square on 17 November. Roger Hallam, one of the founders of the campaign, said it was calling on the government to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025 and establish a “citizens assembly” to devise an emergency plan of action similar to that seen during the second world war. On top of the specific demands, Hallam said he hoped the campaign of “respectful disruption” would change the debate around climate breakdown and signal to those in power that the present course of action will lead to disaster. “The planet is in ecological crisis – we are in the midst of the sixth mass extinction event this planet has experienced,” he said. “Children alive today in the UK will face the terrible consequences of inaction, from floods to wildfires, extreme weather to crop failures and the inevitable breakdown of society. We have a duty to act.” Extinction Rebellion is part of the Rising Up activist group, and organisers have spent the past few months holding public meetings in towns and cities across the country. Hundreds of people have gathered in libraries and meeting halls, cafes and universities, pubs and churches to hear dire warnings about the consequences of the unfolding climate emergency – and what they can do about it. “It feels like we are tapping into something very powerful in terms of the frustration and urgency many people are feeling as the evidence mounts of the scale of the climate emergency we are facing,” said Hallam, an academic at King’s College who specialises in social change and protest. He said the group was now getting 20 requests a week from people across the UK wanting to be given the talk. “To put it simply,” he said, “we’re fucked. From the melting ice in the Arctic to the release of methane from the permafrost, the evidence is overwhelming and people are starting to realise that. What we need now is to start working out what we are going to do about it.” The attempt to organise wide-scale civil disobedience around the looming climate breakdown comes just weeks after three people were jailed – and then released – for anti-fracking campaigns in the UK. And it follows dire warnings from the UN that there are only 12 years left to prevent global ecological disaster. Almost 100 academics – half of them professors – on Friday backed the call for rebellion. In a letter to the Guardian they state: “While our academic perspectives and expertise may differ, we are united on this one point: we will not tolerate the failure of this or any other government to take robust and emergency action in respect of the worsening ecological crisis. The science is clear, the facts are incontrovertible, and it is unconscionable to us that our children and grandchildren should have to bear the terrifying brunt of an unprecedented disaster of our own making.” Last week the US politician Bernie Sanders posted a link to an article supporting Extinction Rebellion, civil disobedience and the wider anti-fracking campaign to his 7.5 million followers. Hallam said the group was in talks with campaigners in the US about organising similar Extinction Rebellion events in Washington DC next month. Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP, is also supporting the plan and will be among the speakers at the launch in parliament next week. As part of their attempt to mobilise the wider environmental movement, activists from Extinction Rebellion, armed with flowers and letters, occupied Greenpeace headquarters last week. Describing the move as a “tap on the shoulder of a friend”, they wanted the environmental organisation to email its members highlighting the rebellion plan – and ideally calling on them to take part. After two hours of “friendly discussions” the group left. Greenpeace subsequently said that although it supports any attempt to raise awareness of the climate emergency it does not know enough about those behind Extinction Rebellion to ask its members to take part. But Hallam remains undeterred. The planned rebellion will begin with a declaration of demands being pinned to parliament next week and reach its peak with a peaceful sit-down protest in Parliament Square on 17 November. “After that, who knows,” he added. At the end of another organising meeting in a cafe on a west London estate this week, Hallam acknowledged it is impossible to say exactly what will happen. How many of those who have signed up will actually turn up on the day? Will those who say they are prepared to get arrested and go to prison buckle when faced with police telling them to move? Will hundreds more supporters turn up unannounced? Looking around the bustling cafe, where about half of the 30 people in attendance are signing up to take part, Hallam said: “In the end we have to realise that we will all be alone on our deathbed and asking ourselves whether we lived a worthwhile life – and for this generation the climate crisis is the overriding existential challenge. There are no guarantees but doing nothing, not trying, is not an option.” Gail Bradbrook, scientist and veteran of tax justice campaigns and the Occupy movement “For years I have engaged with this ecological crisis on an intellectual level, the mounting evidence, the science … but now I have engaged with the potential destruction of this world on an emotional level and there is a fundamental difference. There is huge feeling of grief, of loss. I found myself bursting into tears, of feeling distant with longstanding friends … but as with other forms of grief, as the poets say, you start to come through that initial shock and feeling of loss and there is a renewed appreciation of the beauty of the world, a renewed realisation that we are connected. Once you face and feel the shock of what we are facing, if you are willing to face the grief and can process those feelings, there is tremendous energy and a will to do what it takes. So that is what we have been asking people, to be willing to look at the truth of our predicament and grieve. And something is starting to change. There is a still a disconnect between how bad things are and the action that needs to happen. But that gap is narrowing. There are more significant people starting to break ranks, both breaking from their institutions and breaking from their individual lives. For me it goes beyond the idea of protecting my life as a privileged individual, or even the idea of protecting my children’s future to a deeper need to have been a good ancestor to future generations, to know that I did my best when the big challenge came.” Alison Green, pro vice-chancellor of Arden University and UK director of the Scientists Warning public engagement campaign (speaking in a personal capacity) “I have no formal background in environmental issues and am fairly senior in my organisation. But unlike some academics I have taken the time to look properly at the evidence and have come to the clear conclusion that we are facing an imminent and potentially catastrophic climate emergency. It has led me to re-evaluate what I am doing and why I am doing it. I am a career academic but in the face of what is likely about to happen to us I have to reconsider my priorities. I have children and I feel incredibly conflicted continuing in a ‘business as usual’ national setting, getting up and going to work when just around the corner there is a future for my children that is not the kind of future they believe they are working towards. If I am honest, it really breaks my heart. I have to ask myself, can I continue to do with integrity what I am doing when I know what is about to happen? I am therefore asking myself, am I prepared to protest? Am I prepared to go to jail? And these are questions I am hoping many more people start to engage with. There will not be an opportunity for a ‘lessons learned’ scenario if we don’t act or if we get this wrong – there will not be an opportunity to repent at leisure. If you understand the science, and I would put myself in that category, then I think there is an obligation to act – we are entitled to rebel because our interests are not being met. My levels of optimism are not high and this may not work but we must have the courage to try.” Jessica Townsend, writer “I’m writing a novel set in 2030 and as I started the research on climate change, I became more and more alarmed at the disconnect between what I was reading in popular science books and what is in the mainstream media. Much of it made me feel traumatised and upset. I don’t understand how we have allowed living animals to be part of a factory process or to treat the Earth as if it was just raw materials for our industries. Technology has made the world so complicated that regular people don’t have time to keep abreast of everything that’s happening. But the ecological disaster quietly unfolding around us is just too important to ignore: we have to wake up. The last campaign I was involved in was Stop the War and I was so gutted when Tony Blair invaded Iraq that I swore I’d never do this again. But I’m a grandmother. If we do nothing we are heading for 3-4C of global warming. That will mean a superheated world, with perhaps a billion migrants, and societal breakdown. My grandson, everyone’s grandchildren, deserve a better future than that.” Rupert Read, academic at the University of East Anglia and Green party politician “I’ve taken part in civil disobedience before but not for the last 15 years. I’ve been prompted to again by the dire stakes of the climate breakdown we are now in the early throes of, and by the dire failure of our government (or any government, for that matter) to take these stakes seriously. The way that climate chaos has manifested in the last three years, with our weather systems perhaps beginning to spiral out of control, and especially the overheating of the Arctic, has been a big factor for me. The situation in the Arctic is now genuinely terrifying, because of the risk of huge-scale methane release. This is an emergency, an unprecedented emergency. It dwarfs any other emergency we’ve known, including even World War II. And we will be judged by our children by how we respond in this emergency. Not by what are, in comparison, just distractions: such as Brexit. To future generations I would say that we are trying. Those of us who are joining this rebellion, and the many who support us, are really trying. If we fail you, it wasn’t for lack of effort.”"
"It’s a spectacular trick to get someone to amplify your message when they disagree with you vehemently, describe you as an idiot and decry you as dangerous. But that is exactly what some conservatives have managed to do.  I had been noticing this sleight of hand for a while but it was finally crystallised last week after the climate zealot and federal politician Craig Kelly declared in a widely reported speech that we shouldn’t worry about climate change and that, rather than being the cause of global warming, “fossil fuels actually protect us”.  While this statement is incendiary, and stoked the outrage Kelly no doubt expected, there is nothing new or strange about it. Kelly has made extreme statements like this his stock-in-trade and you could substitute his speech for those by Tony “climate change itself is probably doing good” Abbott or Barnaby “people in the Kmart don’t care about the Paris agreement” Joyce. But what is strange, and what’s so damn smart, is how widely these comments have been repeated and amplified by the very people who oppose that message. To put it simply – a lot of progressives are being played for mugs. Imagine if Kelly, Abbott or Joyce sidled up to one of your more left-leaning friends and said to them: “Hello there, I’m going to make a speech and it’s really important to me that the message gets out. Be a chum and share it all over your social media feeds and tell your friends about it.” Your left-leaning friends would tell them to go to hell. But then they do exactly that when left to their own devices.  It’s shared with commentary, usually “this person is an idiot”, but the claims are still being amplified. Polarising figures win the numbers game almost by default – and not just with climate. Take the time Pauline Hanson wore a burqa into parliament as an example. I would wager that her actions did not surprise the majority of her supporters, and that it upset even fewer than that. They know Hanson’s game – that’s what attracted a lot of them to her in the first place. She loses nothing from the outrage and gains everything. The media firestorm after this stunt saw her views commentated on, shared and picked over for weeks. Those who supported or hated her continued to do so. But there would have been a small handful of people who were invigorated by the outrage – and that helped her. That’s why she looked so happy despite the protestations and condemnation from both sides of parliament that day – it’s all oxygen.  There have been numerous studies, the most shocking around anti-vaccination claims, that suggest attempting to “set the record straight” is actually the same as spreading the false claims yourself.  The researchers found that, despite their intention to combat anti-vaccine lies, “over-time exposure to these interventions strengthened participants’ belief in those lies and falsehoods”.  Despite advertising refuting anti-vax myths, the researchers found that people remembered the myths, not the refutations. Think about that next time you repeat something said by someone you disagree with. It also suits polarising conservatives to be opposed by a group they steadfastly insist on portraying as the “liberal elite”, “latte elite” or inhabitants of the “quinoa corridor”. In his book Insane Clown President, journalist Matt Taibbi described the way Donald Trump would stoke outrage and use the media to not only amplify his polarising statements but use their reporting to portray himself as a victim. This perception was further reinforced each time media figures, celebrities, or anyone else he chose to describe as “elites” attempted to criticise him.  In fact, as Taibbi points out, “[Trump] made his campaign into a class conflict and he used the media as the representatives of the class enemy, because they were the ones in the room. It was a brilliant strategy.” These are reasons enough to stop but there is one more, and it’s the most insidious of all. The anger around Kelly’s statements creates an illusion that there is still a debate going on. That there are still even sides. That climate change isn’t an issue that has united farmers, firefighters, surf lifesavers, soldiers, tourism operators, scientists and most of the rest of the country. This false perception is helped when Labor’s rising star Sam Crosby comes out to debate Kelly’s comments. Ridiculous ideas should be laughed at and mocked, not debated and amplified.  The Overton window is a well-known phenomenon in communications and political strategy that basically says there is a “window” of ideas that are acceptable to the public. Everything inside the window is normal. Everything outside the window is radical, ridiculous or unthinkable. But that window changes – during the US election Vox did an explainer of how the window works and what Trump-style politics had done to debate in the US. “The easiest way to move that window was to force people to consider ideas at the extremes, as far away from the window as possible,” Carlos Maza wrote. “Because forcing people to consider an unthinkable idea, even if they rejected it, would make all less extreme ideas seem acceptable by comparison.” By saying extreme things, these polarising figures shift what is “normal”. Their statements are the new extreme, making what was once extreme seem reasonable. And if you’re repeating their lines, you’re helping them. If we boost Kelly’s assertion that we don’t need to worry about climate change and that fossil fuels protect us, rather than endangering us, we are messing with the dials.  People who say polarising things are not stupid. They are very far from it. When they make statements that seem stupid, they’re doing it for a good reason. There is a purpose and a strategy that is well thought out – and it’s working.  Don’t amplify things you don’t agree with. Don’t help people who look to reduce serious issues like climate change. Resist the urge, even if it feels good. By all means refute, but treat these people like Voldemort from Harry Potter – they shall not be named, their claims shall not be repeated. That’s the way to really hurt them. • Simon Black is a campaigner at Greenpeace"
"It’s not about “them”, it’s about us. The horrific rate of biological annihilation reported this week – 60% of the Earth’s vertebrate wildlife gone since 1970 – is driven primarily by the food industry. Farming and fishing are the major causes of the collapse of both marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Meat – consumed in greater quantities by the rich than by the poor – is the strongest cause of all. We may shake our heads in horror at the clearance of forests, the drainage of wetlands, the slaughter of predators and the massacre of sharks and turtles by fishing fleets, but it is done at our behest. As the Guardian’s recent report from Argentina reveals, the huge forests of the Gran Chaco are heading towards extermination as they are replaced by deserts of soya beans, almost all of which are used to produce animal feed, particularly for Europe. With Jair Bolsonaro in power in Brazil, deforestation in the Amazon is likely to accelerate, much of it driven by the beef lobby that helped bring him to power. The great forests of Indonesia, such as those in West Papua, are being felled and burned for oil palm at devastating speed.  The most important environmental action we can take is to reduce the area of land and sea used by farming and fishing. This means, above all, switching to a plant-based diet: research published in the journal Science shows that cutting out animal products would reduce the global requirement for farmland by 76%. It would also give us a fair chance of feeding the world. Grass-fed meat, contrary to popular belief, is no alternative: it is an astonishingly wasteful use of vast tracts of land that would otherwise support wildlife and wild ecosystems. The same action is essential to prevent climate breakdown. Because governments, bowing to the demands of capital, have left it so late, it is almost impossible to see how we can stop more than 1.5C of global warming without drawing carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. The only way of doing it that has been demonstrated at scale is to allow trees to return to deforested land. But could we go beyond even a plant-based diet? Could we go beyond agriculture itself? What if, instead of producing food from soil, we were to produce it from air? What if, instead of basing our nutrition on photosynthesis, we were to use electricity to fuel a process whose conversion of sunlight into food is 10 times more efficient? This sounds like science fiction, but it is already approaching commercialisation. For the past year, a group of Finnish researchers has been producing food without either animals or plants. Their only ingredients are hydrogen-oxidising bacteria, electricity from solar panels, a small amount of water, carbon dioxide drawn from the air, nitrogen and trace quantities of minerals such as calcium, sodium, potassium and zinc. The food they have produced is 50% to 60% protein; the rest is carbohydrate and fat. They have started a company (Solar Foods) that seeks to open its first factory in 2021. This week it was selected as an incubation project by the European Space Agency. They use electricity from solar panels to electrolyse water, producing hydrogen, which feeds bacteria that turn it back into water. Unlike other forms of microbial protein (such as Quorn), it requires no carbohydrate feedstock – in other words, no plants. Perhaps you are horrified by this prospect. Certainly, there’s nothing beautiful about it. It would be hard to write a pastoral poem about bacteria grazing on hydrogen. But this is part of the problem. We have allowed a mythical aesthetic to blind us to the ugly realities of industrial agriculture. Instilled with an image of farming that begins in infancy – about half the books for very small children involve a rosy-cheeked farmer with one cow, one horse, one pig and one chicken, living in bucolic harmony – we fail to see the amazing cruelty of large-scale animal farming. The blood and gore, filth and pollution. We fail to apprehend the mass clearance of land required to feed us. The Insectageddon caused by pesticides; the drying up of rivers; the loss of soil; the reduction of the magnificent diversity of life on Earth to a homogeneous grey waste. The compound the Finnish researchers have produced from air, water and electricity is most likely to be used as a bulk ingredient in processed food. But (though this goes well beyond the company’s current plans) is there any reason why, with modifications of the process, it could not start to deliver the proteins required to make cultured meat, or the oils that could render palm plantations redundant? Is there any reason why it should not eventually replace much of what we eat? According to the researchers’ estimates, 20,000 times less land is required for their factories than is needed to produce the same amount of food by growing soya. Cultivating all the protein the world now eats with their technique would require an area smaller than Ohio. The best places to do it are deserts, where solar energy is most abundant. When electricity can be generated at €15 (£13) a megawatt hour (a few years hence), their process becomes cost-competitive with the cheapest source of soya. Could a similar technique also be used to produce cellulose and lignin, eventually replacing the need for commercial forestry? Is there any inherent reason why the hydrogen pathway could not create as many products as photosynthesis does today? Could it help to change our entire relationship with the natural world, reducing our footprint to a fraction of its current size? There are plenty of questions to be answered, plenty of possible hurdles and constraints. But think of the possibilities. Agricultural commodities, currently using almost all the Earth’s fertile land area, could be shrunk into a few small pockets of infertile land. The potential for ecological restoration is astonishing. The potential for feeding the world, a question that has literally been keeping me awake at night, is just as electrifying. None of this means we can afford to relax and wait for an infant technology to save us. In the meantime, as urgent intermediate steps, we should switch to a plant-based diet and mobilise against the destruction of the living planet. You could start by joining the Extinction Rebellion movement, which launches today. But if this works, it could help – alongside political mobilisation – to change almost everything. Places that have become agricultural deserts, trashed by giant corporations, could be reforested, drawing carbon dioxide from the air on a vast scale. The ecosystems of land and sea could recover, not just in pockets but across great tracts of the planet. A new age of global hunger becomes less likely. Crude and destructive technologies got us into this mess; refined technologies can help get us out of it. The struggle to save every possible species and ecosystem from the current wave of destruction is worthwhile. One day, perhaps within our lifetimes, they could repopulate a thriving world. • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"
"Peter Fiekowsky, a physicist and entrepreneur, hates silver bullets. But at a climate summit in California last month he found himself pitching one. In partnership with the company Blue Planet, he was demonstrating a low-tech-looking machine that can pull carbon dioxide from the air and store it in construction materials.  If every new building for the next 30 years was made with the resulting product, humans could erase the globe-warming pollution they’ve sent into the atmosphere, said Fiekowsky, founder of the Healthy Climate Alliance network. Blue Planet’s technology is nascent in a scene dominated by a few companies that specialize in carbon removal, and it won’t be the last newcomer. People have done too much damage to the climate to avoid catastrophe just by halting the burning of fossil fuels. They now will have to re-engineer the world, according to scientists with the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The livability of the planet will thus depend largely on tools that are now available only on a small scale and currently still expensive. The key, Fiekowsky said, is not the technology itself. It’s having a meaningful goal: restoring the climate, “because it means maybe we’re not doomed”. The UN’s recent report – which says it will require unprecedented action within the next 12 years to keep temperatures from climbing beyond a current 1C increase to a 1.5C increase – does not inspire optimism in many carbon removal experts. While it’s technically feasible to slow fossil fuel use fast enough and capture enough greenhouse gases to limit warming, the world is not on track to do so. Scaling up carbon capture technology is possible but will be difficult, said Kurt Waltzer, managing director for the Clean Air Task Force. “We are absolutely going to have to have a significant amount of carbon removal, there’s no question about it,” Waltzer said. “The level will probably depend on how quickly we can get to a zero-carbon world, but it is going to be enormous.” Most of the work has previously centered around sequestering carbon from power plants, which is different than drawing it from the air. James Mulligan, carbon removal expert at World Resources Institute, said direct-air carbon capture technologies are “unproven at the scale that we’ll need them”. A decade ago, they were viewed as “impossibly expensive”, he said. Now, some are touting a cost of $100 to $200 per ton of carbon. “That’s still expensive,” Mulligan said. “But halting climate change isn’t going to be free.” Reforestation and new agricultural practices could also trap carbon and help slow warming. But direct removal will still be necessary. With direct-air capture, the most obvious option is to store carbon underground. But technologies that create a sellable product will help reduce costs. Three of the biggest direct-air carbon removal companies – Carbon Engineering, Climeworks and Global Thermostat – are all working to store CO2 in something useable. Carbon Engineering markets a carbon-neutral fuel. Climeworks sends carbon to fertilizers, fuels and soon, the beverage industry. Global Thermostat sells the gas for a wide range of purposes. Products made with carbon don’t demand a high enough price to boost capture around the world, so expanding them will require government intervention. Louise Charles, a spokeswoman for Climeworks, said the company has found government support in Europe and has 14 direct-air capture plants built or under construction. But she said there just isn’t enough money in the industry yet. Next year, Climeworks will enter a new market, letting individuals pay to catch and store carbon to account for their own emissions from flying and driving. Steve Oldham, the CEO of Carbon Engineering, said interest in his company has increased in the last few weeks in light of the IPCC report, which he said may be good for business but is overall “kind of scary”. “We think we have a solution that could be part of solving the problem,” Oldham said. “But the missing piece in the middle is policy, and policy requires both need and a solution.”"

"The Wentworth byelection result demonstrates Liberal voter support at the next election should not be taken for granted. Many Liberal voters don’t share the government’s woefully immoral position on climate change or the way that its policies seem to be for sale.  Many Liberals want the party to change its position on climate change. Many of us can’t understand how any sensible business orientated party can ignore the obvious climate science or the very obvious climate economics. The cost of playing “climate catch up” will be greater and the loss of opportunity also greater by delaying action. Australia has a global competitive advantage in a low carbon world and it is in our self interest that we achieve this. If the party will not listen (and many of us have tried to fight from the inside) climate conscious Liberal independents will stand at the next election to ensure that Liberal voters can express their displeasure at the current position of the Liberal party. Should climate conscious Liberals stand as independents in Liberal seats and draw away just 20% of the primary Liberal vote, then many safe Liberal seats will be at risk.Many members of the Liberal party share a deep concern for the environment.Many potential members are discouraged from joining the party as they do not see membership consistent with their belief in the importance of good environmental management.We know that a healthy environment and a sound economy are both essential to our nation’s current and future prosperity. We know that we can and must preserve both our environment and our economy for current and future generations of Australians.The Liberal party has historically been a party conscious of the environment. We need to maintain and build on that tradition. This tradition is strong and includes the establishment of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, Uluru National Park, Kakadu National Park, the cessation of sand mining on Fraser Island and nominations of those areas for World Heritage, and the National Heritage Trust.As Liberals we need to change the view that being environmentally conscious is inconsistent with being an active member of the party.I am deeply upset by the Liberal parties environmental position. If you mention “environment/climate change/emissions management” and “Liberal” in the same sentence at best, “don’t compute” flashes up. At worst “hypocrite” springs to mind. This is not acceptable.The prime minister’s marketing strategy for coal must end and be replaced by policies that work to secure the planet for current and future generations. A quality of life that is prosperous, healthy and environmentally sound (for the people) Clean, efficient and profitable businesses and industries (for business) Sound and enforceable environmental laws that balance the risks and opportunities of tomorrow with the profit motive of today (solid and effective law and government) Sustainable economic development for all, where the needs and desires of communities are pursued in balance with – as opposed to in competition with – the environment (achieving balance) “Real Growth” where economic targets like GNP growth are supplemented by additional measures (much as in the “balanced scorecard” approach to measuring business performance), and are calculated taking account of all social costs (including externalities and the value of finite resources consumed) Appropriate government policies, including the identification and removal of government interventions that produce perverse environmental outcomes, including subsidies (setting the right policies) After the IPCC report was released, containing scientific certainty of the complete loss of the Great Barrier Reef if action was not taken, the prime minister dismissed it like he would a blowfly. It is a disgrace. Claiming Liberal disunity is the death of the party is irrelevant. Scott Morrison is so wrapped in self interest, advertising and spin he fails to see that loss at the next election is a price many Liberals are prepared to pay if that is what it takes trigger real change to reinstate our legacy of good environmental and economic management. Remember the party can be repaired, but the planet and environment we leave our children cannot. • Oliver Yates is a member of the Liberal party and former CEO of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation"
"Young people in colourful T-shirts bearing slogans of Stop Adani, and members of Renew and other green groups, have been fanning out across Sydney’s eastern suburbs to knock on as many doors as possible – not for any particular candidate, but for a specific cause. Unlike most general elections or byelections where economic management, tax, health and education dominate voters’ thinking and candidates’ pitches, the byelection in Wentworth will be a referendum on climate change and the lurch to the right by the Liberal party.  The Liberals have done much themselves to make climate the central issue – and not in a good way. The dumping of their national energy guarantee, inextricably linked with the dumping of the member for Wentworth, Malcolm Turnbull, from his job as prime minister, which ultimately triggered his resignation and Saturday’s poll, exposed the great schism within the Liberal party on this issue. It has left the Liberal candidate Dave Sharma with little to say other than that he believes climate change is real and that Australia is on track to meet its Paris commitments. But has has offered no detail on how, other than to point to Snowy Hydro 2.0, a project close to his predecessor’s heart. The Neg also laid bare the deep fissures in the Coalition between the pragmatic centre and the right wing, which Turnbull tried to bridge for three years but in vain. The well-educated voters of Wentworth, who might once have felt reassured that Turnbull would prevail, now see that the party that they have supported for 60 years is not the moderate “small l” Liberal party they voted for.  Add in a drought in Australia, record-breaking storms in the US and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report warning that the world faces a catastrophe without urgent action on climate change to peg global warming to 1.5%, and it’s no wonder the issue has become, perhaps, the defining factor in the Wentworth byelection. GetUp’s climate campaigner, Miriam Lyons, says it’s not just Wentworth; climate change is now as big an issue as it was in the 2007 election campaign. That does not bode well for the Coalition at the next election. Converting that unhappiness over climate change into a vote for someone else has been the subject of an intense, co-ordinated campaign in Wentworth. A coalition of environmental groups has been working together in the electorate to ensure that voters realise they have an opportunity to send a message on climate change. The ScoMos, with lumps of coal, and the Tony Abbotts in their budgie smugglers outside candidate events are just the most visible parts of their efforts. GetUp has organised an army of phone banking volunteers who have called more than 85,000 of Wentworth’s 103,000 registered voters. “After the IPCC report came out and Scott Morrison said it didn’t apply to Australia, one man walked into our office and said: ‘what can I do?’. He’s one of our phone banking volunteers now,” Lyons says. Over the past few days, volunteers have swelled to more than 100 each night. GetUp will have literally hundreds of volunteers at polling places handing out cards that explain how to cast your vote for the environment. It gives four options: Greens, the independents Kerryn Phelps and Licia Heath, and Labor. But in a controversial move, it has changed the Greens’ recommendation on preferences, instead advocating a preference for Phelps ahead of Labor’s Tim Murray. The former Greens leader Bob Brown has also recommended putting Phelps ahead of Murray after voting 1 Greens, in a pragmatic recognition that there is a greater chance of the Liberals being defeated if she comes ahead of Murray. Lyons says GetUp’s decision on who to recommend and how to preference is based on candidate responses to surveys and a scoring process that evaluates each candidate on their promises on climate policy, and other progressive issues such as ending offshore detention. Phelps has said she opposes the giant Adani mine, while the ALP supports it, although Murray has said he will work to halt it. Several green groups also organised a candidate forum at Bondi Pavilion, which was attended by 300 people. But it received good national exposure, thanks to speakers from the conservative side of politics – John Hewson and Geoff Cousins, who were joined by coral expert Professor Terry Hughes. Hewson, a former Liberal leader, has urged voters concerned with climate change to vote against the Liberals. “The idea was to maximise turnout by getting more conservative voices to lead with the message: ‘its OK to put climate change as the top priority in deciding how to vote’,” says Gavan McFadzean, the Australian Conservation Foundation’s (ACF) climate campaigner. Hewson’s intervention seems to have been a turning point, aided by Malcolm Turnbull’s son, Alex Turnbull, who has used his Twitter account and media interviews to advocate for a protest vote against the party his father once led. He says he’s doing it because climate change is the most important issue, and while he appears to have acted off his own bat, it has certainly helped underline the climate policy void on the conservative side of politics. The ACF does not issue how-to-vote cards, but has sent its 5,000 supporters in Wentworth a scorecard rating each candidate on their environmental policies and has asked them to talk to their friends and family about the issues. The advertising has also been more conventional, and the ACF has been running advertisements about climate change and drought in local cinemas, while GetUp has crowd-sourced funds for mobile billboards that have become regular features on the streets of Wentworth. The ACF has also produced electorate-specific data on what climate change will mean for that community. It plans to replicate the work, by the Australian National University, for more electorates during the the general election. Wentworth is proving a useful test bed for strategies the environmental groups plan to use next year. “Wentworth is a trial run for tactics for the election next year,” McFadzean says. “The main challenge will be to keep climate as an issue through the UN Conference of Parties meeting in Poland and into next year.”"
"Mass bleaching and coral death could be likely along the entire Great Barrier Reef this summer, according to a long-range forecast that coral experts say is “a wake-up call” for the Australian government. The US National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) has forecast a 60% chance that the entire Great Barrier Reef will reach alert level one, which signals extreme heat stress and bleaching are likely.  The forecast period covers November 2018 to February 2019 and the risk extends to the southern Great Barrier Reef, which escaped the mass mortality seen in the middle and northern parts of the reef in 2016 and 2017. “This is really the first warning bells going off that we are heading for an extraordinarily warm summer and there’s a very good chance that we’ll lose parts of the reef that we didn’t lose in the past couple of years,” said marine biologist Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, the director of the Global Change Institute at the University of Queensland. “These are not good predictions and this is a wake-up call.” Hoegh-Guldberg said it was particularly worrying that the long-range forecasts were already showing high chances of bleaching and mortality before March, which is the main month of the year for bleaching events. He said if the models proved accurate it would mean the entire Great Barrier Reef would be damaged by climate change and coral populations would trend towards very low levels, affecting the reef’s tourism and fishing industries and the employment they support. “To really have the full picture we’re going to have to wait for those projections that cover the main part of bleaching season,” he said. “Given sea temperatures usually increase as we get towards March, this is probably conservative.” The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s recent 1.5 degree report warned coral reefs were especially vulnerable to climate change. At even 1.5 degrees of warming it estimated the planet would lose 80% of its coral reefs. At 2 degrees they would all be wiped out. The government has backed coal power in defiance of the IPCC’s call for a phase-out by 2050. But Hoegh-Guldberg said the projection and warning from the NOAA was “very consistent with what the IPCC 1.5 degree report told us.” “It’s extremely important that politicians and our leaders stand up and make the changes we need to make so we don’t tread down an even more dangerous path,” he said. The environment minister, Melissa Price, said “like many Australians, I deeply share concerns about the health and resilience of our world heritage listed-Great Barrier Reef.” “We acknowledge that climate change has an impact on the reef,” she said. “That’s one of the reasons that Australia is working with other countries to tackle climate change through the Paris agreement, and we will deliver on the commitment to reduce emissions by 26-28 per cent of 2005 levels by 2030.” Price said that of the $443m the government had given in a grant to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, $100m would go towards reef restoration and coral recovery. The most recent quarterly emissions data published by the government shows Australia’s emissions are increasing."
"If a bricklayer builds a wall that falls over 12 years later, killing someone, the bricklayer can be sued and even jailed. If a doctor finds some old packets of thalidomide in their surgery and, in spite of the overwhelming scientific evidence of its horrific effects, dispenses it to pregnant women, they would go to jail. The example can be multiplied endlessly: the reality of our world is that we are responsible for our acts. Unless, that is, you are an Australian politician. A politician can destroy our future, a politician can ignore the best evidence and be responsible for decisions that lead to deaths of many and the suffering of all, and still be free until the end of their days to milk the legal corruption that is Australian public life, picking up highly paid sinecures as ambassadors, board directors and lobbyists for the corporations they were once meant to regulate in our interest. Last Monday there came the unbelievable news contained in the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report. If large-scale action is not taken now we will face a global warming catastrophe. The report was a nightmarish scream heard through a spithood of formal scientific language. Any rise above 1.5C is highly likely to be disastrous, with millions of people displaced by rising seas, the extinction of numerous species, and the loss of most coral reefs. At 2C the rate of crop loss doubles, as does the decline in sea fisheries. Almost all coral reefs will be dead. Diseases such as dengue and malaria will be far more widespread, extreme droughts and floods far more common, while security and economic growth will be imperilled. One of the report’s lead authors, the geographer Adelle Thomas, said, “The scientific consensus is really strong. It’s not just a political slogan: ‘1.5 to stay alive.’ It’s true.” The report was specific in how long we have to keep warming at 1.5C: until 2030. Twelve years. This Saturday the voters of Wentworth have the opportunity to turn their byelection into a referendum on climate change. If you are a Wentworth voter, consider the historic responsibility you have and how in the past you have used it to good effect. Last year it was Wentworth, after all, that voted 80.8% yes for marriage equality, the fourth-highest yes vote in the nation. Marriage equality, as many have since noted, was not given to us by enlightened politicians. It was forced on a recalcitrant government by the countless acts of individual courage shown by those who stood up in their workplaces, families, in their kitchens, cafes, sporting clubs, for their dignity and freedom; it was made possible by organisation and a passion that transcended party loyalties, and could not finally be refused. Marriage equality was won by the people, in other words, not gifted by the politicians. Our prime minister, a man with a wit that would make Kenny look like Oscar Wilde, once thought it funny to wave a lump of coal in parliament during the middle of one of eastern Australia’s worst heatwaves. Luckily he had Barnaby Joyce there to laugh. With a similar bro and brio he dismissed the IPCC report while speaking to Alan Jones, saying he wouldn’t be bound by its recommendations. His deputy, Michael McCormack, declared the government would not change policy “just because somebody might suggest that some sort of report is the way we need to follow”. That “some sort of report” – the findings of 91 of the world’s most eminent climate change scientists surveying more than 6,000 studies of the most recent research – didn’t trouble McCormack because he hadn’t read the report. Neither had our environment minister, Melissa Price, who told ABC radio the IPCC report, whatever the shared judgment of its global expertise, was “drawing a long bow” by calling for an end to coal by 2050. But then, of course, this is the same government that offers total political support for the Adani coalmine at a time when the IPCC says coal must be phased out. This is the same government that granted $440m to a foundation that never asked for the cash, to deal with water runoff and the crown-of-thorns starfish on the Great Barrier Reef when the science is clear that climate change is what will kill the reef. We have shown that we are large, that we care, and that we think And this is the same government that has no policies to meet Australia’s commitments to the Paris climate agreement. This is the same government that hides shameful greenhouse emissions reports showing our pollution increasing by releasing them in the days before Christmas, without publicity. And its leader, our prime minister, is the man who says that “we’re doing well” when the government’s own figures show that our pollution is increasing. The Liberal candidate Dave Sharma echoes the same smug complacency of the Liberal government he expects to join next Monday. “I do think we are doing enough,” Sharma has said, “and I do think we have had a good record on climate change. Emissions are at their lowest levels in 28 years,” he said. The evidence is otherwise: absolute emissions continue to rise and are among the highest in the OECD. Like our prime minister, who claims we will meet our Paris agreement targets “in a canter”, Sharma says: “We are on track to meet the Paris commitments and I believe we will address the Paris commitments and we will be addressing affordability and sustainable and coherent energy policy.” Sharma’s diplomatic wording cloaks the truth: the Liberal government is the Aleppo of energy policy. It has none, only the shell-shocked ruins of a once great party. As for the Paris climate targets, according to consultants, NDEVR Environmental, Australia is on a trajectory that will see it fail to reach them. In the face of such sustained stupidity by our leaders many Australians have felt an overwhelming sense of powerlessness. But we should not. If you are a Liberal voter, consider the voices of true conservatism and business As the marriage equality vote showed, as the Sydney Opera House controversy revealed, if we choose to exercise our power we discover that we are not as we have so often been told, small and mean and self-serving, cast in the shrivelled image of our politicians. To the contrary, we have shown that we are large, that we care, and that we think – and that when we dare to exercise it, that the power is ours. In evading their responsibilities on climate change, our politicians have been irresponsible to the point of what would be, in any other sphere of life, criminality. If you are a Liberal voter, consider the voices of true conservatism and business. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, recently warned “of the catastrophic impacts that climate change could have for the world financial system”. “We accept the IPPC assessment of climate change and that human influence is clear and that the physical impacts are unavoidable,” Jac Nasser, the former chairman of BHP, the world’s biggest resource company, declared, while Eric Schmidt, the former chairman of Google, said: “The facts of climate change are not in question. People who oppose it are hurting our children and making the world a worse place. They’re just simply lying.” Listen to Fiona Simson, the president of the National Farmers’ Federation, who has stated “We’ve turned a corner on climate change … overwhelmingly, I think it’s got to a point where the science is very acceptable.” These are hardly the lunatic voices of the far left. It is clear that the traditional constituencies of the Coalition, business and farmers, support major action on climate change – as do the majority of Australians according to all published research, as do the majority of people in Wentworth. Yet the government, from the prime minister down, dismisses the issue. Indeed, both the government and Sharma, state that they are “doing enough” on climate change. The very phrase drips with the contempt of our political class for Australian citizens who they take for passive fools, easily manipulated. As with marriage equality we see a polity determined to do nothing. Since 2013, the Coalition government in its various incarnations has lied, laughed and destroyed when it comes to this most fundamental matter: that of our future. Their record is one of deceit, obfuscation and craven capitulation to the fossil fuel industry. It is a party that has evaded its most fundamental responsibility to our land and our people, and the time for a reckoning has arrived. This Saturday, voters of Wentworth can lead Australia as they did in the marriage equality survey. They can make the byelection a referendum on climate change by voting the candidate they believe has the best climate policy number 1, any who might have a reasonable policy from 2 to 15, and put Dave Sharma at 16. “We have presented governments with pretty hard choices,” Prof Jim Skea, co-chairman of the IPCC panel has been quoted as saying. “We show it can be done within laws of physics and chemistry. Then the final tick box is political will.” The most important thing a voter can do on election day is demonstrate that this threat to our future must be our politicians’ number one priority, and give our politicians the political will to act now. There is so much beauty in this world. Sometimes it is hard to believe this life that is given us. Sometimes it is hard to believe that it is possible to change it for the better, or save it from the worst. But from today we must, and we can. If we take our compass from power we will know only despair. But if we take our compass from those around us and their actions we discover hope. It is time we rediscovered not partisan division but a common humanity ready to take on our gravest crisis. It is time we acted, and the Wentworth byelection is the first chance Australians have. Our tomorrows are running out. We have only today. • Richard Flanagan is the Man Booker prize winning Australian author • Businessman Geoff Cousins is a former Howard government adviser"
"The shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, has issued a clear warning to Australia’s energy sector that Labor does not support the government indemnifying new coal plants against the future risk of a carbon price – noting the cost to taxpayers could run into billions. While the ALP federally has a policy of not repudiating contracts, Butler told Guardian Australia on Wednesday: “Investors need to understand very clearly that we do not support that. That would be an extraordinary waste of taxpayers’ money.”  Butler’s comments follow a signal from the energy minister, Angus Taylor, that the government could provide an indemnity for private projects as part of “absorbing” the risks currently stopping companies investing in new “reliable” power generation. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, earlier this week held out the prospect of government support for new coal-fired power stations “where they meet all the requirements” of yet-to-be finalised new mechanisms to boost investment in new electricity generation. One of the key problems preventing private investment in new coal-fired power generation is proponents have struggled to get finance because they are unable to predict future carbon risk, particularly given Australia’s decade-long partisan standoff over emissions reduction policies. Taylor told Guardian Australia in an interview on Tuesday the government would look to remove the risks currently stopping investment in new power generation. “I’m saying we will look at whatever risks that can’t be managed by the companies that need to be managed to get investment. “What we are saying is the risks that government needs to absorb to get investment in reliable generation, we will look at absorbing. We need the investment.” Butler said in response the idea that the Coalition would expose taxpayers by taking on private sector risk associated with new coal plants “which the industry itself has described as uninvestable, marks a new low, even for this government”. He warned that if the government did proceed to provide an indemnity for a new coal project to shield the investor from future carbon risk, the cost to taxpayers “would likely run to billions of dollars that could otherwise be spent on schools and hospitals”. With an election due in the first half of next year, Butler sent a clear signal to the energy sector that it would be imprudent to countenance such a proposal. “Labor has sent the clearest possible message that new coal-fired power stations have no part in Australia’s future energy mix”. “They are too expensive, and fundamentally inconsistent with our climate change obligations”. Taylor has made it clear the Morrison government wants to settle a decision about the mechanisms the government will use to underwrite investment in new generation projects quickly, and have a short list ready to go by early next year, so before the next federal election. The energy minister says government backing will be available not only for new generation projects but also for retrofitting existing plants. The idea of the government underwriting new generation power stations was proposed by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission in a recent landmark review of the electricity market. The ACCC suggested an underwriting mechanism where the government would enter low fixed-price energy offtake agreements, set at $45-$50 per MWh. While government conservatives grabbed the recommendation as a potential lifeline for coal, the ACCC made it clear that wasn’t the intention. The ACCC’s recommendation was also aimed at bringing new entrants into the market to increase competitive pressure on the incumbents, but the government has departed from those parameters. It is unclear whether any market participants would bring forward a proposal for a new coal plant before next January, and whether it would get regulatory approval. Trevor St Baker, part-owner of the Vales Point coal generator and founder of the business electricity retailer ERM Power, has previously telegraphed interest if the government settles on a favourable energy policy."
