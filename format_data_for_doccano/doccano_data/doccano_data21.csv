People have upbraided me for not doing an in-depth analysis of the paper “Earth’s Energy Imbalance and Implications“, by James Hansen et al. (hereinafter H2011). In that paper they claim that the earth has a serious energy imbalance, based on the change in oceanic heat content (OHC). Here’s my quick analysis of the paper. A more probing discussion will follow.
Figure 1. What could happen if the ocean gets warm. Dangers include increased risk of lassitude, along with augmented consumption of intoxicants and possible loss of clothing, accompanied by mosquito bites in recondite locations.
Here’s how I proceeded for a quick look at the H2011 results. The paper says that during the period 2005 – 2010, the warming of the entire global ocean, from the surface down to the abyssal depths, is the equivalent of 0.54 W/m2 of energy.
When I read that, the first thing I did was make the conversion to degrees per year of oceanic warming. I wanted to see what they were saying, but measured in meaningful units. A half watt per square metre of energy going into the global ocean means nothing to me. I wanted to know how fast the ocean was warming from this rumored imbalance. The conversion from watts per square metre to degrees Celsius ocean warming per year goes as follows.
We want to convert from watts per square metre (a continuous flow of energy) to degrees of warming per year (the annual warming due to that flow of energy). Here’s the method of the calculations. No need to follow the numbers unless you want to, if you do they are given in the appendix. The general calculation goes like this:
An energy flow of one watt per square metre (W/m2) maintained for 1 year is one watt-year per square metre (W-yr/m2). That times seconds /year (secs/yr) gives us watt-seconds per square metre (W-secs/m2). But a watt-second is a joule, so the result is joules per square metre (J/m2).
To convert that to total joules for the globe, we have to multiply by square metres of planetary surface, which gives us total joules per year (J/yr). That is the total joules per year for the entire globe resulting from the energy flow in watts per square metre.
That completes the first part of the calculation. We know how many joules of energy per year are resulting from a given number of watts per square metre of incoming energy.
All that’s left is to divide the total joules of incoming energy per year (J/yr) that we just calculated, by the number of joules required per degree of ocean warming (J/°C), to give us a resultant ocean warming in degrees per year (°C/yr).
The result of doing that math for the 0.54 W/m2 of global oceanic forcing reported in H2011 is the current rate of oceanic warming, in degrees per year. So step up and place your bets, how great is the earth’s energy imbalance according to Hansen et al., how many degrees are the global oceans warming per year?  … les jeux sont fait, my friends, drumroll please … may I have the envelope … oh, this is a surprise, there will be some losers in the betting …

The answer (if Hansen et al. are correct) is that if the ocean continues to warm at the 2005-2010 rate, by the year 2100 it will have warmed by a bit more than a tenth of a degree … and it will have warmed by one degree by the year 2641.
Now, I don’t think that the Hansen et al. analysis is correct, for two reasons. First, I don’t think their method for averaging the Argo data is as accurate as the proponents claim. They say we can currently determine the temperature of the top mile of depth of the ocean to a precision of ± eight thousandths of a degree C. I doubt that.
Second, they don’t use the right mathematical tools to do the analysis of the float data. But both of those are subjects for another post, which I’ve mostly written, and which involves the Argo floats.
In any case, whether or not H2011 is correct, if the ocean wants to change temperature by a tenth of a degree by the year 2100, I’m certainly not the man to try to stop it. I learned about that from King Canute.
w.
APPENDIX:  Some conversion factors and numbers.
One joule is one watt applied for one second. One watt applied for one year = 1 watt-year * 365.25 days/year * 24 hrs/day * 60 minutes / hour * 60 seconds / minute =  31,557,946 watt – seconds = 31.56e+6 joules.
Mass of the ocean = 1.37e+18 tonnes
It requires 3.99 megajoules (3.99e+6 joules) to raise one tonne of sea water by 1°C
Joules to raise the entire ocean one degree Celsius = tonnes/ocean * joules per tonne per degree = 5.48e+24 joules per degree of oceanic warming
Surface area of the the planet = 5.11e14 square metres
1 W/m2 = 1.60e+22 joules annually
So the whole calculation runs like this:
    .54 W/m2 *1.6e+22 joules/yr/(W/m2)

------------------------------------------------   =  0.0016 °C/yr

       5.48e+24 Joules/°C

It appears that the focus of this has to do with the refusal to give up station data in and the DOE’s apparent complicity in that issue as revealed in the CG2 emails in 2009 from Dr. Phil Jones at CRU.
From the Competitive Enterprise Institute (via email):
=============================================================
November 30, 2011
Freedom of Information Officer
Mr. Alexander Morris
U.S. Department of Energy
1000 Independence Avenue, SW
Washington, D.C. 20585
RE:     FOIA Request – 2007 communications between Office of Science and Dr. Phil Jones
ByRegularandElectronicMail — Alexander.Morris@xxx.doe.gov
Dear Mr. Morris,
On behalf of the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), a not-for-profit policy organization in Washington, DC, pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552 et seq. and the relevant U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) implementing regulations, please consider the following Request.
Please provide us within twenty (20) working days copies of any and all record(s) — defined here as correspondence and any memoranda, analysis, other communications cited therein or attached — which were 

created, received and/or held by DoE’s Office of Science, and
sent by or to (including as a “cc:”) a Dr. Phil Jones of the Climatic Research Unit of the University of East Anglia (typical, but likely not exclusive address: p.jones@uea.xxx), and
dated during the year 2007.

Background
Dr. Phil Jones, whose work has on occasion been funded in part by the U.S. taxpayer through DoE, is on record stating to parties requesting certain information things such as “Why should I make the data available to you, when your aim is to try and find something wrong with it.” (Jones in a 2004 email to researcher Warwick Hughes).
Also, in the 2009 and 2011 “ClimateGate” releases of emails many or most of which had been subject to but improperly withheld under the UK’s FOI law, we have seen Jones’s admissions of destroying correspondence in response to or anticipation of FOI requests.
Most important to the present request, in several emails recently made public Phil Jones explicitly states that the DOE informed him it is “happy about [Jones] not releasing the original [temperature] station data” to researchers requesting that particular information, which information was funded by the U.S. taxpayer through DoE.
The data at issue was also requested under a the UK’s FOI law. Jones was funded by the U.S. taxpayer. As taxpayers we have a right to learn relevant facts of apparently public employee-enabling of a scientist they fund to avoid FOI requests.
Examples of recently released correspondence supporting the public’s need for this information is found in, e.g., “ClimateGate 2011” emails that DoE offered this counsel in 2007.
In email 1577, Phil Jones says the following:
“Any work we have done in the past is done on the back of the research grants we get – and has to be well hidden. I’ve discussed this with the main funder (US Dept of Energy) in the past and they are happy about not releasing the original station data.” (July 28, 2009)
Also, he repeats this in email 1217:
“Work on the land station data has been funded by the US Dept of Energy, and I have their agreement that the data needn’t be passed on. I got this in 2007.” (May 13, 2009)
Transparency
We note the inauguralpost on the White House “blog” made immediately upon President Obama’s swearing-in to office which restated, in pertinent part, a prominent promise made when courting votes during the election campaign:
Transparency — President Obama has committed to making his administration the most open and transparent in history, and WhiteHouse.gov will play a major role in delivering on that promise. The President’s executive orders and proclamations will be published for everyone to review, and that’s just the beginning of our efforts to provide a window for all Americans into the business of the government. You can also learn about some of the senior leadership in the new administration and about the President’s policy priorities. WhiteHouse.gov, “Change has come to WhiteHouse.gov”, January 20, 2009 (12:01 p.m.), http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/change_has_come_to_whitehouse-gov/
Scope of Request
This Request for the described records covers DoE’sOfficeofScience(particularlyincluding,butnotlimitedto,itsOfficeofBiologicalandEnvironmentalResearch,andtheClimateandEnvironmentalSciencesDivisionanditsEarthSystemModelingProgram), and the period January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2007, inclusive.
Please identify and inform us of all responsive or potentially responsive documents within the statutorily prescribed time, and the basis of any claimed exemptions or privilege and to which specific responsive or potentially responsive document(s) such objection applies. Further, please inform us of the basis of any partial denials or redactions.
Specifically, if your office takes the position that any portion of the requested records is exempt from disclosure, we request that you provide us with an index of those documents as required under Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 415 U.S. 977 (1972), with sufficient specificity “to permit a reasoned judgment as to whether the material is actually exempt under FOIA” pursuant to Founding Church of Scientology v. Bell, 603 F.2d 945, 959 (D.C. Cir. 1979), and “describ[ing] each document or portion thereof withheld, and for each withholding it must discuss the consequences of supplying the sought-after information.” King v. U.S. Department of Justice, 830 F.2d 210, 223-24 (D.C. Cir. 1987).
In the event that some portions of the requested records are properly exempt from disclosure, please disclose any reasonably segregable, non-exempt portions of the requested records. See 5 U.S.C. §552(b). If it is your position that a document contains non-exempt segments and that those non-exempt segments are so dispersed throughout the documents as to make segregation impossible, please state what portion of the document is non-exempt and how the material is dispersed through the document. Mead Data Central v. U.S. Department of the Air Force, 455 F.2d 242, 261 (D.C. Cir. 1977). Claims of non-segregability must be made with the same detail as required for claims of exemption in a Vaughn index. If a request is denied in whole, please state specifically that it is not reasonable to segregate portions of the record for release.
Please provide copies of documents, in electronic format if you possess them as such, otherwise photocopies are acceptable. By this we mean that no delay need be incurred on the basis that the records are held in a particular format and must be transferred as we seek them as held in whatever medium or bearing whatever physical characteristics may be the case.
Request for Fee Waiver
We request your office(s) waive any fees associated with this request on the basis that CEI is a nonprofit, tax-exempt public interest organization, with formal research, educational and publication functions as part of its mission, and because release of these records will serve the public interest by contributing significantly to the public’s understanding of the controversial topics of environmental and science-related policy and specifically the ongoing debate over the transparency and credibility of taxpayer-funded science and the activities of taxpayer-funded scientists, and because such a release is not primarily in our organization’s commercial interest.
If our fee waiver request is denied we are willing to pay up to $50.00, and in the event of any appeal as appropriate and regardless of that outcome or your response to this fee waiver request we request the search and document production proceed in the interim.
As explained below and in our initial Request, this FOIA Request satisfies the factors customarily considered for waiver or reduction of fees, as well as the requirements of fee waiver under the FOIA statute – that disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii), see also inter alia DOE’s implementing regulations, Title10,CodeofFederalRegulations(Section1004.9).
CEI promotes the public interest advocating sensible policies to protect human health and the environment including through education on activities of government and taxpayer-supported entities, and has routinely received fee waivers under FOIA.
CEI is a national, nonprofit organization dedicated in great part to relevant energy and environment issues with no commercial interest in obtaining the requested information. Instead, CEI intends to use the requested information to inform the public, so the public can meaningfully participate in the policymaking process related to hydrocarbon energy production and use with complete, relevant information.
1. The subject matter of the requested records must specifically concern identifiable operations or activities of the government.
The requested records relate to DoE’s process and advice given regarding obligations to disclose certain details regarding taxpayer-funded work. Pursuant to FOIA this process, related correspondence, these determinations and the policies and procedures on which they are based are unquestionably “identifiable operations or activities of the government.” The Department of Justice Freedom of Information Act Guide expressly concedes that “in most cases records possessed by federal agency will meet this threshold” of identifiable operations or activities of the government. There can be no question that this is such a case.
2. For the disclosure to be “likely to contribute” to an understanding of specific government operations or activities, the releasable material must be meaningfully informative in relation to the subject matter of the request.
The disclosure of the requested documents must have an informative value and be “likely to contribute to an understanding of Federal government operations or activities.” The Freedom of Information Act Guide makes it clear that, in the Department of Justice’s view, the “likely to contribute” determination hinges in substantial part on whether the requested documents provide information that is not already in the public domain. The requested records are “likely to contribute” to an understanding of your agency’s activities because with limited exceptions they are not otherwise in the public domain and are not accessible other than through a FOIA request.
Given current concerns about the credibility of certain taxpayer-funded research and related processes (as revealed in, inter alia, the “ClimateGate” release of emails in 2009 and 2011), this information will facilitate meaningful public understanding of the described campaign, therefore fulfilling the requirement that the documents requested be “meaningfully informative” and “likely to contribute” to an understanding of your agency’s decision-making process and the controversial issue described above.
3. The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of the public at large, as opposed to the understanding of the requester or a narrow segment of interested persons.
Under this factor, the identity and qualifications of the requester—i.e., expertise in the subject area of the request and ability and intention to disseminate the information to the public—is examined. As described in our Request, above and below, CEI has a well-established interest and expertise in the subject of taxpayer-funded science and the related regulatory policies, demonstrated through, inter alia, freedom of information requests and litigation.
More importantly, CEI unquestionably has the “specialized knowledge” and “ability and intention” to disseminate the information requested in the broad manner, and to do so in a manner that contributes to the understanding of the “public-at-large.” CEI intends to disseminate the information it receives through FOIA regarding these government operations and activities in a variety of ways, including but not limited to, analysis and distribution to the media, distribution through publication and mailing, posting on the organizations’ websites, and emailing.
As shown by the extensive public discussion following revelation of certain tactics in the “ClimateGate” releases, these records are the subject of great public interest. To deny this would be prima facie capricious.
4. The disclosure must contribute “significantly” to public understanding of government operations or activities.
With the exception of the limited ClimateGate releases which do include Phil Jones flatly stating he has corresponded with DoE and received a staffer’s blessing to withhold data, there are currently no records publicly available regarding the requested information — correspondence to and from DoE addressing this matter. Absent disclosure of the records requested, the public’s understanding will be shaped only by what we are told was a “selective” and “out of context” release of emails. Further, Jones’ admissions of having destroyed records makes release of DoE’s versions more important to the public debate.
The records requested will contribute to the public understanding of the government’s role, or their “operations and activities” associated with this critically important information. The disclosure of the requested records is also essential to public understanding of DoE decision making process, its advice to parties it funds regarding transparency, and U.S. influence in critical “climate science” efforts including but not limited to the “IPCC” process. After disclosure of these records, the public’s understanding of this process will be significantly enhanced. The requirement that disclosure must contribute “significantly” to the public understanding is therefore met.
5. The extent to which disclosure will serve the requester’s commercial interest, if any.
As already stated CEI has no commercial interest in the information sought or otherwise in the requested records. Nor does ATI have any intention to use these records in any manner that “furthers a commercial, trade, or profit interest” as those terms are commonly understood. CEI is a tax-exempt organization under sections 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, and as such has no commercial interest. The requested records will be used for the furtherance of CEI’s mission to inform the public on matters of vital importance to the regulatory process and policies relating to energy and the environment.
6. The extent to which the identified public interest in the disclosure outweighs the requester’s commercial interest.
See answers to factors 1-5 above. Whether the magnitude of the identified commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently large, in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is “primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.” When a commercial interest is found to exist and that interest would be furthered by the requested disclosure, an agency must assess the magnitude of such interest in order to compare it to the “public interest” in disclosure. If no commercial interest exists, an assessment of that non-existent interest is not required. As noted above, ATI has no commercial interest in the requested records.
Disclosure of this information is not “primarily” in CEI’s commercial interest. On the other hand, it is clear that the disclosure of the information requested is in the public interest. It will contribute significantly to public understanding of the regulatory process as already described.
We respectfully request, because the public will be the primary beneficiary of this requested information, that DoE waive processing and copying fees pursuant to 5 U.S.C. §552(a)(4)(A). In the event that your agency denies a fee waiver, please send a written explanation for the denial. Also, please continue to produce the records as expeditiously as possible, but in any event no later than the applicable FOIA deadlines.
Sincerely,
Christopher C. Horner

Here’s the popup message solicitation you get when you visit the website for the first time:

Climate change is melting the North Pole and it’s no longer safe for Santa and his Workshop. So our dear old friend is packing up the sleigh to find somewhere else to live.
You can help! Move your mouse over this website to find gifts you can buy Santa to help him set up a temporary Workshop and protect the North Pole for his return.
Of course, you’re savvy enough to know we won’t be sending actual gifts to Santa. You will receive a tax receipt for 100% of your purchase and proceeds will be used by the David Suzuki Foundation to support our critical work to protect nature and the environment from threats like climate change.
Buying these green gifts and personalized ecards on behalf of hard-to-buy-for friends or relatives on your holiday list is a great way to show you’re thinking of them — and the planet!
Act now to help Santa!
Sincere thanks,
The David Suzuki Foundation
This is nothing more than a thinly veiled revenue generator for the foundation.
No shame, no scruples, just send money. Is it any wonder informed people are doubting the climate change issue when presented with crap like this?
h/t to Mike Bromley in Canada who writes:
Canadian geneticist-turned-environmentalist David Suzuki targeted children in his latest outburst of emotionally-charged enviro-gab, this time scaring the fun out of Christmas by warning that Santa’s home was melting.  In a post-black-Friday period of climate-ethical circus generation, this takes the cake.  This is beyond reprehensible.
Here’s what the North Pole looks like today:

UPDATE: Here’s a clip from 1972 showing Suzuki comparing humans to maggots in his own words. Looks like that must have been his Che’ Guevara period. (h/t Daily Bayonet)

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe English language The Local from France reports here that clothing retailers have been hard hit by the economic crisis and exacerbated by unusually cold weather so far this summer.


Cold conditions persist over western Europe. Temperature anomaly forecast next 7 days. Source: wxmaps.org/pix/temp4.html
Some weather agencies have been trying for months to convince the public that the recent cool temperatures are actually normal and that the coolness is just in our heads. However, consumer behavior is telling us something completely different: It really is cool outside.
The Local writes that “French retailers have started this year’s summer sales early, offering drastic reductions to bargain hunters.”
Among the reasons, The Local cites one retailer (my emphasis):

‘Because of the bad weather, customers have been looking in particular for winter stuff,’ one young shoe vendor in the capital told French daily Le Parisien on Monday. … Which is bad news for apparel and accessories stores who have stockpiled their shorts, swimwear and t-shirts for the summer season.
‘We still have at least 50 percent more stock than usual,’ the vendor added.”

Meanwhile the weather forecast is warning that some areas of Germany may see surface frost in the nights ahead as an early summer cold spell once again grips the country in the days ahead. Read here.
In the days ahead there is indeed once again the risk of surface frost, according to meteorologist Dominik Jung of www.wetter.net. […] During the nights especially in the south there may be surface frost at some locations.”
Recent long-term forecasts circulating in the German media have projected a normal temperature summer with a mixed bag of sun and rain. The big question right now is whether a high pressure system located near the Azores will be able to expand to central Europe and bring summerlike conditions. The weather models are undecided on this.
The rule of thumb is that the weather pattern that establishes itself over Germany during the end of June and early July often (up to 70% chance) persists through much of the summer. This is a phenomenon known as Siebenschläfer in Germany. Right now things could be looking better.

In the 1960s and 1970s, neo‐​Malthusian panic about overpopulation overtook eugenics as the primary motivation behind coercive policies aimed at limiting childbearing. Neo‐​Malthusian ideas spread among senior technocrats and government leaders in some developing countries, resulting in human rights abuses that Western development professionals encouraged and that Western aid often funded. Those abuses peaked in the form of China’s one‐​child policy (1979–2015) and India’s forced sterilizations during its “Emergency” (1975–77), a period in India when civil liberties were suspended and the prime minister ruled by decree.



The one‐​child policy saw over 300 million Chinese women fitted with intrauterine devices modified to be irremovable without surgery, over 100 million sterilizations, and over 300 million abortions. Many of these procedures were coerced. In a similar vein, India’s Emergency saw 11 million sterilizations, many of them forced.



China and, to a far lesser extent, India still have troubling policies. After softening its one‐​child policy to a two‐​child policy, China continues to brutally enforce family size limits and to require birth permits from prospective parents and parents seeking to expand their families. Coercion continues to define an unknown share of the country’s 9 million annual abortions. In India, political representation is apportioned in a way that punishes states with high birth rates. Half the people in India live in states with policies that penalize, to varying degrees, families with more than two children to discourage large families. Fortunately, recent policy changes are reversing heavy financial penalties imposed earlier on high‐​fertility states.



Neo‐​Malthusian policies aimed at limiting family size have increased female infanticide and sex‐​selective abortion in China and India, skewing the _world’s_ sex ratio at birth to 107 boys per 100 girls. (The natural ratio is 105 boys per 100 girls.)



Neo‐​Malthusianism remains the chief cause of family size restrictions. Countering overpopulation hysteria continues to be important.



The world is doomed, many people argue, citing poverty, dwindling natural resources, and an allegedly unsustainable rate of population growth. They say there are just too many problems to overcome. But is that really the case? Join the conversation and find out.



In 1983, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)—then the United Nations Fund for Population Activities—the world’s largest multilateral source of funding for government population programs, began issuing a prize called the Population Award, to be presented annually to “an individual, to individuals, or to an institution for the most outstanding contribution to the awareness of population questions or to their solutions.”1 The first prizewinners were Indira Gandhi, India’s prime minister who declared a national “Emergency” that suspended civil liberties and mandated sterilizations on a massive scale between 1975 and 1977, and Qian Xinzhong, head of China’s State Family Planning Commission and the man in charge of the country’s one‐​child policy, which lasted from 1979 to 2015.



The coercive nature of India’s Emergency and the atrocities of China’s one‐​child policy were already well known.2 The Nobel Prize–winning economist Theodore Schultz, chairman of the University of Chicago’s Department of Economics, resigned from the UNFPA Advisory Commission in protest of the award recipients.3



Why did the United Nations (UN) applaud Gandhi and Xinzhong, who had overseen coercive policies that victimized millions of people? Part of the answer can be found in UN Secretary‐​General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar’s statement as he presented the Population Award: “If rapid population growth in the developing nations is left unchecked, it will evidently undermine all efforts for economic and social development and could easily lead to widespread depletion of each nation’s resources.” He praised the “vision and foresight” of Gandhi and Xinzhong for their efforts toward “controlling population growth.”4



Neo‐​Malthusianism, defined as fear that a large population size could lead to a humanitarian and ecological disaster and that combating so‐​called overpopulation is thus an urgent problem—has real‐​world consequences. The belief has often resulted in support for coercive policies. Countering neo‐​Malthusianism is especially critical now given the recent prominence of such thinking.



At the 2020 World Economic Forum in Switzerland, famed primatologist Jane Goodall opined, “All these [environmental] things we talk about wouldn’t be a problem if there was the size of population that there was 500 years ago.”5 The world population 500 years ago is estimated at 420–540 million people, or around 6.7 billion fewer people than today.



Goodall is far from alone in her belief that population growth is an urgent problem. In August 2019, the United Kingdom’s Prince Harry subtly suggested that children are a burden to the planet and that responsible couples should have “two, maximum.”6 Bill Nye, “the Science Guy,” supports the introduction of special taxes or other state‐​imposed penalties for having “too many” children.7 And popular television host Bill Maher in April 2019 declared: “I can’t think of a better gift to our planet than pumping out fewer humans to destroy it… . The great under‐​discussed factor in the climate crisis is there are just too many of us… . We don’t need smaller carbon footprints, we need less [sic] feet.”8



Recent examples of neo‐​Malthusian writings include op‐​eds appearing in prominent outlets such as _NBC News_ (“Science Proves Kids Are Bad for Earth. Morality Suggests We Stop Having Them”) and the _New York Times_ (“Would Human Extinction Be a Tragedy?,” which muses that “it may well be, then, that the extinction of humanity would make the world better off”).9 In April 2019, the progressive magazine _FastCompany_ released a video titled “Why Having Kids Is the Worst Thing You Can Do for the Planet.”10



Neo‐​Malthusianism enjoys support among some prominent elected officials. While historically overpopulation alarmism was a bipartisan concern in the United States championed by both Republicans and Democrats, in recent years it has been most common on the political left. When asked in September 2019 if he would enact a “campaign” to “curb population growth” to fight climate change if elected president, Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) answered in the affirmative, noting he would focus on poor countries.11 Rep. Alexandria Ocasio‐​Cortez (D-NY) famously questioned the morality of childbearing in the face of climate change earlier that year, asking, “Is it OK to still have children?”12 Presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden has even voiced acceptance of China’s family size limits, telling a Chinese audience, “Your policy has been one which I fully understand—I’m not second-guessing—of one child per family.”13



In November 2019, more than 11,000 scientists signed a report calling for the reduction of the world’s population to combat climate change.14 That report went viral and was shared on social media by many U.S. political figures, including Sanders and Sens. Ed Markey (D-MA) and Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) as well as Reps. Jimmy Gomez (D-CA) and Susie Lee (D-NV).15 Overpopulation alarmism, prominent in decades and centuries past, is undergoing a renaissance.



Others have offered in‐​depth critiques of neo‐​Malthusian theory.16 It turns out that birth rates tend to fall without coercion as countries grow richer and that population growth may make resources _more_ plentiful thanks to humanity’s capacity for innovation. Economist Julian Simon, for example, argued that the human mind is the “ultimate resource,” allowing humanity to increase the supply of other resources, discover alternatives to overused resources, and improve efficiency of resource use.17 Recent research has found evidence supporting Simon’s view, showing that every 1 percent increase in population is associated with commodity prices falling by around 1 percent.18 In other words, each additional person helps to decrease resource scarcity on average, suggesting that humans, when free to innovate and engage in market exchange, tend to be net creators rather than net destroyers.



Also, evidence shows that as countries grow richer and children’s odds of survival improve, couples tend to choose to have smaller families without being forced to do so. (Contrastingly, parents faced with high rates of infant mortality in their communities tend to have large families in part as a strategy to improve their odds of having at least some surviving children.) This phenomenon is called the “fertility transition.” Today even in sub‐​Saharan Africa, the world’s poorest region, birth rates are falling voluntarily.19 The global population is projected to decline in the long run.20



Yet many people remain convinced that overpopulation is an urgent problem necessitating government intervention, so it is worthwhile to detail some of the consequences of neo‐​Malthusian ideas. This paper focuses on the world’s two most populous countries, China and India, which together hold roughly 40 percent of the world’s population and are where neo‐​Malthusianism has arguably caused the most suffering.



While neo‐​Malthusian human rights abuses peaked with China’s one‐​child policy and India’s Emergency, problematic policies continue today. In both countries, neo‐​Malthusian policies have contributed to higher rates of sex‐​selective abortion and infanticide. China has the world’s most imbalanced sex ratio at birth, resulting in 30 million more men than women, and India has the world’s fourth most imbalanced ratio despite government and private efforts to combat sex‐​selective abortion.21 China and India have contributed to a _worldwide_ lopsided sex ratio at birth of 107 boys per 100 girls and to over 160 million “missing” women globally.22 (The natural sex ratio at birth, when unaltered by sex‐​selective abortion or infanticide, is on average 105 boys born for every for every 100 girls.23)



Cases of coercion, such as during the one‐​child policy and Emergency, alone are sufficient reason to oppose neo‐​Malthusianism. By documenting the extent of penalties and coercion, this paper seeks to demonstrate the grave importance of combating the resurgence of the neo‐​Malthusian mentality.



In 1798, English clergyman Thomas Robert Malthus published _An Essay on the Principle of Population as It Affects the Future Improvement of Society_ , warning that out‐​of‐​control population growth would deplete resources and bring widespread famine. His preferred solution was to decrease birth rates by delaying marriage, but if that proved insufficient, he endorsed extreme measures to slash population growth. To prevent famine, he thought it morally permissible to “court the return of the plague” by having the poor live in swamps and even entertained the idea of banning “specific remedies for ravaging diseases.”24



Malthus’s disregard for the welfare of the poor, in the name of slowing population growth, would prove an enduring part of overpopulation alarmism.



After Malthus died, the Industrial Revolution transformed Western society. It created unprecedented prosperity. Food became more plentiful even as the population grew. Malthusianism seemed disproven. Moreover, increased wealth led to more funding for sanitation, hospitals, and education and a decline in child mortality. That allowed for smaller family sizes and resulted in a decline in fertility.



In the early 20th century, as mortality rates among the poor declined, the pseudoscientific “eugenics” movement emerged. It sought to prevent allegedly inferior people from reproducing. Roughly 70,000 people were forcibly sterilized in the 20th century under eugenic legislation in the United States alone.25 Eugenicists and Malthusians often allied in policymaking, as they both believed that childbearing should be limited for people they deemed undeserving.26



In 1952, population control and family planning activist Margaret Sanger, who was motivated by both eugenics (see her 1920 book, _Women and the New Race_ ) and Malthusianism, gave an address in Mumbai.27 In her speech she claimed that Mahatma Gandhi, the man who led India’s successful campaign for independence from British rule, once told her that he supported limiting couples to four children to combat “overpopulation.” She opined:



As population increases in any given territory, it encroaches upon all natural resources… . _Parenthood should be considered a privilege, not a right_ … . Those who do not have the individual initiative and intelligence to plan and control the size of their families should be assisted, guided, and directed in every way to eliminate the undesirable offspring, who usually contribute nothing to our civilization but use up the energy and resources of the world.28



The year she gave that address, Sanger founded the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), a global nongovernmental family planning organization that went on to provide technical assistance to China’s coercive one‐​child program.



The 1960s and 1970s saw rapid global population growth as economic development and the spread of medicine and scientific knowledge lowered mortality rates. During that time, Malthus’s view became resurgent, replacing eugenics as the primary motivation behind population control policies. In 1960, world population reached 3 billion. By 1975, it reached 4 billion. Rich countries’ governments started to fear that poor countries’ burgeoning populations would deplete the world’s limited resources, according to development economist Betsy Hartmann of Hampshire College.29 Neo‐​Malthusianism was born.



As early as 1959, the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations recommended that aid be given to “developing countries who establish programs to check population growth.”30 In 1966, President Lyndon Johnson made U.S. foreign aid dependent on countries adopting population control policies.31 In 1967, Congress allocated $35 million via the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) for “population programs.” In 1969, President Richard Nixon established the Office of Population within USAID that was dedicated to population control and had a $50 million annual budget.32 In 1977, the head of that office, Reimert Ravenholt, said he hoped to sterilize a quarter of the world’s women.33 The World Bank also made aid contingent on population control, embracing “explicit demographic goals.”34



In 1968, Stanford University biologist Paul Ehrlich published _The Population Bomb_ , a bestseller claiming that without population control the world would run out of food, fresh water, and other resources and predicting mass starvation in the 1970s.35 That year, a representative of the Ford Foundation, a prominent American charity, came out in favor of mandatory “sterilization after an allowable number of births.”36 Also in 1968, a group of academics, politicians, and businesspeople formed the Club of Rome to focus on environmental problems. In 1972, the organization published an influential report, _The Limits to Growth_ , that warned population growth could deplete resources and lead to a “collapse” of global society.37 The warning was based on computer simulations relying on dubious assumptions.



In 1969, the UN launched the UNFPA, which promoted the view that population growth was at the root of environmental problems and poverty, blaming the world’s poorest people in particular. The “bottom billion often impose greater environmental injury than” all the other people “put together,” the UNFPA said in 1992.38 Increasingly prominent neo‐​Malthusians “spoke of a war on population growth,” notes Matthew Connelly, a historian at Columbia University.39 “The war would entail sacrifices, and collateral damage,” Connelly wrote. “Poor countries were pressed to accept population programs and rich countries were expected to pay for them.”40



By the early 1970s, USAID contributed over half the budget of the IPPF and UNFPA and contributed substantial amounts to the Population Council and similarly minded groups.41



Facing pressure from officials in international organizations and rich countries who prioritized the “wooing of national elites” in developing countries to their cause (through concerted campaigns and generous funding), many policymakers in poor countries came around to the view that population growth caused resource scarcity.42 Between 1976 and 1996 neo‐​Malthusian sentiments became more widespread, and the number of governments viewing their citizenry’s fertility levels as “too high” increased from 55 to 87.43 Over the same period, the number of governments pursuing policies to lower the rate of population growth grew from 39 to 71.44 Overwhelmingly, it was poor countries that were expected to curb their populations (see Table 1).



The increasingly popular goal of lowering the population justified coercive policies in the minds of some scholars. In 1970, ecologist Garrett Hardin opined at a meeting convened by the Population Council, “It would be much easier if we have a persuasive campaign first to prepare the way for coercion later.” By 1978, in a survey of Population Association of America members, 34 percent of respondents agreed that “coercive birth control programs should be initiated in at least some countries immediately.”45



By the 1980s, the background document to the International Conference on Family Planning, cowritten by the UNFPA, IPPF, and Population Council, decreed, “When provision of contraceptive information and services does not bring down the fertility level quickly enough to help speed up development, governments may decide to _limit the freedom_ of choice of the present generation.”46 Many people saw coercion as acceptable because the overpopulation problem was deemed so urgent.



In a 1991 interview with the _UNESCO Courier_ , the famed oceanographer Jacques Cousteau opined that humanity should not try to cure diseases because population “must be stabilized and to do that we must eliminate 350,000 people per day.”47 In 1994, at its International Conference on Population and Development, the UN declared that “intensified efforts” were “crucial” to “stabilization of the world population.” In 2002, the UNFPA stated its mission to be “the universally accepted aim of stabilizing world population” to protect “the natural resources on which all life depends,” but its use of the word “stabilization” was misleading because it was a euphemism for _lowering_ the population. Nafis Sadik, a former executive director of the UNFPA, clarified that stabilization meant “stabilization of world population at the lowest possible level, within the shortest period of time.” Groups that declared commitment to stabilizing the population included the Sierra Club, an environmental organization, as well as charitable foundations such as the Ford Foundation, the Hewlett Foundation, the MacArthur Foundation, the Packard Foundation, and the Rockefeller Foundation.48



The prevalence of neo‐​Malthusian doctrine among international organizations, government leaders, and philanthropies became widespread. Through these groups, neo‐​Malthusians exerted moral pressure, sought converts to their cause, and offered financial incentives, rewarding governments in poor countries that enacted population control measures while sounding no alarms if those measures became coercive.



The results were catastrophic. Consider China and India.



In a Helsinki pub in 1978, a Dutch professor, Geert Jan Olsder, and a Chinese mathematician, Song Jian, sat down together for a beer. Olsder mentioned the Club of Rome’s _Limits to Growth_ report and ignited a “messianic fervor” for population control in Jian that would shape China’s future.49 “His eyes lit up,” recalled Olsder, who maintained that “all things equal, [the world] should do the same [as China] and have a one‐​child policy.”50



“During a visit to Europe in 1978, I happened to learn about the application of systems analysis by European scientists to the study of population problems with a great success,” Jian wrote of the encounter, “I was extremely excited … and determined to try the method.”51 He did not stop at _Limits to Growth_. He also read Malthus: “When I was thinking about this, I took Malthus’s book to research the study of population.”52



 _Limits to Growth_ not only promoted Malthus’s idea that a large population creates resource scarcity, but it also promoted the notion that planners could use “systems analysis,” meaning mathematical procedures, to compute a country’s sustainable population size. In 1978, Jian calculated that China’s “ideal” population was between 650 million and 700 million people—or 280 million to 330 million fewer than its population at the time.53



Jian translated the Club of Rome’s central arguments, but none of the circulating critiques of the Club of Rome’s methodology, into Mandarin. He also published his own findings inspired by the Club of Rome’s approach. Jian was highly respected for previous work on ballistic missiles, and he soon persuaded China’s elite of an urgent population crisis necessitating forceful population control. Harvard University anthropologist Susan Greenhalgh’s book _Just One Child: Science and Policy in Deng’s China_ , chronicles Jian’s successful campaign to spread neo‐​Malthusian fears among China’s elite despite opposition from rival government factions.



Population control became an integral part of the country’s “socialist modernization” efforts, culminating in the one‐​child policy. Thus, the neo‐​Malthusian “crisis mentality and the top‐​down, engineering‐​type solutions to the crisis made their way to China,” Greenhalgh wrote.54



Not only was the intellectual impetus for China’s coercive population control policies decidedly neo‐​Malthusian, but organizations such as the UNFPA and IPPF provided support for the one‐​child policy. The UNFPA opened an office in Beijing in 1979 and pledged $50 million for population policy in China over the next four years. It stipulated that the money was in part to fund training for 70,000 family planning workers and an extensive campaign promoting smaller family sizes.55 The Chinese state‐​run association responsible for implementing the one‐​child policy became an IPPF member in 1983.56



International support for the one‐​child policy consisted of both intellectual and moral encouragement as well as financial support that, even when not ostensibly funding coercion, freed resources to support the one‐​child policy. For example, every dollar in aid money spent on training family planning workers or on educational campaigns freed Chinese funds that could go toward nonconsensual procedures. UNFPA grants went to training and equipping the people who would go on to carry out coerced procedures. The UNFPA also paid for many of the computers used to calculate birth quotas.57 Chinese funds that would otherwise have gone to buying computers or teaching family planning workers how to perform abortions and sterilizations were thus made available to fund the one‐​child policy’s enforcement, including the collection of fines and performing coerced abortions and forced sterilizations.



When the minister in charge of the State Family Planning Commission of the People’s Republic of China became one of the inaugural recipients of the UNFPA Population Award in 1983, he said in his acceptance speech that it was “a symbol of the support and encouragement given by the United Nations to China’s family planning program.”58



Then UN Secretary‐​General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar similarly emphasized the UN’s role in helping to mobilize China’s and India’s population control policies. In his speech bestowing the first Population Award, Pérez de Cuéllar said: “The eminent laureates are making a moving acknowledgment of the bonds of common endeavor between their countries and our Organization… . Thanks to international cooperation mobilized by the United Nations, world population growth is slowing.”59



Many in advanced Western countries heaped praise on the one‐​child policy and ignored charges of coercion. “Population experts have praised the program” of the one‐​child policy, noted a 1988 article in the U.S.-based _Journal of Public Health Policy_.60 In 1989, Sadik, then the executive director of the UNFPA, insisted that the Chinese program was “totally voluntary.”61



Even after the turn of the millennium, China continued to receive encouragement from some neo‐​Malthusians in the West for the one‐​child policy. In 2002, Thoraya Ahmed Obaid, then executive director of the UNFPA, praised China’s one‐​child policy, saying, “China, having adopted practical measures in accordance with her current situation, has scored remarkable achievements in population control. In recent years, the UNFPA and China have carried out a series of favorable and positive cooperation.”62



As recently as 2018, New York University law professor Dan Guttman told _Harvard Political Review_ : “With the One‐​Child Policy, China put into effect the single most effective climate change rule in the world… . If you have hundreds of millions of less people [sic], you have that much less resource use.”63



Thus, neo‐​Malthusian doctrine—aided by Jian’s conversion to such thinking and bolstered by moral encouragement and financial support from Western organizations—created and sustained China’s one‐​child policy.



The Chinese government estimates that its one‐​child policy prevented some 400 million births. However, that is disputed; the true number may be lower because China may have experienced the sharp decline in birth rates seen in most countries as they develop economically.64



The policy was first introduced in 1979 and rolled out officially in 1980. It became stricter in the 1990s. However, the exact level of strictness fluctuated. Periods of strict enforcement were called “campaigns” or “shock months” or “shock attacks.”65 For example, 1983 was a particularly strict year for sterilizations (see Figure 1). Not only did the policy’s strictness change over time, but its details varied by locality starting in 1984, when enforcement was decentralized. Afterward, exemptions to the one‐​child policy proliferated, such as some counties allowing rural families a second child.66



While the policy’s enforcement and details varied based on time and place, the policy limited most couples to a single child.



Local administrators faced wage deductions, demotions, or dismissal if their locality failed to follow the one‐​birth‐​per‐​couple quota and received large pay bonuses for performing more abortions and sterilizations.67 Some family planning officials showed lenience out of kindness or in exchange for bribes, but coercion and violence were frequent. In 1981, noncompliant women in Guangdong had their water and electricity cut off.68 “As long as we kept the quotas, we could do anything: destroy homes, property, jail people, even threaten to confiscate people’s children,” one official in Sichuan claimed.69



Single parenthood was illegal, and married couples had to apply for a birth permit before conceiving. In some areas, women could be punished for “not using contraception” even if it did not result in pregnancy and for unwed cohabitation. Women of childbearing age had to undergo periodic mandatory pregnancy tests. In Jiangsu province, women were forced to line up and publicly take urine pregnancy tests twice a month.70



China’s women found some creative ways to overcome the restrictions. One single mother, whose boyfriend died in a car crash when she was four months pregnant, married a gay male friend (and divorced him after she gave birth) so that she could keep her government job without terminating her pregnancy.71 Many mothers had two children in quick succession under the same birth permit, lying that the children were twins. Some women used fertility drugs to improve their odds of birthing twins. China’s one‐​child policy accounts for at least a third of China’s rise in the number of twin births (the rest are a result of later childbearing, as older mothers are more likely to conceive twins).72



China bans medical professionals from assisting with birth surrogacy, a practice that some used to evade the one‐​child policy. In 2009, three surrogate mothers were arrested in Guangzhou and forced to have abortions.73



 **Coerced IUDs, Sterilizations, and Abortions.** In the 1980s, China began mandating that women, after having one child, be fitted with intrauterine devices (IUDs) that are modified to be irremovable without major surgery and be surgically sterilized if they managed to have two children. Many Chinese women considered surgical sterilization “a feared and painful procedure.”74 The most recent UN figures (2017) show that 18.3 percent of Chinese women aged 15–49 had been permanently sterilized and that 34.1 percent had an IUD.75 In comparison, in Hong Kong, where there are no limits on childbearing, only 3.5 percent of women aged 15–49 were permanently sterilized in 2012, the most recent year for which there is data.76



IUDs are typically only effective for a decade, but in China they are effective until menopause and designed to remain implanted indefinitely. In China, women with IUDs are subjected to periodic x‐​rays to ensure the device’s coil is still in place.77 From 1980 to 2014, 324 million Chinese women were fitted with modified IUDs, and 107 million underwent tubal ligation—surgical sterilization—or got their “tubes tied.”78 That averages to 9.5 million modified IUDs and over 3 million tubal ligations annually. Those often occurred without screening for contraindications (conditions or factors suggesting the procedure should not be used because it may be harmful to the patient) or basic health standards.79 As Greenhalgh put it: “The more children a woman succeeded in having, the more likely she was to be labeled a troublemaker and targeted for surgery.”80



As recently as 2010, China held a mass sterilization campaign for close to 10,000 people and detained almost 1,400 relatives of the couples targeted for sterilization to pressure the couples into undergoing the procedure.81



One woman with two children fled her home to avoid a mandated tubal ligation. The family planning team arrived at her house to find only the elderly grandmother of the escaped family. The officials tore down the dwelling, “making the house vanish in just 20 minutes,” a member of the team who now regrets his role in the demolition said. “I told the official in charge, ‘This is too ruthless,’” recalls the former team member. “He replied: ‘It’s policy.’”82



Those who violated the one‐​child policy also faced “excess birth” fines, which were rebranded as “social compensation fees” in 2000. The fines amounted to up to 10 times families’ annual disposable income. In 2013, China collected at least $2.7 billion in these fines.83 By 2015, the last year of the one‐​child policy, approximately 5 percent (800,000) of China’s newborns were third‐​born children in violation of family planning policies whose parents thus incurred fines.84 Since 1990, the average Chinese woman has fewer children than she says would be ideal.85



The poor were often least able to afford the fines. It took some rural families years to pay the fine for a single over‐​quota birth. There are accounts of families selling all their furniture and even their house’s front door to pay the fine.86 “If the couple is too poor to pay, we’ll take things from their house,” explained Huang Denggao, who enforced the population control policy in one village. He would send a team of about 10 enforcers, all “strong healthy young men,” to conduct the pillaging. “If they couldn’t pay, you would confiscate some things of value in the home,” recalled a different former administrator. “Sometimes, we would climb up the roofs and make a hole, to show we meant business, or knock down some windows,” he noted.87



Well over 300 million abortions took place in China over the course of the one‐​child policy, an unknown share of which were coerced.88 In the early years of the policy, the _Wall Street Journal_ reported, some women were “handcuffed, tied with ropes” and sent for forced abortions.89 China bans abortion after six months of pregnancy, but officials often coerced late‐​term abortions past that point without repercussions.90 One former family planning official estimates that she carried out 1,500 abortions, about a third of which were late‐​term.91 A study of Chinese villages found that one in four women who married in the 1970s had an abortion by 1987 and that one in eight had a second‐ or third‐​trimester abortion.92



Consider the firsthand account of Wang Liping, who underwent a forced abortion in 2005 when she was seven months pregnant:



I was stopped by a couple of people on the street… . They asked me to go with them. They … beat me up and dragged me to the … [h]ospital, and forcibly induced labor on me without any examination or my signature… . They and some doctors and nurses pushed me onto the ground… . Then they injected some medicine at my fetus’ location in my belly, and then they roped me onto a sickbed. I could not resist this and nobody came to help me.93



She continued: “My almost‐​fully‐​developed child was born. My child even mournfully cried for some minutes, and later the crying ceased.” The hospital demanded payment for the unwanted procedure.



“I was crying,” Xiao Hong recalls of her forced abortion in 2009 in Guangzhou. “I don’t want to do this,” she told the officials. “But they still dragged me in and injected my belly with a needle,” she recalled.94 She was four months pregnant with twins.



In cases where a coerced late‐​term abortion failed and resulted in a live birth, the unofficial policy was to kill the newborn. One former family planning official recalls skirting the rule: “I would secretly wrap them up and give them to the fathers. I told them to put the child in their bags, as if it was a thing, not a baby, and not to open the bag when they left, so they could get away.”95



Many parents were not so lucky. In 1990, Mao Hengfeng was seven and a half months pregnant when family planning officials restrained her and forcibly injected her with a labor‐​inducing drug. To their surprise, she gave birth to a live child. “The baby was alive; I could hear the baby cry,” Hengfeng claimed. The family planning officials drowned the newborn in a bucket before the mother’s eyes. “They killed my baby … yet I couldn’t do a thing.”96 There are other such accounts of newborn‐​drowning from the 1990s.97



The procedure for failed coerced abortion remained similar over the years. Consider a case from 2011. “They grabbed my wife’s body like they were grabbing a pig, four or five people holding her hands and legs and head, and injected a shot into her belly,” one man recalled to the _Washington Post_ , requesting anonymity.98 The drug failed, and hours after the injection, his seven‐​months‐​pregnant wife gave birth to a living boy, wriggling and crying. The family planning officials refused to let the new parents hold their infant, instead wrapping the newborn boy in a plastic bag. They had him buried on a nearby hill.



 **“Black Children,” Adoption, and Trafficking.** Those who managed to evade coerced abortion gave birth to illegal children known as over‐​quota or out‐​of‐​plan children, popularly called _heihaizi_ or “black children.” Such children lack government registration or _hukou_ , a document needed to attend school, work, marry, and receive a birth permit. There are some 13 million unregistered persons in China.99



The unregistered either must obtain registration with false identities, bribes, personal connections, or the paying of exorbitant fines or else live on the margins of society. Periodic amnesties and registration drives have allowed some to gain registration, but the process is often Kafkaesque. After a 2008 reform to encourage registration, one man spent about three years and $7,000 without success trying to complete paperwork, police interviews, a DNA test, and other ordeals to obtain a _hukou_ for his adopted daughter so that she could attend kindergarten.100



The one‐​child policy also caused a surge in child abandonment and adoption.



Many Chinese gave over‐​quota children to relatives or neighbors following customary adoption practices: a workaround that family planning officials progressively sought to stamp out. In 1991, a national adoption law “codified the regulations used by birth planning officials to prevent and punish people for using adoption to circulate and hide out‐​of‐​plan births,” by making it illegal to give up a healthy child for adoption. It also made it illegal to adopt a child except for those who were both childless and over 35 (lowered to 30 in 1999).101



“Targeted abandonment” emerged, resulting in hundreds of thousands of children being secretly adopted against the law. Parents would leave an over‐​quota child in a basket at night at the doorstep of a family known to want a child. The “abandoners” would set off firecrackers and hide, watching to ensure that the “abandoned” child was taken inside. “Strategic abandonment,” another way of giving children up for adoption, also arose. That involved leaving an infant in a basket filled with baby supplies at a well‐​frequented outdoor location, where someone would soon notice the “abandoned” child. (Secretly arranging adoptions more directly risked punishment by the government, which sometimes labeled such arrangements as child trafficking.) Some staged abandonments took place as recently as 2011.102



Many adoptive families did not meet the restrictive legal criteria for adoption and struggled to keep the child and obtain a hukou. As part of its efforts to quash local adoption, the Chinese government seized many wanted children, placed them in overcrowded orphanages, and promoted international adoption. It was “widely understood” that such seizures were unlikely to be punished.103 International adoptions grew from a few hundred children a year in the early 1990s to a peak of 14,000 children in 2005. More than 120,000 Chinese children were adopted internationally during the one‐​child policy.104



International adoption became lucrative for state‐​run orphanages thanks to the adoption fees. As a result, many over‐​quota children were abducted from birth parents who could not afford the fine and then subsequently adopted out internationally. According to one Hunan villager, birth planning officials used to smash houses to punish noncompliance, but “after [the year] 2000 they haven’t smashed houses. They abduct children.”105



 **Female Infanticide, Sex‐​Selective Abortion, and Skewed Sex Ratio.** Despite the proliferation of targeted and strategic aban­donments, cases of reckless abandonment also swelled. Most abandoned children were girls.



Female infanticide and sex‐​selective abortion are estimated to have caused 50 million “missing” Chinese women.106 Although both female infanticide and sex‐​selective abortion are illegal in China, which instituted stiff penalties for ultrasound sex determination in the 2000s, birth limits have encouraged both practices given a cultural preference for sons over daughters.107 Chinese cultural preference for sons predates the one‐​child policy, and some Chinese immigrant communities in the United States practice sex‐​selective abortion.108 However, the sex ratio became more skewed in areas of China with stricter enforcement of the one‐​child rule than in counties that gave exemptions allowing more families to have a second child. The bribe to an ultrasound technician for prenatal sex determination was around 10 times cheaper than the fine for an over‐​quota child.109



The one‐​child policy helped destabilize China’s sex ratio at birth, which peaked at 121 boys per 100 girls in 2004. It was still at an extreme 119 boys per 100 girls at the time the policy softened to a two‐​child rule in 2016. This imbalance has left many Chinese men without hope of finding a Chinese wife. These men have been labeled “bare branches” because they are seen as dead ends on their family trees. One 2013 study suggested that compared to China’s married men, the nation’s numerous bachelors suffer from higher rates of depression and aggression.110 In 2008, an economic study showed that every 1 percent increase in China’s sex ratio resulted in a 5–6 percent increase in violent and property crime.111



The sex ratio imbalance in China varies substantially. In Tianmen, Hubei, in 2007 there were 176 boys for every 100 girls under age 4.112 Contrastingly, the natural sex ratio at birth, when unaltered by sex‐​selective abortion or infanticide, is on average 105 boys born for every 100 girls.113



Following a big population jump revealed in its 1962 census, India became one of the pioneers of population control in developing countries.114 As neo‐​Malthusianism gained popularity among elected officials in the U.S. government and in international organizations, it inspired those officials to support India in its population control efforts.



The campaign to spread neo‐​Malthusian ideas among India’s policymakers long preceded the Emergency’s forced sterilizations. From the United States, both the Johnson and the Ford administrations encouraged India’s Prime Minister Gandhi to pursue population control more aggressively.115



A now declassified U.S. National Security Council memorandum from 1974 by then secretary of state Henry Kissinger makes explicit the U.S. “aim … for the world to achieve … a two‐​child family on the average … by about the year 2000” and identifies India as a “key country” that the United States, through aid and through UN agencies, should “assist” with the goal of “population moderation.” The memorandum urges “explicit consideration” of “mandatory programs.”116



The memorandum claims that population control is needed to prevent “Malthusian conditions for many regions of the world” and “classic Malthusian cases with famines involving millions of people.” The report quotes the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi claiming that in India “Malthusian pressures are already being felt.”117



Western population professionals thronged to India’s capital in the 1960s, backing surveys, doling out research grants, proselytizing neo‐​Malthusianism, and training many of India’s demographers, doctors, and public health professionals. In conjunction with India’s elite, Western organizations helped design and bankroll policies, such as sterilization targets, aimed at curbing the fertility of the country’s poor.118



By the 1960s, the U.S. government, UNFPA, Ford Foundation, and World Bank accounted for most of the $1.5 billion in annual aid that India received. In 1974, the UNFPA issued its largest grant ever to India, and in 1976 the Swedish Development Authority loaned India $60 million for “family planning,” some of which ultimately funded coerced procedures. Between 1972 and 1980 the World Bank loaned India $66 million for “population control.”119 Upon returning from a visit to India in 1976 during the Emergency, then World Bank president Robert McNamara declared, “At long last, India is moving to effectively address its population problem,” noting without alarm coercive policies including, in his words, “compulsory abortion” and “sterilization laws.”120



The Population Council sent Sheldon Segal, the head of its biomedical division, to New Delhi, where he served as personal adviser to Indian Armed Forces Lt. Col. B. L. Raina, India’s director of family planning. In 1969, the former advocated sex‐​selective abortion as a means of population control despite no political support for it at the time. The Ford Foundation soon allocated $63,563 to the All‐​India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS), a prestigious public medical college, on top of earlier grants of $1.7 million and Rockefeller Foundation grants of $1.5 million. In 1975, AIIMS presented research that advanced sex‐​selective abortion as a means of population control, and there are reports of doctors encouraging pregnant patients to abort female fetuses because “population control was deemed so urgent.”121



The Western‐​funded research stated, “In India cultural and economic factors make the parents desire a son, and in many instances the couple keeps on reproducing just to have a son. Prenatal determination of sex would put an end to this unnecessary fecundity. There is of course the tendency to abort the fetus if it is female.” Outrage among India’s feminists led to the banning of prenatal sex determination at state hospitals in 1978.122 It was banned entirely in 1994.



When Gandhi declared the Emergency and suspended civil liberties, her son Sanjay—although he held no official title and his power was largely unconstitutional—seized the opportunity to embark on a compulsory sterilization program to fight “overpopulation.”123 He ignored the fact that this policy violated Indian law.



Gandhi, in her acceptance statement for the UNFPA Population Award in 1983, gushed that the family planning officials of her nation “will be encouraged that this world body has recognized India’s efforts in one of the most difficult areas of social engineering.”124



She also said, regarding the birth rate, “The goal is to reduce the national average [from 35 per thousand] to 21 per thousand by the year 2000. The task is not easy. Millions of couples, many of them illiterate, must be persuaded.”125 That number is revealing because it shows that her goal was to reach the target birth rate that professional population planners deemed appropriate. While she said that she favored using persuasion to attain this goal, the suspension of civil liberties and censorship during the Emergency meant that her son Sanjay Gandhi was able to force officials to conduct compulsory sterilizations with no legal authorization. Public outrage over the policy contributed to a stunning electoral defeat for Indira Gandhi in 1977. She returned to power in 1980, when the Janata coalition that defeated her in 1977 proved unstable, but when she returned she stated that she had never authorized coercion, and coerced sterilizations came to be widely seen as an excess of the Emergency.126



During the Emergency, some 11 million Indians were sterilized, and an additional 1 million women were fitted with IUDs (see Figure 2).127 An astonishing 6.2 million Indians were sterilized in 1976 alone—1.7 million in September.128 Some 2,000 Indians died from botched operations.129 Demographer and economic analyst Ashish Bose estimated that massively increased sterilization targets and coercive tactics accounted for approximately 7 million undesired sterilizations.130 By late 1973, there were already 14.3 million sterilized persons in India.131



Sanjay Gandhi spearheaded the Emergency’s mass sterilization campaign. Young and ambitious, he wished to bolster his image by implementing a national program. For his focus he chose four policies, one of which was “Family Planning—for a prosperous future.”132 He massively increased sterilization targets, particularly for the high birth rate states of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, and Rajasthan.133 The majority of the victims of forced sterilization during the Emergency were men.



Some positive monetary incentives were offered to encourage sterilization, but negative incentives also flourished.134 In Madhya Pradesh, irrigation water was withheld from village fields unless sterilization quotas were met. Teachers in Uttar Pradesh had to submit to sterilization or forfeit a month’s salary, and health and family planning workers in that state had pay withheld until they met sterilization quotas.135 In one incident in Uttar Pradesh, officials seized a man’s buffaloes and threatened to take his land and house if he did not get sterilized.136 In 1976, Maharashtra state mandated sterilization for couples with more than two children (although that was poorly enforced).137 Accounts abound of state hospitals refusing to treat unsterilized patients and of patients undergoing treatment for unrelated illnesses being sterilized without being informed.138



“If some excesses appear, don’t blame me,” explained the director of family planning in Mumbai. “You must consider it something like a war. There could be a certain amount of misfiring out of enthusiasm. There has been pressure to show results. Whether you like it or not, there will be a few dead people.”139



The schools acted as well. A professor in New Delhi recalls: “In the Emergency, the pressure was on all teachers to get operated and produce cases [of sterilization] from their students. The government [would] withdraw their salaries if they did not agree.” A man who was still a student during the Emergency recalled: “In schools they used to make announcements that those whose parents did not get sterilized would not pass exams… . The Sanskrit master went to my father and told him to go for the operation or else he would fail me and my studies would be ruined.” His father refused at first but eventually relented. “All those whose parents had got sterilized were passed and all those whose parents had refused were failed,” the son remembered.140



To meet the high targets, many officials resorted to coercion with police assistance. “People were rounded up at random, from the streets, the tea shop, the bazaars, and taken to the family planning camps to be sterilized… . They would grab people by force, take them into the tent, make them sign papers,” one witness recalled. “If the police get you, you can’t do much.” Some people resorted to hiding in forests or sugarcane fields to avoid the police and forced sterilization.141



“In those days they would take you to the camp, ask how many children you had, then ignore it and sterilize you anyway,” claimed a different witness. “This sort of thing happened mostly in crowded places and main roads. In fact my employer even advised me to stay indoors as much as possible.”142



Through the denial of permits, government officials pressured private businesses to help the sterilization drives. A factory worker recalls, “My boss told me to get sterilized so that he could get the license” to operate his business, which had been made contingent on sterilization of employees.143



Preoccupation with meeting sterilization targets, rather than actual reduction of birth rates, often made public health workers indifferent to the age, fecundity, and other characteristics of those sterilized. Among the victims of forced sterilization during the Emergency were young people, childless people, people past their reproductive years, people whose spouses had been sterilized, hospital patients, jail inmates, and homeless people.144 There are even accounts of sterilized people undergoing the procedure for a second time.145



During the Emergency’s beautification drives, “slum” neighborhoods were razed and an estimated 700,000 people were displaced. Granting of new housing plots for the displaced was contingent upon sterilization, forcing people whose homes the government destroyed to choose between sterilization and homelessness. It was also possible to obtain housing plots by “motivating others” to undertake sterilization (usually with a bribe), thus sparing oneself. In an area in Delhi known as Turkmen’s Gate, local resistance to the sterilization drive and demolitions resulted in authorities killing at least 12 resisters, with some sources estimating a much higher death toll.146



Those who obtained new plots without sterilization often faced eviction. As one man put it: “It was impossible to live here without getting sterilized because you would be evicted. Nobody liked the idea of sterilization. But people didn’t have any choice.”147

While the worst human rights abuses of neo‐​Malthusianism are in the past, troubling policies inspired by those ideas persist. China and, to a much lesser extent, India continue to provide examples.



China relaxed its one‐​child policy into a two‐​child policy in 2016 and now encourages married couples to have a second child, but having three or more children is still illegal. In some provinces, women must still undergo periodic state‐​mandated pregnancy tests, would‐​be parents must seek birth permits, and single motherhood remains illegal. Those who fail to comply may face exorbitant fines, job termination, detention, coerced sterilization, or coerced abortion. While a far cry from the abuses of the past, even in democratic India half the country’s population lives in states that penalize families with more than two children, and political representation is apportioned in a way that punishes states with high birth rates.



China has continued to limit family sizes through violence in recent years. In 2012, a case of forced abortion in China garnered international attention. It involved a woman who could not afford the fine for a second child and so was physically restrained and injected with an abortifacient when she was seven months pregnant.148 Graphic photographs of the incident went viral on the website Weibo, China’s version of Twitter, sparking widespread outrage.



Commenting on the event, Weibo’s chief editor Hu Xijin wrote, “I strongly oppose the barbarous forced abortion,” but he maintained that overall the one‐​child policy was positive, writing, “the world resources cannot afford to feed a China with billions of people.”149 His words echoed the neo‐​Malthusian reasoning behind China’s family size limits.



So did a _Global Times_ op‐​ed about the incident. The English‐​language Chinese newspaper (under the control of the state‐​run _People’s Daily_ ) concluded, “China’s 1.3 billion population is competing for global resources. The world cannot afford a larger China… . forced termination of late‐​term pregnancies must be condemned and banned. But it shouldn’t be a reason for refuting the whole policy, which has freed China from the burden of an extra 400 million people.”150



Although China has since relaxed its one‐​child policy to a two‐​child policy, coercion still occurs. The two‐​child policy was passed into law in December 2015 and went into effect on the first day of 2016. Some pregnant women reportedly attempted to postpone the delivery of their second child until after January 1, 2016, to avoid paying fines.151 The softening of the policy occurred despite backroom lobbying by former state counselor Song Jian, whose _Limits to Growth_ -inspired models formed the basis of the one‐​child policy. Still, Jian delayed the reform for over a decade. (Jian’s views remained unwavering: in a 2011 essay, he called zero population growth “the ultimate goal of human society.”) High‐​ranking reformers had been trying to overturn the one‐​child policy since at least the year 2000.152



The remaining limitations that the two‐​child policy impose are still justified in neo‐​Malthusian terms. “The tensions between population and resources and environment will not fundamentally change,” noted China’s State Council in its national population development plan for 2016–2030, released in 2017. The plan specifies, according to state‐​run news agency _Xinhua_ , that the government must continue to implement the “two‐​child policy to promote balanced population development.”153



The option of a second child came too late for many. Of the approximately 90 million women of reproductive age with a previous delivery who newly qualified for a second birth, half were over the age of 40. And 60 percent were over the age of 35, when female fertility sharply declines.154



Much reporting on China now refers to travesties, such as forced abortions, in the past tense, as though they occurred only under the one‐​child policy, but that is inaccurate.155 Families with three or more children still must pay a “social compensation fee,” which can reach 10 times a person’s annual disposable income. In 2018, some provinces still fined women who failed to undergo periodic state‐​mandated pregnancy tests even if they were not pregnant. Couples in some provinces were required to seek approval and register before a child was even conceived.156 Many local governments have systems in place to monetarily reward those who report illegal births.157



Unmarried women are still not allowed even one child in many counties. Unwed Chinese mothers must marry within 60 days of a child’s birth or pay the “social compensation fee.” Those who fail to comply with family size limits may also face job termination or detention. However, the most egregious forms of coercion fall into two broad categories: coerced sterilization and coerced abortion.



It is difficult to quantify the extent of human rights abuses, but a government report from Hunan province indicated that county authorities had carried out 19 sterilizations and 67 abortions just in the winter of 2017 and collected nearly 2.76 million yuan (approximately $437,000 U.S. dollars) in ‘‘social compensation fees.”158 In February 2019, one couple in Chengwu county, Shandong province, who could not afford a fine of $9,570 for violating family planning regulations had their life savings (around $3,000) seized.159



 **Coerced Abortion in China Today.** In 2016, China had an abortion rate of about 28 per 1,000 women aged 15–49. That was more than double the abortion rate for the United States in 2015, which was 12 per 1,000 women aged 15–44. There were over 9 million abortions in China in 2016 after the two‐​child policy replaced the one‐​child policy. That figure shows no meaningful decline from the figures for 2015 and 2014, when the one‐​child policy was still in effect (see Figure 3).160



An unknown share of those abortions were coerced. The U.S. State Department’s Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2018 found “coerced abortions and sterilizations” continue under China’s revised Population and Family Planning Law. The report relates that forced abortions were carried out in the provinces of Hubei, Hunan, and Liaoning and that forced abortion protocols remained on the books in Guizhou and Yunnan.161



Migrant workers may be particularly vulnerable. The U.S. report claimed, “In localities with large populations of migrant workers, officials specifically targeted migrant women to ensure they did not exceed birth limitations.”162



China “continued to enforce compliance with family planning policies using methods including heavy fines, job termination, detention, and abortion,” according to the U.S. Congressional‐​Executive Commission on China’s 2018 report. The 2019 report had similar findings: “Chinese authorities threatened or imposed punishments on families for illegal pregnancies and births, using methods including heavy fines, job termination, and abortion.”163



Also noted in the 2018 report are official statements from local government authorities that women are compelled to undergo the “four procedures” (IUD insertion, sterilization, first trimester abortion, and mid‐ to late‐​term abortion) in Gu County in Shanxi province, Guichi District in Anhui province, Yunyang District in Hubei province, Wolong District in Henan province, and Dongshahe Township in Shandong province. The 2019 report notes that in Dalu township in Hainan province, local authorities carried out 264 of the “four procedures” in 2018 and that local authorities had a success rate of 83 percent in detecting pregnancies within the first six months of the gestation period and reached 100.5 percent of their family planning work targets.164



The _Wall Street Journal_ reported that in March 2018 a high school teacher in Tangshan municipality in Hebei province who already had two children aborted a pregnancy after being threatened with job dismissal and a fine.165 In March 2019, authorities in Yunfu municipality in Guangdong province reportedly dismissed another public school teacher from her job for giving birth to a third child in violation of the two‐​child policy. She had been threatened on 14 separate occasions to terminate her pregnancy or face losing her job.166



“A third baby is not allowed so we are renting a home away from our village. The local government carries out pregnancy examinations every three months. If we weren’t in hiding, they would have forced us to have an abortion,” a Chinese father of three told the BBC in 2016. In response to the question, “If they had come for your wife, to carry out this forced abortion, would it have been possible to resist? Could you have refused?,” he answered: “No we cannot resist. There would be many family planning officers to take us away. They would put us in a van, directly to the family planning office, for the abortion.”167



The BBC investigation showcased an official who said that his district requires women of childbearing age to report for two ultrasounds per year and that if a woman is found to be pregnant “out of quota,” then she “will be advised accordingly.” The same official admitted that he and his colleagues have in the past “kidnapped, drugged and forcibly operated on women.”168



 ** _Minorities Targeted for Coerced Abortion._** Many recent testimonies of forced abortion involve minorities such as ethnic Kazakhs and Uyghurs, a Turkic ethnic group. An ethnic Kazakh named Kuliziya Mogudong (sometimes transliterated as Gulzira Mogdin) was forced to have an abortion at five months of pregnancy in February 2018 in Xinjiang. “They ordered me to get an abortion. They said I couldn’t have the babies because I’ve had two others and that a third was not allowed,” she told _NPR_.169 “I told them no, I’m not willing to do it.” Then the authorities threatened to jail her brother unless she complied.170 Mogudong alleged that she was one among “several” ethnic minority women in China who have recently been forced to have abortions under the two‐​child policy.171



Similarly, the ethnically Uyghur Abduqadir family fled China to Turkey in 2017 to avoid a forced abortion.172 Another Uyghur, Kalbinur Tursun, also fled to Turkey to avoid an unwanted abortion in 2016.173 Yet another Uyghur named Gulnaz Uighur said that she fled China after her neighbor died from a botched forced abortion at six months of pregnancy. She alleged that even after the one‐​child policy was softened into the two‐​child policy, “forced abortion was a common thing” in Uyghur communities.174



 **Coerced Sterilization in China Today.** In 2017, the government offered to surgically remove IUDs for couples who qualify to have a second child under the two‐​child policy.175 Roughly 18 million women with IUDs are eligible. After the birth of a second child, the mothers would once again be fitted with modified IUDs that cannot be removed without another major surgical operation.



Surgical removal can be risky, particularly for woman who have had an IUD for a long time—as many of China’s women have. The IUDs often become “embedded in the uterine wall,” according to a gynecologist at Beijing United Family Hospital. “That makes it much more difficult to remove.” Surgical removal may result in bleeding, infection, and injury to the uterus.176



One woman who tried to have her IUD removed, Ai Xiaoming, said that she, like many other Chinese women, had never been advised of potential complications after getting her IUD.177 Her surgery failed, and she had to have a hysterectomy (i.e., removal of the uterus).



Over the years, many Chinese women have come to hate the practically irremovable IUDs, which act as de facto sterilization. The mass implantation of IUDs equaled “involuntary, forced acts of mutilation,” Han Haoyue, a popular columnist, wrote in a Weibo post shared nearly 3,000 times.178 That is a lot of shares for a post openly criticizing the government, which tightly monitors Weibo.179



 ** _Minorities Targeted for Coerced Sterilization._** In the Xinjiang region, minorities such as Uyghurs have been subject to strict enforcement of birth limits and mandated sterilization, particularly over the past four years, according to an Associated Press investigation released in June 2020. As Figure 4 shows, sterilization rates in that region have skyrocketed. Those who defy birth limits are often sent to internment camps.180 Members of the minority Uyghur population have also alleged that they are the targets of recent forced sterilization via unwanted drug injections during internment. “We [prisoners] had to stick our arms out through a small opening in the [prison] door” to receive shots, claimed Gulbahar Jalilova, a former Uyghur detainee. “We soon realized that after our injections that we didn’t get our periods anymore” as they had become sterile against their wishes.181 The kind of drug that was used is unknown.



Another former Uyghur detainee, Mehrigul Tursun, told a similar story of having been unknowingly sterilized when she was forcibly administered a cocktail of drugs while imprisoned in 2017.182 After regaining her freedom, she moved to the United States, where a medical examination confirmed that she had been irreversibly sterilized.



Tursunay Ziyawudun, yet another former Uyghur detainee, from Xinjiang, similarly reported that camp authorities regularly “forced [Uyghur women] to take medicine” that stopped their menstrual cycles and “took women to the hospital and operated on them so that they no longer could have children.”183



The coercive policies of India’s past were ultimately punished at the ballot box, with Indira Gandhi experiencing a resounding defeat in the 1977 election partly due to the unpopularity of Sanjay’s population control policies. Yet even in a democracy such as India, where inclusive political institutions offer protection against oppression, problematic policies persist. While coercion is illegal, disincentives firmly remain part of India’s family planning policies. Families are encouraged with a mix of positive and negative incentives to undergo sterilization surgery and have no more than two children.184 And malapportionment of political representation penalizes states with relatively high birth rates.



However, in the past two decades, the Indian government has also boasted that it is the best country in the world for multinational corporations to invest in because it is enjoying a huge demographic dividend (a rise in the proportion of the workforce in the population). The demographic dividend has been credited as a major driver of economic growth in India.185 On the one hand, India’s boasting of its demographic dividend amounts to an implied reversal of its emphasis on small families with no more than two children. On the other hand, that boast has not led to the cancellation of the many rules and incentives that still follow the neo‐​Malthusian line of thought.



Many Indian policymakers still possess a neo‐​Malthusian mindset. In 2018, 125 members of India’s Parliament signed a writ petition urging President Ram Nath Kovind to implement a nationwide two‐​child policy.186 In August 2019, during his Independence Day address, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi highlighted “the issue of population explosion” and the “consequences of the uncontrolled population growth.”187



The prime minister’s words and the public response to them are revealing. The Indian _Telegraph_ ’s editorial board published a response that questioned the prime minister’s choice of words doubting large families’ patriotism, not least because those words could be interpreted as a dog whistle meant to insult Muslim Indians. Nonetheless, the editorial board agreed that “the burden of population on India’s … resources and environment has been crushing.”188 The piece concluded that what “India needs is a united and robust response to check population growth” that uses less inflammatory language.



The ideas of neo‐​Malthusianism remain prominent in India’s educational system. “We are taught from school onwards that India’s population is a big problem, and we need to control it,” wrote reporter Amit Varma in the _Times of India_ in 2019.189 Supporting his contention, a 2019 survey found that 39 percent of Indians consider “overpopulation” to be among the top three most pressing environmental issues facing their country.190 Varma also decried alleged “immoral coercion still carried out on poor people across the country.”



Likewise, Indian journalist Swaminathan Aiyar has noted that “India remains a country where a great many people, especially in the middle class, are convinced that force is needed to reduce fertility. This is plain wrong and ignores evidence the world over.”191



As an example, a petition filed in 2018 by Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay, the Delhi leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (or BJP, one of India’s two major political parties), urged more action on population control and a nationwide two‐​child policy. He claimed that “every year population is increasing but the amount of natural resources to sustain this population are diminishing.”192 That petition joined four similar petitions already in the court system advocating for a nationwide two‐​child policy.



Neo‐​Malthusian thinking is not limited to a particular political party in India but has bipartisan appeal. Jitin Prasada, an influential politician in India’s other major political party, the Indian National Congress, stated in September 2019: “There should be a nationwide discussion on population control. A law should be made in this regard… . From the environment to water, almost every natural resource is under stress.”193



 **Parliamentary Representation.** India apportions political representation in a way that acts as an indirect penalty for large families. In 2001, India extended a freeze on seat allocation between states for the Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament, until 2026. The freeze was first enacted in 1976, during the Emergency, when India’s 42nd Amendment Act decreed that seat allocation between states for the Lok Sabha would be based on the 1971 census figures until the year 2001. “The rationale was that family planning was a national imperative and states would have little incentive to pursue it if success meant their share of political power would go down,” as their relative populations decreased, according to the _Times of India_.194 The choice to extend the freeze until 2026 was similarly intended to reward states with low birth rates while punishing states with high birth rates and high population growth by lessening their political representation.



Consider Table 2. If political representation were to reflect the changing demographics of India’s states rather than the figures in the 1971 Census, then in 2019 the state of Uttar Pradesh would have had 13 more seats in the Lok Sabha than it did, while the state of Tamil Nadu would have had 10 fewer seats than it did.



Aiyar has pointed out that the seat apportionment freeze has had the effect of unfairly reducing political representation of Indians in the country’s poorest states.195 Birth rates tend to be higher in poor areas because, as Aiyar notes, in communities with high infant mortality rates it can make sense to have many children. (In such circumstances, having many children increases the likelihood of having at least one child who survives to adulthood.)



While reduced political representation is unlikely to incentivize families to have fewer children and is thus an ineffective form of incentivization, diminishing political representation for people in states with high birth rates is nonetheless a form of punishment for large families.



 ** _Family Size Limits._** Roughly half of India’s population lives in states with some form of penalty pressuring families to have no more than two children. Today, 30 percent of Indian women say they want to have more than two children, but India is combating that with various disincentives.196 The U.S. State Department notes:



Policies penalizing families with more than two children … created pressure on women with more than two children to use contraception, including permanent methods such as sterilization, or even termination of subsequent pregnancies. Certain states maintained government reservations for government jobs and subsidies for adults with no more than two children and reduced subsidies and access to health care for those who have more than two.197



A 2018 report from the Human Rights Law Network, a collective of Indian lawyers and activists, identified the seven states that penalize families with more than two children as Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Bihar, Gujarat, and Uttarakhand.198



“I was offered a job as a guard at the Rajasthan Legislative Assembly,” recalled Ummed Singh Rathore in a segment published in January 2020, speaking to _France24_ , the French state‐​owned international news television network.199 He continued: “But later the director told me that the offer had been revoked. I asked why.” The hiring director informed him that Rajasthan bans people with more than two children from working for the government. Rathore said: “I have three children, but I didn’t do anything wrong. This law is wrong. Why does the government interfere in our private life?”



 **Family Size Limits and India’s Missing Girls.** While sex‐​selective abortions and female infanticide (the latter of which has become rarer) are illegal in India and have a long history predating population control policies, policies pressuring families to have fewer children contribute to the persistence of those two practices in India, as they have in China. A 2018 study published in _The Lancet_ found that in India there are on average 239,000 annual deaths of girls under the age of five that occur specifically due to gender discrimination and that neglect of female children accounts for half the country’s “missing girls” (or estimated deficit of women given the low proportion of females in the population).200



Laws preventing people with more than two children from serving on _panchayat_ councils harm the sex ratio. ( _Panchayat_ councils are elected local government assemblies.) Economists S. Anukriti from Boston College and Abhishek Chakravarty of the University of Essex looked at seven Indian states—Rajasthan, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Maharashtra—in which such laws were in effect between 1992 and 2005. Using data from the National Family Health Survey and District‐​Level Household Survey, the researchers found a marked decline in the number of women in the general population reporting third births exactly one year after the new policy was announced. Laws enacted in the late 1990s and 2000s restricting political eligibility to candidates with a maximum of two children severely affected the sex ratio in India, the research found.201



Another study, conducted by scientist Nirmala Buch between 2001 and 2004 and published in 2005, also explored the consequences of policies punishing families with more than two children by disqualifying them from serving on _panchayat_ councils in five states: Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, and Rajasthan.202 Buch’s study found that the two‐​child policy in those states resulted in an increase in cases of desertion, neglect, and death of female infants, illegal sex‐​selective abortions of female fetuses, and the giving away of female children for adoption. The study also documented cases of men deserting wives with over‐​quota pregnancies or pressuring wives into having abortions to maintain their _panchayat_ seats.



Some question those findings. Aiyar, for example, notes that barely 1 percent of Indians have ever run for public office. He argues that only marginal effects can flow from laws limiting political participation for people with more than two children.203



Although India has launched campaigns to discourage sex‐​selective abortion and prenatal sex determination has been outlawed since 1994, the law is weakly enforced.204 (Enforcement of laws is generally weak in India.205) A 2007 BBC investigation easily found four doctors in South Delhi willing to conduct sex determination via ultrasound. Many clinics justify flouting the law by maintaining that they are “fending off population growth by helping parents meet government targets.”206 According to the _Times of India_ , despite the illegality of sex‐​selective abortion, a woman undergoing three such abortions, typically coerced by her husband or in‐​laws to ensure a male child, is “very common.”207



State‐​based two‐​child policies have increased sex‐​selective abortions and neglect of female children, contributing to a skewed sex ratio. In Uttarakhand, one of the provinces that penalizes families with more than two children, not a single female child’s birth was registered in an area covering 132 villages over the course of three months in 2019, sparking a criminal investigation into suspected occurrences of illegal sex‐​selective abortions or, less likely, female infanticide.208



Motivated in part by looming intergenerational fiscal concerns as China’s population ages, the government may soon end coercive restrictions on childbearing. China must follow through on its apparent intentions and end its childbearing limits while also refraining from instituting any new coercive population policies. The latter includes resisting the temptation to use coercion to try to _raise_ birth rates with _minimum_ birth quotas. The country should not trade one kind of coercion for another.



 **Ending Childbearing Limits.** There are many hopeful signs that China is moving toward ending its two‐​child limit. In 2019, its birth rate reached a 60‐​year low, lending strength to those in China’s government who argue that the country should not be concerned about overpopulation.209 China’s National People’s Congress makes no mention of coercive family planning policies in the draft of a new Civil Code up for consideration, and an official suggested to attendees at a United Nations conference that China wouldn’t set population limits in the future.210



Several restrictions have already been loosened. For example, many local governments across China have recently ended fines for unwed motherhood. Having her child “would not have been possible a year earlier,” an unmarried new mother named Yue Li, who lives in Guangdong province where fines for single mothers were recently lifted, told _Bloomberg News_ in 2019. “The penalties would have cost tens of thousands of yuan!” she said.211



Yet bureaucratic inertia and local officials’ desire to obtain revenue contribute to the continuation of the two‐​child limit, notes Yi Fuxian, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.212 Even as the national government now worries about _falling_ birth rates, many local governments “hungry for revenue” continue to fine couples for illegal births, reported the Associated Press in February 2019.213 “The low birthrate has everyone on edge, yet the local governments care only about collecting fees,” according to Chinese journalist Jin Wei.214



Eliminating _all_ fines for extra‐​quota births (thus rendering the quotas symbolic) or, preferably, ending the two‐​child limit itself, would be a logical next step in loosening restrictions on childbearing and would take away the monetary incentive for coercive limiting of family sizes.



 **Preventing Future Coercive Population Policies.** Some even fear that as birth rates fall and China faces a shrinking workforce, it may swing to the _opposite_ extreme and implement minimum birth quotas using the same infrastructure that is being used to limit childbearing. China’s National Health and Family Planning Commission, according to 2006 figures, employed about 500,000 people in 82,350 regional offices across the country.215



In March 2018, China merged its National Health and Family Planning Commission into a new agency called the National Health Commission. The removal of “family planning” from the name signaled reorientation toward other health issues related to the aging population and decreased focus on enforcement of childbearing limits.216 Although deprioritized, enforcing childbearing limits is nonetheless a role of the agency and has not yet been eliminated. The agency justifies its resistance to eliminating coercive family planning rules by citing China’s Constitution, which says, “The state promotes family planning so that population growth may fit the plans for economic and social development.”217



Even if the two‐​child policy ends, future policymakers may give in to the temptation of using an expansive family planning bureaucracy to coercively engineer the size of the country’s population (whether to grow or shrink it). To lessen that temptation, China should amend its Constitution to eliminate the reference to regulating population growth and should further downsize the number of civil servants working on population policy within the National Health Commission and decrease the budget for population policy within the commission. Many of those civil servants could be redirected to other projects within the National Health Commission or encouraged to find employment in the private sector.



While a return to the sanctioned forced sterilizations of the Emergency would be politically unfeasible, Indian support for disincentives for large families remains. Neo‐​Malthusian thinking is still widespread, as demonstrated by Prime Minister Modi’s August 2019 remarks about a “population explosion.” However, Modi and his cabinet colleagues have also repeatedly hailed the advantages of India’s demographic dividend. University of Cambridge economist Joan Robinson famously said that whatever was true of India, the opposite was also true. This is reflected in the huge variations in different parts of a very diverse country, leading to countless internal contradictions that can make nonsense of many categorical theses.



Neo‐​Malthusian thinking certainly is still embedded in many of the government’s policies. But recent boasting about the demo­graphic dividend reflects a Robinsonian internal contradiction, as the country takes pride in high fertility even as it maintains policies to combat it. Anti‐​Muslim bias is another confounding factor influencing population policy while being distinct from neo‐​Malthusian concerns. Pride in the demographic dividend will hopefully help to erode and end neo‐​Malthusian rhetoric and policies.



 **Population and Revenue‐​Sharing among India’s States.** India’s Finance Commission recommends how taxes that are levied by the central government should be shared between the central government and different states, based on several criteria, including population size. In the 1970s, the wealthier southern states, which had lower birth rates, complained that the population size criterion penalized low‐​fertility states and rewarded the northern states for their perceived failures in population control. Successive Finance Commissions based their revenue‐​sharing formulae on state populations listed in the 1971 census and not the latest available figures to avoid such penalization.



However, the 14th Finance Commission, which was appointed in 2013, eroded the advantage of the low‐​fertility states somewhat. The 15th Finance Commission, which was appointed in 2017, went further and abolished references to the 1971 census altogether. To assuage outraged southern states, the commission also included some benefits for states with lower birth rates. On balance, however, the high‐​fertility northern states gained enormously in revenue. That represented a substantial rollback of the traditional neo‐​Malthusian policy pursued by the Indian government.



Partisan politics also played a role in the government’s decisionmaking. The BJP is popular in the high‐​fertility northern states but has almost no support in some of the southern states. By switching from the 1971 population levels to the 2011 levels, the BJP greatly increased the revenue share of the northern states and reduced the revenue share of southern states.



Neo‐​Malthusian thinking has certainly dominated Indian policy for decades. But the rise of the BJP has introduced new trends. Many BJP stalwarts have called for Hindus to have larger families to stop the Muslim share of the population from rising. In India, Muslims tend to have larger families and so their share of India’s population has risen from 9.8 percent in the 1951 census to 14.2 percent in the 2011 census. Prime Minister Modi has sought to bring attention to this trend. An official slogan to encourage smaller families in India since the 1970s has been “hum do, hamare do,” meaning “we are two and have two children.”218 Noting that some Muslim men have four wives, Modi quipped derisively in a 2002 speech that the equivalent Muslim slogan was “hum paanch, hamare pachees,” meaning “we are five and have 25 children.”219



India needs to build on the momentum of successive finance commissions rolling back neo‐​Malthusian biases in revenue sharing by abandoning neo‐​Malthusian biases in all policy areas, irrespective of partisan interests.



 **Two‐​Child Policy Gaining Momentum.** Assam will become the latest Indian state to disqualify people with more than two children from holding government jobs beginning in January 2021, and several recent proposals calling for a national two‐​child policy present the possibility that the country may move to adopt such a policy nationwide.220 In January 2020, Mohan Bhagwat, the head of a prominent nationalist volunteer organization called the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), which has 5–6 million members including Prime Minister Modi, said that the RSS would shift its focus to promoting a national two‐​child policy.221 As noted, Indian Muslims tend to have more children than Hindus. So, a penalty on large families is a not‐​so‐​subtle attempt by the Hindu nationalist BJP to discriminate against Muslims. Clearly, neo‐​Malthusianism is not the sole motive behind the policy, even when neo‐​Malthusian language is invoked as a justification for the policy.



Consider the constitutional amendment bill introduced February 7, 2020, by Shri Anil Desai, a member of the upper house of India’s Parliament and of a regional political party allied with the BJP. The bill proposes to promote small families with a mix of positive and negative incentives. The bill is justified with neo‐​Malthusian reasoning, claiming that a “population explosion will cause many problems for our future generations.” It goes on to read: “Today, there is … a need to … discourage [couples] from producing more children by withdrawing tax concessions, _imposing heavy taxes and by making other punitive provisions for violations_.”222



A distinct but likeminded proposal is the Population Regulation Bill introduced July 12, 2019, by Shri Rakesh Sinha, a Parliament member who also belongs to the BJP and is an associate professor at the University of Delhi. That bill would grant various benefits to couples who undergo sterilization after two children and enact punitive measures on families with more than two children. That bill is also justified with neo‐​Malthusian reasoning, reading in part: “Given the limited … ecological and economic resources at hand, it has become an urgent need to do objective analysis and intervene to plan the process of demographic change for the coming generation[s] of future India.”223



 **Against the Two‐​Child Policy.** The fears of “population explosion” in India are misplaced. The country’s total fertility rate in 2017 (the most recent year for which there is data) was 2.24 births per woman and falling, so it is on track to soon reach the replacement fertility level of 2.1 births per woman.224 If India follows the pattern seen in other countries as they grow richer, the fertility rate will continue to fall until it is beneath the replacement level. In other words, India is on target to stabilize or decrease its population without any need for punitive measures.



Enacting laws that punish, to varying degrees, large families is not only pointless but may further exacerbate the problems that the government is attempting to combat of illegal sex‐​selective abortion and, less commonly, infanticide. Therefore, recent enthusiasm among some policymakers and activists for the introduction of punitive measures for large families is misplaced. India’s government should avoid enacting a nationwide two‐​child policy, and individual Indian states with two‐​child policies should repeal those policies.



The government should also rethink its rhetoric in light of the recently established advantages of a demographic dividend, notes Aiyar.225 Fertility remains high in states like Uttar Pradesh Bihar and Jharkhand. Until recently, many neo‐​Malthusians criticized those states for allegedly threatening India’s future prosperity, but those states will become important providers of the country’s labor force. Rising living standards have already reduced fertility rates in most Indian states to below replacement level, and many Indians now view the high‐​fertility states as serving an unanticipated national purpose. No disincentives should be implemented to discourage small families, but all disincentives for large families should be lifted.



 **Correcting Malapportionment.** In 2026, instead of again extending the freeze first instituted during the Emergency that has resulted in malapportionment of political representation in the Lok Sabha, India’s lower house of Parliament should reflect the country’s changing demographics.



A central tenet of democratic representation is the notion of “one person, one vote.” The freeze violates that tenet by valuing a person’s vote according to the relative fecundity of those residing in the same state, amplifying the voices of those living in low‐​population growth states and devaluing those living in states with high birth rates.



Furthermore, reducing political representation for high birth rate states is an ineffective form of incentivization that is vanishingly unlikely to alter any individual family’s behavior.



Malapportionment of political representation intended to punish states with high birth rates is both undemocratic and pointless and should be corrected.



Every family deserves the right to decide for themselves how many children, if any, they wish to have, free of government meddling. Neo‐​Malthusian concerns, both historically and today, have been used to justify restricting that right, sometimes violently. By punishing those who diverge from an alleged ideal family size determined by technocrats, neo‐​Malthusian policies in China and (to a lesser extent) India both encroach upon personal freedom and contribute to the problems of sex‐​selective abortion and female infanticide, thus skewing the global sex ratio at birth. 



Evidence suggests that population growth can coincide with increasing abundance of natural resources and does not necessarily lead to scarcity and that birth rates are declining dramatically across much of the world without coercion. While the height of neo‐​Malthusianism hopefully lies in the past and China may finally be moving away from heavy‐​handed population control, such ideas may be seeing a resurgence in India and elsewhere. Combating neo‐​Malthusian doctrine remains critical as long as coercive population policies persist anywhere in the world.

184 In 2016, India’s Supreme Court ruled in favor of a 2012 petition alleging that despite their illegality, both coercion and lack of informed consent remain problems in India, stating that many “women [who underwent sterilization] were either not provided any information regarding the nature of the procedure or were outright misled, for example being told by government health workers that it was compulsory to undergo sterilization.” Despite such accounts of illegal coercion, there is no way to ascertain the extent of this violation of Indian law, and the extent may be minor. Unlike with illegal coercion, data are available to quantify the extent of lack of informed consent. According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s StatCompiler database, India’s 2015–2016 _National Family and Health Survey_ states that 20.5 percent of sterilized women were not informed that sterilization is permanent, as is required by law, and 57.9 percent of women who were sterilized were not informed about side effects as is legally required. However, this lack of informed consent is a distinct problem from governmentally instituted coercion or disincentives, is not unique to sterilization, and is thus beyond the scope of this paper.

In 2008, the Washington legislature passed a law mandating a 50 percent reduction in per capita driving by 2050. California and Oregon laws or regulations have similar but somewhat less draconian targets.   
  
  
The Obama administration wants to mandate that all new cars come equipped with vehicle‐​to‐​infrastructure communications, so the car can send signals to and receive messages from street lights and other infrastructure.   
  
  
Now the California Air Resources Board is considering regulations requiring that all cars monitor their owners’ driving habits, including but not limited to how many miles they drive, how much fuel they use, and how much pollution or greenhouse gases they emit.   
  
  
Put these all together and you have a system in which the government will not only know where your vehicle is at all times, but can turn off your vehicle if it decides you are driving too much or driving in a way that emits too many grams of carbon dioxide or is otherwise offensive to some bureaucratic imperative.   
  
  
I sometimes think privacy advocates are a paranoid bunch, seeing men in black around every corner and surveillance helicopters or drones in the air at all times. On the other hand, if a technology is available–such as the ability to record cell phone calls–the government has proven it will use it.   
  
  
Consider all of the lovable progressives out there who think the government should “punish climate change liars,” meaning people who have differing opinions on scientific issues. It’s not much a stretch to think that, any time they happen to be in power, they will use the available technology to make people stop driving. After all, just how important can that extra trip to the supermarket be compared to the absolute imperative of preventing the seas from rising a quadrillionth of an inch?   
  
  
Of course, the elected officials and bureaucrats who run this system will exempt themselves from the rules. After all, nothing is more important than their work of running the country and making sure people don’t abuse their freedom by engaging in too much mobility.   
  
  
As California writer Steven Greenhut points out, we already have red‐​light cameras, and some “eastern states have suspended drivers from using toll lanes after their transponders showed them to be speeders.” They’re not invading our privacy, the greens will argue, they are just making sure that our actions aren’t harming Mother Earth.   
  
  
Of course, for many it really isn’t about greenhouse gas emissions. Mobility allows (or, as anti‐​auto groups would say, forces) people to living in low‐​density “sprawl” where they can escape taxation by cities eager to subsidize stadiums, convention centers, and light‐​rail lines. All they have to do is ramp down people’s monthly driving rations–something like a cap‐​and‐​trade system that steadily reduces the caps–and suburbanites will eventually find that they have to move back to the cities.   
  
  
No doubt some will argue that even those who drive the most fuel‐​efficient cars should be subject to the same driving limits because suburban homes waste energy too. Or that people will be safer from terrorists if they are all jammed together in cities close to emergency facilities than if they are spread across the countryside. Or that suburbanites are parasites on the cities and should be reassimilated back into the cities’ benign embrace and taxing districts.   
  
  
Whatever the argument, the point is that if the technology is there, the government will use it. If people really want to buy cars that monitor their every move and are capable of communicating those moves to some central infrastructure, they should be allowed to do so. But allowing the government to mandate these things is simply asking to have well‐​meaning, and sometimes not‐​so‐​well‐​meaning, government bureaucrats control how we travel and where we live.

Share this...FacebookTwitterTis the season for global warming alarmists to scour the globe in search summer heat waves – to parade as proof of global warming.
In Central Europe we are currently having a sort of a heat wave with temperatures near 90°F (32°C). The forecast for the weekend calls for higher, perhaps all-time record setting temperatures. This has the heat-chasers here salivating like Pavlov’s dogs.

Source: Joe Bastardi’s Saturday Summary
But Joe Bastardi’s Saturday Summary puts the whole global picture into perspective. Satellite data conclusively show that July global temps are running below normal, see chart above or Joe’s video starting at about the 3-minute mark.
Global temperature anomaly is -0.131°C. So where’s the heat? The oceans probably ate it.

Little wonder that Joe later on in his clip says that the warmist side “got taken to the woodshed” by the skeptics in the recent Congressional hearings, which is why such debates and hearings are totally avoided in places like Germany.
Alarmists like to trot out Hurricane Sandy as hard evidence of global climate change. Joe responds with a chart depicting hurricane activity back in the 1950s, a time when atmospheric CO2 concentrations were below 350 ppm:

Source: Joe Bastardi’s Saturday Summary
So what can we conclude? Man-made climate change of the sort peddled by the alarmists is really something for the ignorant and hopelessly clueless to be suckered into believing. There’s lots of educating that still needs to get done out there.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt looks like the article I wrote about Prof. Hans Schellnhuber a couple of days ago helped inspire a new commentary by Dr. Hans Labohm (a former expert IPCC reviewer) that appeared yesterday at the leading De Dagelijkse Standaard blogsite. Hans Joachim Schellnhuber: Het is nog erger dan we dachten.’ (Hans Joachim Schellnhuber: ‘It’s worse than we thought.’)

Labohm also viewed the video of Schellnhuber’s speech at the Stakeholders Conference on the 2015 Agreement, Shaping International Climate Policy Beyond 2020 and felt compelled to comment. Already the sub-title under the large photo of Schellnhuber tells us what to expect. It reads: “Completely detached from reality“.
First Labohm describes the IPCC process as being in a “zombie state” and the Stakeholer Conference as something that is “part of a climate ritual that has dragged on for decades.” and involves a gaggle of people who “earn their living by maintaining the climate hype.” According to Labohm, Schellnhuber’s speech was characterized by “cherry picking”, “spin” and “scare-mongering”. He writes:
So it was again the well-known propaganda tune and everything except science.”
Labohm calls Schellnhuber’s grudgingly made admission that global warming could be delayed yet another ten years as something we always hear from the prophets of doom.
Whenever their predictions don’t come true, they simply push them off into the future. And preferably far enough so that they can’t be called to account.”
Labohm also writes that Schellnhuber misleads the public whenever he claims there is a global consensus among the experts, writing that this is not at all the case “as several prominent warmists have left the sinking ship. That’s not gone unnoticed in a number of international quality media.”
Schellnhuber’s assertion that CO2’s influence on climate is settled science is also illusionary. CO2’s extent on climate change is more hotly disputed than ever. Labohm writes that Prof. Schellnhuber:
…completely ignores the studies that conclude climate sensitivity (the temperature effect of a doubling of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere) is insignificant.”

Labohm points out that Schellnhuber’s explanation for the warming stop (that the heat is being stored in the deeper layers of the oceans) is fraught with unknowns, and only confirms that the IPCC is now finally being forced to admit that natural mechanisms indeed do play a major role and can lead to cooling, and thus can also explain earlier warming periods. It’s back to the drawing board for the modellers – and they’ll have to start over from scratch.
Another example Labohm brings up that shows Professor Schellnhuber is either deceptive, or disconnected from reality, is the Marcott hockey stick. He writes:
In addition, he ignored the fact that, after publication, the author had explicitly and publicly recognized that the data for the 20th century were not robust.”
He also called Schellnhuber’s gloomy scenarios of the future, like 8°C warming, melting ice caps, etc. “Alice in Wonderland”.
Labohm, who is an economist, blasts Schellnhuber’s claim that implementing climate policy to meet the “2°C target” would cost global GDP only one per cent. Labohm points out that the Stern report had reached a similar conclusion, but was later “ripped apart by environmental economists such as Richard Tol“. Labohm writes:
I would be surprised if the refutation of the article/report took more than a few days. The reasoning is simple. There is a strong correlation between power consumption (mainly fossil) and economic growth.”
Little wonder that Germany and Japan have recently announced the construction of new, modern coal plants. Doing anything else would be unaffordable.
At the end of the article, Labohm tells his readers that “the game is over for Schellhuber and Associates”, quoting James Delingpole:
The EU has been the global laboratory testing the green agenda to see how it works. Today’s story means that the guinea pig died; the most important piece of green intervention in world history has become an expensive and embarrassing flop. It’s hard to exaggerate the importance of this for environmentalists everywhere; if the EU can’t make the green agenda work, it’s unlikely that anybody else will give it a try.

Since the end of geostrategic competition between the U.S. and the (former) U.S.S.R and with the ideological struggle between Democratic Capitalism and Communism over, pundits have been proposing new conceptual frameworks for understanding the evolving global political and economic balance — or imbalance — of power.



Indeed, for close to two decades, scholars have been debating the direction that the “paradigm shift” in international relations would take. What would replace the obsolete bipolar international system and the strategic and ideological forces that had driven it?



From Francis Fukuyama’s _End of History_ assuming a stable unipolar system under which the process of economic globalization and the spread of democratic and liberal values would widen to Samuel Huntington’s _Clash of Civilizations_ forecasting a challenge to American power and values from the Muslim World and other civilizational blocs, and through other complementing and competing Big and small ideas warning of (or hailing) the formation of rival trading blocs, the collapse of the nation‐​state, the New World Order, the Coming Anarchy or the rise of a world government, we have been bombarded with a few useful and a lot of useless foreign‐​policy paradigms.



In a way, these ambitious models were fashioned in response to developments in the real world and seemed to enjoy brief popularity when this or that crisis seemed to be “confirming” one’s favored theory. Hence the fall of the Berlin Wall, the U.S. military victory in the First Gulf War, and China’s entry into the global economy made Fukuyama’s vision kind of trendy. The civil war in the former Yugoslavia and radical Islamic terrorism transformed Huntington into an international celebrity and his “clash” paradigm was all the rage. The post‐​Maastricht Treaty consolidation of the European Union (EU) and the establishment of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was supposed to be a sign that regional economic blocs would dominate the international system, while the Zeitgeist of globalism AKA Spirit of Davos seemed to reflect the eroding power of the nation‐​state.



More recently, the growing economic power of China and India coupled with the relative decline in American power have helped popularize the notion of the coming of the “post‐​American‐​American world” while against the backdrop of the heated debate over the so‐​called Ground Zero mosque and the rising electoral power of anti‐​Muslim political parties in Western Europe it looks as though the Clash of Civilization thesis is once again very much “in.” The conventional wisdom is that the brief unipolar American moment is over and that U.S. allies are now hedging their strategic bets as the global environment is taking an elastic multipolar shape.



And so it goes. A new international economic or military crisis gives birth to a new instant paradigm only to be run over by the ensuing events that modify it or even make it obsolete. Recall that it was only a few years ago that the booming energy prices led many observers to conclude that with its huge oil and gas reserves Russia would regain its position as a global superpower and that it would ally with China under the Shanghai Treaty Organization and the BRIC grouping to counter‐​balance American military and economic power. Didn’t happen!



Moreover, while Fukuyama, Huntington and other pundits may have provided us with some valuable insights — capitalism and liberal democracy did emerge as winning economic and political systems in most of the West; culture and religion did become important elements in global politics; regional trading blocs did play an increasing role in global economics; globalization did challenge the power of the nation‐​state; failed states did produce anarchy — they have failed to provide an all‐​encompassing explanations of the way the post‐​Cold War international system was working. In fact, many of these theories pretending to be grand proved to be quite insignificant in the larger scheme of things; not to mention the fact that they were full of intellectual holes. Or to put it in simple terms, reality failed to confirm the theory.



Hence the financial crisis and the growing economic and political discontent in the U.S. and Europe have demonstrated the continuing fragility capitalism and liberal democracy in the West. At the same time, the economic success of Chinese capitalist and non‐​democratic model is posing a long‐​term challenge to the American one. Notwithstanding the 9/11 terrorist acts and the ensuing war against terrorism, the notion that the West and Islam are sliding towards an historic global clash has proved to be nothing more than the figment of imagination — the Crusaders vs. the Caliphate — shared by American neoconservatives, European Islamophobes, and radical Islamists. In the real world, the U.S. is allied with the most important Muslim countries (Turkey; Indonesia: Pakistan; Saudi Arabia) while some of the deep and dangerous political divisions are inside the Muslim world (Sunnis vs. Shiites, for example).



And contrary to earlier grand expectations, the EU seems to be in the process of a slow and painful disintegration, pitting the prosperous German‐​led “North” against the poorer economies of the “South;” NAFTA has proved to provide limited benefits to its members and has not been extended to the rest of the hemisphere; and most of the economic groupings in the Pacific, including the APEC (Asia‐​Pacific Economic Cooperation) forum serve as nothing more than useful talking shops.



If anything, notwithstanding the great hopes invested in such multilateral economic regimes, ranging from the old International Monetary Fund (IMF) to the newer Group of 20 major economies (and the continuing bombastic rhetoric in support of multilateralism), the trend among the large and small economic powers in the aftermath of the economic crisis is to protect their own national economic interests including by embracing protectionist policies. The latest drift towards “currency competition” involving the U.S., China, Brazil and other economies is just the latest example of this economic nationalist trend that included the failure in Copenhagen to achieve global consensus on climate change and the rising opposition in Germany to continue backing the euro as well as the stalemate in the Doha round of global trade liberalization negotiations. The spirit of Doha is no more…



There is no reason to assume the obstacles to global economic integration would disappear anytime soon, especially if the slow economic recovery in the U.S. and the EU would not gain momentum and expose growing economic structural problems and make it clear that it would be impossible for the U.S. and other economies to spend their way towards recovery, forcing them to embrace painful austerity measures. Under these conditions, the economically distressed members of middle class in North America and Europe and other parts of the developed world would be more inclined to vote into power political leaders and movements that favor more trade protectionism and anti‐​immigration policies. Indeed, ultra‐​nationalism and xenophobic backlash against the “Other” — Hispanic and Muslim immigrants or for that matter, the booming Asian exporting economies — could become more popular, especially if the effort to rebalance the global financial system — getting China to save more and the U.S. to spend more — would not gain momentum.



In a way, even under the best‐​case scenario of a speedy economic recovery, the rising tide of nationalism — economic and military — is going to become the default option of the powerful and less powerful nation‐​states worried about growing threats to their security and prosperity. Nationalism has and could prove to be the most effective way for political leaders to win support and legitimacy from their people, a process that could even affect the pacifist nations of Germany and Japan that would drive nations to form partnerships based on interests and not on “civilizational” and other values. This new and messy world would not conform to any of the fashionable and neat paradigms of the last twenty years. But not to worry: An entrepreneurial intellectual would eventually come up with a new theory to explain why all of what is happening in the real world makes a lot of sense, theoretically speaking.

"The use of tools is one example of the growing capacity for analytical thought and invention in apes and early humans. The earliest flint-knapped stone cutting tools date from around 2.6 million years ago. Great apes such as chimpanzees are also known to use tools, from primitive spears to specialised tools used to forage for ants. While tool use is rare in the animal kingdom, it is known among other species. Crows, for example, use sticks to extract snails from shells. And the use of tools has even been documented even in dolphins.  In one population of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) in Shark Bay, Western Australia, members use sponges for foraging. Lacking hands, they pick up and wear the sponges over their rostra (beak), possibly to protect themselves from sharp objects and noxious critters when probing in the sea floor sediment. Previous work has shown that it is mainly daughters that learn the sponging behaviour from their mothers, and that this is passed on through social learning cultural transmission. As among humans and as documented in numerous other animal species, the innovation of sponging is transmitted via social learning mechanisms between individuals, such as daughters closely observing their mothers when they use sponges as tools. The sponging-foraging technique was thought to be part of dolphins’ efforts to find nutritious, bottom-dwelling fish that do not have a swim bladder. As the dolphins’ echolocation sense uses the swim bladder to detect fish, a lack of it makes it hard or impossible for the dolphin to detect them with sonar. But until now there’s not been much evidence to support this idea. Our team made up of scientists from the University of Zurich, Switzerland, Murdoch University and the University of New South Wales in Australia, as well as the Marine Scotland Science labs, used fatty acid signature analysis to identify dietary differences between the dolphins that use sponges and those that do not. The aim was to detect differences in the blubber, where fatty acids from fish prey are deposited. Differences between those that use sponge tools and those that don’t would suggest differences in the long-term diet. We sampled 36 dolphins from two different research sites in Shark Bay, of which 11 were routine tool-users. At each site, we found evidence of a clear dietary difference between the two groups. In fact the differences were pronounced enough to be usually associated with different populations from different areas, or even differing species, rather than those found among individuals sharing the same habitat.  The fatty acid profile found in Shark Bay dolphins that do not use tools is the same, which demonstrates that the tool-using dolphins are able to exploit an ecological niche and the food it offers that would otherwise not be available to them. Cultural transmission, including of tool use, has been identified as the major driver of human evolution. The dolphins’ method for finding new food sources has led to a significant reduction in competition for food – perhaps one of the reasons why it is in Shark Bay that the highest density of dolphins are found."

IPCC now too moderate for professional scaremongers | Herald Sun Andrew Bolt Blog 
What happened to “listen to the science”?
A GLOBAL lobby group has distributed a “spin sheet” encouraging its 300 member organisations to emphasise the link between climate change and extreme weather events, despite uncertainties acknowledged by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
An “action pack” distributed by Global Campaign for Climate Action said members “shouldn’t be afraid to make the connection”, despite the sometimes low level of confidence in the official documents of the IPCC. The action pack, which was produced to coincide with the release of the latest full IPCC report into the link between climate change and extreme weather events, rekindled claims that overstating the case damaged the credibility of the science…

The full report … presented a cautious appraisal and said it was unable to answer confidently whether climate was becoming more extreme.
But GCCA told its member organisations to “use the precautionary principle to argue that we must take potential risks seriously even if the science doesn’t offer high confidence”.
“Generally, all weather events are now connected to climate change, because we have altered the fundamental condition of the climate, that is, the background environment that gives rise to all weather,” the action plan said.
GCCA has about 300 members worldwide including Greenpeace, Oxfam, WWF, Environment America, the Union of Concerned Scientists, Amnesty International and Pew Environment Group.
What’s important to these extremists is not the evidence but the scare.

For every David Attenborough, Prince Harry or James Shaw there are at least as many man-made climate change sceptics supported by science. But how good is the science?



Sanjeev Sabhlok writing for Climate Change Dispatch says **“Driven by Bad Science, Climate Change Climate Alarm is an Excuse to Ignore Real Problems”.** Sabhlok’s gripe is that the IPCC “fails to emphasize that without using fossil fuels today, our future generations won’t become even half as rich”. He discusses an aspect of bad science that man-made climate change hangs off – dangerous CO2 levels.



“There is overwhelming evidence that today’s CO2 level of 400 ppm is simply too low. Commercial greenhouse farmers insist on 1,500 ppm of CO2 to get the best plant output.  
That makes sense because most of today’s plants evolved over the past 250 million years when average CO2 levels were around 1,200 ppm.



We also know that at 150 ppm of CO2 plants struggle to survive. It seems sensible, therefore, to aim for a minimum level of 1,200 ppm of CO2 in the air. At what level will CO2 start harming us? A simple calculation can answer this. At 21 percent of the atmosphere, oxygen is currently 500 times the concentration of CO2



We also know that millions of Tibetans and Ladakh residents routinely live at 60 percent of this oxygen level. This means there is “space” in the air for up to 200 times more CO2 without reducing oxygen availability.



While submariners routinely operate at 5,000 ppm, they could easily do so also at higher levels if necessary.



  
New Zealand’s goal of being carbon neutral by 2050 rests entirely on computer modelling of atmospheric CO2 levels. But **the 400 ppm CO 2 baseline was determined by computer modelling** which included sampling from overseas sites for which there is debate around site location and wind flow.



So why are we using a likely unnecessary and unrealistic baseline of 400 ppm CO2, and, more importantly, how well do we measure our CO2 levels?



“Last year the NIWA atmosphere-ocean scientist was awarded $11.4 million from MBIE’s prestigious Endeavour Fund to develop CarbonWatchNZ.”



This ambitious programme aims to build **the world’s first complete national-scale picture of a country’s carbon balance based on measurements of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.”**



NIWA is telling us our atmospheric CO2 is calculated by estimating fuel emissions and deducting CO2 uptakes through forestry by computer modelling. But now CarbonWatchNZ will measure actual air samples – but don’t get too excited because they will still integrate manipulated data.



“The project involves measuring CO2 and methane (CH4) in the air above New Zealand at a network of sites around the country. 



**By combining these atmospheric measurements with information about winds and air movement over our cities, forests and farmlands,** CarbonWatchNZ will measure the greenhouse gases we are emitting and how much carbon our landscapes absorb. 



When these “top down” atmospheric observations are added to existing estimates from the ground up, New Zealand will be able to build the **world’s first complete picture of a country’s carbon profile**.”



Woop-de-doo! Another model which will apparently be better than the last – not forgetting that they are still estimates. 



We exceeded our baseline level of 400 ppm of CO2 back in 2016, but our data, including baseline, is also reviewed and revised by overseas experts. The Ministry for the Environment reported back in 2016. 



“Every year international expert reviewers examine the inventory and critique the report against internationally agreed guidelines. They then recommend areas for improvement.  
 **To make improvements, it is sometimes necessary to recalculate estimates** of greenhouse gas emissions and removals for some or all years in the time series, not just the latest reporting year.”



  
Little wonder scientists disagree on climate change when the data is overhauled and manipulated before it even gets to Joe Public who can take as gospel what the media says and what is now taught at school. 



So, what did CarbonWatchNZ find in their first year?



“By the end of 2019, New Zealand will have four new atmospheric greenhouse gas measurement stations and two temporary stations measuring gases and isotopes to ‘fingerprint’ the carbon sink on the South Island? Exciting times! #CarbonWatchNZ @niwa_nz @gnsscience @mwlr_nz @waikato”



  
In other words no further estimates just yet. But, on the plus side, NIWA has $11M to play around with.



Oh well, at least we get to choose what we think about the effects of man-made climate change – unlike our farming community who have been hung out to dry by this government.



Policies and decisions to cull livestock numbers are high on Ardern and Green Party agendas. Putting farmers out of business would be a bonus. Unlike the rest of NZ, farmers get no CO2 credits for planting trees on their property.



It’s clear what this government, and the IPCC, are all about – money and power and hanging onto both.

"**A hair salon which repeatedly opened during the current lockdown has been ordered to close by magistrates.**
Sinead Quinn, owner of Quinn Blakey Hairdressing in Oakenshaw, near Bradford, had received fines totalling Â£17,000 for trading during lockdown.
The order to close the salon will last until just after midnight on Wednesday ""to prevent nuisance to members of the public and to safeguard public health"".
Ms Quinn did not appear at the Bradford Magistrates' Court hearing.
The fixed penalty notices were given by Kirklees Council, for opening several times in November.
Hairdressers were required to close from 5 November under national lockdown restrictions, but are allowed to reopen on Wednesday.
More stories from around Yorkshire
The court heard that Ms Quinn had been seen serving customers on six days during the current national lockdown in England, and numerous complaints had been made to the council by members of the public.
Tahir Hanif, representing the council, said Ms Quinn had refused to open the door to engage with enforcement officers.
He said she had mentioned Magna Carta, telling council officers that coronavirus legislation ""does not apply to her and she does not consent to abide by these particular regulations"".
Chairwoman of the bench Rebecca Todd said: ""She is continuing in her behaviour, which is causing distress to the public in an already stressful and disturbing time.""
Under the closure order, anyone entering the premises could be arrested and fined or given a maximum prison sentence of 51 weeks.

"The idea that there is a “land grab” taking place in developing nations began with the publication of a report, Seized!, by the NGO Grain. This rang an alarm bell about large-scale land acquisitions – particularly by a number of Asian countries and Gulf States, which are acquiring millions of hectares of fertile agricultural land, predominantly in Africa. Corporations and states including the US, European nations, and the rising “BRIC” economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China are all involved in this voracious purchasing of land. And despite the huge differences in the countries and localities where the land is purchased, the outcome is surprisingly similar: millions of hectares of farmland, as well as forests and peatlands, have been rapidly converted into huge mono-cropped plantations of soy, oil palm, and other cash crops. This process particularly hits pastoralists, smallholders and vulnerable landless groups. What is striking is that in most cases land grabbing takes place with full support of governments which are happy to swap land for foreign direct investment. As a rule, insufficient consideration is given to the livelihoods, rights and needs of local people. Land sold to investors is often taken away from locals who are not even informed, and are often forcefully removed. To the extent that investments generate benefits such as employment, those from the land are usually bypassed in favour of workers from elsewhere.  The global land grab is a phenomenon against which those whose land is being grabbed seem defenceless. It is an area in which multilateral organisations, such as the World Bank, as well as civil-society organisations and NGOs have become increasingly vocal, and which has attracted greater academic interest. Most early research focused on explaining the land grab narrative in terms of hectares and numbers of people affected, in an effort to uncover global trends and examine case studies. In our research, we have adopted instead an in-depth and comparative approach.  By examining Africa, Latin America and Asia country by country, a number of interesting themes emerge: urban land grabbing in Kenya, Ethiopia’s new agricultural investment policy, genetically modified soy cultivation in Argentina, residential tourism in Costa Rica, water grabbing in Peru and Ecuador, new land conversions in Vietnam, and the Gulf States’ investments in Indonesia and the Philippines. There are differences and similarities, local variations and more general trends. But it is clear that this global land grab really exists, and that it’s impact cannot be expressed in hectares and statistics alone. What is striking is that it has not been merely the demand for food or biofuels that has led to this land rush. In fact, a whole set of earlier policies has paved the way. Large-scale land acquisition started to take place as a number of conditions simultaneously fell into place. Huge tracts of land, under-exploited due to poor agricultural policy or decades of neglect, was made available. Foreign state aid donors emphasised the need to attract foreign investment. Land laws were modernised to make buying, selling and leasing land easier in many countries. And in many cases, institutional weaknesses or outright corruption eased through deals. National governments were supposed to decentralise, stepping back in favour of local governments and opening up to market forces. However, local governments have often not been strong enough to deal with foreign investors, while in other cases they are merely extensions or appointees of the same political elites that run national governments, rather than genuinely representing local interests. The global land grab is not the consequence of ad hoc crises; it is the logical outcome from the policies and political environment laid down before it. So while what is happening today is to a large extent a historical continuation, it is also very different from the events of the past. In countries such as Argentina or Costa Rica, land acquisition and “foreignisation” has taken place for decades, if not centuries. For example, the major US fruit growers’ acquisition of land throughout Central America during the early and mid-20th century. In Kenya, the current land grab echoes its clear precedent under colonisation by the British. Processes are rarely transparent – not in developing countries praised for “good governance”, and not even in cases of Western companies that boast of their “corporate social responsibility”. The global land grab has implications for transnational connections and power relations: it reshapes the geopolitical order, yet is equally a manifestation of a world order that has changed as economic power swings toward China, India, and developing economies. Much attention is paid to improving rules or regulations through land titling programmes, implementing the FAO voluntary guidelines, codes of conduct and other institutional solutions. However, the problem is often not so much regulations as the failure to implement them or a lack of practical control. As we have argued, a framework of accountability for large-scale land acquisitions must not only be limited to private companies, nor to governments or public bodies. To be effective it must be constructed as an integrated system of checks and balances that stretches from international trading regulations through national laws to local enactments, to ensure that all the main players of the game are playing under the same rules.

Share this...FacebookTwitter Germany’s version of the EPA, the Umweltbundesamt (UBA) unleashed a wave of outrage with the publication of a 123-page pamphlet dubbed: “And indeed it continues to warm – What’s behind the climate science debate” (background here).
The government pamphlet defames and blacklists US and German climate skeptic scientists and journalists.
Among those targeted is Professor Dr. Fritz Vahrenholt, co-author of the the German skeptic book, Die kalte Sonne. German daily Die Welt here and Die kalte Sonne here publish his open letter. Here it is in English with permission (short version).
=====================================
To the
President of the Umweltbundesamt (Federal Environment Agency)
Herrn Jochen Flasbarth
Postfach 1406
06813 Dessau-Roßlau Germany
Ref.: False portrayal in your pamphlet: “And indeed it continues to warm”
Dear Mr. President,
At a time when 17 climate scientists, who are very close to the IPCC (Otto et.al., Nature Geoscience, 19 May 2013), surprised the public with a startling report showing that the climate sensitivity of CO2 is 50% lower than what had been assumed, thus telling us that all previous prognoses of anthropogenic climate warming are in need of correction, your agency the German Umweltbundesamt (UBA) released a 123-page publication titled “And indeed it continues to warm”. The brochure swears by the IPCC prognoses and it also deals harshly with people who dispute the science surrounding the temperature development we have seen so far this century by using false assertions, omissions and defamation in an intolerable manner. For a federal authority, which belongs to the Federal Ministry of Environment, this is completely unacceptable.
Obstruction of freedom of expression
Before I bring up the major flaws in your pamphlet, I would like to ask: Whatever compelled you to deny journalists their right to free expression and scientists their right to critically scrutinize scientific findings?
As far as I can tell, contrary to what your pamphlet asserts, not a single “climate change skeptic” named in your brochure disputes the warming trend of the earth by greenhouse gases. In the scientific discussion, it is all about attribution, speed, and the extent of climate change, and the necessary measures needed for prevention or adaptation.
Falsified biography
I am personally concerned. In the section “Climate Skeptics in Germany” where you highlight in yellow, brand, and pillory the names of journalists, organizations – and the scientists Vahrenholt and Lüning – the method you use is clear: Critics are portrayed as industry henchmen. Regarding my curriculum vitae, you write that I was the chairman of German Shell and have been the manager of power company RWE since 2001. The latter is false. In 2001 I founded the Repower wind energy corporation, made it to the leader in the sector, and was CEO until 2008. Why did you falsify my biography?  Did it better fit the image of the villain you wanted to create?
In 2008 I was named Managing Director of the renewable energy company RWE Innogy, which I played a part in founding. Year after year it was the largest investor in the business. You also failed to mention that my primary duty at Shell was to develop renewable energies for the company. The construction of the first solar factory in Germany occurred while I was on the Board. You also fail to mention, because it does not fit the picture, that from 1976 to 1981 I was a manager at the UBA itself, the very agency that is now mocking me.
That you did not mention my term as managing director of RWE Innogy and my current function as the Charirman of the Deutschen Wildtier Stiftung (German Wildlife Foundation) also tells us that the pamphlet has one sole aim: to defame a critic.
You did not handle my Die kalte Sonne co-author Dr. Sebastian Lüning any better. As an assistant professor of geology and paleontology, he had been a peer reviewer for geo-scientific journals for years. He had not been working for RWE DEA for quite some time. What is your idea for scientific debate when you presume that we “are not real climate scientists” and thus not able to examine the various climate models in depth?
I would truly like to know which expert scientists wrote this pamphlet, where Stefan Rahmstorf is cited as a source 12 times. Can you exclude before the public that Mr. Rahmstorf or one of his colleagues played a part in preparing this pamphlet? It seems likely, because when one adds up the projects the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research have been commissioned to do by the UBA, we see it comes out to approximately 8 million euros (read here). In addition there are various products that employees of the PIK participated in. Example here.
Whenever one falsifies personal data of this kind, as is the case in your pamphlet, then one has to expect omissions, half-truths and inaccuracies throughout. On this matter I would like to point a few items.
Few scientists deny warming has stopped
On page 8 the pamphlet explains that the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) uses 30 years as the time period for studying climate. Thus from that it is concluded that a series of cool years in a decade doesn’t mean the climate is cooling. This is only the case “when the cooling extends over several decades”. That is false. In climate science it is undisputed that the significance of a warming or non-warming period is measured to be about 17 years (Santer et al., Journal of Geophys. Res. 2011). Up to now it has been 15 years since the temperature has stopped rising, even as enormous amounts of CO2 are emitted year after year. Between 2000 and 2010 about 100 billion tons were emitted, which is one quarter of all emissions since 1750. This has to tell us something. Indeed there has to be a force out there that is counteracting the climate gas CO2 and its warming capability of 1.1°C for each doubling of CO2 concentration. But you refuse to consider that possibility. On page 54 the pamphlet states: “From the temperature development since 1998, some conclude that global warming has stopped since this time. However this is incorrect for the following reasons: […] The Hadcrut dataset in Figure 2 shows a continuing global warming for more than 30 years. That is a long-term warming trend. A long-term stagnation of global warming on the other hand is not detectable.” Yet IPCC Chairman Rajendra Pachauri and James Hansen (formerly at NASA) think differently, and do recognize the missing temperature increase. Only very few scientists refuse to recognize this stop in warming, as Stefan Rahmstorf does. This outlier opinion obviously has been accepted by the UBA.
UBA refuses to acknowledge natural factors
The UBA is obviously unaware of the fact that the warming of the 20th century occurred cyclically. The warming from 1910 to 1940 was followed by a cooling until 1977. Then another similar period of warming occurred from 1977 to 1998. In our book “Die kalte Sonne” and at our blog (here and here) we point out that the oceanic cycles were not taken into account by the climate models and the IPCC reports. When these well-known powerful cycles are taken into account, then the warming due to CO2 from 1977 to 1988 is only 50% of what is claimed.

What is even stranger is that page 110 of your report falsely quotes and distorts the content of our book: “Both authors […] of course make natural causes such as fluctuating solar activity responsible for the global warming of the last years”. Just reading the inside jacket of our book would have sufficed to learn that ocean cycles and the sun have played a much greater role in the history of our climate than what was previously thought. It is widely known by the public that the oceanic decadal oscillations generated a large part of the 1977 – 1998 warming.  This is a duty that would have been a credit to the government UBA according to its founding Act.
UBA bans rolling back CO2 climate sensitivity
Since then there have been numerous scientific findings that confirm this. Not least, this earlier under-estimation of the impacts of oceanic decadal oscillations has resulted in numerous authors revising CO2 climate sensitivity downward in countless peer-reviewed articles, and now claim it is only half as much as what was previously thought. Why is this not mentioned in the UBA pamphlet?
Instead, the German Federal Office of Environment (UBA) pamphlet on page 28 cites a study from the year 2000! (Grieser et al.): “About two thirds of the global warming since this time (mid 20th century) can be traced to man.” The study, commissioned by the UBA, gives an anthropogenic greenhouse signal of 59.9%. However the study then states that the greenhouse signal for European temperatures is hardly significant at only 7.6%. According to the study, an equally high impact is assigned to both climate gas emissions and to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). That result is nowhere to be found in the UBA pamphlet. We suppose that the impact of the NAO having already been emphasized way back in 2000 would only cause confusion! Instead, time and again, only the publication by Schellnhuber and Rahmstorf (Climate Change, C. H. Beck, 2007) gets quoted. On page 40 only greenhouse gases come into question: “The warming since the 1970s cannot be explained by natural causes.” Page 45 states that the models “give a contribution to warming by anthropogenic causes (greenhouse gases and aerosols) of 0.5 °C”. And because warming in the 20th century (p. 50) is 0.6 °C, it means that already 80% of the warming is due to anthropogenic impacts. Yet, the UBA takes it a step further. On page 38 the pamphlet depicts the climate model results of the IPCC 2007 report. Here the impact from natural factors is close to zero (Figure 1), if not even negative, and only the anthropogenic factors cause warming.
This all leads to crucial questions when it comes to sensitivity. It’s beyond doubt that climate gas CO2 contributes to warming. But what is more important is the question: How much? As you know climate sensitivity of CO2 is the warming that results from a doubling of CO2 concentration with respect to the pre-industrial 280 ppm.
Here the UBA –publication cites only Schellnhuber/Rahmstorf (Climate Change, p. 42):  “The assured valid range of climate sensitivity is 2 to 4.5 °C […] Thus one can assume that 3°C is the most probable value.”
Since then, however, numerous scientific findings are showing that the climate sensitivity of CO2 is much lower (see here).
In peer-reviewed journals, the following CO2 climate sensitivities have been published:
Nic Lewis 1.1 to 2.2°C (Journal of Climate 2013 ), Troy Masters 1.5 to 2.9°C (Climate Dynamics 2013 ), Michael Ring 1.5 to 2°C ( Atmospheric and Climate Science 2012 ). Also the results of the Norwegian Research Council have cut the sensitivity of CO2 in half. But for the UBA, this is all not worth mentioning.
In our book “Die Kalte Sonne” we calculated a CO2 climate sensitivity of 1 to 1.5 °C. Yes, we have to deal with an anthropogenic warming that is far below the catastrophic prognoses of the IPCC and its representatives: 2 to 6 °C. The main message of our book: the natural factors give us time to change our energy basis over to a sustainable foundation. And as far as I can tell, our claim is not far off from the latest scientific results.
Nevertheless our scientifically founded point of view is being banned by the UBA.
Mr. President, in view of the mentioned publication by 17 climate scientists, who have reduced the CO2 climate sensitivity by about one half, your environmental agency really needs to put the pamphlet through the shredder.
UBA has ventured out of bounds
The tasks and duties of the UBA are clearly outlined in accordance with the Act establishing the (UBA). Among its tasks is to clear up questions in the public concerning environmental issues and coordinating environmental research of the country, UBA mission statement here.
However with the publication of the recent pamphlet “And indeed the warming continues”, your agency has clearly ventured out of bounds.
I’d like to know how you intend to correct this unprecedented distortion of scientific data.
I believe that the Parliamentarians of the German Bundestag should know what kind of publications federal tax money is being used for.
Therefore I am taking the privilege of sending a copy of the German version of this letter to the Chairman of the Budget Committee and to the Federal Ministry for the Environment.
Yours sincerely,
Fritz Vahrenholt

_This is the first in a series of posts on global temperature records. The problems with surface thermometric records are manifold. Are there more reliable methods for measuring the temperature of the surface and the lower atmosphere?_   
  
Let’s face it, global surface temperature histories measured by thermometers are a mess. Recording stations come on- and offline seemingly at random. The time of day when the high and low temperatures for the previous 24 hours are recorded varies, often changing at the same station. This has a demonstrable biasing effect on high or low readings. Local conditions can further bias temperatures. What is the effect of a free-standing tree 100 feet away from a station growing into maturity? And the “urban heat island,” often very crudely accounted for, can artificially warm readings from population centers with as few as 2,500 residents. Neighboring reporting stations can diverge significantly from each other for no known reason.   
  
The list goes on. Historically, temperatures have been recorded by mercury-in-glass thermometers housed in a ventilated white box. But, especially in poorer countries, there’s little financial incentive to keep these boxes the right white, so they may darken over time. That’s guaranteed to make the thermometers read hotter than it actually is. And the transition from glass to electronic thermometers (which read different high temperatures) has hardly been uniform.   
  
Some of these problems are accounted for, and they produce dramatic alterations of original climate records (see here for the oft-noted New York Central Park adjustments) via a process called _homogenization_. Others, like the problem of station darkening, are not accounted for, even though there’s pretty good evidence that it is artificially warming temperatures in poor tropical nations.   








_Figure 1_. Difference between satellite-measured and ground-measured trends. Artificial warming is largest in the poor regions of Africa and South America. (Source: Figure 4 in McKitrick and Michaels, 2007).   
  
There are multiple “global” temperature histories out there, but they all look pretty much the same because they all run into the problems noted above, and while the applied solutions may be slightly different, they aren’t enough themselves to make the records look very different. The most recent one, from Berkeley Earth (originally called the Berkeley Earth Science Team (BEST) record) is noteworthy because it was generated from scratch (the raw data), but like all the others (all using the same data) it has a warming since 1979 (the dawn of the satellite-sensed temperature era) of around 0.18⁰C/decade. (Computer models, on average, say it should have been warming at around 0.25⁰C/decade.)   
  
They all have a problem with temperatures over the Arctic Ocean as there’s not much data. A recent fad has been to extend the land-based data out over the ocean, but that’s very problematic as a mixed ice-water ocean should have a boundary temperature of around freezing, while the land stations can heat up way above that. This extension is in no small part responsible for a recent jump in the global surface average.   
  
It would sure be desirable to have a global surface temperature record that suffered from none of the systematic problems noted above, and—to boot—would be measured by electronic thermometers precisely calibrated every time they were read.   
  
Such a dream exists, in the JRA-55 dataset. The acronym refers to the Japan Meteorological Office’s (originally) 55-year “reanalysis” data, and it updates to _yesterday_.   
  
Here’s how it works. Meteorologists around the world need a simultaneous three-dimensional “snapshot” of the earth’s physical atmosphere upon which to base the forecast for the next ten to sixteen days. So, twice a day, at 0000 and 1200 Greenwich Mean Time (0700 and 1900 EST) weather balloons are released, sensing temperature, pressure, and moisture, and tracked to determine the wind. There’s also satellite “profile” data in the mix, but obviously that wasn’t the case when JRA-55 began in 1958. These are then chucked into national (or private) computers that run the various weather forecast models, and the initial “analysis,” which is a three-dimensional map based upon the balloon data, provides a starting point for the weather forecast models.   
  
Once the analyzed data had served its forecasting purpose, it was largely forgotten, until it dawned upon people that this was _really good data_. And so there have been a number of what are now called “reanalysis” datasets. The most recent, and the most scientifically complete one is JRA-55. In a recent paper describing, in incredible detail, how it works, the authors conclude that it is more reliable than any of the previous versions, either designed by the Japan Office or elsewhere.   
  
Remember: the thermistors are calibrated at the release point, they are all launched at the same time, there’s no white box to get dirty, and the launch sites are largely in the same place. They aren’t subject to hokey homogenizations. And the reanalysis data has no gaps, using the laws of physics and a high-resolution numerical weather prediction model that generates physically realistic Arctic temperatures, rather than the statistical machinations used in the land-based histories that inflate warming over the Arctic Ocean.   
  
There is one possible confounding factor in that some of the launch sites are pretty close to built-up areas, or are in locations (airports) that tend to attract new infrastructure. That should mean that any warming in those places is likely to be a (very slight) overestimate.   
  
And so here is JRA-55 surface temperature departures from the 1981–2010 average:   




_

_





_Figure 2._ Monthly JRA-55 data beginning in January, 1979, which marks the beginning of the satellite-sensed temperature record.   
  
The warming rate in JRA-55 until the 2015–16 El Niño is 0.10⁰C/decade, or about 40% of what has been forecast for the era by the average of the UN’s 106 climate model realizations. There’s no reason to think this is going to change much in coming decades, so it’s time to scale back the forecast warming for this century from the UN’s models—which is around 2.2⁰C using an emissions scenario reflecting the natural gas revolution. Using straight math, that would cut 21st century warming to around 0.9⁰C. Based upon a literature detailed elsewhere, that seems a bit low (and it also depends upon widespread substitution of natural gas for coal-based electricity).   
  
JRA-55 also has a rather obvious “pause” between the late 1990s and 2014, contrary to recent reports.   
  
The fact of the matter is that what should be the most physically realistic measure of global average surface temperature is also our coolest.

With stormy midterm elections just ahead, and much of President Obama’s agenda still undone, the last thing congressional Democrats needed is the distraction of a difficult and protracted Supreme Court confirmation battle.



Yet that’s likely what’s in store after Friday’s announcement that Justice John Paul Stevens, the court’s liberal lion, is stepping down in late June. The party’s base, already disappointed with Mr. Obama, will doubtless press the president for a liberal replacement. But with the growing “tea party” movement raising long‐​ignored constitutional issues, even a moderate nominee will face questions congressional Democrats would rather leave buried.



Chief among those is that most basic question, brought to the fore by “ObamaCare”: Are there any longer any constitutional limits on federal power?





Are there any longer any constitutional limits on federal power?



If Congress can reorder one‐​sixth of the nation’s economy, command states to establish insurance exchanges, and require individuals to buy insurance from private companies or face a tax, it would seem not. Yet the 19 states presently challenging such sweeping power will find little comfort in the decisions of Justice Stevens.



Coming of age during the New Deal, Stevens’s jurisprudence more often than not has reflected the dominant themes of that era: judicial deference to broad assertions of government power, especially over the economy, coupled with seemingly inconsistent assertions of judicial power to ignore the law in deference to “evolving social values,” all of which has given us modern “constitutional law” — not to be confused with the Constitution.



The Founders gave us a Constitution aimed at securing individual liberty through limited government, with most power resting in the states or, even more, in the private sector.



It wasn’t perfect, to be sure: In fact, it took a civil war to end slavery, and the Civil War Amendments to make the Bill of Rights good against the states. And there never was a “Golden Age,” as Jim Crow, Prohibition, and much else attest.



But from the start, the main idea was clear: Whatever the nation’s faults in practice, the point of life was to live it, freely, not dependent on government. Indeed, answering anti‐​Federalists’ fears that the new national government would be too powerful, Federalists detailed exquisitely the Constitution’s limits on federal power. Neither camp could have imagined anything like ObamaCare.



Well, all that changed when the social engineers of the Progressive Era, steeped in visions of the “public good,” came finally to power under Franklin Roosevelt.



When the “nine old men” on the court balked, saying the Constitution prohibited FDR’s schemes, the president threatened to pack the court with six new members. The plan failed, but the court got the message.



It turned the Constitution on its head, and the modern welfare state was born. A watershed moment came in 1942, when the court interpreted the Commerce Clause as giving Congress virtually unlimited authority over economic activity.



The result today is unfunded liabilities no one knows how to meet, debt as far as the eye can see, and taxes in the offing that will cripple individuals and businesses alike — quite apart from the restraints on liberty that dependency on government entails.



In 1995, the Supreme Court took a tiny step toward braking this juggernaut when it ruled that the Gun‐​Free Zones Act of 1990 exceeded Congress’s power under the Commerce Clause. The power to address that issue belongs to states, the court held, not to Congress. Stevens dissented, calling the decision “radical.”



Five years later, facing similar issues, he dissented again. But in 2005, facing a challenge to Congress’s prohibition on home‐​grown medical marijuana administered under state law, Stevens wrote at last for the majority, upholding Congress’s ability, under the Commerce Clause, to ban the drug and override state law, and effectively reversing the Rehnquist Court’s meager efforts to put a brake on Congress’s all but unbounded regulatory power.



That decision sets the stage, unfortunately, for the 19 states challenging ObamaCare today.



But Stevens hasn’t always favored federal power over states and individuals.



A year ago, for example, in a case pitting the Food and Drug Administration’s power to regulate prescription drug warning labels against state court awards to injured plaintiffs, he ignored the clause of the Constitution that makes federal law supreme and ruled for the plaintiff.



And in 2007 he entertained Al Gore‐​like claims about rising sea levels over the next century, thus ignoring rules about standing meant to keep mere speculative claims out of court. That enabled Massachusetts to get into court, where Stevens relied on still more dubious claims to rule against the Environmental Protection Agency’s earlier finding that it had no authority to regulate greenhouse gases.



Turning from limiting power to protecting rights, Stevens’s record is mixed, to be sure, but on several hot‐​button issues it could cause difficulties for Democrats in the upcoming Senate confirmation hearings.



Take guns and the Second Amendment: In a blockbuster decision two years ago, the court held, for the first time, that individuals had a right to own handguns for self‐​defense in the home. Stevens wrote the dissent.



Or take property rights: In the infamous Kelo decision of 2005, Stevens wrote for the court’s majority, holding that the city of New London, Conn., could transfer the title to Suzette Kelo’s home to a private developer who promised upscale building on the land, thereby generating more taxes for the city. Here again Stevens ignored the plain language of the Constitution to reach a result he thought socially desirable. That decision produced such a backlash that over 40 states subsequently tightened their eminent domain laws.



In other areas, too — abortion, campaign finance, affirmative action, the death penalty — Stevens has written or joined opinions that are likely, in the current climate, to pose difficulties for congressional Democrats seeking reelection. By and large, they reflect a bias toward government. And that is inconsistent not only with the times but with the Constitution. Yet that’s what Democrats may find themselves defending as the confirmation process unfolds.

“America faces a new culture war,” declares Arthur Brooks, president of the conservative American Enterprise Institute, in the opening sentence of his new book _The Battle: How the Fight between Free Enterprise and Big Government Will Shape America’s Future_. “This is not the culture war of the 1990s. This is not a fight over guns, abortions, religion, or gays. … Rather, it is a struggle between two competing visions of America’s future. In one, America will continue to be a unique and exceptional nation organized around the principles of free enterprise. In the other, America will move toward European‐​style statism.”



And who, according to Brooks, are the combatants in this conflict? Wearing the white hats, “70 percent of Americans support the free enterprise system and are unsupportive of big government.” Wearing black hats, meanwhile, is what Brooks calls “the 30 percent coalition”: the “intellectual upper class” of academics, journalists, and well‐​educated professionals; African‐​Americans and Hispanics; and the young. In other words, pretty much the usual suspects from culture wars gone by.



Although he mentions the Tea Party movement only in passing, Brooks’ call to arms is very much in the spirit of that populist uprising. He seeks to “rally the 70 percent majority in the battle for the soul of America”: In other words, as the Tea Partiers often put it, it’s time for “real Americans” to “take our country back.” Just as the protesters vent their fury at coastal elites and, especially, elitist‐​in‐​chief Barack Obama, so too does Brooks. “The intellectual upper class has become the most important party in the 30 percent coalition — the chief adversary of the free enterprise system today,” he writes. “And at the head of the intellectual upper class are our current leaders in Washington DC — starting with activist, bestselling author, and Ivy League academic, President Barack Obama.”



Let me make it clear at the outset: When it comes to specific questions of economic policy, Brooks and I probably agree on a great deal. Indeed, I’d bet that my opinions are much closer to his than they are to the typical reader of _The American Prospect_. I thought that the stimulus bill was, by and large, a waste of money, and the takeover of General Motors and Chrysler, a travesty. I opposed the recent health‐​care legislation and the climate bill and card‐​check legislation. Hey, I’m a vice president at the Cato Institute, so none of this should come as a big surprise.



But Brooks’ book isn’t about policy; it’s about ideology and how to engage in politics. And it is, I’m sorry to say, a thoroughly wrongheaded way to approach these questions. The attempt to turn economic policy disputes into a populist cultural crusade rests on deep‐​seated confusion about the nature of those disputes and how best to effect constructive policy change. Brooks’ key move is to cast our “free enterprise system” as an instance of American exceptionalism — in contrast to the social democracy of Europe and other advanced nations. Thus, economic policy becomes fodder for cultural politics: Supporters of free markets are defending a unique and precious American heritage, while members of the “30 percent coalition” have thrown in with the foreigners — worst of all, with effete, decadent Europeans.



To treat Brooks’ narrative seriously, it’s helpful to break down the concept of the “free enterprise system” into two separate and distinct elements. The first is free markets; the second, small government. They need not be a package deal. Governments can effectively stifle enterprise and competition without spending a lot of money, while a large public sector and a vibrant private sector can go hand in hand. So let’s look at each component separately.



First, free markets. Is Brooks’ distinction between all‐​American freedom and European‐​style statism a valid one? And here at home, do elites really support the state while everyone else supports the market? No and no. When it comes to establishing and maintaining open and competitive markets, the U.S. institutional and policy environment isn’t really that exceptional at all. Meanwhile, elites are actually more likely to support free‐​market policies than is the American demos.



Plenty of European countries have markets about as free as those in the land of the free. Look at the ratings provided by the annual _Economic Freedom of the World_ report, co‐​published by the Cato Institute. On four broad categories of economic freedom — legal structure and security of property rights; access to sound money; freedom to trade internationally; and regulation –. the United States was slightly “freer” than Sweden, the United Kingdom, Austria, Finland, and Switzerland. Meanwhile, Ireland, the Netherlands and, by a wide margin, Denmark were found to have freer markets. Note that the two highest scorers have two of the biggest welfare states in the world — which just goes to show that blurring issues of regulation and redistribution, as Brooks tries to do, leads to intellectual confusion.



So much for American exceptionalism in actual policy results. Meanwhile, how market‐​friendly is American public opinion? Not very, according to economist Bryan Caplan. In his book _The Myth of the Rational Voter_ , Caplan documents the existence of strong and widespread anti‐​market biases in the American electorate — in other words, sharp divergences between public opinion and the accepted view among most economists. Thus, ordinary voters are more likely to say a price increase was caused by intentional gouging rather than the interaction of supply and demand; they are more likely to blame problems in the economy on companies downsizing or “shipping jobs overseas”; and they tend to underestimate recent economic gains and express more pessimism about the future. On the other hand, the better educated are more likely to think like economists and see such changes as unavoidable. So it looks like Brooks actually gets things backward here: From a free‐​market perspective, the dreaded intellectual upper class is more solution than problem.



Brooks’ narrative works somewhat better with respect to conflicts over the size of government. Here, at least, there is a clear distinction between the United States and Europe. Levels of social welfare spending in Europe are generally much higher than they are in the U.S..



Does America’s smaller welfare state reflect important cultural differences between us and folks on the other side of the Atlantic? Yes, probably, but the main one is hardly worthy of defending. A 2001 paper, _Why Doesn’t the United States Have a European‐​Style Welfare State?_ by economists Alberto Alesina, Edward Glaeser, and Bruce Sacerdote, provides powerful evidence that race is at the center of the story. There’s a strong negative relationship between a country’s racial heterogeneity and its levels of social spending, and within the U.S., states with larger black populations spend less on welfare programs. “Americans think of the poor as members of some different group than themselves, while Europeans think of the poor as members of their group,” the paper concludes.



Don’t get me wrong: I’m no fan of the European welfare state. There are sound economic reasons for rejecting it as a model. Most decisively, the aging of the population and the continued development of promising but expensive medical treatments are rendering it unaffordable, and fiscal constraints will sooner or later lead to significant restructuring here as well.



But Brooks doesn’t want to use _economic_ arguments. He counsels against “getting stuck in the old arguments over money.” Instead, he wants to defend America’s track record of more modest social spending on _cultural_ grounds. And that is a really bad idea. Our tragic history of race relations may have inhibited spending, but we should be ashamed of that cultural heritage. We certainly shouldn’t embrace it and brag about it. Brooks apparently doesn’t realize what he’s doing; he thinks he’s touting good old Yankee self‐​reliance. But his argument is offensive even if he’s oblivious to how offensive he’s being.



In any event, it’s not anti‐​poverty programs that are threatening to send the U.S. budget spiraling out of control. Rather, it’s the middle‐​class entitlements, Social Security, and especially Medicare. And you can’t blame those programs on the machinations of the dastardly “30 percent coalition,” because they are overwhelmingly popular across the electorate. According to an April _New York Times_ poll, 76 percent of Americans think “the benefits from government programs such as Social Security and Medicare are worth the costs of those programs.” And amazingly, the percent only drops to 62 when the sample is restricted to the 18 percent of people who say they support the Tea Party movement!



Here again, Brooks’ effort to turn economic policy problems into “us versus them” cultural conflicts collapses in failure. On the vexing question of how to defuse the entitlements fiscal time bomb, there is no “us” and “them.” The politics of us versus them is almost always ugly and illiberal. And on the policy questions that Brooks is concerned with, there’s no need for such deliberate divisiveness. Yes, there are strong disagreements about market regulation and the proper size and scope of social spending, but these disagreements are not based on some irreconcilable differences in values. Vigorous support for continued economic growth is nearly universal across the political spectrum. How else will we put jobless Americans back to work, and how else will we pay for the activities of government, without a strong, dynamic private sector? A similarly broad consensus exists for the following two propositions: On the one hand, a government safety net is needed to protect Americans from various hazards of life; on the other hand, that safety net shouldn’t bankrupt us.



Figuring out how to restore growth and how to construct an effective but affordable safety net, are questions for debate, analysis, and democratic decision‐​making. My answers to those questions may differ from yours, but dividing up into warring tribes and demonizing each other aren’t the ways to figure out who’s right.

"About 12,000 years ago, human domestication of the natural world began in earnest with the intentional cultivation of wild plants and animals. Fast forward to today and our dominion over the planet appears complete, as 7.8 billion of us multiply across its surface and our reach extends from the deep-sea beds, which are being mined, to the heavens, where we are, according to Donald Trump, dispatching a space force. Yet as has been made clear by a recent litany of disasters – from the coronavirus pandemic to America’s deadliest wildfire in a century – there are forces that cannot be domesticated. Indeed, our interference with the natural world is making them more liable to flare up into tragedy. We created the Anthropocene, and the Anthropocene is biting back.  Covid-19 appears to have emerged in a Wuhan seafood and wild animal market, yet some scientists argue that its true origin story lies in the disruption of ecosystems. Genetic testing indicates that the virus probably came from bats, and at some point may have been transmitted via an intermediate species such as the pangolin, the most trafficked animal in the world. Although pangolins were not – officially – listed as traded at the market, it was certainly host to other wild animals such as wolf pups, crocodiles and civets. “Wild animals carry their own unique viruses,” David Quammen, the author of Spillover: Animal Infections and the Next Human Pandemic, told Yale Environment 360. “When we go into a tropical forest with its great diversity, and we start cutting down trees, and capturing animals, or killing animals for food” – or sending them to markets where they can mix with farm animals and humans – “then we offer those viruses the opportunity to become our viruses, to jump into us and find a new host, a much more abundant host”. The risk of diseases spreading from animals to humans is in fact greatest when the animals concerned are endangered and in decline owing to trafficking and habitat destruction, a recent study found. The climate crisis and human population growth are “disease amplifiers”, according to the World Health Organization. Wildfires similarly show how our remaking of the natural world has had disastrous consequences. In our new book Fire in Paradise, which is based on our extensive reporting for the Guardian and published today, we document the destruction of an entire California city in 2018 by a fire of unprecedented severity in modern times. Claiming 85 lives, it is the deadliest ever wildfire in the state. Wildfires are native to the western US in the same way that monsoons or hurricanes are native to other places. Yet a century of efforts to stamp them out and protect human lives and property in California has left the state’s forests and grasslands unnaturally dense with flammable vegetation that would otherwise have burned off in semi-regular but low-intensity burns. To make matters worse, global heating is rendering California’s wild places ever drier. Paradise’s residents knew of the sword that hung over their heads. The town had an evacuation plan and an emergency robocall system. In the summer of 2018, a horrifying and awe-inspiring fire tornado 1,000ft wide had laid waste to an area just 80 miles away. “It’s not a matter of if,” one longtime resident, Iris Natividad, told us. “It’s a matter of when.” Even so, no one imagined how bad it would be on that morning in early November, when a spark from a PG&E transmission tower ignited the brush that surrounded it, at one point consuming nearly 400 American football fields’ worth of vegetation a minute on its sprint into Paradise. Flames that burned as hot as a crematorium melted cars and blowtorched thousands of homes. The fire trapped people in town and caught many unaware. Paradise suffered total devastation, and the images of neighborhoods reduced to nothing but piles of ash shocked the world.  We’d say this was the new normal – except that actually “it would be a mistake to assume that the region has reached any semblance of a stable plateau”, three wildfire scientists wrote for the Guardian only a few months before the Paradise fire. We know there will continue to be huge fires. We also know there will be more outbreaks, as a consequence of extreme weather, biodiversity destruction, political instability, and expanded ranges for mosquitoes and ticks. Yet one optimistic lesson from the Covid-19 tragedy is that we can act. We will heed the calls to stay home, and we will condemn the economy in the process, if it means saving lives. And we will do it overnight. On our part-domesticated, still-wild planet, in the geologic era that bears our name, we’ve learned that we do indeed possess the willpower to prevent another pandemic, and another Paradise. Alastair Gee and Dani Anguiano are the authors of Fire in Paradise: An American Tragedy, available from WW Norton on 5 May. Read an excerpt here"

According to Dr. Clive Best, A key prediction from the 2007 IPCC WG1 report fails statistical tests.

AR4 figure for long term predictions for each scenario
Abstract: Global temperatures measured since 2005 are incompatible with the IPCC model predictions made in 2007 by WG1 in AR4. All subsequent temperature data from 2006 to 2011 lies between 1 and 6 standard deviations below the model predictions. The data show with > 90%  confidence level that the models have over-exaggerated global warming.

Background: In 200o an IPCC special report proposed several future economic scenarios each with a different CO2 emission profile. For the 2007 assessment report these scenarios were used to model predictions for future global temperatures. The results for each of the scenarios were then used to lobby governments. It would appear that as a result of these predictions, there is  one favoured scenario – namely B1 which alone is capable of limiting temperature rises to 2 degrees.

When the Soviet Union sank, human liberty dramatically increased. The great totalitarian tyranny that had consumed millions of its own apparatchiks and tens of millions of its other citizens was gone.



However, the initial years of chaotic liberty have been replaced by ever more stifling authoritarianism. The negative impact has been most obviously felt in the political realm. According to last year’s State Department human rights assessment: “There were numerous reports of governmental and societal human rights problems and abuses during the year.” The list of examples is long and distressing. 





The Moscow authorities have demonstrated that they don’t care much what foreigners, or even most Russians, think.



Freedom House rates Moscow as “not free.”



The country holds elections but, says Freedom House, “is not an electoral democracy.” Freedom House offers a similar list of human rights abuses, including restrictions on the media, pervasive corruption, limits on freedom of assembly and association, and a subservient judiciary.



Unfortunately, religious liberty also is coming under pressure. The Russian constitution formally protects religious freedom and equality, but, noted the State Department last fall, “the government did not always respect those provisions.” There long have been some limits to this most basic freedom. 



Freedom House explained:





The State Department made many of the same points. It explained that there was “generally free practice of religion for most of the population,” but some religious minorities found their rights to be restricted. State also pointed to the 1997 legislation “On Freedom of Conscience and Association,” warning that its provisions “continued to seriously disadvantage some religious groups viewed as non‐​traditional.” The Federal Security Service (FSS), which has replaced the FBI, increasingly has viewed some faiths as threats to Russian security.



Moreover, the government is increasingly using the Extremism Law passed in June 2002 to persecute nontraditional religions. A group of U.S. religious leaders recently raised the alarm about this dangerous trend in a letter to the president. 



Undoubtedly, examples of dangerous extremism exist in Russia. However, the legislation bans far more than violent groups. For instance, the definition of extremism includes “public defamation of any person on duty holding a public office in the Russian Federation” and “infringement on life of a public official or community leader committed with a view of termination of his public or other political activity.”



In March a court in the city of Surgut upheld the seizure of Scientology books and materials as “extremist.” It was an ex parte hearing, at which the church was not represented. The Church of Scientology had previously been denied the right to register under the 1997 law, which requires groups with more than 15 years in the country to sign up as religious organizations. 



The Scientologists are not the only victims of the law. The federal list of Extremist Materials to which their publications were added includes nearly 600 publications. 



Muslim literature has been denounced as “extremist” because it “propagandizes the idea of the superiority of Islam — and therefore Muslims — over other religions and the people who adhere to them.” Last fall the Russian Supreme Court upheld a government ban on publications of the Jehovah’s Witnesses as extremist. The local organization was ordered liquidated and its property was seized. 



Unfortunately, these are merely the tip of an iceberg of growing repression. The American religious leaders explained to President Obama: 





The result is what the letter‐​writers call “an increasingly hostile environment” for non‐​traditional faiths, resulting “in investigations, armed raids, nation‐​wide bans on certain religious literature that had been published and read worldwide for decades, and even dissolutions and liquidations of religious organizations.” An incredible 2,000 religious organizations were subject to liquidation for failing to reregister after the year 2000. Moreover, churches have increasingly cited increased bureaucratic oversight and regulation. The State Department noted that “Many non‐​traditional denominations frequently complained that they were unable to obtain venues for worship.” 



Finally, attacks on individual faiths and congregations have been escalating. The Oslo‐​based Forum 18 News Service explained: “The formation of Russia’s policy towards one particular form of extremism — religious extremism — may have begun hesitantly.” However, passage of the 2002 legislation “eventually led to a wide‐​ranging crackdown on religious literature the authorities deemed ‘extremist’.” Religious organizations increasingly have come under attack in other ways as well. 



Forum 18 compiled a long list of disturbing incidents beginning in mid‐​2007:



It’s an imposing list. But there are more examples. Many religions and individual congregations have suffered from a raid, prosecution, banning, dissolution, arrest, penalty, restriction, seizure, investigation, confiscation, detention, or other attack from the state authorities. Non‐​traditional, proselytizing faiths have suffered the most.



The European Court of Human Rights has become the final resort for some desperate Russians. In October 2006 the justices ruled for the Salvation Army. A year later the ECHR supported the Church of Scientology. Last October it again ruled against Russia and in favor of the Scientologists. In June the ECHR held that a 2004 ban on the Moscow’s Jehovah’s Witnesses violated articles on freedom of thought, conscience, worship, and assembly of the European Convention on Human Rights, which has been ratified by Russia.



In the latter case the court stated that “the Moscow authorities did not act in good faith and neglected their duty of neutrality and impartiality.” Moreover, the government had interfered with “the religious organization’s right to freedom of association and also with its right to freedom of religion.”



Unfortunately, Russia does not treat decisions of the ECHR as authoritative.



Not every religion is disabled to the same degree. The Orthodox Church enjoys privileged status, which it has used against other faiths. In June the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) warned “that the de facto favored status of the Moscow Patriarchate Russian Orthodox Church results in difficulties for minority religious communities, particularly those officially deemed non‐​traditional.”



Moreover, the Orthodox Church recently used its preferential status to encourage a blasphemy prosecution against a contemporary art exhibition entitled “Forbidden Art” held at the Sakharov museum. The government is seeking a three year jail term for organizers, a haunting throwback to Soviet restrictions on contemporary art.



In June the USCIRF warned that “Many Russian officials also proclaim that certain religious and ethnic groups are alien to Russian culture and society, thereby contributing to a climate of intolerance. In general, the Russian government has failed to address consistently or effectively the severe and chronic problem of violent and sometimes lethal hate crimes and anti‐​Semitism. Numerous acts of vandalism against synagogues, churches, and mosques also go largely unpunished or are attributed to hooliganism.”



Obviously, Washington’s influence over Moscow’s internal policies is limited. Nevertheless, U.S. government officials, religious leaders, and human rights activists can offer the same simple message as the religious leaders who wrote the president: “The Russian Government should make good on Russian guarantees of freedom of religion and association for every individual and religious community, and it should honor its international human rights obligations and commitments.”



The Moscow authorities have demonstrated that they don’t care much what foreigners, or even most Russians, think. But the controversy could embarrass the Putin/​Medvedev government, tarnishing the regime’s image. Since religious restrictions — in contrast to political repression — don’t strengthen Vladimir Putin’s hold on power, maybe even he would come to see the value of offering religious believers a little more space.

Nigel Farage in Australia this week spoke about the international trend away from globalism and toward nationalism or **self-determination** since 2016. The US, Italy, Spain, Austria, the UK and Australia have all moved in that direction.



Ardern was in Tokelau recently when she saw the opportunity for NZ to fund an airstrip. I’d prefer that Ardern, as keeper of the national purse, adopt a more accountable, nationalist based attitude toward others, given our healthcare and housing needs at home. 



For those of us who want to cut globalism loose and prioritise New Zealanders before helping other nations, which parties provide the strongest platform?



On equality regardless of sex, race, age or religion, only ACT and New Conservatives promise to remove our existing race-based Maori seats. “NC believes the Treaty of Waitangi – Te Tiriti o Waitangi ensures the same rights and privileges are available for everyone.”



The Nats would remove us from the UN Global Migration Pact – big ups to Simon Bridges and The National party. 



On addressing the loss of traditional NZ values through migration, ACT recognises the potential problem and says “new migrants should be willing to adapt to and endorse New Zealand’s values”, but doesn’t say how ACT would achieve it. New Conservative goes further, saying they would ensure **“there is no acceptance or allowance of Sharia Law, in any expression, as well as any non-constitutional jurisdictional authority, in New Zealand”.**



On gun law, National supported the government’s 2019 reforms, and ACT was the only party to vote against it. The New Conservatives would amend the badly crafted Prohibited Arms Act 2019, with an amended version of banned “E” category firearms and a new five-year residency condition for firearm ownership. New Conservative would also increase sentences for violent, firearm-related and sexual crimes.



On climate change, the New Conservatives are **the only party who would pull out of the Kyoto and Paris Agreements** , saying they would instead invest the money into much-needed R&D at home.



Both the National Party and ACT support the UN climate change agenda, but ACT would scale down our financial contributions by tying our carbon price to the prices paid in our top five trading partners.



 **On free speech ACT’s David Seymour has been a lone but loud voice in the house.**



On Israel, the Nats lost voters when they supported UN Security Council Resolution 2334 concerning the Israeli settlements in “Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem”. Later Simon Bridges did a u-turn and admitted they got this wrong, but then negated his newfound insight by unnecessarily reiterating “Israel [doesn’t get] a free pass to act disproportionately against Human Rights” **.**



At the time David Seymour and Winston Peters criticized the government for supporting the resolution and Peters felt strongly enough about it to insert a clause into the Labour-NZ First coalition agreement saying the new government “will record a Cabinet minute regarding the **lack of process** followed before the National-led government’s sponsorship of UNSC2334”.



The New Conservatives go much further, promising to open a NZ embassy, recognise Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, apologise for Resolution 2334 and strengthen our ties with Israel.



The party that ticks most boxes of interest to me is New Conservative but their first hurdle is achieving 5%, and after that entering into a coalition agreement that doesn’t strip them of their core values, remembering that MMP can turn any party into muppets.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s Süddeutsche Zeitung reports the latest development on the Umweltbundesamt (UBA) scandal.
Recently Germany’s version of the Environmental Protection Agency (UBA) published a 120-page brochure that publicly named and branded renowned skeptic US and German journalists and scientists because they “did not conform to the level of climate science knowledge“.

Minister of Bullying? Environment Minister Peter Altmaier defends blacklist. Photo credit: Rudolf Simon, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license.
Two of the science journalists named in the UBA brochure are Michael Miersch, editor at FOCUS, and Dirk Maxeiner. The Süddeutsche Zeitung asks in its commentary whether it’s okay “for the state to publicly brand them” and if it is “the function of a state agency to grade the work of journalists and to do so publicly?
Journalists suing Environment Ministry
The Süddeutsche Zeitung writes that the story has now entered the legal phase, with journalists Michael Miersch and Dirk Maxeiner suing the German Environment Ministry for refusing to cease and desist distributing the controversial brochure. The Süddeutsche writes:
They are taking the matter to court because the agency has refused to sign a cease and desist declaration, and is continuing to distribute the brochure in the Internet. He doesn’t want to be ‘officially stamped as not serious‘, said Miersch. Moreover, the science journalist is annoyed that the agency wants to end the debate on climate change: ‘Declaring a debate ended goes against the spirit of science. Anyone who says that the end of the debate has been reached is peddling theology.'”
Environment Minister Peter Altmaier, whose Ministry oversees the UBA, defended the brochure. The Süddeutsche Zeitung quotes Altmaier insisting that the Ministry “is not imposing any thought, speech, writing or other ban.” Federal Environment Minister Peter Altmaier told Welt am Sonntag that he saw “no reason for criticism” and: “We are simply saying that from time to time there are positions that do not agree with the overwhelming majority of scientists.”
Bad enough that Altmaier doesn’t see anything false with wrongly ruining reputations, but he also appears totally misinformed here. Perhaps someone forgot to tell him about all the scientific papers out there showing that the science is more disputed than ever, and that Cook’s 97% consensus-claiming paper is fatally flawed. One has to wonder about Altmaier‘s information supply.
Pattern of bullying throughout the science supply chain
Marginalizing dissenting views and intimidating uncooperative journalists and scientists is not only a practice that was recently used by the German Environment Ministry in the form of its UBA brochure, but it is also one that had been widely used by its main supplier for scientific information: Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute of Climate Impact Research.
Two years ago a court in Cologne ordered Rahmstorf to cease and desist spreading “false assertions” about science journalist Irene Meichsner who earlier had written a highly critical article on IPCC science.
In a February 20, 2011 blog commentary, Rahmstorf wrote that the journalist’s story represented:
…a media scandal where a few journalists mislead the public with completely exaggerated or freely made up pseudo-scandals. Too many among them are naive and go along without seeing through the farce.”

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




Background of that story here. Meichsner took Rahmstorf to court and won.
Thus bullying and intimidation of critics seems to have become a pattern throughout the entire science information supply chain of the German Environment Ministry.
Ministry may have committed a number of violations
What are the chances of success for the journalists against the Ministry of Environment in a court of law?
First off, the Ministry of Environment may have violated its rules for neutrality. Legal professor Thorsten Koch of the University of Osnabrück recently wrote that he believes the “Federal Environment Agency violated the rules of neutrality”. Koch explains that the government is allowed to participate and take a position on the climate issue, but adds:
Strange however that a government office is attempting to bindingly specify the state of knowledge in a scientific question. That is the job of a scientist. Even more it is neither scientifically or legally appropriate if scientific truths – and thus ultimately only the current state of the error – are announced with official authority.
Deciding scientific controversies is no duty of the state. The attempt we have here by the Environment Agency to decide a scientific controversy is in this form unique.”

And there’s “official state defamation”. Koch wrote:
The pamphlet is a product of official state action in which in one sense the claims that contradict the ‘scientific consensus’ made by ‘climate change skeptics’ (p. 110) are polemicized. Even the ZDF public television website ‘heute.de’ diagnosed it as ‘official state defamation’. This makes the matter legally questionable.”
It’s very difficult to predict the outcome of any legal battle.
German Association Of Journalists demands apology
Finally the German Association of Journalists demands an apology from Minister Altmaier, writing:
A state agency in Germany does not have the authority to brand critics of government policy as heretics and that Peter Altmaier “stop the distribution of the brochure in its current form and to apologise to the journalists named in the pamphlet.”
The pressure is mounting.

A proposed plan to save the planet, an opinion piece on _Stuff_ , is completely backwards facing. Apparently, the only way to save the planet (or at least just Wellington) is to **regress our modern-day** society into a world from the past and to “behave better” – whatever that means.



Now don’t get me wrong, there are parts of the past that I quite, like such as stable nuclear families where children were brought up with both a Mum and a Dad, but other aspects of the past are frankly revolting. I wouldn’t accept regressing to the bad old days where teeth were pulled without anaesthetic and I am not at all keen on going to visit my friends on a bicycle or, even worse, having to walk! Public transport is for other people, not me, thanks, as unless you live in a well-planned city like Melbourne where you can catch a train anywhere easily, public transport is unreliable and generally useless. Just ask any Aucklander.



  
[…] The Wellington city approach mirrors that of many other councils and national government. We will behave better. **We will walk and cycle a lot more, use public transport a lot more.** There will be a big investment in public transport infrastructure. And **we will buy electric cars.**  
  
  
[…] Too often transport-change plans assume that people are just “naughty” and make poor travel choices. All that is needed is exhortation to better behaviours. But from the research I was involved in, my conclusion is that where people live and how they travel is a rational decision made on the basis of the real settings at play. **Exhortation and environmental concern play little part in that choice.**  




Tell me something I don’t know. If public transport is accessible to where people live and takes them to where they want to go on time and efficiently, some of them will use it to take them to work. That is not something that can be created in an existing city. It is not something that can be implemented quickly either. **A city has to be planned before it is even built** , like Melbourne, if public transport is to be of any use whatsoever. It also helps if the city is very flat. 



_THEREFORE, IF WE WANT REAL DRAMATIC CHANGE, WE NEED TO PROVIDE A DRAMATIC CHANGE TO THOSE SETTINGS UNDER WHICH PEOPLE LIVE. WHAT IS NEEDED IS A HIGHLY VIABLE ALTERNATIVE, THAT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED QUICKLY._



 _MY APPROACH FOR THAT ALTERNATIVE IS TO USE OUR EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE IN A MORE EFFECTIVE WAY, SO AVOIDING THE DELAY AND COST OF NEW INFRASTRUCTURE._  
 _WE NEED TO **REPLACE ABOUT 90 PER CENT OF THE 378,000 VEHICLES** THAT MAKE UP THE PRIVATE LIGHT VEHICLE FLEET OF THE WELLINGTON REGION. **WITH THE ROADS NOW CLEARED,** A HIGH-QUALITY PUBLIC TRANSPORT SYSTEM BASED ON ABOUT 1500 BATTERY ELECTRIC BUSES COULD OPERATE VERY EFFECTIVELY._



Now he is just being silly. The rest of his suggestions are all about trying to make buses more efficient and about electric cars replacing the bulk of Wellington’s private car fleet. Of course, if electric cars replace normal cars then **how exactly will that clear the roads?**



  
  
[…] _THE CHANGE **WILL HAVE SOME NEGATIVE IMPACTS,** ESPECIALLY ON THE CAR SUPPORT SECTOR, BUT ALSO MANY BENEFITS, INCLUDING FREEING UP LARGE TRACTS OF CBD AND CBD FRINGE LAND WHICH COULD BE USED FOR INNER CITY LIVING. _



Someone tell him he’s dreaming. Do we really want to cost people jobs just so that some latte-sipping arty types can live in the CBD?



 _[…] SUCH A DRAMATIC CHANGE IN TRANSPORT OBVIOUSLY NEEDS THE AGREEMENT OF THE COMMUNITY, BUT IMPLICIT IN THAT AGREEMENT IS THAT **REMAINING CARS WILL BE THE SECONDARY FORM OF TRANSPORT** AND **RESTRICTED** IN THEIR USE.[…]_



And there we have it. Scratch the surface and we have someone **keen to restrict our freedoms** for the so-called greater good. He will be wanting to turn the motorway into a horse lane next.

"**The mass Covid testing of students, so they can go home safely for the Christmas break, is starting at many universities across the UK.**
Universities are opening temporary testing centres where hundreds of thousands of students will be checked for Covid this week before they leave.
Students have been asked to take two tests, three days apart.
If they test negative, many students will leave university in the ""travel window"" starting from 3 December.
But testing is voluntary and it will not be available in all universities.
The UCU lecturers' union has warned about the reliability of the testing plans and says there could be ""chaos"".
Caleb Shaw, a journalism student at the University of the West of England in Bristol, is taking a test on Monday.
""I know I'm less likely to get seriously ill with it,"" he says, but he wants to get a test to protect his family.
""If I get a test then I can make sure I don't bring it home to them. It would be stupid to not take advantage of it,"" Caleb says.
The university is using its sports centre as a temporary testing site until 6 December with 90 staff and students helping with the testing process.
Inshaal Ahmad, a students' union sabbatical officer at the University of Bradford, says most students seem supportive of the testing.
He says many students at Bradford live in multi-generational households, including older relatives, and want to ""be on the safe side"" and not risk bringing the virus back from university.
Testing at Bradford will continue until 6 December and as with other universities, booking slots for tests will also be a way of staggering the times when students can leave, within the ""travel window"" that ends on 9 December.
The mass testing is intended to reduce the risk of spreading coronavirus as students travel away from their term-time addresses.
Sports halls and rooms on campus are being converted into testing centres, where students will take ""lateral flow"" swab tests, which will provide results within an hour, with the outcome sent by email or text.
Two tests are recommended to increase accuracy - and students will be expected to travel soon after a second negative result, with students in England and Wales encouraged to leave within 24 hours.
If students get a positive result, they will have to take another test to confirm - and if they have coronavirus they will have to stay and self-isolate.
Most universities are providing testing - 130 ""expressed an interest"" in taking part in the scheme, according to the Department for Health and Social Care.
But the National Union of Students says there should be capacity for all students who want a test to get one before Christmas.
""We are not aware of how universities will decide which students are tested if testing is oversubscribed,"" says the NUS.
The UCU lecturers' union says the approach to testing has been rushed and confused and the last-minute arrangements will be a ""recipe for chaos"".
The union said it had ""grave concerns"" and ""testing so many people and following necessary safety measures would be an extremely challenging operation"".
But not all universities in Northern Ireland are planning to offer testing.
""Testing will help to break the line of transmission amongst students, especially when they are infected but are not aware of it,"" said Professor Steve West, vice chancellor at the University of the West of England.
Bradford's vice chancellor, Professor Shirley Congdon, told students the tests ""offer extra assurance to you, your families, friends and community"".â¨"
"In making his landmark post-Brexit speech in February under Sir James Thornhill’s baroque painted ceiling in the Royal Hospital, Greenwich, Boris Johnson believed he had found the perfect setting to paint his own picture of Britain charting a new course as a free-trading, independent, open and liberal nation. Like the painting above him, eulogising the triumph of William and Mary over the popish and tyrannical French, Johnson’s speech was an optimistic and patriotic piece of work. It offered a distinctive vision of British prosperity and diplomatic superiority.  The speech had no hint that the world he described, and Britain’s place in it, was under any existential threat. But the past three months have left UK foreign policy thinkers suddenly searching in the fog for Britain’s future role in this changed world. Indeed, as the UK prepares to celebrate VE Day, the institutional order created by the west following the defeat of Germany, and on which Johnson’s vision rested, seems after 75 years finally to be coming apart. Those institutions, in which the UK thrived, are either paralysed, or a battleground. Covid-19, an invisible enemy, but deadlier than the blitz, has exacerbated and accelerated trends recalibrating risk, revealing new Great Powers and placing all UK diplomatic alliances under scrutiny. Sir Simon McDonald, the foreign office senior mandarin, says it is a “watershed moment for humanity”, and a chance for “a world reset”. Ministers have postponed the foreign and security policy review, due to have been published this autumn, to devote time to fighting the virus. Yet the UK’s most senior diplomats, including at foreign office executive committee level, are already examining Britain’s strategic posture. The question of the UK’s greatest ally, the US, currently, in the words of the former foreign secretary David Miliband, “a flagship for dysfunction” can be set aside until the US elections. For most British analysts, the most pressing foreign policy question for the UK will be its relations with China. Will the divisions between the US and China deepen so much that, regardless of the outcome of the US election, all nations, including the UK, are sucked into its vortex, requiring Britain to choose? If so, multilateral solutions become harder. Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, has spoken of the need for “a deep dive” into the role of China, adding vaguely: “We cannot have business as usual.” The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has backed an inquiry. The mood towards Beijing on the Tory benches, already sceptical, is turning ugly and suggests at minimum that the Huawei deal will not survive in its current form, placing other Chinese infrastructure projects in the UK at question. “We are all paying the price for Beijing’s decision to ignore the science, prioritise trade – and put the rest of the world’s health at risk,” says Tom Tugendhat, the liberal internationalist chair of the foreign affairs select committee. His committee is relentlessly pressing the foreign office for clear strategy on China. It’s clear that his committee will at minimum demand the UK adopt takeover rules that sees Chinese investment as a security risk. Nick Timothy, Theresa May’s former special adviser and a long-term China sceptic, has lambasted “David Cameron’s Operation Kowtow” and identified the chief culprit as George Osborne and the Treasury. He says: “Just as Harold Macmillan had perceived that, as British power declined, we should play Athens to America’s Rome, Mr Osborne thought he could pull off a geopolitical pivot that would strengthen Britain for decades to come.” Echoing the US State Department, Timothy adds: “It is surely now obvious that China is also a strategic rival to the west as a whole. It is an autocratic and oppressive state, with wildly different values and interests to our own. Its policy towards Asia, Africa and elsewhere is inevitably imperialistic. And its modus operandi – setting debt traps for countries to gain leverage over them and engaging in mass industrial espionage – is a danger to our interests and those of our allies.” In this context, British alliances with Japan and South Korea, rivals to China, will be at a premium. But a faultline on China is emerging in the Tory party. The Foreign Office is urging caution, making the case for keeping a few bridges unburnt. The former foreign secretary Lord Hague told Policy Exchange: “We can’t solve global problems without China. And global problems are some of our most pressing and obviously most existential. The Covid-19 crisis is an example of such a dramatic world crisis. So we can’t be dependent on China, but we can’t be without a framework of cooperation with China.” McDonald agrees: “There is no problem that the world faces today that can be addressed, still less solved, without the active participation of China.” Miliband also argues that a balance needs striking. He says he has no illusions about China. “It is obvious that the Chinese state is being very confident in its response to Covid-19, describing it both as a success and the product of its one-party system. Their message is being effectively delivered – through aid supplies and diplomatic outreach around the world. It is much harsher than before, with crackdowns at home and favour-buying abroad.” But that does not mean cooperation with China should be seen as appeasement, Miliband argues. “We need to worry about a democratic recession, and the debate about whether democracies or autocracies coped best in this crisis is materially relevant to lives around the world, but it is really important this debate does end up excluding the need for institutions that encompass both democratic and autocratic regimes.” China is not just a seminar discussion for the UK. Britain needs China on board if its chairmanship of the UN climate change conference, set for Glasgow in November but now delayed until the middle of next year, is to be a success. Even now the best UK diplomats are pressing China to adopt bolder carbon emission targets for 2030. McDonald has said he hopes the coronavirus crisis will lead to greater Chinese ambition. “Build back better” has long been part of UK disaster relief thinking, and has now become the slogan of those preparing green post-coronavirus stimulation packages. But there are countervailing forces. Many of the building blocks for Glasgow have been removed. An EU-China meet-up scheduled for September and seen as a moment for China to float new targets has been cancelled. A Chinese-hosted conference on biodiversity, a chance to discuss carbon sinks and nature based solutions, has also been postponed, while governments are under pressure to save industries such as aviation. Above all, even under a Democrat presidency, relations between China and the US will be on a downward curve, making a climate change agreement more difficult. Tim Benton, head of the Chatham House energy and environment programme, foresees an uphill task for Britain’s diplomats. He argues that: “Any tension that undermines the existing international architecture – whether it is WTO, WHO, UNFCCC [the UN framework convention on climate change] – anything that creates stress is going to get in the way of reaching climate change targets. “You can imagine there is so much to-ing and fro-ing between major powers vying for their own nationalistic interest that climate change just gets pushed further down the agenda because economic reconstruction is seen as so much more important.” Economic reconstruction leads to the Brexit question. For many diplomats, the thought of piling a no-deal Brexit on to a £300bn coronavirus hit to the UK economy looks less like an act of self-harm, and more like a death wish. McDonald, speaking to the foreign affairs select committee, held out the faint hope that it was still an open question whether the PM might yet revisit the timetable. Robin Niblett, Chatham House director, senses Johnson will not delay, but instead look for a short-form agreement. “If you think that by the summer, the politics may get nastier with inquests about how we got into quite such a mess, and the money for what was called levelling up has been diverted to survival – the survival of businesses and the economy – then Johnson may feel politically he has to follow through on Brexit. Once you delay, you lose your agency and Brexit is about agency, as much as it is about control.” Miliband predicts the UK and the EU might settle for an outline deal that leaves details to be negotiated. Either way, the integrated review will have to work with changed assumptions about both resources and security. “The budget for global Britain promises to be brutal,” Niblett says. In the UK, growth is due to fall 7% this year. The World Trade Organization sees world trade declining by between 13% and 34%. Covid’s lasting legacy may be a switch away from just-in-time imports towards shorter supply chains and national sourcing. In this deglobalising world, Johnson’s promise in Greenwich to be “a superhero champion” of free trade looks incongruous. The US – with which the UK seeks to sign a signature free-trade deal – is in free fall. Yet Johnson fervently believes that the coronavirus only strengthens the case for a free-trade deal. Any scrap of extra growth becomes important. At the same time, definitions of security are in flux. In the view of Professor Malcolm Chalmers, deputy director of the defence thinktank the Royal United Services Institute, the virus ranks alongside the cold war or 9/11 in terms of its security implications. The original concept of the walled state as protector has been reasserted, but the case for traditional defence spending has weakened. The army has had its role in the UK crisis, but the aircraft carrier has proved irrelevant, acting as much as an incubator as a shield from the virus. If the new stealth bomber is a pathogen, vaccines are the new missile defence system. In a post-coronavirus comprehensive spending review it will be health and not defence that will be first in the queue for the distribution of dwindling resources, Chalmers suggests. Beatrice Heuser, professor of international relations at Glasgow University, predicts defence officials “will have to cook their books like hell to reach the Nato target of spending at 2% of GDP”. There is a final issue for Britain: relevance. Many analysts also fear that the UK’s credibility as a leading convening power on the whole nexus of issues of the climate crisis, global health and development has taken a hit by its performance over coronavirus. Bill Gates may right to say that no country is likely to get an A grade for its pandemic preparedness, but judging by the European press the UK is currently near the bottom of the class, labelled, rightly or wrongly, as leading on “herd immunity” and then abandoning the policy. Niblett argues that “Brexit was such a shock to people that thought Britain was pragmatic and had a sense of its national interest. Now the almost wilful lack of preparation over coronavirus makes it feel like Britain just assumed it was separate, an island off the coast of Europe, and it has discovered it is not. It does play into a lethal combination of incompetence and hubris that has been used against Britain for a while now. “On global health we will have taken a knock. Even though our scientific and university calling card remains unparalleled, the NHS was held up to a mirror and it has been shown at best to be underfunded. We could be put into an Anglo–US box of just-in-time living, and that seems less worthy of imitation. Soft power is all about attraction and people wishing to imitate you.” Miliband also issues a warning that Britain will need to be “brutally honest about its mistakes or risk irrelevance”. He sees one cause of optimism. “This may be the first global crisis where it is British universities seeking a vaccine, British companies developing contact tracing apps, British NGOs framing global connections. It is these institutions that may lead government rather than government provide the lead.” The Foreign Office is also urging Johnson to recognise there is a hard-won reputation on which he can draw. As far back as 2008, the UK government published a cross-government white paper entitled “health is global”. The paper argued that health should be seen as “an agent for good in foreign policy” so the UK was in at the birth of health diplomacy. The UK may have been trounced in the election to head the WHO in 2017, but there are influential Brits all around the international health set-up. UK’s strong medical research base, large aid budget and an interventionist mindset gives Johnson the platform from which to engage. The natural instinct within Whitehall is to be a player, but it will require leadership that only a prime minister can provide. Greenwich, according to Nicholas Hawksmoor, writing in 1728, was chosen as the site of Royal Hospital because it was located on the bend in the river “in the View of all the World and in the Sight of the Grand Emporium London”. The nation’s wealth and global outlook were seen as interdependent. It will be up to Johnson to decide if and how he honours that tradition."
"The surge of interest in British shale oil and gas has focused on central Scotland in recent days. A forward look at national planning to 2019 was published by the Scottish government on June 23. It has been followed by the release of a British Geological Survey (BGS) assessment of unconventional resources in place.   From the historical evidence, Scotland had good prospects in shale hydrocarbons. The region west of Edinburgh created the oil shale industry of James “Paraffin” Young, who mined organic shale from two-metre-thick seams. He refined a multitude of products from oils to soaps, which lit and cleaned his customers.  Along the way Young invented the first incarnation of the vertically integrated oil company, from resource to consumer, which still makes multinational profits today. Central Scotland also has a history of small-scale gas production, from coals and from isolated conventional sandstones.  So clearly a hydrocarbon system has been “worked” in the past. But even before the BGS report we knew from the geology that the 2km to 4km thicknesses of Bowland shale in England was not present, and the geographic area was smaller. Sure enough, the report indicates that we are not now heading for a new North Sea-style oil rush as predicted by some commentators for the “large and uninhabited and desolate areas” of the Bowland basin in Lancashire, Yorkshire and Northumberland.  Instead, Scotland looks more like a slow-burning fuse leading to a potentially useful, but less-than-spectacular outcome, like the Weald in Kent. Is exploitation of these Scottish shale oil and gas deposits worth the effort, and can it be achieved with minimal environmental and community impact? The estimate of resources in place by the BGS is smaller than that for Bowland –- 80.3 trillion cubic feet of gas (compared to 1300 trillion cubic feet in Bowland) and six billion barrels of oil (versus 4.3 billion in western Bowland). This Scottish shale oil is potentially the real prize, being at shallow geological depths and in restricted geographic areas.  As with all such estimates the potential recovery rate is unknown. It is typically taken to be 10% of the hydrocarbon present. For gas that means about 20 years’ supply for the entire Scottish requirement of current gas use -– or more realistically maybe 15% of Scottish supply for 100 to 140 years. It is also worth bearing in mind that the current reports are focused only on central Scotland. Potentially suitable geology exists in small or thin quantities around the offshore Clyde and Forth estuaries, the Moray Firth, Orkney, and the inner Hebrides - which could potentially supply gas for local use. The Scottish government has control of surface land use, environmental regulation, and planning – although ownership and exploration of deep hydrocarbons remains with Westminster. Not surprisingly given the different approaches to energy from the two jurisdictions, Scotland looks to be heading down its own route here. Rather than the “most favourable world regime” to encourage drilling and production promoted for England, the Scottish planning approach so far is more cautious. The Scottish government’s planning proposals have been influenced by experience with onshore wind developments. The proposals include negotiating on a case-by-case basis to leave “buffer zones” between a drilling site and the nearest human residents; specifically enforcing dialogue and consensus with local communities; robust risk assessments; and much more explicit protection for wild land, including a “green network” in central Scotland.   None of these hurdles are particularly tough or unusual. Any reputable developer used to shepherding onshore wind proposals through planning in Scotland would expect all of them. Yet it does seem to signal that Scotland is heading towards a more environmentally inclusive treatment of unconventional hydrocarbons than the aggressive push for speed delivered from Westminster.  How then would a considerate and wise developer attempt to proceed?  The first essential would be to gain the exploration rights, so we can expect to see some competitive interest over bidding for perceived hot spots in the forthcoming 14th onshore licensing round.  Then there is a need for real and specific information. In spite of its long history of coal mining, there is very little modern information in central Scotland from boreholes recovering rock core, or regional seismic reflection images deeper than 1km, so surveying and exploratory drilling is probable (and has taken place to a limited extent already).  Developers will have a mountain to climb in terms of providing information to the affected public – who in many cases have already been heavily conditioned by environmental interest groups and scary stories from parts of the USA with lax legislation.  While several boreholes in central Scotland have already been fracked, it’s clear that perceptions have changed. Much better surveying, information, and monitoring of existing baseline conditions will be required before any serious commercial operation gains consent.  Supposing that local public consent is achieved, is it “right” to extract and use shale hydrocarbons? A report in 2013 by the chief scientist of the UK department of energy and climate change made clear that there is no guarantee that unconventional hydrocarbons will reduce the UK’s carbon footprint, and indeed are likely to increase the world’s global carbon emissions.  And if “fugitive” leaks of methane occur from poorly engineered onshore drilling and production, the reported national emissions of Scotland could increase. That’s a difficult situation for a country seeking to deliver the world’s most ambitious carbon reductions. So carbon cleanup has to be an essential part of the deal.  There would seem to be three main options. First, the English model – drill and extract as fast as possible, using multinational corporations as the workforce, and hope that the lower-cost energy and taxes on production are a sufficient recompense.  Second is a conditional acceptance that extracting a fossil resource for a limited timespan could provide a one-off injection of wealth into a community, which could enable development of genuinely sustainable industries.  That might include considering that the chances of keeping a skilled petrochemicals industry with Ineos at the Grangemouth petrochemical plants and refinery complex would benefit from the security of lower-cost feedstock for the next decades (Ineos recently signed a deal to import fracked gas from the US from 2016-17).  Grangemouth’s petrochemicals plant produces two million tonnes of products annually, so if Scotland’s produceable shale oil were directed to Ineos, that is a 40-year life of low-cost feedstock. The price of feedstock is 50%-70% of bulk chemicals costs, so that would enable a globally competitive site to continue operations.  Using shale oil in industry could also solve an emissions problem, as fitting carbon capture onto these centralised larger industrial units makes Scottish unconventional oil production a low emissions proposition, secure against future climate legislation. By contrast, extracting shale gas to burn for heat and power looks like a low value proposition, with hard-to-control extra emissions. Or third, Scotland could choose to make a divestment statement and keep that fossil carbon in the ground. Option two provisionally looks most wise to me. Knowledge of, and confidence in, an assessment, drilling and extraction system can be developed slowly during five to 10 years of preparatory and test drilling investigation work, required before any production could get underway.  Not only does this potentially benefit the likes of Grangemouth, it also establishes a system for what comes after shale gas and oil – underground coal gasification – where very large Scottish resources are probable in the upper, mid and outer Forth, the Clyde and Canonbie. Drilling to convert those coals into gas deep below ground needs even more work to develop, but could provide domestic carbon resources into the medium future, potentially replacing the North Sea.  Being able to extract that much fossil hydrocarbon requires that environmental quality and carbon cleanup are essential, and are explicitly built in to any proposals. So if Scotland starts that now with shale oil, and keeps its renewable ambitions intact to develop home-grown secure low carbon electricity, the direction of travel could be about right. "
"**Two new mass testing programmes for Covid-19 are under way in a bid to drive down infection rates before Christmas.**
Testing of Scotland's university students is beginning in an effort to make sure they are safe to return home.
And residents in five coronavirus hotspots are being targeted as part of a trial mass testing programme.
They include communities in areas of Glasgow, Ayrshire, Clackmannanshire and Renfrewshire.
Experts say the community testing could cut the chain of transmission by identifying asymptomatic cases of coronavirus.
The tests are being carried out in parts of Scotland were public health officials consider the numbers are ""stubbornly high"".
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said they would help inform decisions about expanding community testing ""much more extensively"" in the New Year.
She added: ""It's important to stress that any test will only tell you if you are positive at that point in time, when you are being tested - they will not necessarily show up if you are still incubating the virus.
""So they do not mean you can or should stop following all the other safety measures in place.""
The testing of students is part of a separate programme designed to minimise the spread of Covid-19 as many of them prepare to return home for Christmas.
All students are being asked to take two rapid lateral flow device (LFD) tests before travelling.
The tests should be taken three days apart and if they are both negative they will be encouraged to go home as soon as possible.
If either test is positive, the student will be asked to self-isolate.
Positive cases should also take a more reliable PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test through NHS Test & Protect.
It is thought about 80,000 students could be planning a trip home during the winter break.
NUS Scotland president Matt Crilly said he ""strongly encouraged"" any student moving household over the holidays to get tested.
They are rapid turnaround tests, where samples are processed on-site with no lab required and results are available in under half an hour.
They have allowed the introduction of mass testing but they are not as accurate as the PCR tests that are carried at NHS test centres.
Health Secretary Jeane Freeman told parliament this week the lateral flow tests had an overall sensitivity of 76.8% - meaning the test will identify more than seven in 10 positive cases of Covid.
Students are encourage to take two tests to increase the chances of the virus being picked up.
Ms Sturgeon said the tests ""produce results much more quickly"" and are ""potentially very useful"", but that any positive results would be confirmed via PCR testing.
The LFD tests being given to students have been criticised by Allyson Pollock, Professor of Public Health at Newcastle University.
Prof Pollock told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme they can result in 50% of cases being missed, leading to a ""false reassurance"".
""The other big issue for students is they're not being given good information about the purpose of test, what a test means and the fact it could result in a false reassurance and a false negative.""
Prof Pollock said that students should be self-isolating if they were returning to households with vulnerable people.
But Scotland's national clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch, said lateral flow testing could detect four out of five positive cases, despite the test's sensitivity level being between 50% and 70%.
""There is an element of false reassurance... but this is the tech we have available. So until the tech gets better, surely we should use the tech as good as we've got for the best purpose it has?""
He told BBC Scotland that students were not being told to isolate for two weeks when they got home ""as that wouldn't be much of a Christmas"".
""[The guidance] does tell them to turn down their social interaction now in order to be safe when they go home to their parents, their grandparents, their siblings,"" he added.
""Testing is not the umbrella around which we've based our student guidance, quite the opposite. The student guidance is all about communication, empathy, working with the student population - and element of that will be testing.""
Universities minister Richard Lochhead said all 19 higher education institutions in Scotland were taking part in the testing programme, with some sharing facilities.
He said the aim was to minimise the risk of students taking the virus back home to their families.
Mr Lochhead said there was a good probability the virus would be captured by the test but other safety measures such as limiting mixing with other students were also very important.
St Andrews opened its testing centre over the weekend.
Alastair Merrill, the university's vice-principal, said it would be able to process 1,500 lateral flow tests a day.
He said: ""We are keeping the centre open until the end of semester so as many students as possible have the opportunity to get their two tests before travelling home for Christmas.""
Mr Merrill said there had been a ""spike"" in Covid case at the start of term in September, particularly among first-year students.
He said there had been 100 cases in total, most in private student accommodation.
""We have been very successful in containing the spread,"" he said. ""There has been no evidence of spread in classrooms or education settings.""
He also said there was no evidence of any transmission from students to the wider community.
Mr Merrill said he thought that a similar approach to mass testing would be an important part of bringing students back to the university after the Christmas break."

A few weeks ago I wrote a piece highlighting a comment made in the Hansen et al. paper, “Earth’s Energy Imbalance and Implications“, by James Hansen et al. (hereinafter H2011). Some folks said I should take a real look at Hansen’s paper, so I have done so twice, first a quick look at “Losing Your Imbalance“, and now this study. The claims and conclusions of the H2011 study are based mainly on the ocean heat content (OHC), as measured in large part by the data from the Argo floats, so I thought I should look at that data. The Argo temperature and salinity measurements form a great dataset that gives us much valuable information about the ocean. The H2011 paper utilizes the recent results from “How well can we derive Global Ocean Indicators from Argo data?“, by K. von Schuckmann and P.-Y. Le Traon. (SLT2011)
Figure 1. Argo float. Complete float is about 2 metres (6′) tall. SOURCE: Wikipedia
The Argo floats are diving floats that operate on their own. Each float measures one complete vertical temperature profile every ten days. The vertical profile goes down to either to 1,000 or 2,000 metres depth. It reports each dive’s results by satellite before the next dive.
Unfortunately, as used in H2011, the Argo data suffers from some problems. The time span of the dataset is very short. The changes are quite small. The accuracy is overestimated.  Finally, and most importantly, the investigators are using the wrong method to analyze the Argo data.

First, the length of the dataset. The SLT2011 data used by Hansen is only 72 months long. This limits the conclusions we can draw from the data. H2011 gets around that by only showing a six-year moving average of not only this data, but all the data he used. I really don’t like it when raw data is not shown, only smoothed data as Hansen has done.
Second, the differences are quite small. Here is the record as shown in SLT2011. They show the data as annual changes in upper ocean heat content (OHC) in units of joules.  I have converted OHC change (Joules/m2) to units of degrees Celsius change for the water they are measuring, which is a metre-square column of water 1,490 metres deep. As you can see, SLT2011 is discussing very small temperature variations. The same is true of the H2011 paper.
Figure 2. Upper ocean temperatures from Schuckmann & Le Traon, 2011 (SLT2011). Grey bars show one sigma errors of the data. Red line is a 17-point Gaussian average. Vertical red line shows the error of the Gaussian average at the boundary of the dataset (95% CI). Data digitized from SLT2011, Figure 5 b), available as a comma-separated text file here.
There are a few things of note in the dataset. First, we’re dealing with minuscule temperature changes. The length of the gray bars shows that SLT2011 claims that we can measure the temperature of the upper kilometer and a half of the ocean with an error (presumably one sigma) of only ± eight thousandths of a degree … 
Now, I hate to argue from incredulity, and I will give ample statistical reasons further down, but frankly, Scarlett … eight thousandths of a degree error in the measurement of the monthly average temperature of the top mile of water of almost the entire ocean? Really? They believe they can measure the ocean temperature to that kind of precision, much less accuracy?
I find that very difficult to believe. I understand the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem and how that gives us extra leverage, but I find the idea that we can measure the temperature of four hundred million cubic kilometres of ocean water to a precision of ± eight thousandths of a degree to be … well, let me call it unsubstantiated. Others who have practical experience in measuring the temperatures of liquids to less than a hundredth of a degree, feel free to chime in, but to me that seems like a bridge way too far. Yes, there are some 2,500 Argo floats out there, and on a map the ocean looks pretty densely sampled. Figure 3 shows where the Argo floats were in 2011.
Figure 3. Locations of Argo floats, 2011. SOURCE
But that’s just a chart. The world is unimaginably huge. In the real ocean, down to a kilometer and a half of depth, that’s one Argo thermometer for each 165,000 cubic kilometers of water … I’m not sure how to give an idea of just how big that is. Let’s try it this way. Lake Superior is the largest lake in the Americas, visible even on the world map above. How accurately could you measure the average monthly temperature of the entire volume of Lake Superior with one Argo float? Sure, you can let it bob up and down, and drift around the lake, it will take three vertical profiles a month. But even then, every measurement it will only cover a tiny part of the entire lake.
But it’s worse for Argo. Each of the Argo floats, each dot in Figure 3, is representing a volume as large as 13 Lake Superiors … with one lonely Argo thermometer …
Or we could look at it another way. There were about 2,500 Argo floats in operation over the period covered by SLT2011. The area of the ocean is about 360 million square km. So each Argo float represents an area of about 140,000 square kilometres, which is a square about 380 km (240 mi) on each side. One Argo float for all of that. Ten days for each dive cycle, wherein the float goes down to about 1000 metres and stays there for nine days. Then it either rises from there, or it descends to about 2,000 metres, then rises to the surface at about 10 cm (4″) per second over about six hours profiling the temperature and salinity as it rises. So we get three vertical temperature profiles from 0-1,000 or 0-1,500 or 0-2,000 metres each month depending on the particular float, to cover an area of 140,000 square kilometres … I’m sorry, but three vertical temperature profiles per month to cover an area of 60,000 square miles and a mile deep doesn’t scream “thousandths of a degree temperature accuracy” to me.
Here’s a third way to look at the size of the measurement challenge. For those who have been out of sight of land in a small boat, you know how big the ocean looks from the deck? Suppose the deck of the boat is a metre (3′) above the water, and you stand up on deck and look around. Nothing but ocean stretching all the way to the horizon, a vast immensity of water on all sides. How many thermometer readings would it take to get the monthly average temperature of just the ocean you can see, to the depth of one mile? I would say … more than one.
Now, consider that each Argo float has to cover an area that is more than 2,000 times the area of the ocean you can see from your perch standing there on deck … and the float is making three dives per month … how well do the measurements encompass and represent the reality?
There is another difficulty. Figure 2 shows that most of the change over the period occurred in a single year, from about mid 2007 to mid 2008. The change in forcing required to change the temperature of a kilometre and a half of water that much is about 2 W/m2 for that year-long period. The “imbalance”, to use Hansen’s term, is even worse when we look at the amount of energy required to warm the upper ocean from May 2007 to August 2008. That requires a global “imbalance” of about 2.7 W/m2 over that period.
Now, if that were my dataset, the first thing I’d be looking at is what changed in mid 2007. Why did the global “imbalance” suddenly jump to 2.7 W/m2? And more to the point, why did the upper ocean warm, but not the surface temperature?
I don’t have any answers to those questions, my first guess would be “clouds” … but before I used that dataset, I’d want to go down that road to find out why the big jump in 2007. What changed, and why? If our interest is in global “imbalance”, there’s an imbalance to study.
(In passing, let me note that there is an incorrect simplifying assumption to eliminate ocean heat content in order to arrive at the canonical climate equation. That canonical equation is
Change In Temperature = Sensitivity times Change In Forcing
The error is to assume that the change in oceanic heat content (OHC) is a linear function of surface temperature change ∆T. It is not, as the Argo data confirms … I discussed this error in a previous post, “The Cold Equations“.  But I digress …)
The SLT2011 Argo record also has an oddity shared by some other temperature records. The swing in the whole time period is about a hundredth of a degree. The largest one-year jump in the data is about a hundredth of a degree. The largest one-month jump in the data is about a hundredth of a degree. When short and long time spans show the same swings, it’s hard to say a whole lot about the data. It makes the data very difficult to interpret. For example, the imbalance necessary to give the largest one-month change in OHC is about 24 W/m2. Before moving forwards, changes in OHC like that would be worth looking at to see a) if they’re real and b) if so, what changed, before moving forwards …
In any case, that was my second issue, the tiny size of the temperature differences being measured.
Next, coverage. The Argo analysis of SLT2011 only uses data down to 1,500 metres depth. They say that the Argo coverage below that depth is too sparse to be meaningful, although the situation is improving. In addition, the Argo analysis only covers from 60°N to 60°S, which leaves out the Arctic and Southern Oceans, again because of inadequate coverage. Next, it starts at 10 metres below the surface, so it misses the crucial surface layer which, although small in volume, undergoes large temperature variations. Finally, their analysis misses the continental shelves because it only considers areas where the ocean is deeper than one kilometre. Figure 4 shows how much of the ocean volume the Argo floats are actually measuring in SLT2011, about 31%
Figure 4. Amount of the world’s oceans measured by the Argo float system as used in SLT2011.
In addition to the amount measured by Argo floats, Figure 4 shows that there are a number of other oceanic volumes. H2011 includes figures for some of these, including the Southern Ocean, the Arctic Ocean, and the Abyssal waters. Hansen points out that the source he used (Purkey and Johnson,   hereinafter PJ2010) says there is no temperature change in the waters between 2 and 4 km depth. This is most of the water shown on the right side of Figure 4. It is not clear how the bottom waters are warming without the middle waters warming. I can’t think of how that might happen … but that’s what PJ2010 says, that the blue area on the right, representing half the oceanic volume, is not changing temperature at all.
Neither H2011 nor SLT2011 offer an analysis of the effect of omitting the continental shelves, or the thin surface layer. In that regard, it is worth noting that a ten-metre thin surface layer like that shown in Figure 4 can change by a full degree in temperature without much problem … and if it does so, that would be about the same change in ocean heat content as the 0.01°C of warming of the entire volume measured by the Argo floats. So that surface layer is far too large a factor to be simply omitted from the analysis.
There is another problem with the  figures H2011 use for the change in heat content of the abyssal waters (below 4 km). The cited study, PJ2010, says:
Excepting the Arctic Ocean and Nordic seas, the rate of abyssal (below 4000 m) global ocean heat content change in the 1990s and 2000s is equivalent to a heat flux of 0.027 (±0.009) W m−2 applied over the entire surface of the earth. SOURCE: PJ2010
That works out to a claimed warming rate of the abyssal ocean of 0.0007°C per year, with a claimed 95% confidence interval of ± 0.0002°C/yr.  … I’m sorry, but I don’t buy it. I do not accept that we know the rate of the annual temperature rise of the abyssal waters to the nearest two ten-thousandths of a degree per year, no matter what PJ2010 might claim. The surface waters are sampled regularly by thousands of Argo floats. The abyssal waters see the odd transect or two per decade. I don’t think our measurements are sufficient.
One problem here, as with much of climate science, is that the only uncertainty that is considered is the strict mathematical uncertainty associated with the numbers themselves, dissociated from the real world. There is an associated uncertainty that is sometimes not considered. This is the uncertainty of how much your measurement actually represents the entire volume or area being measured.
The underlying problem is that temperature is an “intensive” quality, whereas something like mass is an “extensive” quality. Measuring these two kinds of things,  intensive and extensive variables, is very, very different. An extensive quality is a quality that changes with the amount (the “extent”) of whatever is being measured. The mass of two glasses of water at 40° temperature is twice the mass of one glass of water at 40° temperature. To get the total mass, we just add the two masses together.
But do we add the two 40° temperatures together to get a total temperature of 80°? Nope, it doesn’t work that way, because temperature is an intensive quality. It doesn’t change based on the amount of stuff we are measuring.
Extensive qualities are generally easy to measure. If we have a large bathtub full of water, we can easily determine its mass. Put it on a scale, take one single measurement, you’re done. One measurement is all that is needed.
But the average temperature of the water is much harder to determine. It requires simultaneous measurement of the water temperature in as many places as are required. The number of thermometers required depends on the accuracy you need and the amount of variation in the water temperature. If there are warm spots or cold parts of the water in the tub, you’ll need a lot of thermometers to get an average that is accurate to say a tenth of a degree.
Now recall that instead of a bathtub with lots of thermometers, for the Argo data we have a chunk of ocean that’s 380 km (240 miles) on a side with a single Argo float taking its temperature. We’re measuring down a kilometre and a half (about a mile), and we get three vertical temperature profiles a month … how well do those three vertical temperature profiles characterize the actual temperature of sixty thousand square miles of ocean? (140,000 sq. km.)
Then consider further that the abyssal waters have far, far fewer thermometers way down there … and yet they claim even greater accuracies than the Argo data.
Please be clear that my argument is not about the ability of large numbers of measurements to improve the mathematical precision of the result. We have about 7,500 Argo vertical profiles per month. With the ocean surface divided into 864 gridboxes, if the standard deviation (SD) of the depth-integrated gridbox measurements is about 0.24°C, this is enough to give us mathematical precision of the order of magnitude that they have stated.  The question is whether the SD of the gridboxes is that small, and if so, how they got that small.
They discuss how they did their error analysis. I suspect that their problem lies in two areas. One is I see no error estimate for the removal of the “climatology”, the historical monthly average, from the data. The other problem involves the arcane method used to analyze the data by gridding the data both horizontally and vertically. I’ll deal with the climatology question first. Here is their description of their method:
2.2 Data processing method
An Argo climatology (ACLIM hereinafter, 2004–2009, von Schuckmann et al., 2009) is first interpolated on every profile position in order to fill gappy profiles at depth of each temperature and salinity profile. This procedure is necessary to calculate depth-integrated quantities. OHC [ocean heat content], OFC [ocean freshwater content] and SSL [steric (temperature related) sea level] are then calculated at every Argo profile position as described in von Schuckmann et al. (2009). Finally, anomalies of the physical properties at every profile position are calculated relative to ACLIM.
Terminology: a “temperature profile” is a string of measurements taken at increasing depths by an Argo float. A “profile position” is one of the preset pressure levels at which the Argo floats are set to take a sample.
This means that if there is missing data in a given profile, it is filled in using the “climatology”, or the long-term average of the data for that month and place. Now, this is going to introduce an error, not likely large, and one that they account for.
What I don’t find accounted for in their error calculation is any error estimate related to the final sentence in the paragraph above. That sentence describes the subtraction of the ACLIM climatology from the data. ACLIM is an “Argo climatology”, which is a month-by-month average of the average temperatures of each depth level.
SLT2011 refers this question to an earlier document by the same authors, SLT2009, which describes the creation of the ACLIM climatology. I find that there are over 150 levels in the ACLIM climatology, as described by the authors:
The configuration is defined by the grid and the set of a priori information such as the climatology, a priori variances and covariances which are necessary to compute the covariance matrices. The analyzed field is defined on a horizontal 1/2° Mercator isotropic grid and is limited from 77°S to 77°N. There are 152 vertical levels defined between the surface and 2000m depth … The vertical spacing is 5m from the surface down to 100m depth, 10m from 100m to 800m and 20m from 800m down to 2000m depth.
So they have divided the upper ocean into gridboxes, and each gridbox into layers, to give gridcells. How many gridcells? Well, 360 degrees longitude * 2 * 180 degrees latitude * 2 * 70% of the world is ocean * 152 layers  = 27,578,880 oceanic gridcells. Then they’ve calculated the month by month average temperature of each of those twenty-five million oceanic volumes … a neat trick. Clearly, they are interpolating like mad.
There are about 450,000 discrete ocean temperatures per month reported by the Argo floats. That means that each of their 25 million gridcells gets its temperature taken on average once every five years …
That is the “climatology” that they are subtracting from each “profile position” on each Argo dive. Obviously, given the short history of the Argo dataset, the coverage area of 60,000 sq. miles (140,000 sq. km.) per Argo float, and the small gridcell size, there are large uncertainties in the climatology.
So when they subtract a climatology from an actual measurement, the result contains not just the error in the measurement. It contains the error in the climatology as well. When we are doing subtraction, errors add “in quadrature”. This means the resultant error is the square root of the sum of the squares of the errors. It also means that the big error rules, particularly when one error is much larger than the other. The temperature measurement at the profile position has just the instrument error. For Argo, that’s ± 0.005°C. The climatology error? Who knows, when the volumes are only sampled once every five years? But it’s much more than the instrument error …
So that’s the main problem I see with their analysis. They’re doing it in a difficult-to-trace, arcane, and clunky way. Argo data, and temperature data in general, does not occur in some gridded world. Doing the things they do with the gridboxes and the layers introduces errors. Let me show you one example of why. Figure 5 shows the depth layers of 5 metres used in the upper shallower section of the climatology, along with the records from one Argo float temperature profile.
Figure 5. ACLIM climatology layers (5 metre). Red circles show the actual measurements from a single Argo temperature profile. Blue diamonds show the same information after averaging into layers. Photo Source
Several things can be seen here. First, there is no data for three of the climatology layers. A larger problem is that when we average into layers, in essence we assign that averaged value to the midpoint in the layer. The problem with this procedure arises because in the shallows, the Argo floats sample at slightly less than 10 metre intervals. So the upper measurements are just above the bottom edge of the layer. As a result when they are averaged into the layers, it is as though the temperature profile has been hoisted upwards by a couple of metres. This introduces a large bias into the results. In addition, the bias is depth-dependent, with the shallows hoisted upwards, but deeper sections moved downwards. The error is smallest below 100 metres, but gets large quite quickly after that because of the change in layer thickness to 10 metres.
CONCLUSIONS
Finally, we come to the question of the analysis method, and the meaning of the title of this post. The SLT2011 document goes on to say the following:
To estimate GOIs [global oceanic indexes] from the irregularly distributed profiles, the global ocean is divided into boxes of 5° latitude, 10° longitude and 3-month size. This provides a sufficient number of observations per box. To remove spurious data, measurements which depart from the mean at more than 3 times the standard deviation are excluded. The variance information to build this criterion is derived from ACLIM. This procedure excludes about 1 % of data from our analysis. Only data points which are located over bathymetry deeper than 1000 m depth are then kept. Boxes containing less than 10 measurements are considered as a measurement gap.
Now, I’m sorry, but that’s just a crazy method for analyzing this kind of data. They’ve taken the actual data. Then they’ve added “climatology” data where there were gaps, so everything was neat and tidy. Then they’ve subtracted the “climatology” from the whole thing, with an unknown error. Then the data is averaged into gridboxes of five by ten degrees, and into 150 levels below the surface, of varying thickness, and then those are averaged over a three-month period … that’s all un-necessary complexity. This is a problem that once again shows the isolation of the climate science community from the world of established methods.
This problem, of having vertical Argo temperature profiles at varying locations and wanting to estimate the temperature of the unseen remainder based on the profiles, is not novel or new at all. In fact, it is precisely the situation faced by every mining company with regards to their test drill hole results. Exactly as with Argo data, the mining companies have vertical profiles of the composition of the subsurface reality at variously spaced locations. Again just as with argo, from that information, the mining companies need to estimate the parts of the underground world that they cannot see.
But these are not AGW supporting climate scientists, for whom mistaken claims mean nothing. These are guys betting big bucks on the outcome of their analysis. I can assure you that they don’t futz around dividing the area up into rectangular boxes, and splitting the underground into 150 layers of varying thinknesses. They’d laugh at anyone who tried to estimate an ore body using such a klutzy method.
Instead, they use a mathematical method called “kriging“. Why do they use it? First, because it works.
Remember that the mining companies cannot afford mistakes. Kriging (and its variants) has been proven, time after time, to provide the best estimates of what cannot be measured under the surface.
Second, kriging provides actual error estimates, not the kind of “eight thousandths of a degree” nonsense promoted by the Argo analysts. The mining companies can’t delude themselves that they have more certainty than is warranted by the measurements. They need to know exactly what the risks are, not some overly optimistic calculation.
At the end of the day, I’d say throw out the existing analyses of the Argo data, along with all of the inflated claims of accuracy. Stop faffing about with gridboxes and layers, that’s high-school stuff. Get somebody who is an expert in kriging, and analyze the data properly. My guess is that a real analysis will show error intervals that render much of the estimates useless.
Anyhow, that’s my analysis of the Hansen Energy Imbalance paper. They claim an accuracy that I don’t think their hugely complex method can attain.
It’s a long post, likely inaccuracies and typos have crept in, be gentle …

By Ed Hoskins, MA (Cantab)  BDS (Lond)
The UK Met Office long term Central England Temperature record has kept a continuous and consistent data set since the 1660s. It appears to be reliable and to have maintained its quality. It has not been adjusted as have so many other official temperature record.

Although the CET record covers only a small part of the northern hemisphere, it has shown a consistent rise since the end of the Little Ice Age in 1850 at a rate of about +0.45°C/century or about +0.67°C in the last 150 years. This rise accords well with other temperature records.
However since the year 2000, diminishing solar activity in solar cycle 24 (moving back towards little ice age patterns) appears to be having a real effect.

So since 2000 the CET shows an annual temperature diminution at the rate of -0.49°C/decade or -0.59°C in 12 years: this negates almost the entire CET temperature rise since 1850. Although this is a very short period, the extent of the climate change that has been observed since the turn of the millennium is remarkable.
Using the March 2013 CET value, it is possible to show the winter temperature values up until March 2013 with a combination of the four months December – March for the first 13 years of this century. The diminution of the four winter months temperatures is more remarkable at a rate of -1.11°C/decade or -1.41°C in the last 13 years. This compares with a winter temperature increase rate from 1850 to the year 2000 of +0.45°C/century or +0.68°C for the whole 150 year period.
There are substantial shorter term fluctuations in temperature, and since about 1850 world temperatures have been recovering from a Little Ice Age up by about +0.7°C up until the year 2000. These fluctuations have correlated well with solar activity observable by the number of sunspots. There was a particularly active solar period from about 1970 onward coinciding well with sunspot cycles 21 – 22 – 23: it led to comparatively rapid warming.

However the current cycle 24 is very much weaker and sunspots are diminishing to the levels of the earlier Little Ice Age.
According to some [2]: “so begins a Little Ice Age”. These colder conditions lead to a southwards diversion of the Jet Stream over Europe, as could be seen on 2/4/2013 [3], when the upper atmosphere air flow was passing over Northern Africa, rather than to the North of Scotland as is normal in warmer times.

Such a jet stream pattern leads to very wet summer conditions and remarkably cold winters as have occurred in the last 5 years throughout Northern Europe and the rest of the Northern hemisphere. This adverse colder climate could well persist for decades or even hundreds of years, as it certainly did for the pervious Little Ice Age.
Humanity has thrived in our current Holocene interglacial world. The comparatively warm last 10,000 years have been responsible for the development of the whole of civilisation. The GRIP [4] Greenland ice core data, supported reinforced by several other similar long term ice core records, show this effect very clearly.
Over the past 10,000 years the current Holocene epoch has been progressively cooling since the early “climate optimum”. Overall in the 10,000 years the world has cooled gradually by about 1.0 °C. There were other well documented temperature high points during the period, including the Minoan, Roman and Medieval warm periods.

However the most recent period of 1000 – 2000 AD was the coolest millennium of the whole epoch: see John Kehr the Inconvenient Sceptic [5].

A longer term record shows that only 13,000 years ago the world was in the depths of a real ice age with temperatures about 12°C lower than at present.
So interglacial periods of about 12,000 years have been occurring regularly about every 120,000 years. They are interspersed by real 100,000 year long ice ages, when vast ice sheets cover large parts of the world.
The previous Eemian interglacial epoch was some 130,000 years ago. At its peak it was about 3°C warmer than our current Holocene interglacial: hippopotami thrived in the Rhine delta. The Eemian also lasted about 12,000 years.
The pattern repeats itself [6], there have been 5 interglacial events in the last 500,000 years.

At ~10,500 years our current cooler but benign Holocene interglacial is coming towards its end and the reversion of our planet to a real ice age is foreseeable.

Guest post by Bob Tisdale
This post is a continuation of my post Tamino Once Again Misleads His Followers, which was cross posted at WattsUpWithThat here. There Tamino’s disciples and his other followers, one a post author at SkepticalScience, have generally been repeating their same tired arguments.
The debate is about my short-term, ARGO-era graph of NODC Ocean Heat Content (OHC) data versus the GISS climate model projection. This discussion is nothing new. It began in with Tamino’s unjustified May 9, 2011 post here about my simple graph. My May 13, 2011 reply to Tamino is here, and it was cross posted at WUWT on the same day here. Lucia Liljegren of The Blackboard added to the discussion here.
A graph that’s similar to the one Tamino and his disciples think is fake is shown in Figure 1. It’s similar but different, sort of a short-term OHC model-data comparison Modoki. We’ll get back to it.

Figure 1
First, let’s discuss…
…THE BLATANTLY OBVIOUS ERROR IN TAMINO’S RECENT FAILED CRITIQUE

Tamino’s recent failed critique is titled Fake Predictions for Fake Skeptics. Some people have noted that a fake climate skeptic would be an anthropogenic global warming proponent, but we’ll move on from the implications of that.
Tamino linked to the NODC Ocean Heat Content webpage as the source of his data. There, the NODC provides a spreadsheet of their global OHC data (here). Tamino presents a few preliminary graphs and observes:
Note that there’s a decided hot fluctuation in 2003. So we’ll “predict” the time span 2003 to the present, based on data from 1993 to 2003.
His next graph (my Figure 2) is identified only with the heading of “Ocean heat content 0-700m”. It includes a linear trend that Tamino claims is “based on data from 1993 to 2003”. The length of the trend line is assumedly based on the same period as data. But the period of his trend line does not include the “decided hot fluctuation in 2003.”

Figure 2 (Tamino’s 3rdgraph)
Tamino’s next graph, my Figure 3, includes an extension of his linear trend. In addition to the heading, the graph identifies the red trend line as “fit 1993-2003”, but his “fit 1993-2003” still does not include the “decided hot fluctuation in 2003.”

Figure 3 (Tamino’s 4rdgraph)
In the paragraph after that graph, Tamino states:
We can see that observations don’t follow the prediction exactly — of course! The main difference is that during 2003, the observations were hotter than the prediction. For that time span at least, the oceans had more heat than predicted.
He reinforces that the 2003 data is warmer, yet he and his disciples fail to observe that the 2003 data is not included in his “fit 1993-2003”.
The NODC clearly marks their quarterly data in the spreadsheet they provide here. The Global OHC value at 2002-12 is 6.368768 [*10^22 Joules], and the value at 2003-12 is clearly marked 11.6546 [*10^22 Joules]. But the data included in Tamino’s trend does not include the 4thquarter 2003 data at 11.6546 [*10^22 Joules].
If you’re having trouble seeing that, Figure 4 is similar to Tamino’s graph with the hash marks included. It shows the trend based on the period of 1993 to 2002.

Figure 4
And Figure 5 gives you an idea what Tamino’s graph would look like if he had actually included 2003 data in his trend.

Figure 5
Animation 1 compares the two. (You may need to click on it to get the animation to work.)

Animation 1
How could Tamino and his disciples have missed such an obvious mistake? Some of you might even think it wasn’t a mistake on Tamino’s part, and that his disciples purposely overlooked that blatant error. I’m sure you’ll have a few comments about that.
HANSEN ET AL (2005) OFFSETS THE OHC DATA
A recent comment noted that the observations-based dataset in Hansen et al (2005) was not NODC OHC data, that it was the OHC data based on Willis et al (2004). I never stated that I was providing Willis et al (2004) data. My OHC update posts have always been about the NODC dataset.
My Figure 6 is Figure 2 from Hansen et al (2005). Note that the data starts at about zero watt-years/m^2 in 1993. And my Figure 7 is Figure 3 from Willis et al (2004). Note that the Willis et al data starts at -1 * 10^8 Joules/m^2 at 1993. Hansen et al converted the data, which is not in question since I’ve done the same thing, and Hansen et al have offset the data, which I have done also.

Figure 6
HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

Figure 7
Mysteriously, Hansen et al can shift the data without comment from Tamino, but when I do it, it’s interpreted by Tamino and his disciples, and by those from SkepticalScience, as a fake graph.
THE BEST WAY TO COMPARE THE MODELS TO THE OBSERVATIONS-BASED OHC DATA
Obviously, the best way to present the GISS Model-ER projection for Ocean Heat Content would be to use the actual GISS Model-ER data. The RealClimate annual model-data updates here and herepresent the Model-ER data. But the Model-ER OHC simulations are not available in an easy-to-use format like at the KNMI Climate Explorer. If it was available, all of this nonsense about my shifting data, my misrepresenting data, etc., would disappear. Why?
I have stated in comments at WUWT that I would use the ensemble mean of the Model-ER data and the NODC OHC observations for my future model-data comparisons. I’ve also stated I would use the base years of 1955-2010 to avoid the possibility of being accused of cherry-picking the base years.
Why? I presented this in a June 14, 2011post. And that post has been linked to all OHC updates since then.
Figure 8 is a graph from a 2008 presentation by Gavin Schmidt of GISS. It includes the OHC simulations of the Model-ER for the period of 1955 to 2010, which is the model data shown in the RealClimate model-data posts. It also includes the older version of the global NODC OHC data.

Figure 8
If we:
1. replicate the ensemble mean data of the GISS Model-ER,
2. replace the older NODC OHC data with the current version, and
3. use the base years of 1955-2010 so that no one can complain about cherry-picked base years,
Figure 9 would be a reasonable facsimile of the long-term comparison from 1955 to 2010. Notice where the ensemble mean of the GISS Model-ER intersects with the data near the ARGO era. Sure looks like 2003 to me. Figure 1 at the top of this post confirms how closely the GISS Model-ER would intersect with the NODC OHC data at 2003.

Figure 9
That graph in Figure 1 looks familiar, doesn’t it? It sure does look like the ARGO-era graphthat Tamino and his disciples dislike so much.
MY OFFER
In my January 28, 2012 at 6:18 pmcomment at the WUWT cross post I wrote the following:
I offered in a comment above to use the base years of 1955-2011 for my short-term ARGO-era model-data comparison. That way there can be no claims that I’ve cherry picked the base years or shifted the data inappropriately. I do not have the capability to process the GISS Model-ER OHC hindcast and projection data from the CMIP3 archive. So I cannot create the ensemble member mean of the global data, on a monthly basis, for the period of 1955 to present. But some of you do have that capability. You could end the debate.
If you choose to do so, please make available online for all who wish to use it the Global GISS Model-ER hindcast/projection ensemble member data on a monthly basis from 1955 to present, or as far into the future as you decide.
I will revise my recent OHC update and reuse that model data for future OHC updates. That way we don’t have to go through this every time I use that ARGO-era comparison graph as the initial graph in my OHC updates.
Fair enough?
Any takers?
CLOSING
I know the trend of the OHC data is not the model mean, but for those who are wondering what Tamino’s NODC OHC graph might have looked like if he had actually included the 1993 through 2003 data in his trend AND then compared it to the period of 2003 to 2011, refer to Figure 10.

Figure 10
And if he had lopped off the data before 2003, because it isn’t presented in the graph that he complains about so much, the result would look like Figure 11.

"Restarting the economy and getting people back to work after the coronavirus lockdown should focus on low-carbon work programmes, the UK government’s climate advisers have urged. They said this would generate new jobs, protect the climate and ensure a fairer economy for everyone.  People’s homes could be made ready for winter and new jobs created through schemes to insulate houses, while tree-planting could begin and flood barriers be constructed, the Committee on Climate Change advised Boris Johnson. Fulfilling the UK’s need for low-carbon infrastructure, from electricity networks to cycle lanes, and restoring peatlands, would create jobs in the short term, while government money could also be used to encourage advances in science and innovation that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the future, the committee found. The UK has a target of cutting emissions to net zero by 2050, but before the coronavirus crisis the government had set out few plans to achieve it. In a letter to the prime minister on Wednesday, the committee said combining the recovery from the lockdown with actions to cut emissions would be beneficial in the short and long term. “Actions towards net-zero emissions and to limit the damages from climate change will help rebuild the UK with a stronger economy and increased resilience,” wrote the committee chair, Lord Deben, and the chair of the sub-committee on adaptation, Lady Brown. More measures were needed to help people continue to walk, cycle and work remotely after the lockdown eases, the committee said. Increased cycling and walking would reduce the strain on public transport while keeping down air pollution, which people have become more aware of because of reduced road traffic. The advisers also called for retraining programmes to equip people with skills such as installing low-carbon heating, energy and water efficiency, and flood protection for homes. They said rescue packages for carbon-intensive sectors “should be contingent on them taking real and lasting action on climate change”, to avoid locking in high emissions for the future. Fairness should be a “core principle” of any recovery, they advised. “The crisis has exacerbated existing inequalities and … the response to the pandemic has disproportionately affected the same lower-income groups and younger people who face the largest long-term impacts of climate change,” the chairs wrote. “The benefits of acting on climate change must be shared widely and the costs must not burden those who are least able to pay, or whose livelihoods are most at risk as the economy changes. It is important that the lost or threatened jobs of today should be replaced by those created by the new resilient economy.” The committee’s advice bolsters calls from other experts to “green” the economic recovery. On Tuesday, a group of leading economists, including the Nobel prize-winner Joseph Stiglitz, set out evidence that government spending on low-carbon and other environmentally beneficial activities would provide a bigger boost to the economy, in both the short and long term, than pursuing a traditional recovery that poured money into fossil fuels and ignored the climate crisis. Green campaigners urged the government to heed the advice. Mike Childs, head of science at Friends of the Earth, said: “Improving people’s lives and saving the climate needs to be central to recovery, not rebuilding the profits of damaging industries. The right post-pandemic investment can push a big, positive, reset button on our carbon-guzzling and unsustainable economy and build a clean, healthy and fair world.” Richard George, head of oil for Greenpeace UK, said: “When you have both the economy and the environment on the same side of the scales, the debate is over. The only question now is whether the government will listen to the experts and support a recovery package that protects our jobs, our health and our climate.” Chris Venables, of the Green Alliance thinktank, said the coronavirus crisis was changing the public’s understanding of what is possible in terms of combating climate change, and changing people’s expectations of the government’s role in improving society. “The recovery can change the way we think about public health and the health of the planet, whether that is preferring online connectivity to carbon-intensive travel, or making greater efforts to conserve forests and improve access to green spaces. In response to coronavirus, the government has taken decisive measures. Similar courage can lead us to a healthier world in recovery.” In the letter, the committee reminded the prime minister of Britain’s role on the world stage. The UK will host the next UN climate talks, Cop26, scheduled for November but now postponed to next year. Johnson and the Cop26 president, the business secretary Alok Sharma, will be urging other countries to come forward with national plans to curb carbon. Deben and Brown said the UK must show leadership by linking the economic recovery and the climate crisis.“Our credibility as an international leader rests on taking action at home,” they said."
"**Single parents say they are struggling to pay bills while self-isolating due to not having access to a Â£500 grant during the coronavirus pandemic.**
People who are forced to stay off work after testing positive for Covid-19 or being contacted by tracers are eligible to apply for the sum.
But parents or carers who need to look after a child sent home from school due to the virus cannot claim.
The Welsh Government said the scheme would be kept ""under review"".
Applications for the Â£500 grants, set up to support those on low incomes, opened a fortnight ago following criticism of a delay in getting it up and running.
People can access the grant if they test positive or are contacted by contact tracers, and cannot work from home during the 14 day self-isolation period.
But charities warned the criteria means those told who had to stay home to look after children, if there were cases at their schools, would not be able to claim.
Ellie Harwood, from the Child Poverty Action Group, said many living in deprived areas would do jobs that could not be done from home, and so would have to go without pay.
""For lone parents, particularly, the prospect of two weeks without any money coming in is really difficult,"" she said.
""We just know that so many families struggle to make ends meet even though they're in work.
""More often than not, particularly with lone parents, there's quite a lot of research that shows that mothers, and it normally is mothers, will go without, they won't eat three meals a day.""
When Louise Hall was told to keep her eight-year-old son off school after a positive case in his year group in October, she had to stop working.
The child therapist, from Newport, said no-one in her support bubble lived nearby to help care for him and she was not eligible for any government support.
She said she had already had to get ""creative and flexible"" with paying bills.
""I needed to be there for my son because he's not old enough to be left at all,"" she said.
""If I don't work, we don't eat and that's very hard as a self-employed person because you have to wait for invoices to be paid anyway, you have to wait for cash flow.""
She said the Â£500 would pay for almost all of her rent, and make a big difference to their lives, and she worried there would be more cases and he would have to isolate again.
Dawn Cartwright, from Penrhyndeudraeth, Gwynedd, has been home with five of her children for the last two weeks after positive cases were confirmed at their school.
The teaching assistant said she had been living for ""two weeks with no wages at all"" after needing to stay home with them.
""I'm allowed to go to work but working in a primary school, do I go to work and risk spreading the virus or stay at home and look after the children? It's very hard to know what to do,"" she said.
""It's very hard. Christmas is coming up but the bills need paying first. I know a lot of families who are struggling with knowing what to do.""
Ms Cartwright, who has been relying on working tax credits to get by, but said she was now having to decide what bills to pay when she gets her next pay check.
""I'd like them just to think they're asking us to protect people by staying home...but there's no help to be had,"" she said.
Now the action group has called on the Welsh Government to follow Northern Ireland and allow people to claim if anyone in their household is told to self-isolate.
""Sometimes it is easy to overlook the specific circumstances of certain types of families when these schemes are planned,"" Ms Harwood said.
Plaid Cymru said low income working parents of isolating children ""cannot be excluded from self-isolation payments without an alternative"".
The party's equalities spokeswoman Leanne Wood said: ""Alternative childcare is not an option when children are formally required to self-isolate, therefore parents and carers have no other option than to miss work as a result.""
Ms Wood called for the Welsh Government to allow parents to show a child's self-isolation record as proof they were eligible for support.
A Welsh Government spokeswoman said the self-isolation scheme was designed to remove the financial barriers some people face when asked to self-isolate.
""It is similar to the schemes in place elsewhere in the UK,"" she said.
""We keep the scheme under review."""
"Charles Darwin ate one on his trip to Brazil. Apparently it tasted more like pork than chicken. My nine-year-old, football-mad, half-Brazilian son could identify one on his World Cup merchandising and my Brazilian biologist wife knew it was some kind of armadillo, but not which species. It is of course Brazil’s World Cup mascot, the three-banded armadillo, named Fuleco.  It was brave to choose such an obscure animal as an official mascot. The English used a lion when they started this tradition in 1966 and the South Africans used a leopard in 2010. It is refreshing to see such a non-emblematic species chosen – and one that is endangered and needs awareness of its existence to be raised. But I can’t help but feel an opportunity has been lost when it comes to conservation in Brazil. First the name of the mascot: Fuleco. Not even my football-mad son knew its name and my wife had no idea why it was called this. Fuleco is supposed to be a portmanteau of the Brazilian words for football (futebol) and ecology (ecologia), which suggests it should have been “Futeco”. But as my wife pointed out, names beginning with “fut” do not sound good in most languages.  Three-banded armadillos hail from the dry tropical forest lands (the Caatinga) of Brazil’s northeast and they are classified as vulnerable to extinction by the IUCN. In Portuguese they are appropriately called “tatu bola”, which translates to “ball armadillo”. Surely, this name or even “bola” (ball) could have been used to highlight the unique nature of this armadillo.  While this species is famous amongst Brazil’s native population for rolling up into a ball to defend itself, the problem is that there are several other species of armadillo in Brazil that are also well known. So here is the first missed goal: the mascot species is not being properly identified and it’s likely that the majority of the 200m Brazilians who affect its habitat and survival will remain ignorant of its plight. The second missed goal is not to take advantage of a wonderful Brazilian law that allows private companies or individuals to create nature reserves and then “donate” them to the country. Brazil has more than 1,000 of these Private Reserves to Protect Nature (RPPN). Brazilian law allows owners to retain ownership of the land once it has been declared a RPPN, but the land from this point in time onwards can only be a nature reserve, protecting it from environmentally unfriendly exploitation.  Here is the opportunity for a fantastic marketing win that would also score a goal for conservation. FIFA could buy an area of land important for the conservation of Fuleco’s species, and call it the “FIFA World Cup Nature Reserve 2014” if they wished. Of course some endowment money would be needed to maintain the reserve but this would need to generate only a few tens of thousands of dollars per year. This would be a fantastic legacy for the people of Brazil and make a real long-term impact on this species’ conservation. So far FIFA have spent only £27,000 on the three-banded armadillo’s conservation. Some Brazilian wildlife conservation researchers have suggested a green goals project. For every goal scored in the World Cup, 1,000 hectares of land would be bought and used to make a reserve. In the average World Cup there are 170 goals so 170,000 hectares would be protected. This is a good idea, but I think it should be a bonus on top of a base minimum reserve size. I would hate to be cheering for poor defences and bad goal keeping when watching the games with my family. The Brazilian government set aside US$275m for Wildlife Parks to be upgraded for world cup visitors, but less than 1% of this money has been spent. This is against the backdrop of new parliamentary affront in Brazil against the country’s conservation areas and reserves for indigenous peoples: more than 200 politicians (40% of them) actually claim that the creation of conservation areas in Brazil has damaged the lives of many people.  It is true that often the paying out of land payments has progressed at a snail’s pace, but this is the politicians’ fault. And there are other motives at play, considering that many government wildlife reserves sit on top of valuable resources such as gold and diamonds. All this only leads us to ask: why hasn’t the Brazilian government used some of this money to create a new national park to save the three-banded armadillo? The final whistle has not blown on this game. There is still time for both FIFA and the Brazilian government to make a meaningful gesture towards the conservation of Fuleco’s kind. FIFA should try to leave behind lasting legacies in World Cup host countries and this could well be a new National Park to save species from extinction. This would really be a golden goal that everyone can cheer for."

The clown-show that is the Pacific Islands Forum came to a fitting conclusion yesterday, with a rogues’ gallery of banana republics lining up with their hands out. But, in their greed for foreign handouts, Pacific nations seem dangerously blind to the wolf that they’re inviting into their complacent sheep-fold.



From the earliest days of the Maoist takeover, China has assiduously sought to buy influence in what was then called the “Third World”. For much of the 20th century, Beijing had little more to offer than anti-Imperialist rhetoric. But these days, thanks to Deng Xiaping’s reforms, the communists are awash with cash – and they’re not sparing a single yuan in buying up influence from the greedy and gullible.



China has told Pacific nations it recognises the “legitimate demands” of small island states for tackling climate change, and called on developed countries to “earnestly carry out their obligations” under the Paris agreement.



Well, he would say that now wouldn’t he? The Paris agreement is the absurd fiction that punishing America and the West, bleeding them white of energy and cash while allowing China to merrily belch out as much carbon dioxide as it pleases is somehow “saving the planet”. China is playing the green-left elite of Europe, not to mention camp-followers like Jacinda Ardern, for utter fools.



China’s Special Envoy to the Pacific, Ambassador Wang Xuefeng, told the Pacific Island Forum in Tuvalu today that “no matter how the international situation evolves, China will always be a good friend, partner and brother of Pacific Island countries”.



“China believes that all countries, big or small, are equals,” he said.



Yeah, right. Just ask Taiwan, Tibet or Vietnam.



But the blatant baloney didn’t end there.



Mr Wang talked up his own country’s efforts to tackle reduce its emissions.



Mr Wang told PIF members that China backed “equitable global climate governance regime”…“China firmly upholds the principles and framework of the Convention, and remains committed to the principles of equity, “common but differentiated responsibilities”, and respective capabilities.”



Just a little reminder of the reality behind Beijing’s two-faced rhetoric:



China has 981,000MW of installed coal generation capacity, compared to Australia’s 25,150MW.



But China wasn’t the only participant doling out shovel-loads of self-serving horse-pucky.



Tuvalu Prime Minister Enele Sopoaga said …the marathon session, which dragged well into the night, was at times emotional.



“The Prime Minister of Tonga actually cried during the retreat,” he said.



  
But that was only because the buffet closed early.



Economist Judith Sloan didn’t hesitate in calling the PIF for what it really is.



Let’s face it, it’s just a dressed-up cash grab on the part of these leaders…to be lectured by some jumped-up leaders from the Pacific Islands that we should close down our coal industry — with the darling of the left, Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand’s PM, chiming in — is both to underscore their ignorance and demonstrate their extreme naivety.



Australia is handing out half a billion dollars of gibsmedat. How do the Cargo Cultists of the Pacific think we can afford this largesse?



With coal our largest export earner, the closure of this industry would seriously undermine our capacity to provide funds to our neighbours in the Pacific.



They could always demonstrate their commitment to their principles by refusing to take coal-funded cash.

Unfortunately, science is never settled, and the remarks will go down in history as being among the most naïve ever expressed by the office of the President.

The Latest List of Lies
By Ed Caryl
On Tuesday, June 25, in advance of President Obama’s Climate speech, David Simas, a White House presidential advisor, sent an email to the press corp outlining the governments position on climate change. This missive was so unabashedly full of lies dressed as irrefutable statements that it would have made the most notorious dictator propagandist proud. The refutation is absurdly easy. Let’s break down each paragraph:
The carbon pollution that causes climate change isn’t a distant threat, the risk to public health isn’t a hypothetical, and it’s clear we have a moral obligation to act.”
He is talking about CO2. A CO2 molecule is one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms. By weight, CO2 is about 73% oxygen and 27% carbon. He calls it “carbon pollution”, not “oxygen pollution”, because to most people, carbon is a dirty, black substance commonly called soot, and oxygen is life giving for animals. Carbon-soot is what one sees from the exhaust of a poorly tuned diesel truck. That isn’t CO2. CO2 is colorless and odorless. Pure carbon also exists as graphite and diamond.
CO2 is not pollution. It is 0.04% of the atmosphere. If the concentration in the atmosphere falls below 0.02% plants die. CO2 is plant food. It is life for plants. It is fertilizer. It is essential to vegetation. It is harmless to humans until it reaches 1% to 4% of the atmosphere.
CO2 and water vapor are responsible for keeping the earth’s surface habitable. Without CO2 and water vapor, the earth would be much colder. Does too much CO2 increase the temperature? Perhaps, but water vapor is a much larger influence. Water vapor, from the bottom to the top of the atmosphere, is the earth’s thermostat.
Is climate changing? Climate changes all the time; it is called “weather.” Is it a threat? Severe weather has always been a threat. Is it a threat to public health? Sure, but it has always been that way. Recent weather has actually been less extreme than periods in the past. Cold kills more people than heat, so we should be welcoming warmer weather if that is what is happening. Rome expanded during a warm period. Medieval castles and cathedrals were built during a warm period.
We have a moral obligation to act? In what way? Primitive tribes used rain dances. We throw government money at alternative energy companies that promptly go bankrupt. These are equally efficacious activities.
The 12 hottest years on record have all come in the last 15 years, and 2012 was the hottest one we’ve ever recorded. When carbon pollutes the air, the risk of asthma attacks increases. When the Earth’s atmosphere fundamentally changes, we see more heat waves, droughts, wildfires, and floods.”
The first sentence is half true. 2012 was not the hottest year, 1998 was, according to HADCRUT4 and all the other temperature data sources. There were 7 years out of the last 15 that were hotter than 2012. We are now past the peak of the current temperature cycle, so, of course the hottest years are recent years.
CO2 in the air has no effect on asthma. Other pollutants increase asthma, not CO2.
The earth’s atmosphere has not fundamentally changed. There are not more heat waves, or droughts, or wildfires, or floods. The facts are that all these things either cycle up and down over time, or are decreasing. Wildfires are caused by things that man does like arson, building in pine forests, “controlled” burns, and forest management practices. Floods are caused by urban pavement, levees, and poor flood control dam management, as well as nature.

These events also create an economic imperative to act. When farms wash away and crops wilt, food prices go up. Last year, we saw 11 different weather disasters that each cost the United States more than $1 billion.”
What events? Farms have not washed away in any unusual number, and floods don’t normally wash them away anyway, a flood just makes them very wet for a time. In the 1930’s Dust Bowl they blew way, but this was before the CO2 rise. CO2 makes crops more drought resistant. Food prices have gone up because an area equivalent to Iowa and New Jersey combined are now devoted to corn used to produce ethanol rather than food for beef, chickens, and hogs. This has been a government mandated disaster.
Weather-related losses happen every year. As time passes, more things get built that can be destroyed, and inflation increases the dollar cost.
And confronting this challenge isn’t just about preventing disaster — it’s also about moving America forward in a way that creates hundreds of thousands of good, new, clean energy jobs. It’s about wasting less energy, which saves money for every business and every family in America.”
Of course he is not talking about jobs for oil field workers, pipeline constructors, miners, or gas drillers. He’s talking about government subsidized jobs building bird-blenders (wind-turbines) and bird-incinerators (solar power towers). He’s talking about government loans to “green” companies that then lose it. He’s talking about CFL light bulbs made in China that will be causing mercury pollution for years to come. He’s talking about LNG powered cars and trucks that will explode on impact or during refueling.
So the debate’s over. It’s time for action.”
You don’t get out of the debate by declaring it over and walking away. The debate has just begun. We now have the MSM beginning to let the truth be heard.
Here’s what President Obama is announcing today. Check it out, then help to spread the word.”
Help spread the lies. But don’t think for yourself or investigate.
First, he’s laying out a plan to cut carbon pollution in America — by working to cut pollution from power plants, protect the health of our kids, boost clean energy, and revamp our transportation sector for the 21st century. Second, he’s preparing the United States for the impacts of these changes — by building stronger, safer communities and developing resources to make our country more resilient. And finally, he’s leading international efforts to combat global climate change.”
Raise the cost of energy. Raise government spending on more losing Alternative Energy Schemes. Make a case for more gun control. Give DHS more power. Raise the cost of health care. Make big government even bigger, and charge at international windmills.
We’ve put together a graphic that breaks this all down — from the effects we’re already seeing to the specific actions we’re going to take to lead this fight.”
The effects: food prices taking off, energy prices skyrocketing, and now more efforts to enhance both of those effects.
No single step can reverse the effects of climate change, but that’s no excuse for inaction. We have a moral obligation to leave our kids a planet that’s not broken and polluted.
None of those steps will have any affect on something that happens naturally. They will, however, increase costs, put more downward pressure on jobs, and further depress an already depressed economy. In the end, it will leave our kids a planet with poor job prospects, food prices they can’t afford, and energy prices that will reduce their standard of living, restrict mobility, and make it harder to heat their hovels. And that will really be a broken planet.

"**A Sheffield shisha bar which breached Covid-19 regulations has been fined Â£2,000 and had 70 pipes seized.**
Officers found 20 people inside the venue on the Wicker on Friday, with Â£200 fixed penalty notices handed out to all inside.
South Yorkshire Police said it had received numerous reports about the bar breaching rules.
Both police and the council had made previous visits to the business advising it of the regulations.
Insp John Mallows, from the force's city centre neighbourhood team, said: ""We want the public to know that police and local authorities will take action to address Covid-19 breaches and the warrant is one example of our partnership working to tackle repeated issues.
""Individuals who seek to ignore the rules and put both theirs and other lives at risk will face enforcement action.""

"February 2020 was the wettest February on record for the UK and the fifth wettest of any calendar month in a series dating back to 1862. 209mm of rain fell across the country, and some areas recorded as much as four times their normal February rainfall, resulting in severe flooding. So how does this compare to the UK’s wettest month on record: October 1903? The records show that 227mm of rain fell during October 1903, but the observations are not detailed enough to show precisely where and when the most intense rainfall occurred. That’s because thousands of meticulous weather observations are recorded in copperplate hand-writing, but haven’t yet made it to digital form.  Now they have! A call for volunteers to use Covid-19 lockdown time to help rescue rainfall records has resulted in over 15,000 people transcribing all five million UK rainfall measurements recorded between 1820 and 1960, in the space of just three weeks. Once the data has been double checked scientists will be able to compare exceptional months like October 1903 and February 2020, and understand the variation in British weather. Meanwhile, more data awaits. “The next project will be at sea, looking at ship weather logbooks,” says Ed Hawkins, who leads the Weather Rescue project.  "

Guest Post by Willis Eschenbach
In the process of writing my piece about Lisa Jackson and the EPA, I got to reading about the EPA passing new mercury regulations. Their regulations are supposed to save the lives of some 11,000 people per year. So I figured I should learn something about mercury. It turned out to be quite surprising … here was my first surprise:
Figure 1. Natural and anthropogenic sources of atmospheric mercury emissions. About 7,500 tonnes of mercury are emitted into the atmosphere each year. Named countries show anthropogenic (human caused) emissions for that country.
My first surprise was that far and away the largest emitter of atmospheric mercury is the ocean. The ocean? I’d never have guessed that. Other huge emitters are various lightly vegetated land areas. In addition, forests, volcanoes, and geothermal vents are significant emitters … which is the reason for my new religious crusade:


So … what are the anthropogenic sources of mercury emissions, and how much of those are emitted from North America? Figure 2 shows those values:
Figure 2. North American emissions versus the rest of the world.
As you can see, North America is not doing well at all in the mercury emission sweepstakes. The rest of the world is busting our chops, easily out-emitting us in all categories. We’ve fallen way, way behind, the Chinese are kicking our emissionary fundament-als. Not only that, but the residence time for mercury in the atmosphere is about a year, so they get our mercury … but we also get theirs …
Now, the “stationary combustion” figures are what the EPA is targeting with their new restrictions. Those are mostly the coal-fired power plants. So let’s see how much of the global emissions are caused by US power plants:
Figure 3. US power plant mercury emissions, and emissions from all other sources.
As you can see, the US power plants emit less than 1% of the global mercury emissions. Even if the EPA could get rid of every US coal plant, it will not make a measurable difference in the atmospheric mercury.
Now, here comes the fun part. The new EPA regulations will not cut out all the mercury from US power plants. We’re already pretty efficient at removing mercury, and each additional reduction comes with more difficulty.
So let’s assume that the EPA regs will cut out 25 tonnes of mercury per year. This is supposed to save 11,000 lives every year. So that means if we could wave a magical wand and cut out all of the mercury, 100 percent of it, we should expect to save about 11,000 times 7500/25 = 11,000 times 300 = 3,300,000 lives saved every year … and if you believe that three million people die every year from mercury poisoning, you too could get a job with the EPA.
That’s the thing about facts. As Homer Simpson says,
Facts are meaningless. You could use facts to prove anything that’s even remotely true!

So EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt is gone, the environmentalists’ noirest _bete noire_ since James Watt ran the Interior Department early in the Reagan Administration. He will be replaced (at least temporarily) by Deputy Administrator Andrew Wheeler, a longtime Washington insider with a keen knowledge of the Agency. He served as chief of staff for the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which oversees all EPA activities, and he also has extensive and diverse experience as a lobbyist.   
  
  
He’s likely to be lower key than Pruitt, but also very effective, given his thick rolodex. He’s certain to continue EPA’s efforts to separate its science advisors from its research largess. He’ll likely continue to prioritize and streamline remediation of the 1000+ “superfund” sites nationwide, a key Pruitt program. And he most assuredly will not bring back anything like the Obama Administration’s clean power plan with its “renewable” solar and wind power mandates. Instead, the switch from coal to more efficient gas‐​fired power plants is likely to continue.   
  
  
The linchpin of EPA’s regulatory apparatus for global warming is the 2009 “Endangerment Finding” from emissions of carbon dioxide. According to the 2007 Supreme Court decision in _Massachusetts v. EPA,_ if the Agency finds that resultant global warming endangers health and welfare, it can then regulate those emissions under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.   
  
  
The Finding is in turn based upon prospective climate change generated by large computer models both for climate and an estimate of its “social cost”. In 2016, _Science_ magazine carried a news story by Paul Voosen noting that all of the climate models used by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have been “tuned” to simulate 20th century climate changes. This includes a substantial warming from 1910 to 1945, despite the fact that there was very little additional carbon dioxide in the atmosphere when it began.   
  
  
In 2017, France’s Frederic Hourdin and 14 coauthors published a landmark paper called “The Art and Science of Model Tuning” in the _Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society_. Among other things, they revealed that there is an “anticipated acceptable range” of output. Who decides that?   
  
  
It turns out that the forecasts of 21st century climate change are subjectively bounded. Voosen’s article describes the problems encountered at the Max‐​Planck Institute when their model produced seven degrees (C) of warming for doubled carbon dioxide. “They had to get that number down”, Voosen wrote.   
  
  
Then there’s the whole problem of the “social cost of carbon” calculated by the Obama Administration to justify its sweeping “Clean Power Plan”. As shown by Kevin Dayaratna and colleagues at the Heritage Foundation, that cost is extremely sensitive to changes in prospective warming, and conceivably can be negative (i.e. a benefit) for modest warming, because carbon dioxide itself is a boon to plant growth, which includes crops.   
  
  
Just last month, EPA proposed a revised method to calculate the cost, which cut the previous estimate by around 85%.   
  
  
The model tuning, and the subjective estimates of both the amount and costs of future warming, indeed may endanger the Endangerment Finding itself. The new Acting Administrator should revisit that critical 2009 document.

Warning



This is NOT satire.  
I REPEAT.  
This is NOT Satire



In another case where the truth is stranger than fiction Green list MP, Associate Transport Minister and writer of [secret letters,](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/08/jags-secret-letter-flouts-the-cabinet-manual/) Julie Anne _“Car Fascist”_ Genter has been exposed for ordering an investigation into BANNING Petrol car imports by 2035.  




Associate Transport Minister Julie Anne Genter ordered an investigation into a total ban on petrol car imports by 2035 among a range of options to reduce emissions in the national transport fleet.  
An array of documents, including an excerpt from a draft cabinet paper from April last year, reveal Genter instructed officials to work on the policy, before scrapping the plan.  
But **National says the fact the plan was even worked on was “irresponsible”.**  
A Ministry of Transport (MoT) report from September last year showed officials had been instructed to “progress an initiative to regulate an end-date of 2035 to the import of light vehicles that are unable to be driven without fossil-fuels”.  
  
  
In other words, **Genter wanted to ban the import of all cars which still use petrol by 2035.**  
  
[…] MoT officials progressed work and presented a report in October last year titled “Ban on Importing Light Vehicles Powered by Fossil Fuels; Preliminary Cost-Benefit Analysis”.  
This report looked into the pros and cons of such a ban.  
But, due to the “lack of information, time and resources”, the cost-benefit analysis was not able to take a number of key issues into consideration.  
  
For example, how such a ban would affect EVs was not looked into, nor was the impacts on electricity prices and the road safety impacts of changing New Zealand’s vehicle fleet so dramatically.  
The report said the main benefit for consumers would be the saving people would make when it comes to not having to buy petrol.  
  
[…] Genter’s proposal was never taken to Cabinet – “it was rejected and ruled out”.  
  
National transport spokesman Chris Bishop said the fact a Cabinet paper was produced showed she was **working behind closed doors to change the law**.   
“Reducing emissions from our vehicle fleet is an important step in the fight against climate change.  
“But it would be irresponsible to make petrol cars illegal so soon without a solid plan to help people into electric vehicles,” he said.

Haiti recently was devastated by a massive earthquake. Yet social desolation in Haiti long preceded the natural disaster. The tragic Caribbean nation does not have the economic freedom and legal stability necessary to build a prosperous economy.



Much goes into the process of economic development. One of the most important factors is the protection of property rights, both physical and intellectual. Today the Property Rights Alliance (PRA) released its latest annual _International Property Rights Index_ (IPRI), written by Victoria Strokova, with contributions from many others. Countries which do the most to strengthen property rights have the best economic results.



Prosperity is not everything, of course. As Nobel Laureate Milton Friedman observed: “The preservation of liberty, not the promotion of efficiency, is the primary justification for private property. Efficiency is a happy, though not accidental, by‐​product.”





Property rights promote justice, allowing people at all economic strata to enjoy the fruit of their labor.



Americans enjoy believing that the U.S. is the most market‐​oriented society on earth. But the U.S. is not number one on general economic freedom indexes, though it remains in the top ten. America doesn’t even fall within the top ten on protecting property rights. The U.S. was 15 — not bad out of the 125 countries ranked, but nevertheless disappointing given America’s freedom heritage. Here, as in so many areas, the U.S. is losing its position as the global leader in promoting individual liberty and limited government.



Property rights always have been important. Barun S. Mitra, head of India’s Liberty Institute, who wrote the foreword to the latest IPRI ratings, observes that “A modern economy is built on clear ownership of property whether tangible or intangible — be it land, shares, or intellectual property.” Property rights promote justice, allowing people at all economic strata to enjoy the fruit of their labor. More important from the economic standpoint, property rights create an extraordinarily powerful incentive to raise and use resources productively and efficiently.



Alas, the challenge to economic freedom has grown in the aftermath of the financial crisis. Notes Kelsey Zahourek, the PRA’s executive director, “many people across the globe are continuing to see their basic property rights stripped away from them in the shadow of a global economic crisis.”



No surprise, the greatest challenge faces the poorest nations. Writes Mitra:



While world attention is focused on the economic situation in the U.S. and other developed countries, the situation also underscores the perpetual economic crisis in many developing nations and poor communities. In these societies, recognition of property rights and respect for ownership are weak, and a title document is often non‐​existent. Typically, these are places where informal economic activities dominate. But the consequences are very similar in both — lack of credit. Ironically, the problem of the poor is not that they do not have assets; instead, they are unable to effectively to capitalize their assets. The present crisis demonstrates that the rich are equally vulnerable to being unable to capitalize their assets if they lose their connection to the real economy and the clear titles that it requires.



Protecting property rights take many forms. One aspect is the legal and political environment. At issue are judicial independence, rule of law, political stability, and control of corruption. Notes the PRA report: “Even the most comprehensive _de jure_ property rights cannot be enforced unless a strong rule of law and independent judiciary are present to enforce them.” Political instability and corruption make it harder to acquire and preserve private property, and to benefit from using and improving private property. These factors typically are most lacking in poor Third World states.



Defending physical property rights is one leg of the property stool. One aspect is the strength of independent institutions, most notably the judiciary, standing against attempts to seize private assets. Other aspects include the ease of registering property and borrowing money. Explains the PRA: “access to a bank loan without collateral serves as a proxy for the level of development of financial institutions in a country.”



Another, increasingly important aspect of property is intellectual property rights. Today, with economies increasingly dependent on information and other new technologies, intellectual property is an increasingly important aspect of economic growth and prosperity. IPRI looks at both _de jure_ and _de facto_ protection for intellectual property, as well as strength of patent law and level of copyright piracy.



Useful information about many countries is lacking, which limits the number of states covered by IPRI (such as Haiti, which is absent). However, the 125 nations listed account for 97 percent of global GDP. And the rankings, if not exact, are broadly accurate in assessing national commitments to stronger property rights regimes.



The best performers are the Scandinavian states. Although these governments typically spend more than Washington, they also often regulate with a lighter, more efficient, and less corrupt hand.



In the case of property they tend to be far more protective of individual liberty. The top ten are Finland (number one for the fourth year in a row), Denmark, Sweden, Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, New Zealand, Singapore, Australia, and Austria. No surprise, all of these nations enjoy productive and prosperous economies.



At the bottom are Bosnia and Herzegovina, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Bolivia, Burundi, Chad, Zimbabwe, Venezuela, Ivory Coast, and Bangladesh. Obviously, much is wrong with these nations, as well as others that rank poorly on the IPRI. However, unless they are able to remedy their flawed property rights regimes, they are unlikely to successfully develop even if they meet their other challenges — end external wars, pacify internal conflicts, overturn dictatorships, and so on.



North America is the freest region. Western Europe is the second. The Mideast and Asia are roughly tied for third‐​fourth. Eastern Europe/​Central Asia, Latin America, and Africa trail.



The U.S. is only number 15 overall but ties for first regarding IP. America is number 18 on legal/​political environment and ties for 11 on physical property. The U.S. did improve overall slightly from 2009 to 2010, though little substantive changed much.



While the relationship is not perfect, nations in the top IPRI quintiles do far better economically than those in the bottom quintiles. Although most countries which protect physical property also promote intellectual property, there are differences of emphasis.



Overall, nations in the top IPRI quintile enjoy an average per capita income of $35,676. The average for the second quintile is $20,087. The third comes in at $9,375. Countries in the fourth quintile have an average of $4,699 while those in the fifth fall in at $4,437. The report includes tables matching IPRI score and per capita GDP. Again, while the relationship between freedom and prosperity is not perfect, it is strongly positive.



Positive IPRI scores relate positively to other economic factors, such as foreign direct investment inflows and GDP growth. The poorest countries are most vulnerable to the adverse effects of economic statism. Wealthy, industrialized nations tend to have a free and prosperous heritage upon which they can rely. Third World states have no such advantage.



The report includes a number of specific case studies. One of the saddest is Venezuela, where all liberties, including private property protections, are under assault. Notes PRA:



“Commencing in 2001 with a set of decree‐​laws (i.e., executive orders with value and rank of laws) such as the one on Agrarian Reform …, a new trend began in Venezuela to ignore private property rights protected by article 115 of the 1999 Constitution. Moreover, with the takeover of a significant number of private agrarian lands starting in 2005, such a trend has become a State policy. The government’s strategy of systematically denying the existence of private property in different areas reached its highest manifestation with the enactment of new decree‐​laws in 2008 and recent legislation passed in 2009 by the National Assembly.



The result has been tragic for Venezuelan democracy as well as Venezuelan prosperity.



The report also notes how better property rights can promote non‐​economic ends, such as environmentalism. The study observes the World Bank “found that weak IP regimes were another form of [non‐​tariff barrier] undermining the transfer of climate friendly technologies.”



Moreover, better protection of property rights is essential for gender equality. Poor countries tend to do worse on protecting women’s property rights just as they do worse on protecting property rights generally. Of particular importance are women’s access to credit, land, and other property, as well as inheritance practices and social rights. In Uganda, for instance, “Despite the importance of land to women, the overriding feature of their relationship to land is insecure tenure.”



All countries could do better. Even Finland, notes the PRA: “The one area in which Finland needs to make progress is in [intellectual property rights], specifically copyright protection. Pirated material in business software is estimated to account for over 25 percent of the business software on the market.” The U.S. has further to go. The opportunities for improvement are modest, but nevertheless real.



Liberty is good. Milton Friedman was right: the most important justification for freedom is moral. But efficiency matters too. And protecting property rights is a critical basis of an efficient, productive, and innovative economy. Governments of rich and poor nations alike need to finally learn this lesson.

NOAA have just about finalised their numbers for the 2011 tornado season, although December figures still await confirmation.
It usually takes about three months to confirm the provisional reports as each tornado report has to be physically assessed by NWS personnel, in order to determine the category and, in many cases, even decide whether a tornado has actually occurred.

So let’s take a look at the figures, as they stand currently.

Historical Trends
When observing long term trends, it is important to remember that considerable changes have been made to the way that tornadoes are reported. NOAA have this to say :-
Improved tornado observation practices have led to an increase in the number of reported weaker tornadoes, and in recent years the number of EF0 and EF1 tornadoes have become more prevalent in the total number of reported tornadoes.
With increased national Doppler radar coverage [introduced between 1992 and 1997], increasing population, and greater attention to tornado reporting, there has been an increase in the number of tornado reports over the past several decades. This can create a misleading appearance of an increasing trend in tornado frequency. To better understand the true variability and trend in tornado frequency in the U.S., the total number of strong to violent tornadoes (EF3 to EF5 category on the Enhanced Fujita scale) can be analyzed. These are the tornadoes that would have likely been reported even during the decades before Doppler radar use became widespread and practices resulted in increasing tornado reports. The bar chart below indicates there has been little trend in the frequency of the strongest tornadoes over the past 55 years.

The effect of changes in observation can be clearly seen when looking at the ratio of the weakest F0 tornadoes to total numbers back to 1950, which rises from 10% to 60%.

US Tornadoes Per Year
When the weaker tornadoes are excluded, it is clear that there is very little trend since the 1980’s. It is also very apparent that tornado occurrences were much higher in all categories of F2 and above during the 1970’s, than in the decades since.
Even in 2011, the total of F2+ tornadoes, which amounted to 279, was only slightly above the average of 255 for the whole 1970-79 period.
Are Tornadoes Becoming More Extreme?
In overall terms, Figure 2 indicates that for F3+ categories, 2011 ranked only 6th worst since 1950. But is there any trend towards the most severe categories?
Figure 5

Figure 5 shows the number of F2+ tornadoes by category for each year since 2002 expressed as a percentage of the total of F2 to F5 occurrences. The dotted lines are the averages for the 1970’s. Although 2011 experienced a sharp increase in F3, F4 and F5’s, the pattern over the 10 years as a whole does not seem to indicate any real trend, simply going up and down around the historical averages.
Conclusions
Whilst nobody can predict what 2012 will bring, there fortunately seems to be no evidence to suggest that there is any trend towards an increase in numbers or severity of tornadoes in the US.
Notes
1) The F-scale (Fujita) was uprated to the EF-scale (Enhanced Fujita) in 2007. The intent at the time was that the new scale should be consistent with the old one, and that, therefore, previous years would not be “revalued”. (More on the change here.) Please excuse me then, when I use both terminologies at different times!
2) All tornado statistics have been sourced from the Storm Prediction Centre.

"**Welsh pubs, restaurants and cafes will be banned from serving alcohol from Friday and will be unable to open to customers beyond 18:00 GMT.**
First Minister Mark Drakeford announced the new rules to tackle a rise in coronavirus cases.
Business groups said the move would devastate Wales' hospitality industry, with closures ""guaranteed"".
Indoor entertainment and visitor attractions, including cinemas, museums and galleries, will also have to shut.
Businesses can offer a takeaway service after 18:00, and if they have an off-licence can sell takeaway alcohol up until 22:00.
The Conservative leader in the Senedd, Paul Davies, said the national approach from the Welsh Government was unfair on areas with low Covid rates.
Plaid Cymru said hospitality was ""paying the price"" for a lack of stricter measures after the firebreak lockdown ended on 9 November.
Mr Drakeford said without changes there could be between 1,000 and 1,700 preventable deaths over the winter.
The first minister said firms hit by the restrictions would be offered Â£340m in support which he claimed was ""the most generous package of financial assistance anywhere in the UK"".
Mr Drakeford told a press conference: ""I know these new restrictions will be difficult, coming as they do at the one of the busiest times of the year for the sector.
""Unfortunately, we continue to face a virus which is moving incredibly quickly across Wales and a virus that will exploit every opportunity when we spend time with one another.""
The case rate has risen from 187 per 100,000 people over seven days on Friday, to 210 cases per 100,000 people, Mr Drakeford added.
The restrictions come into effect at 18:00 on Friday, and are similar to the restrictions on hospitality within level three areas in Scotland.
However the rule allowing four people from four different households to meet indoors in pubs and restaurants will stay in place.
The decision will be reviewed on 17 December.
Bingo halls, bowling alleys, soft play centres, casinos, skating rinks and amusement arcades will also have to close.
Meanwhile current restrictions on travel into England, implemented while a lockdown is in place over the border, are being reviewed.
The first minister said he would make a further announcement later this week.
The chief executive of one of Wales' largest breweries says she wants the Welsh Government to prove that Covid is being spread in pubs and restaurants.
""Where is the scientific evidence that you are more at risk in a pub than you are at home or in a supermarket?"" said Connie Parry of Tomos Watkin brewery in Swansea.
Ian Price, director of business lobby group CBI Wales, warned closures and job losses were ""all but guaranteed"" in pubs and restaurants.
""The first minister's announcement is devastating for a Welsh hospitality sector that's already reeling from a damaging cycle of restrictions,"" he said.
Dai Dearden, general manager of The Grange pub in Cardiff, said the announcement was a ""hammer-blow"".
""I think it will close us for the time being at one of the busiest times of the year"", he said, adding it would have ""a massive effect on the health and well-being, and mental state, of my staff and our customers"".
Tom Simmons, the chef and co-owner of Thomas in Pontcanna, Cardiff, said: ""The spend in our restaurant is around 70% on food and drink - and we will lose customers who know they can't have a drink with their meal. Many won't come back because of that.""
""I don't see any reason or logic behind this. All it will do is lead to people gathering at home and drinking instead - it would be structured with restaurants and pubs, not in people's homes.""
Joanne Cooney runs the Irish Bar in Llandudno in Conwy county, which currently has the lowest coronavirus case rate out of Wales' 22 counties.
She said: ""The numbers are high in big towns and we're being penalised for them. Our numbers are low. We should've been able to open and trade.""
""People are not going to come in. You've just turned us into a coffee shop, the town has loads of coffee shops - that's not what we are.""
Ben Francis, of the Federation of Small Business, said it was ""incredibly important"" that promised funding ""can be rolled out as a matter of urgency"".
""There is no getting away from the fact that today's announcement will come as a devastating blow to those indoor entertainment and hospitality firms that have fought tooth and nail to protect jobs, remain viable and provide a safe environment for their staff and customers this year.""
Meanwhile, Folly Farm adventure park and zoo in Pembrokeshire announced it would be closing, saying it was ""heavily reliant"" on the indoor part of the business.
A spokesman for the Welsh Association of Visitor Attractions, which represents more than 70 family attractions in Wales, said the Welsh Government did not consult with tourism leaders before deciding the new rules.
""The health of Wales is paramount, but the way tourism decisions are now being taken is scandalous.
""Some members have stated that the stop-go, no-consultation policy of the Welsh Government is affecting both their health and well-being, and that the Welsh tourism industry is in a state of utter despair at the way it is being treated,"" it said.
The first minister told the press conference that the evidence ""is there"" that the virus is spreading in hospitality - and said it could be seen from a series of reports from the Welsh Government's Technical Advisory Cell.
""When people meet together in a hospitality setting, you're not just having a glancing encounter with somebody as you do if you're going round a supermarket,"" he said.
""You're sitting together with people for a significant period of time.""
BBC Wales has asked to see the evidence cited by Mr Drakeford.
A Welsh Government spokesman referred to a report from the scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage) in September which estimated that closing bars, pubs, cafes and restaurants would have a ""moderate impact"" on Covid transmission.
Hospitality businesses were allowed to open after the firebreak ended earlier in November.
Mr Drakeford said scientific and medical experts had warned that by 12 January, the total number of people with Covid in hospital could rise to 2,200 ""unless we respond now"".
According to the House Of Commons Library there are 2,190 pubs in Wales.
Paul Davies, Welsh Conservative Senedd leader, said: ""This blanket approach across all of Wales is disproportionate and will unfairly affect parts of the country where infection rates are significantly lower than others, and will harm the sector to such an extent that large parts of it may not recover.""
Plaid Cymru said it had called for stricter measures as Wales came out of its firebreak lockdown.
""The Labour Welsh Government failed to do that and now hospitality is paying the price,"" Helen Mary Jones, Plaid's economy spokeswoman, said.
Caroline Jones, of the Independent Reform Alliance in the Senedd, said the national approach would ""strangle the hospitality sector further at the very time of year in the run up to Christmas where many pubs, cafes and restaurants make their profits"".
The Â£160m ""Restrictions Business Fund"" will offer firms in the hospitality, tourism and leisure sectors that pay non-domestic rates (NDR) grants of up to Â£5,000.
The Welsh Government estimated around 60,000 businesses with a rateable value of under Â£150,000 would receive the support.
A ""sector-specific"" Â£180m Economic Resilience Fund would be made available for hospitality, tourism and leisure businesses.
The Welsh Government said small and medium sized businesses meeting the criteria could receive up to Â£100,000, while larger firms could receive up to a maximum of Â£150,000.
The financial support for the hospitality industry is significant and much more than it has been given before.
But coming just a month after the two-week firebreak, these restrictions will be a deadly blow for some traders.
Once again the Welsh Government is having to walk a fine line, beating the virus by reducing the amount we meet others, while at the same time trying to protect the businesses we usually go out to.
Urban pubs may still attract shoppers for a ""dry"" lunch but they are unlikely to spend nearly as much as usual.
Rural pubs, often a community's main place to meet, are more dependent on their evening trade.
The money they are getting from the Welsh Government might well pay overheads like rent and insurance but these are businesses that have already taken a huge hit this year."

From NASA Goddard, Jim Hansen reports on his balance problem:
Earth’s Energy Budget Remained Out of Balance Despite Unusually Low Solar Activity

A prolonged solar minimum left the sun's surface nearly free of sunspots and accompanying bright areas called faculae between 2005 and 2010. Total solar irradiance declined slightly as a result, but the Earth continued to absorb more energy than it emit throughout the minimum. An animation of a full solar cycle is available here. Credit: NASA Goddard's Scientific Visualization Studio
A new NASA study underscores the fact that greenhouse gases generated by human activity — not changes in solar activity — are the primary force driving global warming.
The study offers an updated calculation of the Earth’s energy imbalance, the difference between the amount of solar energy absorbed by Earth’s surface and the amount returned to space as heat. The researchers’ calculations show that, despite unusually low solar activity between 2005 and 2010, the planet continued to absorb more energy than it returned to space.
James Hansen, director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) in New York City, led the research. Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics published the study last December.
Total solar irradiance, the amount of energy produced by the sun that reaches the top of each square meter of the Earth’s atmosphere, typically declines by about a tenth of a percent during cyclical lulls in solar activity caused by shifts in the sun’s magnetic field. Usually solar minimums occur about every eleven years and last a year or so, but the most recent minimum persisted more than two years longer than normal, making it the longest minimum recorded during the satellite era.
A graph of the sun's total solar irradiance shows that in recent years irradiance dipped to the lowest levels recorded during the satellite era. The resulting reduction in the amount of solar energy available to affect Earth's climate was about .25 watts per square meter, less than half of Earth's total energy imbalance. (Credit: NASA/James Hansen)
Pinpointing the magnitude of Earth’s energy imbalance is fundamental to climate science because it offers a direct measure of the state of the climate. Energy imbalance calculations also serve as the foundation for projections of future climate change. If the imbalance is positive and more energy enters the system than exits, Earth grows warmer. If the imbalance is negative, the planet grows cooler.
Hansen’s team concluded that Earth has absorbed more than half a watt more solar energy per square meter than it let off throughout the six year study period. The calculated value of the imbalance (0.58 watts of excess energy per square meter) is more than twice as much as the reduction in the amount of solar energy supplied to the planet between maximum and minimum solar activity (0.25 watts per square meter).
“The fact that we still see a positive imbalance despite the prolonged solar minimum isn’t a surprise given what we’ve learned about the climate system, but it’s worth noting because this provides unequivocal evidence that the sun is not the dominant driver of global warming,” Hansen said.
According to calculations conducted by Hansen and his colleagues, the 0.58 watts per square meter imbalance implies that carbon dioxide levels need to be reduced to about 350 parts per million to restore the energy budget to equilibrium. The most recent measurements show that carbon dioxide levels are currently 392 parts per million and scientists expect that concentration to continue to rise in the future.
Climate scientists have been refining calculations of the Earth’s energy imbalance for many years, but this newest estimate is an improvement over previous attempts because the scientists had access to better measurements of ocean temperature than researchers have had in the past.
The improved measurements came from free-floating instruments that directly monitor the temperature, pressure and salinity of the upper ocean to a depth of 2,000 meters (6,560 feet). The network of instruments, known collectively as Argo, has grown dramatically in recent years since researchers first began deploying the floats a decade ago. Today, more than 3,400 Argo floats actively take measurements and provide data to the public, mostly within 24 hours.
Data collected by Argo floats, such as this one, helped Hansen's team improve the calculation of Earth's energy imbalance. Credit: Argo Project Office
Hansen’s analysis of the information collected by Argo, along with other ground-based and satellite data, show the upper ocean has absorbed 71 percent of the excess energy and the Southern Ocean, where there are few Argo floats, has absorbed 12 percent. The abyssal zone of the ocean, between about 3,000 and 6,000 meters (9,800 and 20,000 feet) below the surface, absorbed five percent, while ice absorbed eight percent and land four percent.
The updated energy imbalance calculation has important implications for climate modeling. Its value, which is slightly lower than previous estimates, suggests that most climate models overestimate how readily heat mixes deeply into the ocean and significantly underestimates the cooling effect of small airborne particles called aerosols, which along with greenhouse gases and solar irradiance are critical factors in energy imbalance calculations.
“Climate models simulate observed changes in global temperatures quite accurately, so if the models mix heat into the deep ocean too aggressively, it follows that they underestimate the magnitude of the aerosol cooling effect,” Hansen said.
Aerosols, which can either warm or cool the atmosphere depending on their composition and how they interact with clouds, are thought to have a net cooling effect. But estimates of their overall impact on climate are quite uncertain given how difficult it is to measure the distribution of the particles on a broad scale. The new study suggests that the overall cooling effect from aerosols could be about twice as strong as current climate models suggest, largely because few models account for how the particles affect clouds.

“Unfortunately, aerosols remain poorly measured from space,” said Michael Mishchenko, a scientist also based at GISS and the project scientist for Glory, a satellite mission designed to measure aerosols in unprecedented detail that was lost after a launch failure in early 2011. “We must have a much better understanding of the global distribution of detailed aerosol properties in order to perfect calculations of Earth’s energy imbalance,” said Mishchenko.

By Christopher Monckton of Brenchley
Responses to my post of December 28 about climate sensitivity have been particularly interesting. This further posting answers some of the feedback.
My earlier posting explained how the textbooks establish that if albedo and insolation were held constant but all greenhouse gases were removed from the air the Earth’s surface temperature would be 255 K. Since today’s temperature is 288 K, the presence as opposed to absence of all the greenhouse gases – including H2O, CO2, CH4, N2O and stratospheric O3 – causes 33 K warming.

Kiehl and Trenberth say that the interval of total forcing from the five main greenhouse gases is 101[86, 125] Watts per square meter. Since just about all temperature feedbacks since the dawn of the Earth have acted by now, the post-feedback or equilibrium system climate sensitivity parameter is 33 K divided by the forcing interval – namely 0.33[0.27, 0.39] Kelvin per Watt per square meter.
Multiplying the system sensitivity parameter interval by any given radiative forcing yields the corresponding equilibrium temperature change. The IPCC takes the forcing from a doubling of CO2 concentration as 3.7 Watts per square meter, so the corresponding warming – the system climate sensitivity – is 1.2[1.0, 1.4] K, or about one-third of the IPCC’s 3.3[2.0, 4.5] K.
I also demonstrated that the officially-estimated 2 Watts per square meter of radiative forcings and consequent manmade temperature changes of 0.4-0.8 K since 1750 indicated a transient industrial-era sensitivity of 1.1[0.7, 1.5] K, very much in line with the independently-determined system sensitivity.
Accordingly. transient and equilibrium sensitivities are so close to one another that temperature feedbacks – additional forcings that arise purely because temperature has changed in response to initial or base forcings – are very likely to be net-zero.
Indeed, with net-zero feedbacks the IPCC’s transient-sensitivity parameter is 0.31 Kelvin per Watt per square meter, close to the 0.33 that I had derived as the system equilibrium or post-feedback parameter.
I concluded that climate sensitivity to the doubling of CO2 concentration expected this century is low enough to be harmless.
One regular troll – one can tell he is a troll by his silly hate-speech about how I “continue to fool yourself and others” – attempted to say that Kiehl and Trenberth’s 86-125 Watts per square meter of total forcing from the presence of the top five greenhouse gases included the feedbacks consequent upon the forcing, asserting, without evidence, that I (and by implication the two authors) was confusing forcings and feedbacks.
No: Kiehl and Trenberth are quite specific in their paper: “We calculate the longwave radiative forcing of a given gas by sequentially removing atmospheric absorbers from the radiation model. We perform these calculations for clear and cloudy sky conditions to illustrate the role of clouds to a given absorber for the total radiative forcing. Table 3 lists the individual contribution of each absorber to the total clear-sky [and cloudy-sky] radiative forcing.” Forcing, not feedback. Indeed, the word “feedback” does not occur even once in Kiehl & Trenberth’s paper.
In particular, the troll thought we were treating the water-vapor feedback as though it were a forcing. We were not, of course, but let us pretend for a moment that we were. If we now add CO2 to the atmospheric mix and disturb what the IPCC assumes to have been a prior climatic equilibrium, then by the Clausius-Clapeyron relation the space occupied by the atmosphere is capable of holding near-exponentially more water vapor as it warms. This – to the extent that it occurred – would indeed be a feedback.
However, as Paltridge et al. (2009) have demonstrated, it is not clear that the water vapor feedback is anything like as strongly positive as the IPCC would like us to believe. Below the mid-troposphere, additional water vapor makes very little difference because its principal absorption bands are largely saturated. Above it, the additional water vapor tends to subside harmlessly to lower altitudes, again making very little difference to temperature. The authors conclude that feedbacks are somewhat net-negative, a conclusion supported by measurements given in papers such as Lindzen & Choi (2009, 2010), Spencer & Braswell (2010, 2011), and Shaviv (2011).
It is also worth recalling that Solomon et al. (2009) say equilibrium will not be reached for up to 3000 years after we perturb the climate. If so, it is only the transient climate change (one-third of the IPCC’s ’quilibrium estimate) that will occur in our lifetime and in that of our grandchildren. Whichever way you stack it, manmade warming in our own era will be small and, therefore, harmless.
A true-believer at the recent Los Alamos quinquennial climate conference at Santa Fe asked me, in a horrified voice, whether I was really willing to allow our grandchildren to pay for the consequences of our folly in emitting so much CO2. Since the warming we shall cause will be small and may well prove to be beneficial, one hopes future generations will be grateful to us.
Besides, as President Klaus of the Czech Republic has wisely pointed out, if we damage our grandchildren’s inheritance by blowing it on useless windmills, mercury-filled light-bulbs, solar panels, and a gallimaufry of suchlike costly, wasteful, environment-destroying fashion statements, our heirs will certainly not thank us.
Mr. Wingo and others wonder whether it is appropriate to assume that the sum of various different fourth powers of temperature over the entire surface of the Earth will be equal to the fourth power of the global temperature as determined by the fundamental equation of radiative transfer. By zonal calculation on several hundred zones of equal height and hence of equal spherical-surface area, making due allowance for the solar azimuth angle applicable to each zone, I have determined that the equation does indeed provide a very-nearly-accurate mean surface temperature, varying from the sum of the zonal means by just 0.5 K in total. In mathematical terms, the Holder inequality is in this instance near-vanishingly small.
Dr. Nikolov, however, considers that the textbooks and the literature are wrong in this respect: but I have deliberately confined my analysis to textbook methods and “mainstream-science” data precisely so as to minimize the scope for any disagreement on the part of those who – until now – have gone along with the IPCC’s assertion that climate sensitivity is high enough to be dangerous. Deploying their own methods and drawing proper conclusions from them is more likely to lead them to rethink their position than attempting to reinvent the wheel.
Mr. Martin asks whether I’d be willing to apply my calculations to Venus. However, I do not share the view of Al Gore, Dr. Nikolov, or Mr. Huffman that Venus is likely to give us the answers we need about climate sensitivity on Earth. A brief critique of Mr. Huffman’s analysis of the Venusian atmospheric soup and its implications for climate sensitivity is at Jo Nova’s ever-fragrant and always-eloquent website.
Brian H asks whether Dr. Nikolov is right in his finding that, for several astronomical bodies [including Venus] all that matters in the determination of surface temperature is the mass of the atmospheric overburden. Since I am not yet content that Dr. Nikolov is right in concluding that the Earth’s characteristic-emission temperature is 100 K less than the 255 K given in the textbooks, I am disinclined to enquire further into his theory until this rather large discrepancy is resolved.
Rosco is surprised by the notion of dividing the incoming solar irradiance by 4 to determine the Wattage per square meter of the Earth’s surface. I have taken this textbook step because the Earth intercepts a disk-sized area of insolation, which must be distributed over the rotating spherical surface, and the ratio of the surface area of a disk to that of a sphere of equal radius is 1:4.
Other commenters have asked whether the fact that the characteristic-emission sphere has a greater surface area than the Earth makes a difference. No, it doesn’t, because the ratio of the surface areas of disk and sphere is 1:4 regardless of the radius and hence surface area of the sphere.
Rosco also cites Kiehl and Trenberth’s notion that the radiation absorbed and emitted at the Earth’s surface is 390 Watts per square meter. The two authors indicate, in effect, that they derived that value by multiplying the fourth power of the Earth’s mean surface temperature of 288 K by the Stefan-Boltzmann constant (0.0000000567 Watts per square meter per Kelvin to the fourth power).
If Kiehl & Trenberth were right to assume that a strict Stefan-Boltzmann relation holds at the surface in this way, then we might legitimately point out that the pre-feedback climate-sensitivity parameter – the first differential of the fundamental equation of radiative transfer at the above values for surface radiative flux and temperature – would be just 288/(390 x 4) = 0.18 Kelvin per Watt per square meter. If so, even if we were to assume the IPCC’s implicit central estimate of strongly net-positive feedbacks at 2.1 Watts per square meter per Kelvin the equilibrium climate sensitivity to a CO2 doubling would be 3.7 x 0.18 / (1 – 2.1 x 0.18) = 1.1 K. And where have we seen that value before?
In all this, of course, I do not warrant any of the IPCC’s or Kiehl and Trenberth’s or the textbooks’ methods or data or results as correct: that would be well above my pay-grade. However, as Mr. Fernley-Jones has correctly noticed, I am quite happy to demonstrate that if their methods and values are correct then climate sensitivity – whichever way one does the calculation – is about one-third of what they would like us to believe it is.
All the contributors – even the trolls – have greatly helped me in clarifying what is in essence a simple but not simpliste argument. To those who have wanted to complicate the argument in various ways, I say that, as the splendid Willis Eschenbach has pointed out before in this column, one should keep firmly in mind the distinction between first-order effects that definitely change the outcome, second-order effects that may or may not change it but won’t change it much, and third-order effects that definitely won’t change it enough to make a difference. One should ruthlessly exclude third-order effects, however superficially interesting.
Given that the IPCC seems to be exaggerating climate sensitivity threefold, only the largest first-order influences are going to make a significant difference to the calculation. And it is the official or textbook treatment of these influences that I have used throughout.
My New Year’s resolution is to write a short book about the climate question, in which the outcome of the discussions here will be presented. The book will say that climate sensitivity is low; that, even if it were as high as the IPCC wants us to think, it would be at least an order of magnitude cheaper to adapt to the consequences of any warming that may occur than to try, Canute-like, to prevent it; that there are multiple lines of evidence for systematic and connected corruption and fraud on the part of the surprisingly small clique of politically-motivated “scientists” who have fabricated and driven the now-failing climate scare; and that too many who ought to know better have looked the other way as their academic, scientific, political, or journalistic colleagues have perpetrated and perpetuated their shoddy frauds, because silence in the face of official mendacity is socially convenient, politically expedient, and, above all, financially profitable.
The final chapter will add that there is a real danger that the UN, using advisors from the European Union, will succeed in exploiting the fraudulent science peddled by the climate/environment axis as a Trojan horse to extinguish democracy in those countries which, unlike the nations of Europe, are still fortunate enough to have it; that the world’s freedom is consequently at immediate and grave risk from the vaunting ambition of a grasping, talent-free, scientifically-illiterate ruling elite of world-government wannabes everywhere; but that – as the recent history of the bureaucratic-centralist and now-failed EU has demonstrated – the power-mad adidacts are doomed, and they will be brought low by the ineluctable futility of their attempts to tinker with the laws of physics and of economics.
The army of light and truth, however few we be, will quietly triumph over the forces of darkness in the end: for, whether they like it or not, the unalterable truth cannot indefinitely be confused, concealed, or contradicted. We did not make the laws of science: therefore, it is beyond our power to repeal them.

This post over on Scottish Sceptic’s website (below) points to a problem that WUWT has with search engines. One big issue he raises is that I can’t edit meta tags in the website header, but then again, I’ve had a clue that hasn’t mattered for a couple of years now, from the WordPress forum:
It’s not possible to edit meta tags on WordPress.com blogs.
…
Moreover Google does not use the keywords meta tag in web ranking – Monday, September 21, 2009

WUWT – page 35 when searching for “global warming”
Posted on November 9, 2011 by Scottish Sceptic
Following some comments on WUWT about the “+1″ scheme to boost ratings, I first joined the scheme, then decided to do it the old fashioned way and click on the WUWT link when searching for “global warming”.
So, imagine my surprise when I found WUWT on …
PAGE 35
Yes, that is right! WUWT was on page 35 … I had to double check to make sure it was right because it was behind the GWPF, behind climate audit, behind unrealclimate, behind the IPCC behind sites that none of us have ever heard of.

So, why was it on page 35 of the google results?
Why having clicked on it just once, did it move (via another PC on another URL) to page 34?
And, why when I checked the page, was there not a single meta-tag telling the google search engine this site had anything or wanted anything to do with global warming?

The simple answer given the ease by which I escalated the ranking by a single click is that no one ever clicks on a WUWT page when they search for global warming. And before everyone starts point to google bias, obviously, no one trusts the top ranking sites (they are mostly paid for … or promoted due to google’s own politics) but whilst it is quite possible WUWT has a lower ranking than it should, I think there is much more to this and quite a lot has nothing to do with Google and so I have a few suggestions:

I have to be honest, and say that I don’t think Anthony Watts has a clue about publicising his site particularly for search engines. E.g. he doesn’t even mention global warming as a search term in the meta tabs telling search engines which words and phrases characterise the site. That just screams out that he doesn’t exactly make his site google friendly and it’s not surprising that it is so lowly rated.
Sceptics most probably do not use Google to find the site. If we don’t search on google, how is google supposed to know that people want to find that site when they search?
And yes, Google hates WUWT … and more than likely is actively trying to repress the site. OK, we have to accept that, so we have to work together to try to reverse this.

What can be done
1. Search for global warming and click on the WUWT site.
Go to google and enter “global warming”. Then click the last number at the bottom to go to pages 10, then 19, etc. until you reach page 35 3435.
(Addendum: the next WUWT page is around page 70 of google results!!)
Then start going backwards until you find an entry for any page linked to wattsupwiththat.com and then click it.
Repeat prescription every day!
2. Add a link to wattsupwiththat.com
Where ever and when ever add a link.
3. Join the “+1 scheme“
Join the scheme and then find the WUWT pages and press the +1 button

He makes some good points that would make a good new year’s resolution – help spread the word. There is one thing I can do, and that is make a change to the header image to remove the masthead statement and place it into the first lines of text. I’ve made that change today to see if it helps.
As always, my sincerest thanks in advance to everyone who helps support this website in words and deeds.

"In Aesop’s fable of the boy who cried wolf, the boy warns farmers of imaginary wolves threatening their flocks just to laugh at the sight of them running to the rescue for no reason. Of course, when the real wolf comes no one believes his cries – the moral of the story being that nobody believes a liar, even when he tells the truth. There are some species in nature that also cry wolf, but they are much more clever about it than the boy in the fable. A new study published in the journal Science has shown how a species of African birds called fork-tailed drongos will cry wolf in a bid to steal a free lunch from those they alarm. They wait for an unsuspecting pied babbler or meerkat to find an especially tasty morsel such as a lizard or cricket. Then the drongo screams blue murder and, as the terrified animal runs for cover, swoops in and nabs the abandoned meal. This system relies on the fact that drongos also sound the alarm when predators actually are present. In fact they act as sentinels, perching high up in the trees and scanning for danger – predators such as foxes, mongooses, and especially raptors such as goshawks – and will quickly call an alarm before diving for cover themselves. Meerkats and other birds, such as babblers and starlings, also produce alarm calls, and since they share many predators each pays attention to the warnings given by the other. Cross-species alarm calls use is actually quite common in the avian world because a bird that eavesdrops on others’ alarm calls could gain critical, potentially life saving information about predators. For example, members of a species I’ve worked on in North America, called chickadees, are adept at spotting danger and more than 50 different species of birds are known to respond to their alarms. Australian fairy-wrens and scrub-wrens also respond to each other’s alarm calls, and recent work has demonstrated that this interspecies understanding is learned. This type of cross-species, or heterospecific, eavesdropping is not restricted to birds either. Several types of monkeys eavesdrop on each other’s alarm calls and birds called hornbills can also distinguish between primate alarm calls. Even some species of lizard – which don’t vocalize at all – can understand alarm calls relevant to them. Predators have, naturally, dramatic impacts on their prey, and it should not be a surprise that animals will use whatever means possible to avoid becoming something else’s lunch. So, while alarm calling is common, the deceptive use of alarm calls to trick eavesdroppers is much rarer. This type of behaviour was originally proposed for mixed species bird flocks in the Amazon, but fork-tailed drongos are probably the best example. But how do they avoid the fate of the boy who cried wolf in the fable, with other species becoming wise to their false alarms? Drongos have another trick up their sleeves: they pretend to be those other species.  Watching how humans or animals react to repeated stimuli is a commonly used psychological test to ascertain whether a response is habitual or whether the response is connected in some way to the context or source of the stimuli. The boy in the fable crying wolf is eventually ignored, but a cry from someone other than the boy would generate a response, because it is the source of the cry (the boy) that is relevant, rather than the cry itself. The same principle appears in groups of animals; a drongo giving repeated false alarms might soon be ignored were it not for the fact that, as a look-out, the drongo also provides warning of real threats. By mimicking the alarm calls of other species the drongo appears even more reliable.  What the researchers behind this study observed is that drongos adjust their calling behaviour depending on their audience. They are more likely to mimic the species they are targeting – if it’s a babbler they wish to steal from they produce an imitation of the babbler’s alarm, if it is a starling, they imitate the starling.       Drongos were more than twice as likely to mimic a target species’ alarm call during attempts to steal a free meal than that of other species, and when the researchers played back these mimiced calls they found babblers responded more strongly to a drongo mimicking them than to the drongo’s own alarm calls. This suggests that drongos associate each of the mimicked calls with a particular species, rather than simply treating their entire repertoire of alarm calls as the same and interchangeable.  The cunning drongo even goes one step further in this charade, keeping track of whether they have previously fooled certain individual babblers, and varying their alarm calls when attempting to fool and steal from the same individual. The researchers played back alarm calls to babblers and demonstrated that birds become habituated to false alarms, but will respond again if the type of alarm call is changed. Drongos that change their call were much more successful at getting a meal: the likelihood of stealing food from an unsuspecting babbler increased by nearly 50% compared with individuals that did not change their alarm call.  Taken together, this suggests these birds might understand the experience of babblers, indicative of sophisticated cognitive abilities; a very clever bird indeed."

Share this...FacebookTwitterSebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt of Die kalte Sonne site bring up an article that recently appeared in the German economics magazine: Deutsche Wirtschafts Nachrichten (German Business News).

Logo of German economics magazine, who recently published a critical article on climate science here.
Media outlets in Europe are beginning to question all the global warming claims, especially as Central Europe reels from one of its coldest springs in living memory.
The article is dubbed: “Scientists have embarrassed themselves: climate change is not happening.”
The introduction of the report tells us:
Most climate models have falsely predicted global warming: Despite growing emissions of so-called greenhouse gases, temperatures are not rising. Snow in the winter is however a side-effect of global warming, climate scientists say.”
Have you noticed how it is getting increasingly difficult not to bust out laughing whenever “climate scientists” make statements? Deutsche Wirtschafts Nachrichten continues:
Richard Tol of the University of Sussex said in Oslo that his impression is that temperatures have fallen over the last five years, Reuters reported.”

Deutsche Wirtschafts Nachrichten then writes how scientists have been scrambling to explain the unexpected stop in warming, citing oceans eating up the heat or aerosols blocking out sunlight. But all this sounds rather unconvincing to Deutsche Wirtschafts Nachrichten, which adds the following subtitle in the article:
Vertrauen in die Klima-Forschung erschüttert
Which in English translates to: “Trust in climate science has been shaken“. The online business magazine tells us:
The UN IPCC had to correct a report from the year 2007. The report had exaggerated the melting of the Himalayan glaciers, and even claimed that they could disappear completely by 2035.”
See how we’re all laughing again. So entertaining climate science has become.
But don’t let the cold fool you, Rajendra Pachauri insists. Deutsche Wirtschafts Nachrichten writes:
Even though the IPCC admits to errors in their prognoses, says Pachauri: ‘The trend is clear.’ For the year 2016 to 2035 the IPCC projects that the temperatures will be 0.4°C to 1.0°C warmer than the two decades before 2005. Moreover, climate change may lead to rare phenomena – among them: it’ll snow more often in the wintertime, Pachauri said.”
Climate science has truly turned into comedy hour. I used to be able to read such reports in only a few minutes, but I’ve noticed I need more time lately because of all the laughing that climate scientists now generate. I don’t mind at all, though.
The Deutsche Wirtschafts Nachrichten ends its report by writing that scientists are also claiming that a growing Antarctic sea ice is also a sign of global warming – through some weird melting-ice refreezing mechanism, which everyone is still trying to figure out.
A nice piece by the Deutsche Wirtschafts Nachrichten.

She has the magical power of being able to see a colourless, odourless, trace gas and even makes the cover of Vogue alongside our Dear Leader. However, some French political leaders are not drinking the Kool-Aid.



As James Delingpole so eloquently stated in February: _Her alarmist rhetoric was exactly the kind of half-baked, ill-informed, emotive, unscientific and utterly impractical tosh you’d expect to hear from a brainwashed 16-year old schoolgirl_.



Teen climate activist Greta Thunberg was invited to the French parliament this week but not all were worshipping at her feet.



MPs Guillaume Larrivé and Julien Aubert of the conservative Republicans called for a boycott of the Swedish activist, labelling her a “ **prophetess in shorts** ”.



“To fight climate change intelligently, **we do not need apocalyptic gurus** , but scientific progress and political courage,” Mr Larrivé said.



“We are invited to a prediction of **Saint Greta Thunberg** , surrounded by people who see global warming as a religion,” Mr Aubert told Le Figaro and added that Thunberg had no qualifications and **used only emotive arguments** , saying there was no debate to be had.



Politicians from other parties were also dismissive. 



Sébastien Chenu, a member of Marine Le Pen’s National Rally, also slammed the invite saying: “She has no legitimacy other than media, **I do not see why I would go prostrate before her.** ”



“She is a committed young woman, but **she brings nothing to the debate** , and is not enough to mask all the hypocrisy of the government. The members of the National Rally will not take part in this masquerade,” he added.



National Rally MEP Jordan Baredella, who led the party to election victory in the European Parliament elections in May, labelled Thunberg’s movement “ **a new form of totalitarianism** ”.



“This **dictatorship of permanent emotion, moreover when it is based on children** , is a new form of totalitarianism. It is beyond ridiculous,” he said.



Did you ever read a better description of Ardern’s leadership? **“A dictatorship of permanent emotion, based on children.”**



And while not based upon children the dictatorship of pure emotion was the driving reason for the ill-considered rush to control firearms.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German National Weather Service (DWD) has released the preliminary climate data for June 2013.
June in Germany has been quite variable with low temperatures recorded at the start and the end of the month, and a brief, yet record-setting heat just after the middle of the month. Early June also saw record precipitation resulting in wide scale flooding.
As for mean temperature for June, it was normal, which means it was way below model projections. Things aren’t supposed to be normal. The DWD writes:
The average temperature nationwide was 15.8°C. Thus it was about 0.4°C over the internationally valid reference period of 1961 to 1990. Compared to the 1981 to 2010 period, there was no deviation.
That means that there was no climate warming for Germany. According to computer models, which project a 4°C warming by the year 2100 for the current business-as-usual CO2 emissions, temperature today should be about 1.5°C above the 1961 – 1990 reference period mean. Therefore the mean temperature for Germany for June was yet again way below that which had been projected by climate models.

Global temperature development. Source: papundits/every-model-wrong/
The divergence between observed and model-projected global temperatures keeps getting broader. Too bad Obama’s advisors didn’t tell the president that.
According to the DWD, only a few days in June were summerlike and hot. At 98 liters of precipitation per square meter on average, June was 16% wetter than normal (85 l/m²), well within the normal range of variability. But stations in the south and east experienced particularly heavy deluges in early June, for example Aschau-Stein in Chiemgau on June 2-3, two hundred seventy five l/m² fell in 48 hours. From May 26 to June 2, more than 22,76 cubic kilometers of rain fell over Germany.
At approximately 200 hours, sunshine was normal (198 hours).
Lots of weather changes in June, but no climate change.

"While a privatised energy market has delivered stable and cost-effective electricity to Britain’s national grid for 25 years, the world and the pressures it faces are changing. A group of Newcastle University academics led by Professor Phil Taylor, director of the university’s Institute for Research on Sustainability, this week raised some important questions that go right to the heart of current energy policy dilemmas. One of the most controversial points is the contradiction between the liberalised energy market philosophy dominant since 1990, and governments’ apparent inability to ensure the market invests in the low-carbon technologies necessary to meet their ambitious emissions reductions targets. More central planning and a strategic view beyond market forces, the academics argue, is needed. So is a return to something like the CEGB, the Central Electric Generating Board responsible for Britain’s power supply until privatisation, the way forward? In reality, governments in the UK and abroad have for some time been drifting away from relying on market forces alone. The obvious explanation is that markets respond only to the signals they are given. If producing carbon and other greenhouse gases comes with no significant cost attached, then it is quite rational for power companies, responsible for delivering profits to their shareholders, to continue to burn fossil fuels. The main mechanism for introducing emissions limits through market forces, the EU emissions trading scheme, was largely undermined by an excessively generous initial issue of permits, doubts about the scheme’s long-term future and a lack of flexibility in responding to the recession or to the impact of other EU or national policies aimed at supporting renewables or energy efficiency. So Professor Taylor’s broadside is on strong ground when he argues that fossil fuel-generated energy is too cheap – little or no costs have been assigned to the very substantial future burden brought about by the consequences of a changing climate driven by CO2  emissions. Chief among the other market-limiting factors is the sheer uncertainty brought about by inconsistent energy and climate policy that deters new investment. This has already seen companies close power stations and abandon plans for new capacity. There is no global shortage of infrastructure investment money that seeks only modest returns in an era of low interest rates. But those investors quite reasonably demand at least a reasonable degree of certainty before investing huge sums. In practice that requires very strong government and regulatory commitments. British governments commitments to low-carbon investments include feed-in tariffs or other subsidies for both renewables and nuclear energy. Carbon capture and storage (CCS), probably a vital component of a long-term strategy, has not received much funding so far, with only two projects (in Yorkshire and Scotland) underway. Like it or not, a green agenda has drawn government into making decisions for the power sector. It’s hard to see a return to reliance on markets alone to deliver climate policy objectives. The challenge is to make sure that this is done competently, resulting in a well-balanced mix of power generating plant for the future and equally important investments to improve transmission networks and energy efficiency. In the form of the Department for Energy and Climate Change, the government seems ill-equipped for the task.  Professor Taylor argues for “an independent, expert body who can act as an overall system architect”, but we need to be much more specific about what such a strategic authority would be and what we would want from it. Independent expert advice already comes through the Committee on Climate Change. We can assume a great deal of technical advice comes from the National Grid. But keeping the ultimate decision-making within government has serious weaknesses – not least an increased vulnerability to lobbying from special interest groups, and to a politicisation of the decision-making process. Almost certainly we require an independent agency formally responsible for delivering a low-carbon power sector, making procurement choices, and with the power to enter into long term contracts with energy companies. One option, but not the only one, would be to give these powers to the National Grid, which is already a vendor-neutral provider of core system services. Such an agency could be public or private sector, and unlike the CEGB would not be encouraged to own or build its own power stations. Whatever the answer this would be a major institutional change, with huge commercial implications for the sector.  Professor Taylor’s brief implicitly assumes that more central control and planning of supply will be compatible with the aim to generate more competition among supply companies. At the very least this is not obviously the case; in the context of current markets, central direction tends to undermine competition. We need a new take on the retail market that will allow more companies to take their own approaches to what products and packages to offer consumers. This should promote innovation in the ways consumers use energy, not least in ways that reflect its true cost, as Professor Taylor advocates. The most impressive example of a large and successful power sector decarbonisation has been the huge French nuclear programme of the 1980s. This was driven by political consensus on the strategic need to reduce oil dependency. Its essential features were a powerful but independent agency, combined with a wholehearted commitment from the government to the objective. In the UK, these have been often promised but not yet delivered. Britain need not copy France’s reliance on a nuclear programme, but these two features – often promised in the UK but not yet delivered – are not optional to copy its success."

Peter Wallsten of the _Wall Street Journal_ writes, “Libertarianism is enjoying a recent renaissance in the Republican Party.” He cites Ron Paul’s winning the presidential straw poll earlier this year at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Rand Paul’s upset victory in the Kentucky senatorial primary, and former governor Gary Johnson’s evident interest in a libertarian‐​leaning presidential campaign. Johnson tells Wallsten in an interview that he’ll campaign on spending cuts — including military spending, on entitlements reform, and on a rational approach to drug policy.   
  
  
Meanwhile, on the same day, Rand Paul had a major op‐​ed in _USA Today_ discussing whether he’s a libertarian. Not quite, he says. But sort of: 



In my mind, the word “libertarian” has become an emotionally charged, and often misunderstood, word in our current political climate. But, I would argue very strongly that the vast coalition of Americans — including independents, moderates, Republicans, conservatives and “Tea Party” activists — share many libertarian points of view, as do I.   
  
  
I choose to use a different phrase to describe my beliefs — I consider myself a constitutional conservative, which I take to mean a conservative who actually believes in smaller government and more individual freedom. The libertarian principles of limited government, self‐​reliance and respect for the Constitution are embedded within my constitutional conservatism, and in the views of countless Americans from across the political spectrum.   
  
  
Our Founding Fathers were clearly libertarians, and constructed a Republic with strict limits on government power designed to protect the rights and freedom of the citizens above all else.



And he appeals to the authority of Ronald Reagan: 



Liberty is our heritage; it’s the thing constitutional conservatives like myself wish to preserve, which is why Ronald Reagan declared in 1975, “I believe the very heart and soul of conservatism is libertarianism.”



Reagan said that several times, including in a _Reason_ magazine interview and in a 1975 speech at Vanderbilt University that I attended. A lot of libertarians complained that he should stop confusing libertarianism and conservatism. And once he began his presidential campaign that fall, he doesn’t seem to have used the term any more.   
  
  
You can see in both the Paul op‐​ed and the Johnson interview that major‐​party politicians are nervous about being tagged with a label that seems to imply a rigorous and radical platform covering a wide range of issues. But if you can call yourself a conservative without necessarily endorsing everything that William F. Buckley Jr. and the Heritage Foundation — or Jerry Falwell and Mike Huckabee — believe, then a politician should be able to be a moderate libertarian or a libertarian‐​leaning candidate. I wrote a book outlining the full libertarian perspective. But I’ve also coauthored studies on libertarian voters, in which I assume that you’re a libertarian voter if you favor free enterprise and social tolerance, even if you don’t embrace the full libertarian philosophy. At any rate, it’s good to see major officials, candidates, and newspapers talking about libertarian ideas and their relevance to our current problems.

Climate Change Scare continues down-under.
Story submitted by Tarun Singh
I thought it might be worthwhile to highlight another alarmist propaganda being peddled for science.
The below excerpts are from a news item warning on “climate change”
http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/more-news/climate-change-a-fundamental-health-risk/story-fn7x8me2-1226257929702
A LEADING Australian disease expert says prompt action on climate change is paramount to our survival on Earth.
Australian National University Epidemiologist Tony McMichael has conducted an historical study that suggests natural climate change over thousands of years has destabilised civilisations via food shortages, disease and unrest.
“We haven’t really grasped the fact that a change in climate presents a quite fundamental threat to the foundations of population health,” Prof McMichael said.
“These things have happened before in response to fairly modest changes to climate.
“Let’s be aware that we really must take early action if we are going to maintain this planet as a liveable habitat for humans.”
I would like to highlight a few things that I noticed :

a- There is no mention of the Paper’s title or reference provided. I went through the online website of PNAS at http://www.pnas.org/content/current#BiologicalSciencesEvolution and couldnt find a refernce to Tony McMichael , so unless I missed somthing most readers like me can’t verify what is IN THE PAPER.
b – The article has an underlying theme that paints “Climate change” , as a variable that can be controlled by Human interference , there is ample evidence against it as not all variables are understood regarding the different climatic changes.
c- The author concedes that this has been happening for thousands of years yet says “”Let’s be aware that we really must take early action if we are going to maintain this planet as a liveable habitat for humans.”  early action to mitigate what ????
At this point the narrative proceeds:
“With the exception of a few downward spikes of acute cooling due to massive volcanic eruptions, most of the changes have been within a band of about plus or minus three-quarters of a degree centigrade,” he said today.
“Yet we are talking about the likelihood this century of going beyond two degrees centigrade and quite probably, on current trajectory, reaching a global average increase of three to four degrees.”
This is just plain wrong if not deceptively misleading and alarmist.
It has now been accepted that MWP was warmer than now.
The second statement of reaching average increase of three to four degree in a decade , well that just goes to show the authors ignorance or ideological bend. As we all know that the 3 – 4 degree estimate is based on IPCC projections based on postive feedback which has scince been argued in various papers (lindzen and choi).
The falsehoods and misleading continues with  myths then quoted :
“Warming also leads to an increase in infectious diseases as a result of better growth conditions for bacteria and the proliferation of mosquitoes.”
The entire above statement can be categorically dismissed as alarmist hyperbole. However lets save the laughs for the next:
“Drought can also result in greater contact with rodents searching for scarce food supplies.”
The prof then goes on to explain what he considers important. Prof McMichael has been examining the impact of climate change on population health for 20 years and says it’s not easy to raise awareness of the risk.
“Most of the attention has been of a more limited shorter-term kind relating to things around us like the economy, our property, infrastructure and risks to iconic ecosystems and species.”
So in other words, people are stupid to argue about economy, personal property , infrastructure etc when it comes to CLIMATE CHANGE as its all for GREATER CAUSE.

"A new Michael Moore-produced documentary that takes aim at the supposed hypocrisy of the green movement is “dangerous, misleading and destructive” and should be removed from public viewing, according to an assortment of climate scientists and environmental campaigners. The film, Planet of the Humans, was released on the eve of Earth Day last week by its producer, Michael Moore, the baseball cap-wearing documentarian known for Fahrenheit 9/11 and Bowling for Columbine. Describing itself as a “full-frontal assault on our sacred cows”, the film argues that electric cars and solar energy are unreliable and rely upon fossil fuels to function. It also attacks figures including Al Gore for bolstering corporations that push flawed technologies over real solutions to the climate crisis.  Planet of the Humans has provoked a furious reaction from scientists and campaigners, however, who have called for it be taken down. Films for Action, an online library of videos, temporarily took down the film after describing it as “full of misinformation”, though they later reinstated it, saying they did not want accusations of censorship to give the film “more power and mystique than it deserves”. A free version on YouTube  has been viewed more than 3m times. A letter written by Josh Fox, who made the documentary Gasland, and signed by various scientists and activists, has urged the removal of “shockingly misleading and absurd” film for making false claims about renewable energy. Planet of the Humans “trades in debunked fossil fuel industry talking points” that question the affordability and reliability of solar and wind energy, the letter states, pointing out that these alternatives are now cheaper to run than fossil fuels such as coal. Michael Mann, a climate scientist and signatory to Fox’s letter, said the film includes “various distortions, half-truths and lies” and that the filmmakers “have done a grave disservice to us and the planet by promoting climate change inactivist tropes and talking points.” The film’s makers did not respond to questions over whether it will be pulled down. Planet of the Humans has been shown at Moore’s Traverse City film festival, where the producer said it was “perhaps the most urgent film we’ve shown in the 15-year history of our film festival”. Jeff Gibbs, who wrote and directed the film, has suggested that unrestrained economic and population growth should be the target of environmentalists’ efforts rather than technological fixes. Climate activist Bill McKibben, one of the targets for the film for allegedly being influenced by corporate money and for supporting the burning of biomass such as wood chips for energy, said the characterisations are untrue. McKibben has previously changed his views on biomass energy, which he now sees as being detrimental to climate action, and claims he has “never taken a penny in pay” from any environmental group. “I am used to ceaseless harassment and attack from the fossil fuel industry, and I’ve done my best to ignore a lifetime of death threats from rightwing extremists,” McKibben said. “It does hurt more to be attacked by others who think of themselves as environmentalists.” Renewable energy has long been portrayed as expensive and unreliably intermittent by oil and gas companies and their lobby groups, which have spent several decades questioning the veracity of climate science and undermining efforts to radically reduce planet-heating emissions. In fact, the technology used for wind and solar energy has improved markedly in recent years, while the costs have plummeted. While electric cars often require fossil fuel-generated energy to produce them and provide the electricity to fuel them, research has shown they still emit less greenhouse gas and air pollutants over their lifetime than a standard petrol or diesel car. Generating all power from renewables will take significant upgrades of grid infrastructure and storage but several researchers have declared the goal feasible, most likely with carbon-capture technology for remaining fossil fuel plants. Scientists say the world must reach net zero emissions by 2050 to head off disastrous global heating, which would likely spur worsening storms, heatwaves, sea level rise and societal unrest."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman flagship daily Frankfurter Allgeneine Zeitung has an analysis of the German Energiewende (transformation to renewable energy) and its consequences. It writes that the Energiewende “has lost its magic” among the public and that, “The new electric bills in August could be a catastrophe, both politically and economically. […] Now they [industry] are setting off the alarms.” In a nutshell: The Energiewende is costing a bundle.
European policy created its own unlevel energy playing field
Not long ago environmentalist Green Party leader Jürgen Trittin once told German consumers that the switch to renewable energies would be cheap and affordable, costing about as much as the price of a single scoop of ice cream each month. That scoop has since turned into gallon-buckets of Ben Jerry’s.
All told there are approximately 1.3 million solar power generating systems installed in Germany, and all are guaranteed a fixed exorbitant rate for the power they feed in. The added costs from the high rates paid to these producers are simply passed along to industry and ultimately the consumer. Now energy prices are sky high and German industry in many sectors cannot compete globally. The playing field is no longer level, the companies complain.
So far Germany has coped by granting many of its energy intensive industries exemptions from paying the renewable energy levies. A total of 2245 companies have been exempted from the feed-in surcharges, leaving the consumers to pick up the tab. But now Brussels is questioning these exemptions, claiming they represent an illegal subsidy for the companies. If revoked, companies once again will be facing high costs and a competitive disadvantage internationally. The solution: Either make energy cheaper for European countries, or insist the rest of the world makes its energy more expensive.
Europeanization of American energy prices
Currently German industry pays more than twice as much for its electricity than in the USA, and three to four times more for natural gas (USA is now exploiting its massive reserves of shale gas using fracking technology as Europe moves to ban fracking).

This increasingly unlevel energy playing field (created by Europe itself) is precisely what is driving Obama’s newly announced energy policy. Europeans have long complained that their competitiveness has been hampered by the USA’s “irresponsibly” low energy and electricity prices, and have insisted that Obama level the playing field by increasing prices in the USA. Somehow (using climate), Europe has convinced the USA to make its energy more expensive. Obama is happy to oblige.
Over the next decade Americans need to expect a Europeanization of American fossil energy prices. This is the what’s behind the plan announced by Obama yesterday. Obama is more than willing and ready to implement any scheme that is designed to punish Americans, it seems. This is only the first step.
Europe tells America: please repeat our blunders
Creating high prices for fossil fuels is only one component in “leveling the energy playing field”. Europe also expects America to repeat its renewable energy folly as well. America too must have a truly shoddy patchwork of inefficient and unpredictable renewable energy sources, like wind and solar, and an unstable power grid. Only this way can the playing field between America and Europe truly be level. European companies will then surely think twice about moving their operations to the USA.
Declaration of war on blue-collar workers
Ironically not long ago the stated objective of western politicians was to generate prosperity for its citizens. Today it’s precisely the opposite. Obama’s plan is nothing less than an assault on American industry and millions of blue collar workers.

"**The phones began ringing off the hook at Piero Tintori's company Better Examinations back in April.**
His tech business allows tens of thousands of students to remotely sit exams at the same time, with each needing just a laptop, a webcam and an internet connection.
The firm's software uses machine learning (ML), an advanced form of artificial intelligence, to detect patterns in user behaviour that could indicate attempts to cheat. Its technology can also automatically mark multiple-choice answers and mathematics exams.
In addition, it checks each exam-sitter's identity using the webcam, to ensure that no-one else is sitting the test for them. The Better Examinations program also temporarily restricts access to the internet, or certain websites and applications on each person's computer.
""We had 60 organisations from all over the world contact us out of the blue, who wanted to run exams online in May and June,"" says Mr Tintori. ""Everything from universities, to professional organisations, to schools.""
With the firm's headquarters in Dublin, plus offices in the US, Australia and Poland, it uses Amazon's cloud computing system Amazon Web Services, to allow everything to work online.
Mr Tintori says he was also contacted directly by five governments (whom he declines to name), who were keen for school exams to go ahead.
Better Examinations is just one example of the increased use of ML in response to this year's pandemic, with the technology being used to do work far more quickly than humans, such as marking exam papers.
But what exactly is ML? It is a method of data analysis, whereby computer algorithms are used to speedily process vast amounts of data, to make predictions, identify patterns and replicate actions that humans do in their day-to-day jobs.
The use of ML is expected to grow so much over the next four years that its estimated global economic value is expected to rise from $7.3bn (Â£5.7bn) this year, to $30.6bn in 2024, according to one study.
Global law firm DWF, which helps the in-house legal teams of large corporations, is another business now increasingly using the technology.
It was approached by a large real estate company that had an ""impossible"" task. The client wanted 10,000 property lease documents, stored on paper and electronically, and in different locations, to be digitalised into a central database.
This firm also wanted to know the exact terms of each of the leases, to discover new commercial opportunities.
""Traditionally, you would get paralegals under supervision to plough through the documents. But from a cost point of view it doesn't work, and also it's inconsistent,"" says Mark Qualter, chief executive of DWF's managed services division.
DWF designed an ML system to classify each lease document into categories, identify specific types of details, and then extract data from the document.
The banking sector is also embracing ML. UK building society Nationwide had asked US computer giant IBM to build an artificial intelligence ""chatbot"" called Arti for it, to help first-time buyers understand how to get a mortgage.
But when the UK went into its first lockdown in March, and mortgage holidays were announced, the lender was instead inundated with queries about them.
In just four days, Arti - powered by AI platform IBM Watson - was retrained to answer mortgage holiday questions. The virtual agent also dealt with other questions as Nationwide saw online banking registrations jump by 89%.
""In just over two months, Arti had responded to more than 10,000 queries, and a further 350 per day since, freeing up hundreds of hours for frontline teams to focus their time handling more complex requests from members,"" says Michael Conway, UK lead for artificial intelligence at IBM Services.
""Put simply, it allowed Nationwide to focus its resources on those who needed the most help, without ignoring the needs of everyone else.""
Meanwhile, another UK retail bank has been using ML algorithms to identify customers who are showing indications of financial difficulty, so that they can be contacted automatically, and then offered support before matters get out of hand.
This has been provided to the lender by BJSS, a multinational technology engineering consultancy headquartered in Leeds.
Sri Harsha Tharkabhushanam, head of data science for BJSS, says that previously of those in arrears, 30% had got to a severe position where ""there was very little the bank could do for them at that point"".
But after implementing the ML model, the automated prompts meant fewer people were getting into severe difficulties, with the figure falling to 10%.
Business intelligence gathering using AI is also becoming a big deal.
For instance, a large European pharmaceutical firm, which wants to remain anonymous, wanted to make sure that if there was a new product launched, or start-up bought, by any of their competitors, it knew about it quickly.
New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.
The company employed Filament AI, a machine-learning software firm in London, to build it a bespoke ML system that could monitor 1,000 websites, 200 story feeds, and roughly 200,000 news articles a day round the clock.
Michael Osborne, a professor of machine learning at Oxford University, says that companies across many industries are now ""desperately trying to get their hands on ML"", as many more things are now being quantified digitally, making it easier to analyse them to gain insights.
Martha White, associate professor of computing science at the University of Alberta in Canada, agrees that the use of ML is growing fast.
""The combination of more data, and more powerful computers, and a focus on leveraging both has really propelled the field forward,"" she says.
""The prevalence will continue to grow for a few reasons. Firstly, there is still lots of low-hanging fruit, and the ability to monetise with the existing technology. Secondly, we are going to get better at improving our own decision making, using predictions from machine-learning systems.""
But although ML is becoming increasingly popular, there are concerns it has been oversold as a ""magic wand"", and the public's distrust of it is only rising, warns Prof Osborne.
""ML is not this all-singing, all-dancing solution to our woes,"" he says. ""Instead it's something that delivers value only when working hand-in-hand with humans, and having humans tailor it to their specific needs.
""ML is powerful, but not a fully general-purpose technology. It needs a lot of careful tweaking to get it to work for any new application."""

As I’ve [written many times](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/06/popular-leaders-policy-failures-australias-been-there-already/), now, Jacinda Ardern is more and more shaping up to be [New Zealand’s Kevin Rudd](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/08/someone-better-tell-the-fairy-queen-that-the-media-goblins-are-making-mischief/): a fresh-faced leader who rockets up to record highs in the opinion polls and sets the media swooning like a pack of teenage girls – and then collapses in ignominy and defeat in just one term. Ardern’s career is rapidly following the same trajectory, and hitting the same beats as Kevin Rudd’s.



Rudd quickly acquired a reputation as a narcissistic, globe-trotting PM more concerned about strutting at the UN than attending to domestic affairs. Even on the home front, Rudd was quickly seen as all talk and photo-ops, no substance. **Rudd became particularly notorious for his “brain-fart” policies** on “progressive” causes like climate change, which sounded good scribbled on the back of a coaster, but quickly collapsed into defeat and debt.



 **Is this all starting to sound familiar?**



But that hasn’t stopped the earnest immersing themselves into heroic levels of virtue signalling…And no one talks about stuff more than our **serial thought bubbler** , Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern […]Politically speaking, this is why she has the issues she has. This is why the gloss has come off the shiny veneer of Ardernism.



  
Lyndon Johnson supposedly remarked that “If we’ve lost Cronkite, we’ve lost America”. When Kevin Rudd lost the Australian media, he lost his party and lost office. If Jacinda Ardern has lost ‘A Newspaper’, she should be very worried indeed.



Things aren’t looking much rosier for her over at _Newsroom_.



Jacinda Ardern’s election campaign was high on hope (remember relentless positivity?); hope for the homeless, hope for decisive action on climate change (“my generation’s nuclear-free moment”, she described it at her campaign launch); and hope for a new sense of coming together as a modern, progressive and compassionate nation. Upon coming to office, it was accompanied by a strong expression of energy and enthusiasm which persuaded New Zealanders that new times were indeed upon us.



There have been some stunning highs and many lows since those heady days. Sadly, the Prime Minister’s greatest high came in reaction to one of our country’s greatest tragedies…But there have been other (and more) times when the response has not been nearly as impressive, or sure-footed, and where the level of hope invested is not being repaid in Government actions.



One of Rudd’s government’s biggest Achilles’ heels was its woefully incompetent meddling in housing and infrastructure: “Building the Education Revolution” (blowing billions paying cowboys to put up school halls), the “Energy Efficient Homes Package” (blowing billions paying cowboys to put in dodgy insulation, which actually led to the deaths of several workers) and the NBN (blowing billions paying cowboys to put in fibre optic cables).



 **Again: sound familiar?**



KiwiBuild is an abysmal joke that has dashed the hopes of many and virtually destroyed the credibility of the Minister responsible, while housing very few […] As for the “nuclear-free moment” of climate change, the gap between the hope created by the rhetoric and the level of actual achievement is nearly as wide.



Then there was Rudd’s “closing the gap” grandstanding on Aboriginal affairs. For all the hot air, apologies and extra millions, the gap got wider. **Again – familiar?**



On a smaller scale, is the brewing Ihumatao situation. The Prime Minister was very quick to step in […] yet, [the] initial activist enthusiasm has waned considerably, much to the chagrin of the occupation organisers, who clearly and reasonably assumed that a Prime Ministerial intervention actually meant something.



Disappointment has now turned to anger.



Like Ardern, Rudd arrived in a puff of fairy-dust. But then the clock struck 12 and the glass slippers came off – and it was all over with shocking suddenness.



Voters are prepared to give a Government space and time to implement its policies, if they have a confidence the Government knows what it is doing. But that tolerance goes quickly if the public gains the feeling that it does not really know what it is doing, or grossly oversold its policy programme at election time […] At the same time, some have noticed that the Prime Minister seems more and more detached from the day-to-day grind of government.



  
Australia had “Kevin747”, New Zealand has its “PartTimePM”. It remains to be seen how similarly their stories come to an end.

A high ranking member of the Green Party is stepping down before next year’s election, citing the party’s drift to the centre as one of the reasons.



[…] “As an **indigenous ecosocialist** the last few years have been tough; the 2017 campaign, Metiria’s [Turei] resignation, and the continued centrist drift of the party’s direction under James Shaw’s co-leadership.



“When the IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] says we have **12 years to save the world** from climate catastrophe, we simply don’t have time for centrism, moderation or fiscal austerity.”

"Dire warnings of imminent human-induced climate disaster are constantly in the news but predictions of the end of the world have been made throughout history and have never yet come true. Even in the brief period of recorded history, natural climate change has always been with us – whether it is the volcanically induced crop failures that helped precipitate the French Revolution or the Medieval Warm Period that allowed Vikings to colonise Greenland. So how can we trust that the computer models scientists use to make predictions are reliable? There is sometimes reluctance to take experts’ words for anything and so we would like to be shown the evidence. Unfortunately, that is difficult when the details are buried under hundreds of thousands of lines of computer code which implement mathematical algorithms of mind-numbing complexity. There is, however, one branch of science that can reliably give an answer that is easy to understand and hard not to believe. Paleoclimatology – the study of Earth’s past climates – has used fossils to show links between global temperatures and carbon-dioxide levels. This record is written in stone. There are fossil plant-leaves from 55m years ago that have a microscopic structure which can be accurately reproduced in modern plants only when grown in a carbon-dioxide-rich atmosphere. Is it a coincidence that, at the time, it was so warm that crocodiles were living within the Arctic circle?  And this is not an isolated case.  A sedimentary record covering half a billion years shows us exactly what we would expect to see if climate modellers have done their sums right. Fossil and chemical traces in rocks indicate that warm periods in Earth’s history are associated with higher concentrations of carbon dioxide and quantitative studies show that this correlation is, if anything, even stronger than predicted. Those 55m year-old leaves suggest that carbon dioxide concentrations were about four times the present-day levels and back-of-the-envelope calculations indicate that global mean temperatures were around 7°C higher. For comparison, the largely computer-based predictions published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change imply that quadrupling carbon-dioxide concentrations should increase temperatures by between 3°C and 9°C. The simple paleoclimate example may not nail the case for a worryingly strong link between carbon dioxide and temperature, but it is good supporting data. What is most important, however, is that this evidence is hard to refute  There is little doubt that the recent rapid increase in carbon dioxide is linked to human activities such as burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. But does the paleoclimate evidence really tell us that increased carbon dioxide must mean increased temperatures?  One objection might be that ancient climate change is really evidence for varying solar brightness. Fluctuating carbon dioxide levels are then a response to climate variation rather than the cause. However, solar physics tells us that the sun was fainter 55m years ago rather than brighter, as would be needed for higher temperature. Another concern is that some important processes, such as ice-sheet disintegration, only affect climate very slowly. Our warming ice sheets may take centuries to disappear completely but, when they do, the replacement of reflective-ice by heat-absorbing rock will warm our planet yet further. The existence of potential complications like these makes comparisons between paleoclimate change and modern climate change difficult but it is also one of the reasons why multiple approaches are needed. If different researchers using different methods nevertheless come up with more or less the same answer, perhaps they are onto something. Climate change deniers also confuse the argument by suggesting there is nothing we can do anyway. China and other rapidly developing countries will dominate carbon dioxide output in the 21st century. But that is irrelevant if we are simply asking: “Will increased carbon dioxide levels change our climate?” The fact that political and technical problems are massively more complex than anything in climatology is not a reason to stick our heads in the sand. Widespread agreement that man-made global warming is highly likely would be progress. Next, read this: Establishing consensus on climate change is vital for action"
"
I got into this investigation of Argo because I disbelieved their claimed error of 0.002°C for the annual average temperature of the top mile of the ocean. I discussed this in “Decimals of Precision“, where I showed that the error estimates were overly optimistic.
I wanted to know more about what the structure of the data looked like, which led to my posts Jason and the Argo Notes, Argo Notes Part Two, and Argo and the Ocean Temperature Maximum.
This is the next part of my slow wander through the Argo data. In How well can we derive Global Ocean Indicators from Argo data? (PDF, hereinafter SLT2011), K. von Schuckmann and P.-Y. Le Traon describe their method for analyzing the Argo data:
To evaluate GOIs [global oceanic indicators] from the irregularly distributed global Argo data, temperature and salinity profiles during the years 2005 to 2010 are uploaded spanning 10 to 1500m depth.
and
To estimate the GOIs from the irregularly distributed profiles, the global ocean is first divided into boxes of 5° latitude, 10° longitude and 3 month size. This provides a sufficient number of observations per box.
So I thought I’d take a look at some gridcell boxes. I’ve picked one which is typical, and shows some of the issues involved in determining a trend. Figure 1 shows the location of the temperature profiles for that gridbox, as well as showing the temperatures by latitude and day. The data in all cases is for the first three months of the year. The top row of Figure 1 shows all of the temperature for those three months (Jan-Feb-Mar) from all the years 2005-2011. The bottom row shows just the 2005 measurements. The following figures will show the other years.
Figure 1. Click on image for full size version. Gridcell is in the Atlantic, from 25°-30°N, and 30°-40°W. Left column shows the physical location of the samples within the gridbox. Colors in the left column are randomly assigned to different floats, one color per float. Right column shows the temperature by latitude. Small numbers above each sample show the day of the year that the sample was taken. Colors in the right column show the day the sample was taken, with red being day one of the year, shading through orange, yellow and green to end at blue at day 91. Top row shows all years. Bottom row shows 2005. Text in the right column gives the mean (average) of the temperature measurements, the standard deviation (StdDev), and the 95% confidence interval (95%CI) of the mean of the temperature data. The 95% CI is calculated as the standard error of the mean times 1.96.
Let’s consider the top row first. In the left column, we see the physical location of all samples that Argo floats took from 2005-2011. We have pretty good coverage of the area of the gridbox over that time. Note that the gridboxes are huge, half a million square kilometres for this particular one. So even with the 216 samples taken over the six-year period, that’s still only one sample per 2,500 square km.
Next, let’s consider the top right image. This shows how the temperatures vary by time and by latitude. As you would expect, the further north you go, the colder the ocean, with a swing of about three degrees from north to south.
In addition, you can see that the ocean is cooling from day 1 (start of January) to day 91 (end of March). The early records (red and orange) are on the right (warmer) side of the graph. The later records (green and blue) are concentrated in the left hand (cooler) side of the records.
This leads to a curious oddity. The spread (standard deviation) of the temperature records from any given float depends on the direction that the float is moving. If the float is moving south, it is moving into warmer waters, but the water generally is cooling, so the spread of temperatures is reduced. If the float is moving north, on the other hand, it is moving into cooler waters, and in addition the water is generally cooling, so the spread is increased. It is unclear what effect this will have on the results … but it won’t make them more accurate. You’d think that the directions of the floats might average out, but no such luck, south is more common than north in these months for this gridcell.
A second problem affecting the accuracy can be seen in the lower left graph of Figure 1. It seems that we have nine measurements … but they’re all located within one tiny part of the entire gridbox. This may or may not make a difference, depending on exactly where the measurements are located, and which direction the float is moving. We can see this in the upper row of Figure 2.
Figure 2. As in Figure 1, with the top row showing 2006, and the bottom row 2007.
The effects I described above can be seen in the upper row, where the floats are in the northern half of the gridbox and moving generally southwards. There is a second effect visible, which is that one of the two floats (light blue circles) was only within the gridbox in the late (cooler) part of the period, with the first record being on day 62. As a result, the standard deviation of the measurements is small, and the temperature is anomalously low … which gives us a mean temperature of 20.8°C with a confidence interval of ± 0.36°C. In fact, the 95% confidence interval of the 2006 data does not overlap with the confidence interval of the mean of the entire 2005-2011 period (21.7° ± 0.12°C) … not a good sign at all
The 2007 data offers another problem … there weren’t any Argo floats at all in the gridcell for the entire three months. The authors say that in that case, they replace the year’s data with the “climatology”, which means the long-term average for the time period … but there’s a problem with that. The climatology covers the whole period, but there are more gaps in the first half of the record than in the latter half. As a result, if there is a trend in the data, this procedure is guaranteed to reduce that trend, by some unknown amount.
Figure 3 shows the next two years, 2008-2009.
Figure 3. As in Figure 1 and 2, for 2008 (top row) and 2009 (bottom row).
2008 averages out very close to the overall average … but that’s just the luck of the draw, as the floats were split between the north and south. 2009 wasn’t so lucky, with most of the records in the south, This leads to a warmer average, as well as a small 95%CI.
Finally, Figure 4 shows 2010 and 2011.
Figure 4. As in Figure 1 and 2, for 2010 (top row) and 2011 (bottom row).
In the final two years of the record, we are finally starting to get a more reasonable number of samples in the gridbox. However, there are still some interesting things going on. Look at the lower right graph. In the lower right of that graph there are two samples (day 71 and 81) from a float which didn’t move at all over that ten days (see bottom left graph, blue circles, with “81” on top of “71”). In that ten days, the temperature in that one single location dropped by almost half a degree …
DISCUSSION.
In this particular gridcell, the averages for each of the years 2005-2011 are 21.4°C, 20.8°C, no data, 21.7°C, 22°C, 21.9°C, and 21.7 °C. This gives a warming trend of 0.13°C/year, as shown in Figure 5.
Figure 5. Trend of the gridcell three-month temperatures
My question is, how accurate is this trend? Me, I’d say we can’t trust it as far as we can throw it. The problem is that the early years (2005, ’06, and ’07) way undersample the gridcell, but this is hidden because they take a number of samples in one or two small areas. As a result, the confidence intervals are way understated, and the averages do not represent a valid sampling in either time or space.
My conclusion is that we simply do not have the data to say a whole lot about this gridcell. In particular, despite the apparent statistical accuracy of a trend calculated from from these numbers, I don’t think we can even say whether the gridcell is warming or cooling.
Finally, the law of large numbers is generally understood to relate to repeated measurements of the same thing. But here, two measurements ten days apart are half a degree different, while two measurements at the same time in different areas of the gridcell are as much as three degrees apart … are we measuring the “same thing” here or not? And if not, if we are measuring different things, what effect does that have on the uncertainty? Finally, all of these error calculations assume what is called “stationarity”, that is to say that the mean of the data doesn’t change over a sufficiently long time period. However, there is no reason to believe this is true. What does this do to the uncertainties?
I don’t have any answers to these questions, and looking at the data seems to only bring up more questions and complications. However, I had said that I doubted we knew the temperature to anything like the precision claimed by the authors. Table 1 of the SLT2011 paper claims a precision for the annual average heat content of the top mile of the ocean of ± 0.21e+8 Joules. Given the volume involved (414e+8 cubic kilometres), this means they are claiming to measure the temperature of the top mile of the ocean to ± 0.002°C, two thousandths of a degree …
As cited above, I showed before that this was unlikely by noting that there are on the order of 3500 Argo floats. If the SLT2011 numbers are correct and the error from 3500 floats is ± 0.002°C, it means that 35 floats could measure the temperature of the top mile of the ocean to a tenth of that accuracy, or ± two hundredths of a degree. This is highly unlikely, the ocean is way too large to be measured to plus or minus two hundredths of a degree by 35 floats.
Finally, people have the idea that the ocean is well-mixed, and changes slowly and gradually from one temperature to another. Nothing could be further from the truth. The predominant feature of the ocean is eddies. These eddies have a curious property. They can travel, carrying the same water, for hundreds and hundreds of miles. Here’s an article on one eddy that they have studied. Their illustration is shown as Figure 6.
Figure 6. Illustration of an eddy transporting water for a long distance along the south coast of Australia.
Figure 7 shows another example of the eddying, non-uniform nature of the ocean. It is of the ocean off of the upper East Coast of the US, showing the Gulf Stream.
Figure 7. Oceanic temperature variation and eddies. Blue box is 5° latitude by 10° longitude. Temperature scale runs from blue (10°C, 50°F) to red (25°C, 77°F). SOURCE 
The blue rectangle shows the size of the gridcell used in SLT2011. The red circles approximate the distribution within the gridbox of the measurements shown in the bottom row of Figure 1 for 2005. As you can see, this number and distribution of samples is way below the number and breadth of samples required to give us any kind of accuracy. Despite that, the strict statistical standard error of the mean would be very small, since there is little change in temperature in the immediate area. This gives an unwarranted and incorrect appearance of an accuracy of measurement that is simply not attainable by sampling a small area.
Why is this important? It is important because measuring the ocean temperature is part of determining the changes in the climate. My contention is that we still have far too little information to give us enough accuracy to say anything meaningful about “missing heat”.
Anyhow, that’s my latest wander through the Argo data. I find nothing to change my mind regarding what I see as greatly overstated precision for the temperature measurements.
My regards to everyone,
w.

When I was a lad, Mum told me something about bullies: they’re only tough when they’re in a pack. They don’t have the guts to mouth off when they’re on their own, she said.



For all her prattle about “kindness”, Jacinda Ardern is acting a lot like a schoolyard-bully mean girl.



Ardern mouthed off at Australia for months over deportations – from a safe distance. When she visited Australia last month, she couldn’t backtrack fast enough. She’s suddenly talking tough again, now that she’s in with a clique of her pals at the Pacific Islands Forum.



Jacinda Ardern has challenged Scott Morrison to explain his ­government’s position on climate change to Pacific leaders as ­Australia fends off attacks over its domestic emissions policies ­despite committing $800 million to address global warming in the region.



…[Ardern], who has promised a ­carbon-neutral economy by 2050, yesterday declared that every ­nation needed to “do its bit” to fight worsening global warming, despite New Zealand providing $300m less than Australia in ­direct ­climate assistance for the Pacific over 10 years to 2025.



To achieve her carbon-neutral pledge, Ms Ardern has excluded agriculture and methane, which contribute about half of New ­Zealand’s greenhouse gas emissions.



Ardern is deliberately excluding New Zealand’s most emissions-heavy industry. At the same time, she is conspicuously failing to make up for her lack of action by stumping up any significant cash.



By the middle of next decade, Australia will have spent $800m in taxpayers’ money directly helping Pacific island nations — not including the $200m committed to the UN Green Climate Fund […]by contrast, New Zealand spent $200m in the region between 2015 and 2019 and is on track to spend a further $300m by 2023.



For all Ardern’s big-noting, Australia is half a billion dollars of real action ahead of New Zealand.



We’re well ahead in emissions reduction, too.



As Alan Jones – who has called Ardern a **“light weight hoax swallower”** – points out, Australia’s per capita emissions grew by just 1.8% since 1990 – New Zealand’s grew by 10.8%. Australia has 12 times the wind and solar generation of New Zealand.



On every metric, from handouts to emissions reduction, Australia is walloping New Zealand.



As Jones also notes, New Zealanders are voting with their feet. The Kiwi population in Australia has doubled. In fact, more than 11% of New Zealand’s population lives in Australia. There are 15 times more New Zealanders in Australia than the other way ‘round. For all the leftist social media circle-jerking about moving to Australia, the numbers tell the real story.



As for her cargo-cult bully gang, they’re just as spineless and two-faced. Pacific leaders talk a big game for the international media but clamp up to Australia’s face.



Sources said none of the leaders pushed Mr Morrison on climate change, despite strong statements by many at the forum on the need to accelerate emissions reductions to protect low-lying Pacific ­nations from rising seas and worsening storms. Several leaders, including Ms Ardern, emphasised the need for a consensus communique, which could help Australia in its fight to tone down the language of earlier drafts.



Like Jacinda Ardern, they’re all mouth and no trousers.

"The UK’s economy is highly unbalanced; we have the worst regional disparities in the developed world and London’s property prices are also the world’s most expensive – second only to Monaco. Rebalancing the economy is crucial to our future, and it can be done.  With the right investment in transport infrastructure, a second megacity formed by linking Liverpool, Manchester and Leeds, is achievable and could rebalance the UK economy by shifting focus from the dominating south-east. This could be achieved by creating an economic powerhouse in the north, one that replicates the very factors that underpin London’s growth: a large and diverse population and economic base, the ability to attract and retain talent, a critical mass of smart professionals and super-creatives, excellent science institutions, universities and schools, vibrant arts and culture and a first class regional, national and international transport. It’s a tall order. Even the best of the Britain’s second-tier cities would struggle to deliver all this. None of them is big enough – and we know that in modern economies size does matter. Geoffrey West, a physicist at the Santa Fe Institute, has analysed the mathematics of cities and says that there is a rule that holds firm in cities across the world.  According to West, each doubling in size of a city brings with it a 15-20% increase in wages, number of patents filed, the number of highly creative people employed, and an increase in efficiency of transport systems, among others. At the same time there is a matching increase in crime and pollution – but the benefits of higher wages and greater opportunities outweigh these disadvantages. London reflects this urban mathematics. Outside the Greater London region there is perhaps only one place in the UK where these economies of scale could be replicated: in the heavily urbanised east-west belt that stretches from Liverpool, through Manchester and over the Pennines to Leeds. These three city regions have scale, dignity and presence. They also have a massive asset in Manchester International Airport. Their universities are among the country’s leading research institutions and decent housing is affordable – especially for the young professional families now being priced out of London’s housing market or forced to accept crippling commuting and mortgage costs.  Manchester and Leeds are dynamic cities with a strong track record in delivering new jobs. Until recently, Liverpool’s record on jobs was shaky. But it has made a startling recovery based on tourism and conferences, as well as its traditional sectors. Higher speed rail connections between Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds (and perhaps Sheffield) could reduce the Liverpool-Leeds journey time to only 50 minutes, bringing together the cities’ labour markets, generating critical mass and driving the creation of agglomeration economies from bringing the cities closer together. David Higgins, chairman of HS2, drew attention to this issue in a recent speech – as did chancellor of the exchequer George Osborne this week.  Peter Hall, David Thrower and I set out detailed proposals for “High Speed North” in April 2014, building on the extremely modest Northern Hub investment and electrification between Liverpool and Leeds which is already committed or in progress.  These began with the introduction of the Pendolino “tilting trains”, required to cope with the steep gradients and sharp curves on the trans-Pennine route. It also included a reintroduction of four-tracking – a railway dual carriageway, with two tracks travelling in each direction – to provide greater capacity and allow fast trains to overtake slower services. The proposals also called for local trains in Manchester to be rerouted onto new sections of the Metrolink tram system.  For later stages of the project, we proposed a new 20-mile route from Warrington to Liverpool, which would become part of the High Speed North network and a vital high speed connection from HS2 to the centre of Liverpool, increasing capacity on an increasingly busy passenger and freight route. And finally, a new 13-mile “base tunnel” under the Pennines from Manchester to Huddersfield – startling as it may sound, new rail tunnels are not uncommon in other countries such as Germany.  The evidence we have seen on comparable tunnels suggests a range of construction costs between £1.5 and £4 billion. London’s Crossrail, which is of similar length, has cost £16 billion. The chancellor’s Manchester speech this week did bear an uncanny resemblance to our earlier ideas. Was it plagiarism, thought leadership or just a bizarre coincidence? We don’t know and we don’t mind. For once, the government is running with a big, imaginative and relatively inexpensive idea.  To be sure other things need to happen in these northern cities. But the Chancellor’s proposal should be explored further, not dismissed as another bright idea that will end up in a cupboard after the next general election."
"Last month, the Guardian quoted Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, saying if we put post-pandemic bailout money in the wrong place “we will lock ourselves in a dirtier energy system, making it much more difficult to reach our climate targets” (‘Coronavirus profiteers’ condemned as polluters gain bailout billions, 17 April). We beg to differ. It is game over for preventing dangerous climate change now that governments are planning the cheapest and quickest return to consumption. Riding on the wave of cheap oil and fossil-fuel bailouts is incompatible with keeping the average global temperature rise below 2C, let alone 1.5C.  Even if the world agreed to maintain all the pandemic-enforced restrictions on travel and consumption, the emissions saved would amount to almost nothing, compared with what’s needed to achieve the Paris agreement’s climate targets. Yet whether it’s to discourage mass fatalism, or prevent the very worst of what the future threatens, those of us with this knowledge still cling to “yes we can”. In this story, it is always five to midnight; it is always the last chance to prevent disaster. In contrast, collective action on climate can only grow out of complete honesty. It is time to acknowledge our collective failure to respond to climate change, identify its consequences and accept the massive personal, local, national and global adaptation that awaits us all.Dr Wolfgang Knorr Department of Physical Geography and Ecosystem Science, Lund University, Prof Eric Rignot University of California, Irvine, Prof Rik Leemans Wageningen University and Research, Prof Andy Morse School of Environmental Sciences, University of Liverpool, Prof Dennis Baldocchi Department of Environmental Science, Policy and Management, University of California, Berkeley, Prof Thomas Hickler Senckenberg Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre, Prof Francis E Putz Department of Biology, University of Florida, Prof Maarten Krol Wageningen University, Dr Alberte Bondeau Institut Méditerranéen de Biodiversité et d’Ecologie, Aix-Marseille Université, CNRS, Prof Wolfgang Cramer Institut Méditerranéen de Biodiversité et d’Ecologie, Aix-Marseille Université, CNRS, Prof Paul Palmer University of Edinburgh, Dr James G Dyke Global Systems Institute, University of Exeter • Oxford University’s call for a green stimulus for the economy and Polly Toynbee’s demand for a dramatically fairer reversal of the impact of “wealth on health” could both be addressed by a nationwide Green New Deal programme (Poverty kills people: after coronavirus we can no longer ignore it, 5 May). This would allow a way out of the economic collapse caused by coronavirus, while rebuilding our social infrastructure and tackling the climate emergency. It can also provide new jobs and huge opportunities for businesses. At its heart must be a labour-intensive social infrastructure that rebuilds our austerity battered public services. The prioritisation of green infrastructure will require a shift of economic priorities towards more decentralised local economies that reduce carbon emissions and air pollution, minimise the throughput of raw materials, provide long-term food security and protect biodiversity.  This radically new approach will involve listening to climate experts, funding the transition needed through massive government borrowing and introducing policies to curb our “freedoms” to travel, eat and consume in ways that threaten the planet. It is a Green New Deal imperative to tackle both the social and climate crisis that must emerge as the exit strategy from coronavirus.Colin HinesConvenor, UK Green New Deal Group • It is not only whales that are enjoying the opportunity for improved “conversations” presented by the current drop in manmade noise levels (Silence is golden for whales as lockdown reduces ocean noise, 27 April). From insects to fish, nature is booming as human activity intrudes less during lockdown. In our gardens, birdsong is more noticeable without a constant soundtrack of traffic noise. When our activities increase post-lockdown, we should reflect on the joy these sounds have given us and consider more permanent changes to the way we share the planet with our wildlife, for the benefit of all.Andy RadfordProfessor of behavioural ecology, University of Bristol"
"School has resumed after the holidays, and it will not be as any student has experienced before. But this isn’t the first time we have sacrificed our education to flatten a curve for the greater good. We’ve been doing it since 2018 when we decided to forego school classes on Fridays to bring attention to the climate crisis and the exponential curve of fossil fuel emissions that, according to the World Health Organisation, kills seven million people a year. As young people locked in our houses with endless video calls for uni and work, we are worried. Are we the first generation to watch the world go through two exponential crises? One of medical concern, threatening the lives of millions and locking down countries. And the other a climate crisis that is already affecting billions and could end life on this planet as we know it. There is no denying the horrific consequences of Covid-19, with a terrifying mortality rate and a frightening ability to spread. The loss of life is awful. But it has given hope the world can take the collective action needed to stop it. We have acted for Covid-19 by putting aside our political squabbles; we can do this for the climate crisis too. Covid-19 exacerbates inequalities that already exist in our society. It is already vulnerable people who suffer most: low-income families, those in regional and rural areas, First Nations people, young people, women and elderly people. This is also true of climate change. And just like with Covid-19, we all need to play our part in adjusting the new normals of our world, because it will never be the same again. As countries increase their lockdowns and individuals are travelling far less, global emissions are reducing and air quality is increasing. But this comes at the expense of far too much. We should not have to wait for a global pandemic to threaten the lives of millions to reduce emissions. This is not climate justice. This accidental emissions reduction comes with no acknowledgement of past damages from large corporations, who are the greatest contributors to climate change. It comes with no international agreement and without any acknowledgment that those most affected by the climate crisis have contributed the least to it. Climate justice is listening, acknowledging and fighting for and with those who contribute the least pollution. We all have a responsibility to act on the crisis and take ownership of our contributions. Climate action is not the accidental result of a pandemic. While public health studies continue and climate activism takes a back seat, watching the global response to this pandemic proves that international cooperation is possible. Governments and our leaders are out of excuses. We now know that radical change can happen when a crisis is taken seriously. The lockdown measures are crucial for keeping communities safe from this terrifying virus, and once lifted, hopefully more lessons can be learned to champion climate justice. We are facing a drastically different world after the crisis, one with a new global narrative about quality of life and our right to access it. We all have the power to influence that. As young people, we have the right to demand a future that is safe and healthy. We are at a unique tipping point. If climate change were treated like the crisis that it is, governments would respond swiftly, instead of spending decades debating the cost of action. We know that governments around the world can make big, positive changes when a situation demands it. We’ve seen them do just that during Covid-19. So, will we flatten the climate curve as well? • Toby Thorpe is a climate activist from Tasmania. Bryher McKeown is a health science student at the Australian National University.

Some background from the original “hide the decline” from Steve McIntyre here
Despite relatively little centennial variability, Briffa’s reconstruction had a noticeable decline in the late 20th century, despite warmer temperatures. In these early articles [e.g. Briffa 1998], the decline was not hidden.
For most analysts, the seemingly unavoidable question at this point would be – if tree rings didn’t respond to late 20th century warmth, how would one know that they didn’t do the same thing in response to possible medieval warmth – a question that remains unaddressed years later.
He writes now in Hide-the-Decline Plus
Indeed, they did not simply “hide the decline”, their “hide the decline” was worse than we thought. Mann et al did not merely delete data after 1960, they deleted data from 1940 on, You can see the last point of the Briffa reconstruction (located at ~1940) peeking from behind the spaghetti in the graphic below:


Detail from Mann et al (EOS 2003) Figure 1. Arrow points to Briffa series peeking out from behind the spaghetti
Had Mann et al used the actual values, the decline would have been as shown in the accompanying graphic:

Figure 3. Re-stated Mann et al (EOS 2003) Figure 1 showing the decline.
Had Mann and his 13 co-authors shown the Briffa reconstruction, without hiding the decline, one feels that von Storch (and others) might have given more consideration to Soon et al’s criticism of the serious problem arising from the large-population failure of tree ring widths and density to track temperature.

"**Teachers have warned of**a ""collapse"" in secondary school attendance **after the second wave of the pandemic spread across the UK during autumn.**
Relatively few pupils have tested positive, but hundreds of thousands have had to learn from home after being required to self-isolate.
What impact is that having on schools, parents and pupils themselves, as many prepare for exams?
Even before mid-October, when Northern Ireland's ""huge wave"" of cases came to Lisneal College in Londonderry, principal Michael Allen says about five of the GCSE year group of 135 pupils had not returned because of mental health and anxiety issues.
He says the impact of self-isolation was to reduce overall attendance to below 85%. At that level, for an individual student, the school would normally refer families to education welfare services, Mr Allen says.
The first case meant 60 pupils in year 12 - Northern Ireland's GCSE exam year - had to go into self-isolation, just weeks before exams started in November.
""We have just had 20 Year 12s return from two weeks of self-isolation, and at 9.30am many of those young people had to walk into an exam hall and sit a single-award GCSE chemistry exam,"" Mr Allen said.
There is ""total and utter disregard"" for the disadvantage pupils like this face in the exam system, he says, with pupils with special education needs being especially badly affected.
Remote teaching is made harder because teachers cannot work simultaneously with pupils in the classroom and those working at home. ""That's not living in the real world,"" Mr Allen said.
The work of contact tracing falls to school leaders themselves, meaning they have to respond to sudden alerts of positive cases at any time.
Mr Allen said pupils give him or his vice-principal a ""look of dread"" when they walk into the classroom, because they know it means someone will end up missing school. Some have begged them to review the contact tracing process.
""Two weeks ago we had a girl in tears asking us to go back and measure the two metres. No one seems to be taking any notice of what these young people are going through.""
""It's been a bit of a nightmare"", said Emily Proffitt of the asymptomatic spread that forced her to temporarily close Cooper Perry Primary School in Staffordshire on the advice of public health officials.
First, a staff member tested positive over half-term, forcing a few others to self-isolate. Then a few days later another member of the team tested positive.
But there was no traceable connection to other positive cases, so public health authorities said all the staff at the small village school - which has open-plan teaching spaces - needed to be tested.
That eventually uncovered another three asymptomatic cases. By that point so many staff had to self-isolate that the school was forced to close for a week.
They reopened this week, only for a pupil to test positive, meaning two year groups and five members of staff were sent home.
""For the parents, I feel so sorry for them,"" Ms Proffitt said. With several pupils having had four weeks out of school since half-term, some of their parents will have had to take time off work. For some of them, they will have been unpaid.
She said she was worried it looked like the school had not prepared for the risk, when in reality ""we've got hands that are red-raw from sanitising"".
Pupils are anxious, with some asking to wear masks even when they are not required. Staff are working in isolation from each other and are stressed, as many prepare two sets of lessons for in-person and remote teaching, Ms Proffitt said.
""We're looking at probably a decade of attachment and trauma issues that are going to be related back to Covid.""
""However much we paint our smiles on in the classroom, and we're good at that, children read us very well and they know things aren't quite right.""
Merseyside has been one of the areas worst-hit in the UK's second wave of the pandemic.
And at The Prescot School in Knowsley that has meant a collective 700 days in the classroom lost for the year 11 students preparing for exams in the summer.
One student, Ben, told the BBC: ""Year 11 is such a crucial year, you've got exams and mock exams and that's the main thing that's going to set you for life.
""As someone who's self-isolated already, I think it's really stressful to even think about the exams that we've got to do in a few months' time when we've missed out a large chunk of school.""
He says the year group is still learning content that they had missed when schools were closed in the first lockdown.
""In any other time period we would be revising and going over past things now.""
""I don't really think it's fair,"" he said, pointing out that some areas have seen much more disruption to education in this wave of the virus, while everyone will face the same exam conditions.
""We've obviously all gone through Covid and it's been strange for everyone. But there are other places it hasn't affected as much as here,"" he says.
Felicity Sandford said her daughter Cerys was the only one in her form to be sent home after contact with another child in her Spanish class who had tested positive.
""She was a bit traumatised to be pulled out of her class and not know what was going on, and she was the only one,"" Felicity said.
Students were reassured they had not done anything wrong but had to wait a while before they learned why they were being taken out of class. ""I had to go and meet her and she was pretty upset.""
Felicity said she was ""absolutely gutted"" herself as her work as a marketing consultant for children's activity providers in west London was hitting a busy time.
But she says it was a ""pleasant surprise"" how organised the remote learning has been, with Cerys using Microsoft Teams to keep in touch, taking online lessons from Oak National Academy and logging her homework and progress with photographs.
""In lockdown, at primary school there wasn't any structure. With this one I haven't had to get very involved,"" Felicity says.
The strict remote learning regime surprised Cerys too, who had hoped ""she might just get to chill out in her pyjamas"" only to find that her schedule of work had been emailed the night before.
But with both parents working from home, finding space in the house has been one of the main challenges. ""I've actually been working from her bedroom today while she's been at the dining table,"" says Felicity.
Tasos Konidaris says his daughter Mathilde took it ""quite heavily"" when she was told by her school she needed to self-isolate because of contact with a student who tested positive.
A year 11 student, Mathilde already felt unprepared because of missed classes during the pandemic's first wave, Tasos says. ""She thinks, how am I going to deal with this? Is it fair?""
He says the school adapted well to online classes with students able to watch most lessons remotely.
But eventually the whole year had to isolate as the case load became too great.
And when his daughter tested positive, the family had to self-isolate too.
With sons Hector, 13, and Alexander, 10, also learning from home, it put the parents under extra strain. ""You're having to suddenly be a parent, a teacher and do your work. It's quite wearing,"" he said.
But Tasos said it gave them a renewed appreciation of what teachers do.
""When you have your kids looking you in the eye and telling you with a sad face, I want to go back to school - which is funny to hear from a teenager - it's a tell-tale sign about how important it is."""

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s version of the EPA, the Umweltbundesamt (UBA) and its hapless director Jochen Flasbarth have come under intense fire from much of the major German media for having published a pamphlet (background here) defaming and black-listing US and German climate skeptic scientists and journalists.
The number of articles harshly criticising the German UBA’s heavy-handed tactics is mounting and there appears to be no let-up in sight.

UBA director Jochen Flasbarth comes under heavy fire for blacklisting US and German skeptics. Stephan Röhl for the Heinrich-Böll-Stiftung. Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 generic license.
Today Switzerland’s NZZ published an online commentary written by Markus Hofmann titled State-Certified Climate Science. In it he writes:
What the heck was the German Federal Office Of Environment (UBA) thinking when it decided to publish a 118-page report on the climate debate? The propaganda brochure is called: ‘And indeed the warming continues – What’s behind the climate change debate?’. It is causing a number of journalists to blow their tops with outrage.
[…] Indeed for the UBA it is obviously not about presenting facts simply and clearly. ‘And indeed the warming continues’ pamphlet is a declaration of war on so-called climate skeptics.
The UBA doesn’t stop at defaming the ‘non-climate scientist skeptics’ in general terms. No, it names the persons – putting Fritz Vahrenholt, Sebastian Lüning, Dirk Maxeiner, Michael Miersch, Günter Ederer and the ‘European Institute for Climate and Energy’ (EIKE) on a black list. That is ‘official state defamation,’ heute.de writes.

[…] Specifying what the binding state of the science is, is not the job of a governing authority,’ legal expert Thorsten Koch correctly opines in ‘Die Welt’.
Now the debate is off and running: The gentlemen who were criticized by the state are now responding. Vahrenholt is defending himself in an open letter. Maxeiner and Miersch are firing back.
Thus precisely the opposite of what the UBA wanted is now happening: The ‘climate skeptics’ are now in the spotlight. The state’s shot at the skeptics has backfied.”
Yesterday Spiegel published satirical commentary authored by Jan Fleischhauer saying that basically the state has officially declared skeptics as misfits and that everyone should stop listening to them. The UBA defamatory pamphlet singles out veteran journalists Dirk Maxeiner and Michael Miersch for “not being in line with the latest state of knowledge of climate science“. Fleischhauer writes:
If this were about anything less important than global climate, one could take the UBA’s intervention as a badge of honor: There are not many journalists in Germany whose works are so shattering that they would be put on a black list. I know people who would kill to get that kind of recognition.”
The UBA’s pamphlet is indeed a major backfire in the face of the UBA. Flasbarth should resign and a new successor should announce a more tolerant, impartial and open stance in the climate debate.
Tomorrow I will be presenting Maxeiner’s and Miersch’s reply.

"**The number of investment scams has quadrupled since the first UK lockdown began in March with fraudsters using more sophisticated tactics.**
Scammers have been cloning fund managers' websites, products and documents to steal almost Â£10m ($13.3m) from UK investors.
Fraudsters are even creating fake price comparison websites, says the Investment Association (IA).
The reported number of scams almost quadrupled from around 300 to 1,175.
""In a year clouded in uncertainty, organised criminals have sought opportunity in misfortune by attempting to con investors out of their hard-earned savings,"" said Chris Cummings, chief executive of IA.
Losses added up to Â£9.4m between March and mid-October, due to sophisticated ""cloning"" investment scams.
The Investment Association discovered scammers had been promoting fake products on sham price comparison websites and adverts on social media and search engines.
""The investment management industry is working closely with the police and regulators to stop these scams, and is collaborating with our partners in government to close them down and prevent them being advertised in the first place,"" Mr Cummings added.
The trade body has a dedicated live webpage for investors to research and avoid identified scams.
Earlier this month Britain's Action Fraud revealed victims of investment fraud had lost at least Â£657m in the past year, a rise of 28%.
The fraud and cybercrime prevention organisation said scammers have been looking for opportunities during coronavirus pandemic.
""Preying on people when they are at their most vulnerable really shows how low these criminals will stoop to make a profit for themselves,"" said Pauline Smith, head of Action Fraud.
""Just because a company has a glossy website and glowing reviews from 'high net worth' investors does not mean it is genuine,"" Action Fraud warned."

On March 5th 2019 retiring National MP Nathan Guy, rose in the House of Parliament to ask a question of government minister Damien O’Connor: “Does he stand by his statement last year to _Rural News_ that when it comes to increasing costs on farmers, they should—and I’ll quote—”get used to it”?



O’Connor replied: “Our government is clearly committed to increase water quality **, to commit to climate change international obligations** …”



That very same, sad, day one of New Zealand’s very best scientists escaped this mortal prison. David Kear was a genius, a pragmatic, problem-solving genius. London-born, he became interested in New Zealand during time spent aboard HM(NZ)S ‘Achilles’ 1942-44, and interested in geology from time spent in a Welsh coal-mine ‘never wishing to go underground again’. He would emigrate to God’s Own Country with his beautiful new wife after the war.



On a ‘hunch’ he almost single-handedly launched New Zealand’s steel industry after years of efforts by teams of other talented geotechnical experts had proved fruitless. We owe him plenty, just last year our exports of steel totalled nearly half-a-billion dollars, despite our current prime minister’s attempts to disadvantage us in the field.



Mr Kear was recognised for his ability during his lifetime, rising to become head of the internationally recognised DSIR. He was much more than fossil analysist or cross-strata projection theorist, much more involved than our far-removed department-heads of today; he felt science on, and in, the world that surrounds us.



David held the view that ‘global-warming’ theory was an abuse of the scientific method, and he held those views strongly[, as strongly as his hunch](https://royalsociety.org.nz/who-we-are/our-people/our-fellows/obituaries/fellows-obituaries/david-kear/)



that such a deposit [of ironsand with over 80 million tonnes of high-grade concentrate close to suitable transport] might be found on a raised interglacial terrace, but be covered by recent dune-sand. 



His logic proved correct, and a suitable deposit was subsequently proved up by drilling at Waikato North Head. Finding a suitable site with solid foundations for the steel mill itself was more difficult because of the widespread presence of peat in the Waikato Valley. Using geological maps, David found a suitable site at Glenbrook on old lava flows.



In some ways David Kear is New Zealand’s Benjamin Franklin; using his accumulated knowledge and individual genius to the betterment of every single person in this society, asking nothing in return.



He became strongly disabused of ‘climate science’ as early as 1985:



“ I noted the words “ **Global Warming** ” appearing increasingly in paper titles, and sensed a growing number of adherents. Those latter arranged a first-ever “Conference on Global Warming” in Vienna in 1985. Unlike most such meetings, where a communiqué summarising achievements was released on the final day, the full results of this one were **delayed for over 2 years.**



When they did appear (front page, _NZ Herald_ , two days before Christmas 1987) a _World Declaration_ included “Overseas scientists have estimated that the seas around New Zealand will rise by up to 1.4 m in the next 40 years”. That article concentrated on the massive consequent problems, caused by our carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, **but gave no adequate supporting science.** That rate of rise was equivalent to _3,500_ mm/century, 28 times faster than our _125_ mm ** _._** Hence **we stupidly ignored it, thinking no one could possibly believe it. But the World did believe, and the Global Warming mirage was born.** Had _3,500_ been true, sea level should have risen by almost 1 m by today – it hasn’t, not even closely.”



David was deeply concerned, and extremely disappointed, by the half-truths on display:



“There can be no doubt that to ensure their 1987 World Declaration made the greatest impact, they published the maximum value – **contravening the most sacred rule of acceptable science:** **_Thou shall not publish items_** _for monetary, political, or personal gain **that are not clear un-biased un-inflated truths.** ”_



On Wednesday, August 14th NZ Steel announced it may be impractical to consider future steel-making in New Zealand due to its reliance on coal which not only fuels the plant but is vital to the steel-making process; reliant as it is on the carbon-rich fuel’s chemical interaction with ore to produce a high-quality resultant product. Anyone who understands the important difference between iron and steel knows this already but the general public and the current government have no clue whatsoever. Hence:



David would be dismayed that the industry he helped found and which has helped so many towards homes, livelihoods and opportunities, would be disintegrated with 2,500 (at least) jobs lost for mere political opportunism and make-believe science manufactured to feed a media narrative.



It’s an indictment on society that the words of such a talented man, a man we truly owe so much for his contribution, are so hard to find (funny, that) but you can read them for [yourself here](https://www.nzcpr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Global-Warming-Dr-David-Kear.pdf) if you dare, (you may be discouraged by several banners warning of ‘harmful’ content).



Rest in peace; humble Mr David Kear. The world, especially this part of it, is worse-off without you.



I salute you.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHow often have we heard the alarmists say “one cold winter is not climate” but then claim that a single tornado or a few days of hot weather are ominous signs of global warming?
Yesterday the German Press Agency (DPA) had an interview with Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research climate scientist Prof. Friedrich-Wilhelm Gerstengarbe. The subject: two short heat waves that occurred in Germany this month, and another three or four-day hot spell set to start tomorrow. Is this a sign of climate change?, the DPA asks.
What’s a bit surprising is alarmist Gerstengarbe’s reply: no.
Specifically the DPA asks:
Are the heat waves an indication for global warming?

Gerstengarbe responds:
A single heat wave is absolutely no sign of a climate change. We’ve had them before, and we will have them in the future. Heat waves are part of weather occurrences, but they are only a very small piece of the puzzle. Weather is always a part of the climate history. However, you have to be careful not to draw conclusions based on one extreme event.”
This of course does not mean that Gerstengarbe and the PIK have scaled back their hysteria. Quite to the contrary, Gerstengarbe cites other extreme events and the melting Arctic sea ice, but conveniently ignoring all the evidence contradicting the warming, i.e. 15 years of no global temperature increase, growing Antarctic sea ice, 5 consecutive cold winters in a row, etc.
It’s no surprise that the PIK continues its brand of hysterical alarmism – it’s supported by the world’s largest reinsurer against global catastrophes: The Munich Re. The intense alarmism yields hefty profits for the Munich Re, which needs a “scientific basis” to justify jacking up the premiums it charges clients and its huge profits.
Reinsurer Munich Re is even a contributor to the latest IPCC report, which is due to be released in September. So profitable can alarmism be.

The German Association of Journalists Chairman Michael Konken calls the UBA’s defamatory pamphlet targeting US and German journalists and scientists “unacceptable” and demands an apology from Minister of Environment Peter Altmaier. Photo credit: DJV; photographer: Anja Cord
The UBA under Angela Merkel’s Ministry of Environment, which is directed by Peter Altmaier, recently published a highly controversial pamphlet that black-listed climate-science dissident German and US journalists and scientists. Now the German Association of Journalists (DJV) has responded and issued a press release:
Ministry Brands Critics 
 The German Association of Journalists DJV rejects Ministry of Environment’s recent criticism of individual journalists, calling it excessive and unfounded.
The state officials in their pamphlet titled ‘Und sie erwärmt sich doch’ [And indeed the warming continues] singled out and named a number of journalists who had made critical statements about the climate prognoses of the Umweltbundesamt [Federal Environment Agency]. Their media reports ‘did not conform to the state of climate knowledge,’ the pamphlet stated on page 112. Then the journalists and the media outlets for whom they publish were then named. Among those named are the former editor in chief of the magazine Natur and an editor at Focus. ‘The text passages read in a way that make the journalists appear as incompetent and as if they are being pilloried said DJV Federal Chairman Michael Konken. ‘That is not acceptable.’ 
A state agency in Germany does not have the authority to brand critics of government policy as heretics, said Konken. He is now requesting German Environment Minister Peter Altmaier to stop the distribution of the brochure in its current form and to apologise to the journalists named in the pamphlet.
Tel. 030/72 62 79 20, Fax 030/726 27 92 13
I think the apology needs to come from Flasbarth himself as well. Now the blame is being unfairly shifted to Altmaier. Not only should Flasbarth apologise, but he should also  resign. Clearly he lost control of the agency. The whole UBA is nothing more than a nest of environmental zealots, if the pamphlet is anything to go by.

NoTricksZone is something I do on the side as a hobby. One I admit that has consumed far more time than I ever bargained for and has morphed into an unshakable obligation to write a post every day. It is something I really enjoy doing. And unlike many of the warmist blogs out there, I receive no donations at all from anyone. It’s just me speaking out.
According to Google Analytics, yesterday the NTZ site surpassed the 5 million page views mark since the blog’s very humble beginnings in April, 2010. Of course I’m nowhere near sites like What’s Up With That, but the current level of interest is something I never expected to see. Currently the NTZ site is getting between 180,000 to 200,000 views per month from over 100 countries globally. In fact in the three years that NTZ has been operating, it has seen readers from every country in the world – except North Korea and NASA.
To be fair, I think NASA in the meantime has lifted its silly ban.
I also wish to thank a number of other sites who often link to NTZ: Climate Depot, WUWT, Tom Nelson, climategate.nl, climatescam.se, EIKE, Bishop Hill, junkscience.com, Die kalte Sonne.de, and others. Hopefully no one will feel left out if I didn’t mention you. Success without you would never have been possible. No one achieves success alone. Here, nothing works better than a free market that is guided by compassion, truth, and concern for the environment.

“Drain the swamp!” was a powerful rallying cry during Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. The businessman promised to govern in the public interest, and end the revolving door between politics and lobbying. If anyone had the chance to overturn special carve‐​outs, subsidies, regulatory barriers and access generated by special pleading, it was surely a wealthy populist insurgent unbeholden to major donors.



Yet eight months in to the Trump presidency, there appears to be little momentum behind his pledge to overhaul the relationship between big vested interests and the US government. A poll in late May found that 32 per cent of voters thought Trump had made the swamp worse, against 24 per cent who saw improvement. More worryingly, the President’s arbitrary conduct risks exacerbating crony capitalism in future.



The first ominous signs came with Trump’s cabinet selection. Appointing a former CEO of Exxon Mobile to head the State Department, a former Goldman Sachs partner to the Treasury, the daughter of a shipping company magnate to the Transportation department and an investor in steel, automotive components and coal to Commerce, hardly screamed an intent to break links between business and government.





Eight months in to the Trump presidency, there appears to be little momentum behind his pledge to overhaul the relationship between big vested interests and the US government.



Assigning conventional politicians to other positions did little to suggest major change was coming, either. A Newsweek analysis found that approximately 70 per cent of Trump’s White House staff were working in DC before the start of the administration too.



Trump’s picks for key government agencies likewise raised eyebrows. Professor Luigi Zingales of the University of Chicago Booth School of Business has highlighted how the lawyer Walter Clayton was appointed as Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, for example, having previously represented many major Wall Street firms in fraud cases — and despite being married to another Goldman Sachs employee.



True, one of Trump’s early executive orders sought to stop a “revolving door” by preventing administration employees from taking up lobbying posts for five years after their government jobs, and for government employees to recuse themselves from actions that affect their former employers. But this did not go anywhere near as far as Trump had promised.



In a Wisconsin rally last October, he pledged to oversee similar legislation applied to Congress too. He also promised campaign finance reform to prevent foreign lobbyists from raising money in US elections. No such legislation has been forthcoming.



What about policy? The Trump administration had a real opportunity to end government‐​granted regulatory, spending and tax privileges. But little progress has been made here either.



Trump has used a host of executive orders to set frameworks to constrain the growth of regulation, and the Congressional Review Act to eliminate many rules passed under Barack Obama. Though an imperfect measure, there are some indications this is working. In May, the Federal Register for 2017 stood at around 20,000 pages (which would imply a level around 62,000 for the full year). This was much lower than whopping 95,894 of 2016 under President Obama.



A substantial deregulatory effort could theoretically help reduce cronyism by reducing the scope of regulation that can be shaped by special interests. In fact, reducing the size and scope of government more broadly can eliminate many specific perks and instances of favouritism towards certain sectors. Trump’s recent budget showed this, and he is to be commended for proposing cuts, for example, to farm subsidies, which are perhaps the most egregious form of privilege with concentrated benefits and diffused costs across taxpayers.



Yet the President could be going much further to eliminate government involvement with business.



One obvious example is Trump’s flip‐​flop on the Export‐​Import bank — the pinnacle of corporate cronyism. As a candidate, Trump pledged to dissolve the bank, which divvies out loan guarantees and direct taxpayer funds to facilitate the exports of some of the US’s biggest companies, such as Boeing and General Electric. But in office, the President appears to have been nobbled by its beneficiaries. He now claims it is vital for them to have access to this kind of export finance.



On trade, Trump has been more consistently anti‐​market. But more protectionist measures, particularly those designed to insulate the US steel industry, will adversely affect consumers and downstream industries in order to protect one of the President’s favoured sectors. Worse, they will embolden other sectors facing strong foreign competition to lobby the government for similar treatment, exacerbating cronyism.



That is not to say that all of Trump’s actions reflect a desire to favour corporate interests. One certainly could not accuse Trump of listening to big business in his decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement — a decision which brought a stinging rebuke from a range of company heads and industries keen on the deal, and the loss of Tesla’s Elon Musk and Disney’s Robert Iger from his business panel.



But the President’s failure to take a principled, consistent position on the role of government in business means that these individual decisions tend to come with strong assumptions about motive. If Trump thinks protecting steel is acceptable, then it is understandable why others believe his decision on Paris reflects a desire to protect fossil fuels.



While the effect of Trump’s policies on the swamp are ambiguous, his personal conduct is surely deepening it.



The principle that companies should be treated equally under the law, and that government should avoid picking winners and losers, is a mainstay of market economy. But even prior to coming to office, Trump used the bully pulpit of his Twitter account to praise Ford for a decision not to build a new plant in Mexico, alongside tweets which warned ominously that companies that “want to do business in our country, have to start making things here again”.



He and his team seemingly changed the business decision of United Technologies, which cancelled plans to move a plant to Mexico, through a range of proposed US tax incentives and implicit threats to some of the company’s revenues from government contracts. The stock prices of other businesses have risen or fallen based on Trump’s musings on Twitter. Just last week, Trump and the White House made lots of noise about the Foxconn plans in Wisconsin.



As a candidate, Trump threatened Amazon with antitrust action, following critical coverage of him in the _Washington Post_ (owned by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos). More recently, there have been strong indications that the Trump team are using implicit threats against CNN by hinting at interventions in the proposed merger between AT&T and Time Warner (CNN’s parent company). All that is not to mention the shameless use of public office to boost the value of Trump properties, and the use of Mar‐​a‐​Lago as a means of access to the President.



This behaviour all threatens worsening crony capitalism, because companies will be more likely to base their business decisions according to expected political reaction rather than servicing consumer demand. Innovation and entrepreneurial activity will be less likely — the easier path for big business will be to become a “favourite” of the administration. Already we have seen instances of this politicisation, with companies re‐​releasing job announcements to seek the President’s approval and recipients of Export‐​Import bank funds justifying them using Trump’s protectionist language.



As business becomes politicised, the incentive to invest more in lobbying, government relations and political donations to meet the demands and desires of government, rather than consumers, will be irresistible. And if the electors perceive the negative results of this cronyism to be a consequence of enterprise rather than political failure, government control will ratchet up further.



Of course, the Trump presidency has a long way to run. The Republican Congress and White House could eliminate many of the opportunities for cronyism by shrinking regulatory agencies, and ending direct government subsidies. But judged so far on his government construction, policies and conduct, it is difficult to conclude that Trump is “draining the swamp”.

If Jacinda Ardern thought Scott Morrison was going to be intimidated by her and her little friends’ mean-girl bullying act at the Pacific Islands Forum, she was sorely disappointed. In contrast to Ardern’s constant posturing for applause from the globalist peanut gallery at the UN, Morrison reminded her of what a national leader’s first duty should be.



 **“I’m accountable to the Australian ­people, that’s who I’m accountable for,” he said.**



Scott Morrison stared down Jacinda Ardern and 16 other leaders at the Pacific Island Forum last night, refusing to back a statement that would obligate Australia to end coalmining and go carbon-neutral by 2050.



“Carbon neutral” is the most blatant scam in the entire climate medicine show. Just like the Kyoto Protocol, it’s a load of snake-oil cooked up by hucksters bent on distracting the gawping rubes on the benches while their pockets are picked. Pledges of “carbon neutrality” are made by lying shills who weight the dice by strategically omitting some of the biggest CO2 sources, and who know in any case that they will be long out of office by the time their deceit is laid bare. For all its virtue-signalling, Kyoto did nothing to reduce emissions. Even high priest of climate alarmism James Hansen calls it a “farce”. But the leaders who signed it are all out of office and safely beyond being held to account.



Jacinda Ardern can make all the b.s. promises she likes, because she knows that she will be nothing but a footnote by 2050. Her “carbon neutral” pledge should be taken no more seriously than her Kiwibuild promises.



As for the tub-thumping Pacific leaders, the hollowness of their rhetoric is belied by their own reliance on fossil fuels. Let’s see them call for a ban on international flights or fossil-fuelled cruise ships.



They ought also to beware that their “gibsmedat”, Cargo Cult greed will come back to bite them, very hard.



There are mounting fears that China will seek to take advantage of the backlash against Australia at the forum…US Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt will also address the forum, warning that Pacific ­nations risk losing their political and economic sovereignty if they shift closer to China.



Of all people, Ardern’s puppet master is shaping up as an unlikely realist.



In a conciliatory move yesterday, New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters retreated from his Prime Minister’s challenge to Mr Morrison, saying Pacific­­ ­nations needed to look at the big picture, including China’s “coal-fired everything”.



Mr Peters told ABC radio he was worried there was a perception that Mr Morrison was “somehow acting incorrectly”.



“There’s a big picture we have to contemplate where we have to ensure that when we act in this big picture, we act with consistency and integrity,” he said.



When Jacinda Ardern hears the word “consistency”, she reaches for the picture-dictionary. When she hears “integrity”, she throws it in the bin (recycling, of course).

For another shot at government, the Greens will need to convince the average New Zealander, particularly the targeted first time voter, that they are more than Morris dancers, mohair jacket wearers and tree-huggers. Undoubtedly these misguided souls are part of their support base but they really are best kept hidden away from Joe Public.



Media were barred from members’ meetings at the Greens’ annual conference, but James Shaw and Marama Davidson appeared on The Nation at the weekend, attempting to present as a united front. **They failed.** Shaw made absolutely no eye contact at all with Davidson during the entire interview. At best he looked very stiff and awkward.



When asked how their co-leadership is working, Davidson assured us she has a long, good working relationship with Shaw and they “take turns” in heading up “different, complementary” roles in the responsibility of the Green party leadership. “Explaining is losing”, though, as one well-known media commentator so wisely puts it.



Shaw was asked why he didn’t support Davidson at Ihum&amacrtao and said “I had a series of ministerial appointments” after Simon Shepherd had already told him “there was nothing in the ministerial media diary, I checked.” Shaw then paused, ummed and aahed, finally saying “Well, I had work on.” He was not convincing.



The Green leadership may not be united in protesting at Ihum&amacrtao, but they claim a reprieve by saying that their government support is limited to the confidence and supply agreement. 



Apparently, though, they are united on climate change, clean rivers and on achieving a rental warrant of fitness, guaranteed tenancies for renters and a rent-to-own scheme. Having already put enough pressure on the rental market to scare away private investors, it seems Davidson is also a very slow learner.



Wallpapering over the cracks in the Greens’ leadership is a temporary fix at best. Of more concern is that Davidson is already firmly ensconced in the **lunatic fringe element** of the Greens. These are the people who should remain hidden lest they scare off the new punters. Watch this space for a bust-up in the Greens’ leadership before the next election.



Unless she turns over a new leaf, Davidson’s history of trying to reclaim the “C” word and protesting as a radical foreshadows a short career in politics. Shaw should cut her loose before his party loses any more ground to the loonies on the left. Don’t worry James – being called sexist and racist is far better than jeopardising the future of the party.

There’s a wise old saying about “don’t bite the hand that feeds you.” But perhaps we need a new saying along the lines of “don’t subsidize the foot that kicks you.” Here’s a good example: American taxpayers finance the biggest share of the budget for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which is an international bureaucracy based in Paris. The OECD is not as costly as the United Nations, but it still soaks up about $100 million of American tax dollars each year. And what do we get in exchange for all this money? Sadly, the answer is lots of bad policy. The bureaucrats (who, by the way, get tax‐​free salaries) just released their “Economic Survey of the United States, 2010″ and it contains a wide range of statist analysis and big‐​government recommendations.   
  
  
The Survey endorses Obama’s failed Keynesian spending bill and the Fed’s easy‐​money policy, stating, “The substantial fiscal and monetary stimulus successfully turned the economy around.” If 9.6 percent unemployment and economic stagnation is the OECD’s idea of success, I’d hate to see what they consider a failure. Then again, the OECD is based in Paris, so even America’s anemic economy may seem vibrant from that perspective.   
  
  
The Survey also targets some very prominent tax loopholes, asserting that, “The mortgage interest deduction should be reduced or eliminated” and “the government should reduce further this [health care exclusion] tax expenditure.” If the entire tax code was being ripped up and replaced with a simple and fair flat tax, these would be good policies. Unfortunately (but predictably), the OECD supports these policies as a means of increasing the overall tax burden and giving politicians more money to spend.   
  
  
Speaking of tax increases, the OECD is in love with higher taxes. The Paris‐​based bureaucrats endorse Obama’s soak‐​the‐​rich tax agenda, including higher income tax rates, higher capital gains tax rates, more double taxation of dividends, and a reinstated death tax. Perhaps because they don’t pay tax and are clueless about how the real world operates, the bureaucrats state that “…the Administration’s fiscal plan is ambitious…and should therefore be implemented in full.”   
  
  
But even that’s not enough. The OECD then puts together a menu of additional taxes and even gives political advice on how to get away with foisting these harsh burdens on innocent American taxpayers. According to the Survey, “A variety of options is available to raise tax revenue, some of which are discussed below. Combined, they have the potential to raise considerably more revenue… The advantage of relying on a package of measures is that the increase in taxation faced by individual groups is more limited than otherwise, reducing incentives to mobilise to oppose the tax increase.”   
  
  
The biggest kick in the teeth, though, is the OECD’s support for a value‐​added tax. The bureaucrats wrote that, “Raising consumption taxes, notably by introducing a federal value‐​added tax (VAT), could therefore be another approach… A national VAT would be easier to enforce than other taxes, as each firm in the production chain pays only a fraction of the tax and must report the sales of other firms.”   
  
  
But just in case you think the OECD is myopically focused on tax increases, you’ll be happy to know it is a full‐​service generator of bad ideas. The Paris‐​based bureaucracy also is a rabid supporter of the global-warming/climate-change/whatever-they’re-calling-it-now agenda. There’s an entire chapter in the survey on the issue, but the key passages is, “The current Administration is endeavouring to establish a comprehensive climate‐​change policy, the main planks of which are pricing GHG emissions and supporting the development of innovative technologies to reduce GHG emissions. As discussed above and emphasized in the OECD (2009), this is the right approach… Congress should pass comprehensive climate‐​change legislation.”   
  
  
You won’t be surprised to learn that the OECD’s reflexive support for higher taxes appears even in this section. The bureaucrats urge that “such regulation should be complemented by increases in gasoline and other fossil‐​fuel taxes.”   
  
  
If you’re still not convinced the OECD is a giant waste of money for American taxpayers, I suggest you watch this video released by the Center for Freedom and Prosperity about two months ago. It’s a damning indictment of the OECD’s statist agenda (and this was before the bureaucrats released the horrid new “Economic Survey of the United States”).

"Although it may seem counter-intuitive, it would be better if we built buildings from wood than from concrete, brick, aluminium and steel.  We use millions of tonnes of these modern materials every year. They have many valuable properties, but are energy-intensive to create, accounting for around 16% of the entire planets’ fossil fuel production. Instead we could be using wood, which is also strong, renewable, and plentiful – we use only a fraction of the world’s available forestry resources.  Our research, published in the Journal of Sustainable Forestry, estimated that the world’s forest contain about 385 billion cubic metres of wood, with an additional 17 billion cubic metres growing each year. A mere 3.4 billion cubic metres is harvested each year, mostly for subsistence fuel burning; the rest rots, burns in fires, or adds to forests’ density. Swapping steel, concrete, or brick for wood and specially engineered wood equivalents would drastically reduce global carbon dioxide emissions, fossil fuel consumption and would represent a renewable resource. What’s more, managed properly this can be done without loss of biodiversity or carbon storage capacity. In our study undertaken by scientists from the Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies and the University of Washington’s College of the Environment we evaluated various scenarios including leaving forests untouched, burning wood for energy and use of wood as a construction material. The 3.4 billion cubic meters of wood harvested each year accounts for only 20% of new annual growth. Increasing the wood harvest to 34% or more would have several profound and positive effects. Emissions amounting to 14-31% of global CO2 would be avoided by creating less steel and concrete, and by storing CO2 in the cell structure of wood products. A further 12-19% of annual global fossil fuel consumption would be saved, including savings from burning scrap wood and unsellable materials for energy. Building with wood consumes much less energy than using concrete or steel. For example, a wooden floor beam requires 80 megajoules (mj) of energy per square metre of floor space and emits 4kg CO2. By comparison, a square metre of floor space supported by a steel beam requires 516 mj and emits 40 kg of CO2, and a concrete slab floor requires 290 mj and emits 27kg of CO2. By using efficient harvesting and production techniques, more CO2 is saved through the avoided emissions, materials, and wood energy than is lost from the harvested forest – yet another reason to appreciate forests, and to protect them from endless deforestation for agriculture. Clearing trees for harvest is temporary, but converting forests to farmland is a permanent loss of all forest’s resources and biodiversity. If transport and assembly is taken into account, the 16% of global fossil fuels used to manufacture steel, concrete and brick is closer to 20-30%. These potential fuel and carbon emissions savings, already substantial, will become increasingly critical as demand for new buildings, bridges and other infrastructure surges with economic development in Asia, Africa and South America.  At the same time, new construction techniques have made wood even more effective as a building material for anything from bridges to mid-rise apartment buildings. The cross-laminated timber increasingly used in new buildings, made from alternating layers of perpendicular, wood pieces has strength approaching that of steel.  In 2009 a nine-storey building, Stadthaus, in London, was built with CLT instead of steel construction and in Stockholm a 34-storey wooden building has been given planning permission. There are many others, already built and in the pipeline. Harvesting also reduces a forest’s likelihood of suffering a catastrophic wildfire, and improves its ability to withstand it. Maintaining a mix of forest habitats and tree densities in non-reserved forests would help preserve the varied biodiversity in ecosystems worldwide. Harvesting wood will save fossil fuel and CO2, and provide jobs – giving local people more reason to ensure the forests’ survival."

 _a stock of usual tactics or methods straight from his opponent’s political playbook._



In this instance, Judith Collins is wise to avoid anything remotely connected to her opposition’s playbook, simply because their tactics don’t work for them and won’t help her either.



Collins, bless her heart, takes an intelligent and diligent approach to her work, unlike other politicians we could name but don’t need to because we know who they are. 



Instead, she took a leaf out of the political playbook written by the master politician of social media, the great and one and only Donald Trump the Tweeter.



Collins has been on Twitter for a while now, but lately, I have noticed more tweets than usual. 



This week she called out our part-time PM for unfairly berating Scott Morrison over climate change and then reprimanded Andrew Little for calling ACT and the National Party politicians fascists. “Not funny”, Judith said, quite rightly, particularly when the fascist label fits Andrew Little so much better, but of course Collins is far too kind to say so.



Deeply offensive and entirely untrue for the NZ Minister of Justice to liken to FASCISTS, the ACT Party & NZ National Party members who supported a ban on prisoners voting in 2010. All of this taking place in Parliament’s debating chamber. [#NZQT](https://twitter.com/hashtag/NZQT?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#disgusting](https://twitter.com/hashtag/disgusting?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)



Collins is indisputably increasing her public profile and getting her voice heard where it counts, which is outside the MSM. Still, the MSM give her a fair amount of coverage but Collins is right not to trust them. She knows however nice they are, they can turn on you like rabid wolves at the first smell of blood. She won’t have forgotten the time they sent her scuttling off to the backbenches. Retreat is not in Collin’s nature, but in those circumstances retreating and licking her wounds was the lesser of two evils. 



‘Crusher’ Collins is a strong woman and a fighter and the National Party know it. Wouldn’t you think they would be grateful for her strength and loyalty? Not so, instead of slobbering all over her in gratitude they simply use her to prop up their ailing party, keeping her at arm’s length and us in the dark about how far they will let this gifted woman rise.



Not far, it appears while Simon Bridges clings to leadership like a drowning sailor hangs onto the mast of a yacht in a storm. Although, it was a relief when his partner in the art of murky politics stepped away from the helm.



The National Party are dead in the water but oblivious to the fact. They think their history of success and the CoL’s appalling performance will rocket them back into power at the next election. They are wrong.



The Nats reek of dirty politics. At best they have been feeble in opposition, **ignoring the free speech debate,** throwing their support behind expensive and bogus climate change legislation, supporting the badly written gun reform law and in short allowing arguably the worst government to ever grace the beehive get away with ruining the economy. Judith Collins has been standout in calling the CoL to account on housing but the only other serious opposition the CoL faced came from David Seymour on free speech. 



It is slim pickings for conservative voters at the next election. Collins in the rank and file is not enough to persuade traditional national voters to support them again, but Collins in leadership is much more compelling. It’s a great pity she may be forced to go down with the ship, with Bridges still clinging to the mast.

"**Wales is potentially facing levels of unemployment not seen since the recession of the early 1990s, according to new modelling.**
Research commissioned by the BBC suggests the number of long-term jobless could rise to about 44,000 people.
That would be a four-fold increase on the current number.
The Welsh Government said investment was needed to soften the blow, but tough times lie ahead.
While the rate of unemployment is broadly similar in Wales and England, unemployment in Wales has risen at double the rate across the border since the beginning of 2020.
There has been a 41% increase in Wales compared to just 18% in England - meaning an estimated additional 20,000 people are looking for work in Wales.
And despite recent good news about vaccines and a possible end to lockdowns in the New Year, experts say there could be worse to come.
David Hagendyk, director of the Learning and Work Institute in Wales, has been modelling how the country's unemployment figures could look.
For the long-term unemployed, the picture is bleak. Currently, there are 11,000 people in that category in Wales, but Mr Hagendyk said that figure could rise steeply.
""Our modelling shows that could go up and be between 29,000 or 67,000 people being long-term unemployed.
""That gives us a mid-range of about 44,000.
""It blows out of the water the 2008 financial crisis in terms of long-term unemployment numbers.
""It takes us back to the early 1990s and the kind of recession we had then.""
Mr Hagendyk said that, while the numbers were eye-catching, it was important to remember the human stories behind them.
""These are real people with real jobs, real families and we know there is a long-term scarring impact.
""It's absolutely critical that the government acts quickly in order to stop this kind of modelling potential that we might see.""
James Aubrey said he wanted to be a pilot for as long as he could remember, tailoring his exams and work experience to that goal.
He had to fund a two-year training course - borrowing Â£100,000 which he has to pay back over the next decade.
That shouldn't have been a problem for the 22-year-old from Cardiff, but the aviation industry has been one of the hardest hit by the pandemic.
""The starting salaries most airlines were offering was about Â£40,000 which meant there was enough to pay off the loan and be able to live as well,"" said James.
But pilots are being laid off rather than being recruited, so James has decided to look for a job in retail - where he worked before his training - to ensure he has an income in the short-term.
""The loan is bonded to my parents' house,"" he said.
""So it means there's an added extra bit of pressure on top just to meet those repayments, just to make sure it doesn't affect my family as well as me.""
Though still determined to work as a pilot, James is concerned it could take him far longer than planned to get back into aviation.
The Welsh Government said it had allocated more than Â£1bn to support businesses and protect jobs during the pandemic.
Despite this, unemployment is rising faster in Wales than in England.
Mr Hagendyk said the underlying reasons for that lie in the way some sectors employ more people in Wales.
""Our research has shown that about one in five workers here in Wales are working in shutdown sectors - the parts of the economy that have been most affected by the first lockdown,"" he said.
""These are companies in hospitality and tourism, aviation and high street retail - that's about a quarter of a million workers here in Wales.""
Because so many people work in these vulnerable sectors, it does not bode well for the future, said Mr Hagendyk.
""They're more likely to be letting people go, making redundancies,"" he said.
""They're also most likely not to be hiring new people.""
Across Wales the hospitality sector has been amongst the hardest hit - takings have plummeted for hotels, pubs and restaurants.
On the Llyn Peninsula in Gwynedd, the Bryncynan pub began the year by spending Â£1m on a refit.
The pub's manager Heidi Bakewell was forecast to take a similar amount in revenue over the year but in reality the pub has taken about a quarter.
Heidi had also taken on and trained new staff, with some facing losing their jobs because restrictions and lockdowns meant the pub couldn't trade normally.
""I haven't slept the last couple of nights just through thinking, what are we going to do?
""Do we share the hours out, so they all get a few hours? It doesn't really work then because it's not enough for them to live on.
""We've still got three chefs. I think we've got 11 out-front staff still.
""Those numbers will probably go, I would say, to two chefs at the very most and we'll probably cut our front staff, maybe down to five.""
When Pontypridd fashion boutique Kookoo Madame reopened in September, people queued down the street for the few jobs on offer.
Among the hopefuls hoping to land a shop floor job were senior managers, people with degrees and those who were qualified but couldn't get into their chosen industries.
For owners Emma and Rez Jamal, 2020 has thrown up many obstacles.
First they were flooded out by Storm Dennis, and as they recovered from that, the first lockdown came.
To save their business, they moved to a new premises and had to choose between paying for the move or topping up staff wages when furlough ended.
""We had to make some redundancies, which was a really tough decision to make,"" said Emma.
""They were our staff who'd been with us for quite some time.
""It was awful, absolutely awful. I wouldn't want to go through it again.""
Although they were able to open in September, the firebreak meant they had to shut again.
""Everybody's scared, everybody's worried, nobody knows what's round the corner,"" said Emma.
Welsh Economy Minister Ken Skates said the way to combat the testing times to come was to invest in ""jobs, jobs and more jobs"".
He said: ""We've a proven track record in investing in people and supporting people through the most difficult economic times.
""We are confident that we have got plans, policies and schemes in place to prevent the devastating long-term scars that mass, long-term unemployment can inflict on our country.""
But Mr Skates admitted none of the forecasts he had seen had been ""rosy"".
""There is no forecast that suggests we will come out of this incredibly rapidly and are going to instantly bounce back,"" he said.
Many people across Wales face the prospect of having to learn a new profession as jobs dwindle.
Mr Hagendyk said to train even half the number of people who could end up long-term unemployed would be hugely expensive, possibly costing as much as Â£218m.
""This is investment above and beyond what we have already seen going into schools and colleges, so this is new money,"" he said.
""We have seen the Welsh Government expand training college places and apprenticeships to try to offset some of this challenge.
""But I think at the moment the scale of the response is not sufficient to meet the scale of the challenge.""
The Welsh Government said it would need additional funding from Westminster to help with retraining.
Additional funding to support skills has been announced by the UK government for England, and Wales will receive a consequential through the Barnett formula. However, there are fears that this funding alone will fall far short of what might be needed."
"The late 1980s marked a key moment for environmental science, matching triumph with looming disaster. Rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere had been observed since the late 1950s, at the remote Pacific observatory of Mauna Loa, but it was only after three decades of further research that concern over what this rapid accumulation of greenhouse gases might mean reached the desks of the world’s leaders. At the time, politicians appeared receptive to scientific warnings in a way they rarely have been since. In 1987, world governments concluded the Montreal protocol, which still stands today as probably the most successful environmental intervention, phasing out the use of the ozone-depleting chemicals that had threatened to destroy the planet’s protective atmospheric layer.  When scientists called for a parallel effort to understand the impact of rising CO2 emissions on the climate, it seemed likely their conclusions would have a similarly galvanising effect. In 1988, the UN and the World Meteorological Organization put together the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPPC), a body of the world’s leading experts on atmospheric physics and chemistry, and the emerging science of climate change, to summarise human knowledge of the climate, and provide policymakers with an assessment of the risks and possible remedies. Unfortunately, political leadership quickly ran aground on the shoals of the economic vested interests of the fossil fuel industries. But the warnings of that first IPCC report, published in 1990, laid the foundations for the study of what has since been recognised as one of the biggest threats ever to face humanity. One of the foremost scientists who propelled the IPCC, serving as co-chair and chairman of its scientific advisory group from its inception until 2002, was the British atmospheric physicist Sir John Houghton. Houghton, who has died aged 88 of complications arising from Covid-19, had already enjoyed a distinguished public science career when he took on his IPCC role. Chief executive (formerly director general) of the Met Office since 1983, he won numerous prizes and accolades, including the Chree medal and prize in 1979 and election as a fellow of the Royal Society in 1972. He served as president of the Royal Meteorological Society from 1976 to 1978. While the IPCC’s warnings did not result in the swift remedial action that some hoped for, the body continued to refine and expand its knowledge, producing regular comprehensive assessments and forecasts of the climate crisis. In 2007, the IPCC shared the Nobel peace prize with the former US vice-president Al Gore, with Houghton among those accepting the award in Oslo on behalf of the hundreds of scientists involved. Houghton remained as co-chair of the IPCC’s scientific assessment working group until 2002, and in that time also fostered a world-leading research effort at the Met Office and its Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research. The UK still occupies a place at the top table of global climate science today, with the Hadley Centre operating as one of the world’s top climate research hubs. On 1 May, the IPCC announced it would dedicate a key part of its forthcoming report next year to Houghton’s memory. Knighted in 1991, Houghton went on from the Met Office to chair, from 1992 to 1998, the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, another landmark institution that had an influence on environmental science and policy before it was closed down in 2011 under the government’s austerity cuts. Houghton discovered his interest in science at a young age, while studying at Rhyl grammar school in north Wales. He was born in Dyserth, Denbighshire, to strongly evangelical Christian parents, Miriam (nee Yarwood) and Sidney Houghton, the second of three sons of whom the eldest, David, became a meteorologist and the youngest, Paul, a lecturer in engineering. The family moved to nearby Rhyl when John was two, and a statue of him was erected in the town in 2013. He went on to Jesus College in Oxford – sometimes known as the Welsh college for its strong links with Wales – and completed his BA in 1951 and DPhil in 1955. He soon became fascinated by Russia’s Sputnik missions, which he said “transformed” his thinking as they opened new vistas for atmospheric research through satellites. He developed these interests further as a professor of atmospheric physics at Oxford from 1972 to 1983 and deputy director of the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory from 1981 to 1983. Throughout his scientific career, Houghton remained true to his devout evangelical Christian upbringing, and worked on combining the two as president of the John Ray Initiative, which aims to connect the environment, science and Christianity, and as a founding member of the International Society for Science and Religion. He said of his Christian faith: “The most important choice I have made is to accept Jesus as my saviour and lord. I was brought up that way, but there was a point when I realised it was an important decision that I had to make.” As the UK takes on the presidency of the UN’s crunch climate conference this year, known as Cop26 and set to take place next spring in Glasgow, after being postponed owing to the coronavirus crisis, Britain’s climate science community will play a key role in providing world leaders with the knowledge they need to make informed decisions on rescuing the planet from climate breakdown – an effort that owes a lot to the work Houghton began more than three decades ago at the IPCC and Met Office. In 1962 Houghton married Margaret Broughton, and they had two children. After her death he set up the Margaret Houghton memorial fund, a research unit on medical nursing. In 1988 he married Sheila Thompson. Houghton published his autobiography, In the Eye of the Storm, in 2013, and retired to Aberdovey in west Wales, where his final years were clouded by dementia.  He is survived by Sheila, his children, Janet and Peter, his grandchildren, Daniel, Hannah, Esther, Jonathan, Jemima, Sam and Max, and his brother Paul. • John Theodore Houghton, atmospheric physicist, born 30 December 1931; died 15 April 2020"

These days, the Trump administration’s attacks on trade liberalization, trade agreements, and the World Trade Organization are focused on issues such as trade deficits and allegations that the United States is being treated “unfairly.” But before Trump and his trade team hijacked the trade debate, there had been a critique from the left that trade was bad for the environment in various ways. One example was that trade agreements supposedly got in the way of domestic environmental regulation. There had been some trade disputes over domestic environmental regulations, some of which had included provisions that discriminated against foreign products in favor of domestic ones, and environmental groups were concerned about the impact of adverse rulings by WTO “panels” (i.e., quasi‐​judicial courts) on their ability to adopt such regulations.   
  
  
While that debate has been overshadowed recently, it came back yesterday after a WTO panel ruling on various U.S. state measures that discriminate against foreign products in the renewable energy sector. In reaction to this ruling, Todd Tucker of the Roosevelt Institute wrote the following:   




The World Trade Organization (WTO) is back in the news, with a Thursday ruling against seven U.S. states’ renewable energy policies. The WTO is already unpopular with right‐​wing nationalists like Donald Trump. By siding with India against the U.S., the WTO is likely to make left‐​leaning politicians and the burgeoning global environmental movement unhappy. 



**States Are Acting on Climate because the federal government won’t**



The WTO is acting against state level policies intended to improve the environment, stepping into the void left by the federal government. In 2009, the U.S. Senate refused to vote on what was at that time the most ambitious climate change legislation: the Waxman‐​Markey Act. Concluding that federal action might never be forthcoming, U.S. states (especially those than lean Democratic) began enacting climate policy of their own.   
  
  
The measures range from biodiesel incentives in Montana, through nudges for Michigan‐​made clean energy manufacturing, to other schemes in California, Delaware, Connecticut, Minnesota and Washington State. The common denominator of these policies is an attempt to soften the inevitable economic dislocations of moving away from the carbon economy. The Michigan policy was typical: electricity providers get a renewable credit when they generate one megawatt of green energy. However, they get another tenth of a credit when that energy uses Michigan‐​made equipment or Michigan laborers.   
  
  
…   




**The WTO sees “Buy Local” politics as protectionist**



When India complained about these green schemes, they did not have to show that Indian companies tried to qualify for any of them, or that they had been denied access, or that they lost any money to make a case at the WTO. Under the rules of the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade (GATT), Michigan’s energy credit was invalid, because Indian solar panel exporters _in theory_ would have not qualified for that extra tenth of a renewable energy credit if they had tried to sell them in Michigan.



…   
  
  
**This is a Problem for the Green New Deal**   
  
  
The WTO decision collides with a groundswell of progressive interest in a Green New Deal — a plan that looks a lot like the state policies that the commercial body just ruled against. The Green New Deal resolution by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio‐​Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Edward J. Markey (D‐​Mass.) outlines five goals, 14 projects and 15 requirements to help evaluate those projects. Instead of just going ahead with carbon taxes (which would likely be unpopular), it gives groups that might be expected to oppose a carbon tax — front line communities, manufacturing workers — a stake in the deal’s success. It uses Buy Local or Hire Local requirements to make its proposed climate solutions politically sellable and viable. These are the sorts of provisions that India and other countries can be expected to challenge if and when a Green New Deal ever gets through Congress.   
  
  
…



In reality, while there may be some actual trade and the environment conflicts that are hard to sort out, this is not one of them. The WTO ruling here is very narrow. It is not a general condemnation of subsidies for environmental causes. Rather, it simply says that governments cannot discriminate against foreign goods when adopting their environmental policies. That ruling is actually pro‐​environment. If governments are trying to promote the adoption of environmentally‐​friendly products, competition is helpful not harmful. Generally speaking, environmentalists should want more trade in these products, not less. As I jokingly put it on twitter, “The fundamental question: Do you want artisan, hand‐​crafted solar panels from the Eastern Shore of Maryland for a million dollars a pop, or do you want highly efficient solar panels made by a Chinese factory in Iceland that is powered by geothermal energy?” Shielding local producers from competition makes them stagnant and inefficient. That’s not the way to develop good renewable energy products. If the Green New Deal does that, it is not going to be very green.   
  
  
There is a group of people out there who still believe in old school industrial policy, advocating a wide range of government interventions in the economy (including protectionist measures like the ones at issue here), in order to build up domestic manufacturing. But the policies they are pushing cannot be categorized as pro‐​environment, and often these policies will be pretty bad for the environment. It’s a shame, because this is one area where supporters of trade liberalization should be able to work together with environmentalists by pushing for lower trade barriers on these products, as my old colleague Bill Watson and I wrote about here.

This email in December 2003 shows what appears to be the genesis of the idea of setting up the RealClimate.org website.
There a BBC (impartiality – ho ho) connection. Roger Harrabin at this meeting at Tyndall (why was he there in the first place?) of the BBC apparently “…wanted something more pro-active.” according to the email.
Bishop Hill writes:
#2974 is an email from Prof John Shepherd, a Tyndall advisory board member, to RealClimate’s Stefan Rahmstorf. Dated December 2003, it is a response to an email in which Rahmstorf has suggested setting up a website to counter sceptic arguments (perhaps the germ of the idea for RealClimate itself?). That’s not the point though. The point will be clear when you read Shepherd’s report of a meeting of Tyndall’s advisory board. 
Many thanks for your very helpful comments. Essentially I agree on all counts, and indeed the “sceptics ask, scientists answer” web-page that you have set up is exactly the sort of thing I had in mind as a possible minimal response that we (Tyndall et al, and even maybe the Royal Society if it wants to get involved) might undrertake. Wherever possible this could/should refer to other reputable sites (incl IPCC, Hadley Centre, the ones you mention, etc etc) rather than duplicating the material. I would envisage that such a site could be maintained by a consortium of the willing, in this case involving (say) Tyndall, Hadley & PIK. We could then asked the RS (et al) to mention it and link to it on some sort of “sound science” page on their own web-site(s) (Rachel, do you think that this might fly ?).
We had an interesting debate on this at the Tyndall Advisory Board last week, and the consensus was very much in line with your views, except for the journalist present (Roger Horobin), who wanted something more pro-active. I am more sympathetic to his view than most of you, I think, but the question is what more would be useful, effective, and not too burdensome ? So far I don’t think I have identified anything, but I do think that the sort of web-page mentioned above would be a start, and so I am copying this to Asher Minns, for him to consider and discuss with John & Mike at Tyndall Central.
The date of this email is Wed, 03 Dec 2003
Academia moves slowly in most things. They had to build consensus and then search for money to do it, perhaps money that couldn’t be from NASA or other publicly funded research due to the conflicts of interest that would have created with such an outreach. They found money in the form of Fenton Communications, now Environmental Media Services.

James Delingpole has ruthlessly scourged Greta Thunberg in a cutting critique where he describes her as being “emblematic of the stupidity of our age.”



St Greta of Thunberg has made it into the cover of _GQ_ and is now on her way across the Atlantic in a $4 million yacht to lecture Americans about climate change.



[…] what is a 16-year old autistic school drop-out who has done nothing of note in her life other regurgitate climate propaganda doing on the cover of a men’s magazine?



Call me naive but I thought the point of men’s magazines was to write about stuff that _men_ might find interesting: dodging snipers’ bullets in war zones; free-diving with great white sharks; playing Scrabble with the Medellin cartel; […] strafing a remote baboon colony in a Mig-25 Foxbat; the quest for the world’s purest MDMA.



Sure, girls have a place in this universe: as decoration and objects of lust. But spooky Greta with her pigtails and thousand-yard stare of disapproval is not only far too young to qualify for that status but far too earnest and grim.



And boring. What kind of man would be remotely interested in buying a mag whose main feature entailed a finger-wagging lecture […] about how, like, totally endangered the planet is and how totally it’s all our fault and how we’ve got to abandon all the things we hold dear — meat; air travel; fast cars; designer threads — in order to stop all the baby polar bears melting?



A lecture, furthermore, from a child who hasn’t finished her schooling, whose frontal lobes haven’t formed, who has no sense of humour, whose every utterance is the second-hand opinion of alarmist grown-ups […]



No kind of man that I know of, that’s for sure. Unless you count tofu-eating, milquetoast, pantywaist, beta, snowflake, self-flagellating, Mom’s-basement-dwelling, environmental science graduates as men.



Don’t hold back James, tell them what you really think LOL.



[…] why are so many adults who really should know better by dint of their age and experience hurrying to prostrate themselves before this pigtailed school drop out as if she were the new Messiah?



It’s not merely weird. It’s a form of mass hysteria […]



To appreciate just how irrational it all is, consider, by way of a thought experiment, if a 16-year-old autistic kid with pigtails just as fetching as St Greta’s were to organise a global school walkout in protest at mass immigration; or the oppression of women in the Middle East; or the destruction of rainforest to grow palm oil to make biofuels; or the devastation caused by wind energy to birds and bats; or China’s abuse of Hong Kong.



 **How many politicians do you think would be giving that child an audience?** How many millionaire yacht owners would be offering her free trips across the Atlantic? How many newspapers and TV channels would be giving her coverage of any kind?



 **The answer is none.**



That’s because unlike the fake cause being championed by St Greta, those problems are serious and real and intractable and contentious and not easily soluble by sound bites and vacuous, virtue-signalling gestures.



They don’t suit the mainstream media’s feel-bad-in-order-to-feel-good fashionable handwringing narrative about the “climate emergency”.



[…] But such is St Greta’s protected status at the moment that if you criticise her or make jokes about her, as the Brexit-supporting millionaire Arron Banks did recently on Twitter, you get reported to authorities. It even becomes a bona fide news story. (Or the BBC thinks it does…)



[…] the wankerati have completely lost the plot over St Greta. And maybe if no one listened to them, it wouldn’t matter. But a lot of impressionable people take what these influencers say seriously. Which is a bit of a worry when you stop to think about what it is that St Greta of Thunberg actually represents.



[…] [Here](https://www.finance-monthly.com/2018/07/climate-change-we-dont-have-time/) is one of her puppet masters — Ingmar Rentzhog, the Swedish “entrepreneur” behind the tech start-up which has been exploiting Greta’s fresh-faced innocence to push his green agenda.



[…] If this doesn’t terrify you, it should. Not only is the environmental movement getting more radical — see, for example, Thunberg’s friends at Extinction Rebellion — but it also seems to be picking up more public support, in Europe at least, if not the U.S.



Here, though, are a few things we know:



 **There is no evidence** — beyond repeatedly debunked and falsified computer models — to suggest that recent global warming is catastrophic, unprecedented or significantly man-made.



Even if we could decide what the world’s ideal temperature is, **there is no evidence that mankind has access to a knob that can control it** — nor one that wouldn’t end up doing more harm than good.



Not a cent of the $1.5 trillion (plus) per annum currently being spent funding the Climate Industrial Complex is having any measurable effect on combating climate change.



Regardless of what we do in the West, India and China are committed to increasing their carbon dioxide emissions rapidly in a way that will dwarf any puny decarbonisation measures adopted unilaterally by Western economies.[…]



Yet none of these serious objections to the kind of drastic climate action that St Greta of Thunberg’s controllers are advocating ever gets a look-in. Instead, when people like me try to raise them we are dismissed as **deniers in the pay of Big Oil** (I wish!) or we are accused of being heartless and vindictive for picking on a 16-year-old autistic kid.



Well I’m sorry, but “Let’s bomb Western Industrial Civilisation back to the Dark Ages because a 16-year-old climate activist with cute pigtails made the cover of _GQ_ and is now travelling across the Atlantic on an expensive sailing boat” is not an argument. Really it isn’t. And the gullible grown-ups who think otherwise should be ashamed of themselves.

I have been amazed at how bad Wellington traffic has become in the last 5 years or so. Just this week, there were 2 major traffic incidents that caused tailbacks for literally miles. This is happening far too often, and while something desperately needs to be done, the current council is simply not up to it. They are far more interested in rainbow crossings than in getting Wellington moving. By and large, their answer to the traffic congestion is to put in another cycle lane.



So it comes as no surprise to find that the council has caved into Julie Anne Genter’s demands to increase public transport as a way to reduce congestion. The ideology on these issues is strong, but none of it is helping Wellingtonians to get to work, or their kids to get to school.



If Genter really thinks that public transport is the only way forward, then she should say so. Instead, she has insisted on keeping her letter to the Minister of Transport a secret. We all know what that means. So, instead of being ‘open and transparent’, which is something that the Greens have always campaigned on, she is dying in a ditch to keep that letter secret. It really must be bad.



Matthew Hooton isn’t having a bar of it.



This is a story about the allocation of $6.4 billion of public money and a Green Party that wants to cover up why particular decisions were made. It underlines that the Official Information Act (OIA) is broken. 



Contradicting the Wellington City Council, the Greater Wellington Regional Council and the NZ Transport Agency that had worked together on the plan for some years, Twyford’s package delayed a new Mt Victoria tunnel until the 2030s.  
Instead, the money would be allocated in the 2020s to — you guessed it — a billion-dollar-plus tram from the railway station to the airport. The tram would be slower than the airport bus, which currently takes only 25 minutes to the CBD yet is underused. 



In 2016, council and mayoral candidates campaigned on ‘4 Lanes to the Planes’. Now, it seems, we could get there faster by pony and cart.



Inquiries by Opposition transport spokesperson Chris Bishop have revealed that the background to the changed spending priorities included a letter from the Associate Transport Minister, the Greens’ Julie Anne Genter, to her senior minister, Labour’s Twyford.



The letter was written on ministerial letterhead and signed by Genter as Associate Minister.



A billion-dollar airport tram in a hilly city with a population of just 220,000 and only another 300,000 in its wider region would be globally unusual. We should expect to see detailed consideration of arguments and counterarguments as the two ministers debate whether the tunnel or tram should have priority. 



It will never work. People will have to travel to the CBD to get to the tram… almost certainly by car. Then, where exactly do they park? It is madness.



**It has even been reported that Genter and another Green MP threatened to resign if the tunnel went ahead before the tram.**



Well, that would hardly have been a loss, would it? Go ahead and resign. Make my day.



Under the OIA, the public has a legal right to see this to-ing and fro-ing about why their taxes will be spent on one thing instead of another. The Genter letter seems to have been pivotal. 



The Act specifies that its purpose is to progressively increase the availability of official information to enable New Zealanders to more effectively participate in public affairs and promote the accountability of ministers and bureaucrats. 



After all, the whole thing is being funded by taxpayer’s money, so yes… the taxpayer does have a right to know why and how decisions were made.



Its principle of availability demands all information be made available unless there is good reason for withholding it. Information must be released as soon as reasonably practicable, and in no case later than 20 working days after a request is received, or reasons given why it should be kept secret. 



As the only reason seems to be to save Julie Ann Genter’s skin, I don’t believe that counts as an acceptable reason for failure to disclose.



An eternal rule of politics is that, when it comes to ethical questions such as complying with the OIA, each Government is worse than the one before.



They adopt all the dirty tricks of their predecessors and invent new ones of their own.



Ardern, though, promised to break this cycle. 



Her confidence and supply agreement with the Greens’ James Shaw promised to “strengthen New Zealand’s democracy by increasing public participation, openness, and transparency around official information”. 



So Genter is in breach of the confidence and supply agreement too? So where is James Shaw on this? Or Jacinda, for that matter?



Genter now demands to keep secret her letter about the $6.4b funding package on the grounds that it would not be in the public interest for anyone else to see it. 



It is most definitely in the interests of Wellingtonians to see it, particularly when the tunnels they so badly want and need seem to have disappeared into the never-never.



The Official Information Act is now a joke. In spite of promises of transparency, this is the least open government for decades.



An intervention by the courts seems required, but that would require someone with the means to commit a decade to litigation. 



In the meantime, Genter is a disgrace to her party and herself and should either release her letter in full or resign. 



  
Neither will happen. It will simply be brushed under the carpet, like sex scandals, employment matters, Czech kickboxers, and anything else that might make the government look bad… although the lack of transparency is making them look bad anyway.



It seems we just reel from scandal to scandal with this government, but the Greens really are the worst part of it. We should never have anyone who is driven entirely by ideology anywhere near transport. In the meantime, Wellingtonians are resigned to decades of traffic congestion and disruption. So, remember this, guys, in the local elections this year, and the general election next year. Neither the government or the council cares about you. They just play to the climate gods… whoever they are.

Some have already made arrangements for Father Christmas to speak to children via video-streaming sites, instead of face to face.
**Carol singing** \- and carol services - can take place, as long as those attending adhere to the advice on singing safely, which has been put together with the help of Public Health England. Its advice includes singing in well-ventilated areas and keeping distance from each other. Door-to-door carol singing is allowed too, but in groups of a maximum of six.
Special rules have to be in place because singing increases the risk of transmitting the virus through small droplets and aerosols in the air.
The number of people at a carol event should be limited as well. Those performing professionally or as part of a supervised activity for under 18s are not limited in number, but should still follow the performing arts guidance - including things like wearing masks and managing capacity.
For any indoor events, joining in with singing will not be allowed this year. But people can sing if they are outside.
Bishop of London Sarah Mullally welcomed the news about outdoor singing, saying: ""Singing is a very special part of our worship, especially at Advent and Christmas, so I know that the announcement that we will be able to come together for public singing outdoors this Christmas will bring comfort and joy to many.
""Advent and Christmas this year will not be the same as previous years but having outdoor congregational singing and indoor carol services with choirs is a reasonable balance and recognises our duty to protect and care for each other.""
Christmas bubbles can be in place from 23 to 27 December, to allow up to three households to spend the festive period together.
People, in all tiers, can attend **places of worship** for services from 2 December, but the rules on who you attend with depends on which tier you live in, with no indoor mixing allowed outside of tier one. However, people in the same Christmas bubble can attend together.
Christmas **volunteering** \- which can be a key part of the season for many - is allowed, but it is recommended you do this from home. You can volunteer outside the home but follow social distance guidance and advice on helping safely.
The rules on **shopping** depend on whether the shop is indoors or an outdoor market - and on the tier you live in. This will not change for 23 to 27 December when bubbles are in place, and includes Boxing Day sales."

UPDATE49: 10:00 AM PST 11/30 While not email related, just as Climategate breaks David Suzuki commits an egregious propaganda error second only to the 10:10 video where kids are blown up for not going along with carbon reduction schemes at school.

UPDATE33: Gobsmacking! Rob Wilson proves McIntyre and McKittrick correct in an email to colleagues at CRU, showing that when random noise time series are fed into Mike Mann’s procedure, it makes “hockey sticks”. The confirmation that M&M is right never leaves the walls of CRU.

You may recall Landsea resigned from the IPCC over this. Pielke says: “The gatekeeping of the IPCC process is abundantly clear, and the shadowy suggestion that they can find out who the reviewers are from another colleague is a bit unsettling as well.” Trenberth looks particularly bad here.
UPDATE16: 11:30AM PST 11/23 Insider scientist at CRU says our “reaction to Mike Mann’s errors was not particularly honest” – story here
UPDATE15: 7:50AM 11/23 Ric Werme found an email from the late John L. Daly to Mike Mann and the team – it is well worth a read here
UPDATE14: 2:45 AM PST 11/23 Willis Eschenbach offers a guest post here explaining how his FOIA requests went astray. Mr. David Palmer was the Freedom of Information Officer for the CRU at the time. In the newly released emails, he expresses his frustration with the whole procedure.
UPDATE13: 12:05AM 11/23 Craig Stone writes:
I have published a searchable database of the emails at http://foia2011.org
All email addresses and phone numbers are automatically redacted. It’s extremely rudimentary right now, but I’ll be refining the functionality and improving the search capabilities and navigation over the course of the next week.
UPDATE 12: 9:30 PM PST We’ve known for some time that Al Gore made up a bunch of claims in his AIT movie that simply weren’t true. Now this revelation in the new email batch shows that in the case of Kilimanjaro’s disappearing snows, even Phil Jones and Dr. Lonnie Thompson don’t believe global warming is the cause, even though Thompson put out a press release nearly a year ago saying just that.

date: Wed, 29 Aug 2007 12:03:05 -0400
from: “Michael E. Mann”..
subject: Re: Something not to pass on
to: Phil Jones
Phil,
I would not respond to this. They will misrepresent and take out of context anything you give them. This is a set up. They will certainly publish this, and will ignore any evidence to the contrary that you provide. s They are going after Wei-Chyung because he’s U.S. and there is a higher threshold for establishing libel. Nonetheless, he should
consider filing a defamation lawsuit, perhaps you too.
I have been talking w/ folks in the states about finding an investigative journalist to investigate and expose McIntyre, and his thusfar unexplored connections with fossil fuel interests.Perhaps the same needs to be done w/ this Keenan guy.
I believe that the only way to stop these people is by exposing them and discrediting them….
UPDATE7: 1:20 PM PST Phil Jones and Tom Wigley calls another scientist (The former state climatologist of California) a “jerk” for publishing his UHI results.
UPDATE6: 12:08PM PST Here’s an email that collaborates a radio interview I did in Seattle with Thomas Peterson in summer 2007, yes these are 100% real emails, no doubt whatsoever now. More here: Climategate 2.0 – NCDC: “Mr. Watts gave a well reasoned position”
UPDATE 5: 11:00AM PST In a statement, UEA doesn’t deny these emails, but posts about the whitewash investigations of the past, like they matter now.
UPDATE4: 9:45 AM PST I’ve changed the headline from Climategate 2.0 to Climategate 2.0  emails – They’re real and they’re spectacular!  with a hat tip to Jerry Seinfeld. The relevance of that headline is particularly interesting in the context of where Dr. James Hansen of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) has his office in NYC.
UPDATE3: 9:25 AM PST – Having read a number of emails, and seeing this quote from Mike Mann in the Guardian:
When asked if they were genuine, he said: “Well, they look like mine but I hardly see anything that appears damning at all, despite them having been taken out of context. I guess they had very little left to work with, having culled in the first round the emails that could most easily be taken out of context to try to make me look bad.”
I’m going to conclude they are the real deal. I’ve posted a BitTorrent link to the file below. One big difference between Climategate 1 and 2 is that in 1, it took days for the MSM to catch on, now they are on top of it.
UPDATE2: 8:45AM PST The Guardian has a story up by Leo Hickman, and this excerpt suggests they may be the real deal:
Norfolk police have said the new set of emails is “of interest” to their investigation to find the perpetrator of the initial email release who has not yet been identified.
The emails appear to be genuine, but this has yet to be confirmed by the University of East Anglia. One of the emailers, the climate scientist Prof Michael Mann, has confirmed that he believes they are his messages.
UPDATE1: 8:20 AM PST These emails have not been verified yet, and this story was posted by one of my moderating staff while I was asleep. Until such time they are verified, tread lightly because without knowing what is behind the rest of the zip file, for all we know it’s a bunch of recipes and collection of  lorem ipsum text files. I’m working to authenticate these now and will report when I know more – Anthony Watts

The winner for Earth Hour every year since 2003  - North Korea. Odds favor them to be the winner again this year.
Every year at Christmas, many newspapers reprint “Yes Virginia, there is a Santa Claus“, this excellent essay by Ross McKittrick should be repeated on every blog on every observance of Earth Hour. Copy, paste, and share it widely. A poll on what you plan to do to observe this event follows.
The whole mentality around Earth Hour demonizes electricity. I cannot do that, instead I celebrate it and all that it has provided for humanity. – Ross McKitrick
Earth Hour: A Dissent
by Ross McKitrick


Ross McKitrick, Professor of Economics, University of Guelph, Canada. (Photo credit: Wikipedia)

In 2009 I was asked by a journalist for my thoughts on the importance of Earth Hour.
Here is my response.
I abhor Earth Hour. Abundant, cheap electricity has been the greatest source of human liberation in the 20th century. Every material social advance in the 20th century depended on the proliferation of inexpensive and reliable electricity.
Giving women the freedom to work outside the home depended on the availability of electrical appliances that free up time from domestic chores. Getting children out of menial labour and into schools depended on the same thing, as well as the ability to provide safe indoor lighting for reading.

Development and provision of modern health care without electricity is absolutely impossible. The expansion of our food supply, and the promotion of hygiene and nutrition, depended on being able to irrigate fields, cook and refrigerate foods, and have a steady indoor supply of hot water.
Many of the world’s poor suffer brutal environmental conditions in their own homes because of the necessity of cooking over indoor fires that burn twigs and dung. This causes local deforestation and the proliferation of smoke- and parasite-related lung diseases.
Anyone who wants to see local conditions improve in the third world should realize the importance of access to cheap electricity from fossil-fuel based power generating stations. After all, that’s how the west developed.
The whole mentality around Earth Hour demonizes electricity. I cannot do that, instead I celebrate it and all that it has provided for humanity.
Earth Hour celebrates ignorance, poverty and backwardness. By repudiating the greatest engine of liberation it becomes an hour devoted to anti-humanism. It encourages the sanctimonious gesture of turning off trivial appliances for a trivial amount of time, in deference to some ill-defined abstraction called “the Earth,” all the while hypocritically retaining the real benefits of continuous, reliable electricity.
People who see virtue in doing without electricity should shut off their fridge, stove, microwave, computer, water heater, lights, TV and all other appliances for a month, not an hour. And pop down to the cardiac unit at the hospital and shut the power off there too.
I don’t want to go back to nature. Travel to a zone hit by earthquakes, floods and hurricanes to see what it’s like to go back to nature. For humans, living in “nature” meant a short life span marked by violence, disease and ignorance. People who work for the end of poverty and relief from disease are fighting against nature. I hope they leave their lights on.
Here in Ontario, through the use of pollution control technology and advanced engineering, our air quality has dramatically improved since the 1960s, despite the expansion of industry and the power supply.
If, after all this, we are going to take the view that the remaining air emissions outweigh all the benefits of electricity, and that we ought to be shamed into sitting in darkness for an hour, like naughty children who have been caught doing something bad, then we are setting up unspoiled nature as an absolute, transcendent ideal that obliterates all other ethical and humane obligations.
No thanks.
I like visiting nature but I don’t want to live there, and I refuse to accept the idea that civilization with all its tradeoffs is something to be ashamed of.

The 2010 Olympics, held in the largest city ever to host a Winter Games, have not gone completely according to plan.



Before the games even began, organizers lamented how Washington, D.C., was getting a surfeit of snow that would have helped certain venues. Then, a luger lost his life to a track that was apparently both the fastest in the world and the one with the least padding. Then the fourth arm that was to hold the Olympic cauldron failed during the opening ceremonies. Finally, as I personally observed, ice conditions detracted from several promising speed skating events.



Apart from these real concerns, however, political activists and their media enablers remind us of how drugs, commercialism and the threat of terrorism have spoiled the world’s preeminent athletic event. Columnists lament the passing of a purer age, when doctors trained to run four‐​minute miles in their spare time, when competition was its own reward and a medal brought national glory rather than celebrity endorsement contracts. These Cassandras habitually predict the demise of the Olympics as modern society wreaks havoc on the sacrosanct traditions of the ancients.



But this prediction is based on bad information; politicians’ beliefs that the games should promote a kinder, gentler, unified world reflect romanticized history. Since the end of the Cold War, the Olympics have thrown off the corrosive chains of ideological battle to revert to the values of the original Games, among which were the dominance of the personal over the national, the economic over the political, and the athletic over larger concerns of the state.



The standard view of the Greek Olympics as a halcyon festival bringing amateur sportsmen together in the name of peace and brotherhood is a remnant of 19th‐​century Romanticism, which was institutionalized by aristocrats like modern games founder Pierre de Coubertin. Adolf Hitler, who staged the 1936 Berlin Games as a testament to the German people — and invented the torch relay in the first place — was taken in by a similar Olympic vision of nationalism via physical perfection.



The ancient reality could not have been further from these modern misconceptions, however, as Greek armies routinely violated the Olympic truce, and battle sometimes took place in the Olympic sanctuary itself. Individualism and athletic prowess were valued much more than mere participation, and wealth superceded ideology.



Pindar, the lyric poet whose victory odes tell us much of what we know about the early Olympians, wrote at the behest and patronage of wealthy athletes, who sought personal glory rather than the vindication of their city‐​state and its political system. And the great champion Alcibiades used his prestige to gain fame and riches, often at the expense of his “national interest.”



Further, the ancient heroes were Panhellenic — Athenian kids cheered for a Spartan Lindsay Vonn — and the victors’ olive wreaths were intrinsically worth about as much as the medals doled out in Vancouver.



The modern games, as they developed during the Cold War to allow politics to overshadow sports, broke with their predecessors. Mexico City hosted the 1968 Olympics amid the tumult of student uprising around the globe. Black Power made its presence felt on the victory podium with a barefoot gloved‐​fist protest. Subsequent Olympiads reflected the expansion and retrenchment of communism, along with guerilla warfare and counter‐​revolution in Latin America.



The Games of 1972 succumbed to the most dastardly terrorism ever visited upon the Olympics, with Palestinian jihadists’ murder of 11 Israeli athletes and coaches in Munich. The 1976 Montreal event, which left a trail of debt that Quebec taxpayers only recently paid off — and for which British Columbia taxpayers now brace themselves — saw the first of a series of boycotts, this time by 30 African countries protesting apartheid.



As the Soviet Union and its vassal states succeeded in using the games as a showcase for ideological superiority, and the Western world lay mired in stagflation and cynicism, the Olympics lost their ancient bearings.



Though nobody knew it at the time, the 1988 Seoul Olympics were a watershed. These games followed the tit‐​for‐​tat superpower boycotts in Moscow and Los Angeles and were the first to be free from major political turmoil since Tokyo in 1964. More importantly, they represented the last Olympiad of the Cold War, with the Berlin Wall falling the next year, followed by the dissolution of the Evil Empire, German reunification, and the New World Order of globalization.



The 20th century took us through almost continual political upheaval — not least within the Olympics — with most of it defined by the bipolar Cold War mentality and the specter of nuclear Armageddon. With that edifice of pretension eroded, the games were free to become athletic spectacles again.



Under today’s conditions of globalization — cultural homogenization, economic interdependence, decline of the nation‐​state even with respect to our enemies in war — international athletic competition assumes an ever‐​more parallel course to that of world society at large. As with all sporting events, the Olympics of the past two decades have become exponentially more entertainment‐​oriented. Even the proliferation of crass commercialism is a positive step because it returns the Olympics to the role they fulfill best: providing a forum for the finest athletes in the world to compete for fame and riches, while showing the rest of us a good time.



The Olympics now bring us the absolute best, without regard to color, creed, contract, or the Iron Curtain. The nature of the Olympic “movement,” meanwhile, has returned to the entertainment, ritual, and indeed athletic value of the original games. Gone is the sham of amateurism, as athletes are once more individuals, not tools of the state.



Tradition meet meritocracy; Coubertin meet Milton Friedman. Counter the conventional punditry, the symbiotic relationship between sports and society has thankfully returned to its original, proper status under the ancient Greeks.



Returning to 2010, International Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge was correct to quip ironically that his leadership group should have urged something other than the “greenest Games” (perhaps by avoiding temperate climates like Vancouver — or 2014’s Sochi, Russia?). It is of course tempting for these unaccountable IOC grandees to hitch their star to the ~~global warming~~ climate change fad, but that doesn’t mean they should be immune from criticism for using a glorious athletic competition for peddling utopian myths.



This article is part of a series of dispatches filed to the _Daily Caller_ during the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. Links for the complete series appear below:

Prince Harry cut a sad and lonely figure walking behind his mother’s coffin in 1997.



Since then, he has served in Afghanistan, partied long and hard, worn a Nazi shirt, fallen in love a few times, and finally, married an American mixed-race actress and been congratulated for his diversity on his choice of bride. This young royal couple was set to blow away the cobwebs from the Royal Family… or so we were told at the time.



We’ve heard it all before though.



It is strange the way that Americans and the Royals never seem to mix well. While it is too early to say that this marriage is a disaster for the Royal Family, Harry is fast losing the enormous popularity and sympathy that he once enjoyed, and rightly or wrongly, his new wife is being blamed for that.



I don’t blame Meghan. Sure, she behaves like the princess she thinks she has become, but that is not entirely her fault. Harry needed to make sure she understood her role as part of the Royal Family, and clearly, he hasn’t had the heart – or the guts – to sit her down and tell her a few home truths.



He should have explained to her that, as a Royal, your life is never your own. Sure, they enjoy wealth and enormous privilege, but it all comes at a price. The public expects a piece of you, and the constant attention from members of the great unwashed is a price they have to pay for the life of luxury and respect that they enjoy.



After all, we all thought Meghan would cope well with the attention, unlike Harry’s former girlfriends, Chelsea Davy and Cressida Bonas, who apparently struggled with the constant media scrutiny.



Meghan, however, insists on having her cake and eating it, demanding privacy when it suits her and courting attention when she feels like it.



But keeping the details of Diana’s grandson’s birth private, including not announcing who the godparents are, is definitely not the way to endear oneself to the British public and it did not go unnoticed that the Queen did not attend Archie’s christening, citing a clash of engagements.



These events could have been rearranged. Everyone knows that. The Queen was sending a message that has neither been received or understood.



Since then, the Duchess (now known as ‘Duchess Difficult’) has snubbed President Trump on his UK visit, demanded that no one photograph her at Wimbledon because she was there in a ‘private’ capacity (on centre court attending a televised match), and issued decrees to neighbours at their home near Windsor not to approach them, not to ask to see Archie and not to pat their dogs.



You can just imagine how this is going down with the British people, who recently paid 2 million pounds for the renovations at Frogmore Cottage to be completed, can’t you?



Harry should know better. While we can understand his loathing of the media, after the way they hounded his mother, there are ways of reaching a happy medium, and issuing decrees to the public about keeping their distance is not the way to do it. The Cambridges manage to steer a path between privacy and public duty, and William and Harry had much the same upbringing.



The announcement this week that the Sussex’s are going to have no more than 2 children came as a bit of a relief because it is high handed and arrogant to treat the British public with such disdain on the birth of a royal baby.



However, this is why I have turned completely off Harry, probably for good.



Dozens of Hollywood A-listers, pop stars and royalty including Leonardo Di Caprio, Katy Perry and Prince Harry raise awareness of global warming by flying to Sicily in 114 private jets to attend a [Google Camp](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/07/31/irony-alert-global-elites-take-to-the-sea-skies-for-more-climate-talks/) on the theme of climate change. Did they think – what? – that we wouldn’t notice the irony here? 



There is an expectation that the Royals do not act extravagantly, as they are mostly funded by the British people, and can be severely criticised for spending taxpayers money unwisely. This is an act of arrogance and hypocrisy by our former favourite Royal.



Prince Harry confides that he is only going to have [two children](https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2019/07/31/prince-harry-people-dont-understand-their-unconscious-bias/) by his current wife – ex- _Suits_ actress and _Vogue_ editor Meghan Markle – because any more would apparently be bad for the planet. (This is the same Meghan Markle – aka the Duchess of Sussex – who flew home by [private jet](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/meghan-markle-flies-home-by-private-jet-after-new-york-baby-shower-a4072641.html) earlier this year after travelling to New York for a baby shower) 



There is nothing like the hypocrisy of the left and the mega-rich.



And apparently, Harry turned up barefoot. What? Are shoes bad for the environment now?



It is clear that Harry has forgotten, and that Meghan never knew, that the purpose of the Royal Family is to serve its people. The British will support the Royals, so long as they see a benefit in having them around. After all, think of all the tourist dollars that could go into the post-Brexit coffers from guided tours of Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle and Balmoral, to mention just a few royal residences.



Unfortunately, this is all going to end badly. The Queen is going to have to intervene at some point and tell Harry and Meghan to pull their rather swollen heads in, or the Royals risk facing the wrath of the British people. This may well end in some form of exile for the Sussex family, as they take their demands for privacy and self-indulgence to unprecedented levels.



It’s funny though. Didn’t something like this happen the last time a royal married an American? History really does repeat, doesn’t it?

"**A party of 200 people at a halls of residence was broken up by police.**
The gathering in the courtyard outside St Peter's Court, Radford, which houses University of Nottingham students, stopped after midnight.
Nottinghamshire Police said officers were unable to arrest anyone as the crowd dispersed when they arrived, but they were still investigating.
It was one of a number of parties the force broke up overnight, prompting a plea to follow the rules.
Students across England are being tested next week as part of the government's plan to allow them to return home between 3 and 9 December.
Shortly after 21:00 GMT officers handed out five Â£200 fines after responding to reports of a party in a field in Gonalston.
They said they were still trying to find the organiser and a driver who crashed into a police car as they fled the scene.
At about 22:30 officers were called to a flat in Pilcher Gate, in the city centre, where they gave Â£200 fines to 21 people.
Shortly after 23:30 two people were arrested in Valley Road, Carlton, on suspicion of assaulting a police officer who had been at the scene of another illegal gathering.
Just after midnight officers broke up a ""large party"" in St Ann's and issued the organiser with a summons to appear in court.
Det Supt Andrew Gowan said: ""The very last thing we want to be doing as police officers is to be punishing people for gathering together and having fun.
""However, the current national restrictions are in place to protect the wider public from harm and we will keep enforcing them for as long as we need to.
""It is deeply disappointing that so many needed such an expensive reminder that the rules apply equally to everyone.
""We understand that this is a difficult time but there really are no excuses for this kind of behaviour where people are blatantly ignoring the restrictions in such large numbers.""

The Greens conference at the weekend may have been mostly done behind closed doors, but snippets came out, including James Shaw calling Simon Bridges a **“climate change denier”.**



We all know Bridges is no denier, but his attitude towards climate change is somewhat more benign than that of the Green party.



Nevertheless, the Greens have announced a few things that will pave the way to reducing global warming… and it seems that, in New Zealand, we think that we can reduce the increase in global temperatures all by ourselves. Our Zero Carbon Bill requires New Zealand to go for the Paris Accord target of 1.5 degrees of warming, instead of the 2 degrees that most countries have adopted.



Nobody seems to have told Jacinda or James Shaw that our adopting the harsher Paris target will make absolutely no difference to global emissions, but the effect it will have on our economy could be devastating. 



So while it has been announced that the government vehicle fleet will be all-electric by 2026 and the infamous 1 billion trees will be planted by 2028, we all know that this will make little or no difference to global emissions. It is paying lip service really.



“Climate change is an urgent issue requiring an urgent response, to ensure a stable climate for future generations of New Zealanders,” Shaw said.



“Our Government is committed to a just and rapid transition to a low emissions economy, because it’s vital that we play our part looking after our planet.”



But if it is all so urgent, why wait until 2026 to replace the government fleet of vehicles? Why not save the planet and do it now? And why can’t we get Shane’s nephs off the couch to plant all those trees sooner?



(Please note the sarcasm level is high here… just in case you thought I was serious.) 



Work was “well under way” on fixing the Emissions Trading Scheme and establishing an independent Climate Change Commission,” Shaw said.



It was also working to reduce the price of electric cars.



The Government also wanted to be moving towards a goal of 100 per cent renewable electricity by 2035.



By 2050, it wanted socially inclusive and compact cities, clean and clever energy generation and smart, sustainable farming practices using low emissions technologies.



  
All good stuff, James, but you are going to have to build several more dams for all this new electricity to be generated.



Oh, wait… isn’t it usually the Greens who object to new dams being built?



Speaking of those ‘smart, sustainable farming practices’, it is agriculture that is really going to be feeling the brunt of the Zero Carbon Bill, and agriculture is, of course, the backbone of our economy.



While all industries are expected to meet their emissions targets, agriculture has only 11 years to meet the first of its targets, unlike most other industry sectors that have until 2050. This robs agriculture of the time it will need to make technological advances, such as the production of genetically modified grasses that will reduce methane emissions from farm animals.



Don’t mention GM to the Greens either, as they are ideologically opposed to even thinking about the subject, even though it is the way forward to reducing methane emissions for agriculture.



That leads me to think that James Shaw’s idea of ‘smart, sustainable farming practices’ really only includes the growing of kale and mung beans, as anything else would be considered ecologically damaging one way or another.



Make no mistake though. A country like New Zealand, which is so reliant on agriculture for so much of its gross domestic product, is going to be badly affected by the assault on farmers, even though the effect on global emissions of each of these measures will be negligible.



If even the UK, which produces about 4% of global emissions, can do little to reduce temperatures on its own, we know for sure that we have no chance. Leading by example is not going to make China or India fall into line, no matter how much Jacinda wants it to be so.



That is not stopping this government, driven by ideology and not much else, from forcing farmers to adopt extreme emissions reductions which will not only not save the planet but will probably drive many of them off the land.



Be careful what you wish for, James Shaw. Agriculture provides a significant amount of tax revenue, which will never be replaced by the sale of mung beans. What are you going to do when that runs dry?

"Detailed century-old observations of penguin behaviour, including sexual activity so depraved and shocking it was recorded in Greek alphabet code, have been acquired by the Natural History Museum. Curators at the museum announced the purchase of original manuscript notebooks made by the explorer George Murray Levick, part of Robert Falcon Scott’s ill-fated Terra Nova expedition to the Antarctic in 1910-13.  As well as insights in to the unstoppable sex lives of penguins, they shine light on a remarkable story of survival and endurance with Levick forced to live in a cramped ice cave for seven months after he was unable to re-embark on the Terra Nova in February 1912. Douglas Russell, a senior curator of birds at the Natural History Museum, said the handwritten notes were a unique account of huge historical and zoological research interest. Together the notes represent the first major observations of an entire breeding season of an Adélie penguin colony. They are an exciting and important acquisition, Russell said. “Material such as this is often unavailable to researchers and now, for the first time, modern science has the opportunity to study Levick’s first-hand account and revisit his conclusions. “The importance of original manuscripts cannot be underestimated as they add crucial contextual and scientific data to our existing collections.” Levick was a young surgeon on Scott’s Terra Nova expedition to the South Pole and was entrusted with documenting the area’s natural history. “He is a hugely positive soul,” said Russell. “He is a nice chap. “He becomes completely obsessed with the Adélie penguin colony. One of the greatest joys in reading the notebooks is that, when the first birds arrive, you can tell the mounting excitement that he has. It is palpable in the pages … it blows his mind.” Levick was shocked by elements of penguin behaviour, documenting the excesses of young males, or “hooligan cocks”, in Greek alphabet code. These include necrophilia, sexual abuse of chicks, non-procreative sex and homosexual behaviour. But that’s penguins for you. “The thing with penguins is that sperm is cheap,” said Russell. “They have one over-riding aim which is to fertilise and bring on the next generation … the birds will pretty much have sex with anything.” The notebooks are particularly important because the area Levick was studying, Ridley Beach on Cape Adare, is still home to around 335,000 Adélie penguins, the largest colony in the world. But, scientists predict, not for much longer. “As we see rising sea levels, it is highly likely that the entire colony will move. Part of the value here is that this is an account of an area that will one day be lost, it will all be reclaimed by the sea. “As a scientist, Levick was decades ahead of his time and now, more than 100 years later, his words still have much to tell us,” said Russell. The survival of the notebooks is all the more remarkable because of what Levick and five others endured after their time on Cape Adare when they were unable, after the death of Scott, to re-embark on the Terra Nova. Effectively marooned, they were forced to make an ice cave where they lived for seven months surviving on blubber and birds they had killed. After living in “utterly horrendous” conditions, Levick then walked 200 miles back to home camp. “His ability to weather this storm is extraordinary,” said Russell. “I do think there is a massive parallel for us all in that whatever we think of as isolation, we are nowhere near what Levick went through. Maybe it gives us the ability to look at things in context.” The announcement was made to coincide with world penguin day. The museum plans to make the notebooks physically and digitally available for future research, outreach and education Andrea Hart, head of special collections at the museum, said: “The Levick notebooks are a vital addition to our existing collection and the scientific observations held in original manuscripts such as these remain as relevant and important today as when they were first created. “We’re delighted that Levick’s work can now be accessed by academics, researchers and the public, more than a century after his seminal trip to Antarctica.”"
"Satellite images of the earth provide a striking picture of our planet during the hours of darkness. From space, the world at night appears as an intricate mass of tiny points of light, clustered into constellations of villages, towns and cities and linked by a spider-web of road networks. But can this be considered a form of pollution? What harm can light do to us or the environment? It was astronomers who first put forward the argument that excess light could be viewed as a form of pollution, obscuring our view of the night sky – observatories must be located far from the glow of city lights. But a growing body of evidence suggests that artificial light may have more profound effects on the environment than simply polluting our view of the stars. For nearly four billion years, life on earth has evolved under natural cycles of light – night and day, the phases of the moon and lengthening and shortening of days through the seasons. These cycles are hard-wired into the behaviour and physiology of animals and plants. They use the varying duration of daylight over the year as a cue to trigger seasonal events such as the breaking of buds for leaves and flowers in the spring, or mating and reproduction. The internal biological clocks that regulate 24-hour cycles of production of the hormone melatonin in humans and other animals, are constantly recalibrated by alternating periods of light and darkness. Melatonin plays a crucial role in regulating sleep-wake cycles, chemically causing drowsiness when it’s time to sleep and lowering body temperatures when we’re out for the count. The division of time between day and night regulates periods of activity and rest in animals – when to hunt or forage and when to sleep. And faint natural light sources help nocturnal animals to orientate and navigate. Recent research has shown, for example, that dung beetles use the faint trace of the Milky Way to find their way.  The effects of introducing artificial light into these complex relationships can be profound, affecting the whole gamut of species. A few examples: we now know that urban light at night can advance egg laying in blue tits and bring forward the development of reproductive organs in blackbirds.  Light pollution can disrupt the annual migration of salmon, restrict the nightly movements of bats and increase mortality in young shearwaters and turtles. It can also change the foraging behaviour of wading birds  and cause deciduous trees to produce leaves earlier in the spring and retain them later in the autumn. Street lighting changes affect the structure of natural food chains. One study on grass verges under street lights found significantly higher numbers of predatory invertebrates including ground beetles and spiders, as well as scavengers, such as ants and woodlice than in unlit patches. We are only beginning to understand how these impacts may have deeper, long term consequences for nature conservation, biodiversity and the health of our ecosystems. The simplest methods for reducing light pollution – like switching off or removing unnecessary outdoor lighting and only installing new lighting where there is a demonstrated need – have the added benefits of saving money and reducing carbon emissions. A suite of other ways to reduce the environmental impact of light, from the technologically advanced to low-tech, exist and could help to make progress. The main barrier to making these reductions is lack of awareness that artificial light can be a form of pollution. Also, it is assumed that a brighter, whiter night-time environment is always safer, aesthetically pleasing and more desirable – this shouldn’t be taken as a given, and the evidence backing up these claims is often contested. Preserving, where possible, darkness at night can help reverse some of the ill-effects that the explosion of light pollution in recent years is having on the environment. Plus, we’d all benefit from seeing more of the night sky’s natural beauty."

Now that health care is done (for the time being), expect global warming to be high on the Obama administration’s “to do” list. But cap‐​and‐​trade legislation and its alternative, a direct tax on carbon‐​based fuels, can’t be passed via “reconciliation” and are far short of the needed 60 Senate votes.



As a result, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is itching to step in and dictate how and how much we can drive, fly, consume, or make. This the agency made clear in its “endangerment finding,” a necessary precursor to regulation, released last December.



Expect the administration to use 2010 global‐​temperature data as backup for the EPA’s regulatory power grab. Global temperatures shot upward around the beginning of this year thanks to El Niño, a warming of the tropical Pacific that takes place every few years. The average global temperature has a reasonable chance of beating the last high, set back in 1998 (also an El Niño year).



Meanwhile, a number of studies point to sources other than greenhouse gases as explanations for the modest warming trend of the late 20th century. This could doom the EPA’s finding. But do not expect it to go quietly.



The EPA did no scientific research of its own to buttress its endangerment finding, relying on the 2007 report of the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and a similar “Synthesis Report” from the U.S. Climate Change Science Program as the basis for its conclusions. According to these reports:



Most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid–20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic [greenhouse gas] concentrations.



“Most” means “more than one‐​half,” and the IPCC says “very likely” means a probability of between 90 and 99 percent. This claim may have constituted the “settled” science of climate change in 2007, but things have become greatly unsettled since then.



The rise in global surface temperatures as measured by the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia (yes, the “Climategate” folks) is 0.70 degrees Celsius since 1950, or a little over a tenth of a degree per decade. But the most recent refereed science literature argues otherwise.



Soon after the IPCC report, David Thompson and several others (including Climategate’s Phil Jones) published a paper in _Nature_ showing a cold bias in measurement of sea‐​surface temperatures from the early 1940s through the mid 1960s. Accounting for this drops the rise in temperature to 0.55 degrees Celsius.



At the time of the IPCC report, Canada’s Ross McKitrick and I published a paper in the _Journal of Geophysics_ showing that there was a clear and systematic “non‐​climatic” warming — from changes in land use and problems with station maintenance — in temperatures measured at weather stations. The bias isn’t all that much when measured globally, but it subtracts another .08 degrees Celsius, leaving 0.47 degrees Celsius.



Earlier this year, Susan Solomon of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration published a bombshell in _Science_ in which she argued that the lack of recent warming was likely due to fluctuations in water vapor way up in the stratosphere — changes that bear no obvious relationship to greenhouse‐​gas emissions. Given the limited stratospheric data that we have going back to 1980, her finding reduces the remaining trend to 0.41 degrees Celsius.



In 2008, V. Ramanathan of the Scripps Institute of Oceanography summarized the scientific literature on the emissions of black carbon (aka “soot”) and concluded this was responsible for about 25 percent of global warming. Carbon particles are _not_ greenhouse gases. This drops the supposedly greenhouse‐​gas‐​caused warming to .31 degrees Celsius — 44 percent of the original 0.70.



Note that it’s not even necessary to bring in variations in the sun in order to ascribe more than half of the warming to non‐​greenhouse changes.



So, where are the studies refuting these findings? They don’t exist. The EPA is wrong. The IPCC was wrong, too, that it is “very likely” that “most” of the warming since 1950 is from greenhouse‐​gas changes. The EPA has lost the scientific linchpin of its proposal to regulate our lives.



While the president will surely brandish the El Niño–driven warmth of 2010 as the reason for the EPA to regulate where the Senate can no longer act, the EPA needs to accept that the “settled” science of global warming has shifted tectonically since the last IPCC report.

Europeans are wondering whatever happened to global warming. Climate institutes, who just years ago predicted warm, snow-less winters, have turned 180° and are now insisting that the Little Ice Age-like conditions that have gripped Europe over the last 5 years are actually signs of global warming after all! Fortunately, very few people believe them.
Not only has snow become more frequent in the winter, but now ski slopes in the French Pyrenees are reporting that they will be open for (snow) skiing in June – the first time in history the French Local here reports.
A combination of a icy winter and a chilly spring has meant that for the first time ever in the month of June, skiers will have the option of heading to the pistes in the French Pyrenees, French TV TF1 reported on Wednesday.”

Remember how super-computer climate models predicted snow being rare and would end much of the European ski industry? Precisely the opposite is happening (my emphasis):
The Pyrenees witnessed heavy snow falls throughout the winter that led to regular avalanche alerts being put in place and at point in the ski season stations had to close because there was too much snow.”
This is hilarious. A climate scientist just couldn’t be made to look more foolish. Well, take that back. They are making themselves look even more foolish: Now they are claiming that all the cold and snow is global warming!
The Local ends but offering a small ray of hope to once warm and sunny France and Spain: “…there is hope the sun might make an appearance in France in July and August.”

"**Rita Ora says she's ""deeply sorry"" for breaking English lockdown rules to celebrate her 30th birthday.**
The singer says she attended a party at a restaurant in west London on Saturday.
""Given the restrictions, I realise how irresponsible these actions were and I take full responsibility,"" she wrote in a statement.
It's reported up to 30 people were at the party, although she describes the event as a ""small gathering"".
She says it was a ""spur of the moment"" decision.
London's Metropolitan Police confirmed officers went to the Casa Cruz restaurant after a report about a potential breach of Covid lockdown regulations.
""I'm deeply sorry for breaking the rules and in turn understand that this puts people at risk,"" she posted.
""This was a serious and inexcusable error of judgement.""
Current lockdown regulations in England mean you can only meet one other person outside.
Pubs and restaurants are currently closed (although they can serve non-alcoholic takeaways) and you shouldn't be with people from outside your house or support bubbles indoors.
Police have the power to break up groups larger than six and those who ignore officers could be fined Â£100, doubling with each offence to a maximum of Â£3,200.
So far, the singer has not been fined.
Kensington and Chelsea Council, which is responsible for issuing Covid fines against businesses in the area, says it is still investigating what happened at Casa Cruz.
The singer's not the first high-profile public figure to admit breaching lockdown. In October, Chelsea striker Tammy Abraham apologised ""for the naivety shown"" in attending a party for his 23rd birthday.
In May, Manchester City's Kyle Walker wrote to the club's supporters after breaching coronavirus restrictions.

We’ve known for some time that the eco-minded tend to think that humans are a bad thing. For example, there’s the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement:

That’s no joke, it is a real organization. What follows is something I thought was just a  clever April Fools Joke, but sadly turns out to be only too real. So real in fact, it may be powerful enough to buzzkill all the effects of a Barry White album.


No, it isn’t an April fools joke. The website and the product is real, which you can see here.
They even have a distributor network, and unsurprisingly, the land of fruits and nuts is ground zero.

The caption for the polar bear wrapper reads:
POLAR BEAR 
An international icon of global warming, the polar bear is going extinct as the Arctic sea ice melts beneath its feet because of the greenhouse gas emissions of 7 billion people — especially those in high-consumption nations like the United States. The bear was put on the U.S. endangered species list in 2008.
Some of the other wrappers are hilarious here’s another:
DWARF SEAHORSE 
This inch-tall, curly-tailed fish occurs only in shallow seagrass areas in the Gulf of Mexico, along the Atlantic Coast of Florida and in the Caribbean. Unfortunately, as the Gulf gets more crowded and industrialized, this seahorse faces more threats to its existence. Widespread loss of seagrass habitat due to pollution, boat damage and global war.
Maybe we could get Josh to come up with some condom wrapper art for the climate skeptic movement.
I’m thinking of some slogans like:

Party like its 1999 (before GISS adjustments).
Hot times ahead – NOT!
My head just exploded! Romm bam, thank you ma’am!
The heat is missing, and it’s a travesty!
Use before hiding the decline

"Carbon emissions from a new coal-fired power station at Collinsville in north Queensland would be comparable to generators built in the state 15 to 20 years ago, according to sources familiar with the proponent’s submissions to the federal government. Guardian Australia has learned the company behind the proposal, Shine Energy, has held discussions about obtaining a concessional infrastructure loan from the federal government via the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility.  In February the government awarded Shine $4.4m to conduct a feasibility study. The grant was broadly considered a concession to pro-coal Queensland Nationals MPs. The new information about the proposal – obtained by sources with knowledge of Shine’s closely guarded business case and other information submitted to the federal government before it was awarded the feasibility study grant – casts doubt on key public claims about the environmental merit and commercial viability of a Collinsville plant. Shine said it could not respond to questions, claiming that details of its proposal were confidential. The company indicated that aspects of the project might have changed since it submitted documentation to the federal government but it would not provide any detail. The company has pitched its Collinsville coal proposal as having the potential to reduce carbon emissions by allowing the closure of higher-emitting power stations elsewhere in the state. But a lack of available water allocation at Collinsville poses a technical challenge for the financing, design and construction of any plant that would emit a lower proportion of carbon, compared with the last generation of coal plants built in Queensland – which has the newest fleet in Australia. Shine has submitted information that shows that by using a dry-cooling system the plant’s emissions intensity would be comparable to the last two plants built in Queensland – Kogan Creek, commissioned in 2007, and Millmerran, commissioned in 2002. Both produce emissions at a rate slightly above .80 tonnes of carbon dioxide per megawatt hour. Sources say Shine’s studies identified it could pollute about 10% to 15% less carbon dioxide if it built a plant with a wet-cooling system, which requires large volumes of water. Plans to build a large dam at the nearby Urannah Creek have been touted as a way to supply water to heavy industry, including a coal-fired power station. But while the Urannah Dam is backed by many of the same political and business interests as the proposed power station, it is bitterly opposed by local Indigenous traditional owners, including Shine Energy and some of its directors. The Shine Energy chief executive, Ash Dodd, told Guardian Australia in February that the power generator proposal would not rely on the Urannah Dam. “We as Birri and Widi traditional owners stand opposed to the [Urannah Dam] project as it will have a major environmental impact on our sacred rivers and all water rights belong to our people.” Richie Merzian, the climate and energy director at the Australia Institute, said the federal government had spent $1.3bn attempting to improve the emissions intensity of coal since 2003. “It is damning that the best technology they can find now has the same emissions intensity as plants built 15 years ago,” Merzian said. “If the best they can do is build another plant like Kogan Creek, it will do little for reliability, given this plant is the most unreliable on the grid per unit of energy.” Dodd has raised the prospect that Collinsville could allow for the closure older, dirtier plants, including the privately operated Gladstone power station (.95 tonnes CO2 per MWh), though the Queensland government is firmly opposed to that suggestion and Gladstone has commercial energy supply contracts running until 2029. The state’s opposition to the Collinsville plant could also prove problematic for Shine in its efforts to obtain finance. In interviews, Dodd has said the company has held discussions with overseas-based investors and would apply for Naif financing. Guardian Australia understands Shine is pursuing a concessional federal loan from the Naif program, which it expects could then catalyse additional interest from private investors. The Queensland government holds an effective veto over any Naif loan to a project in the state. A Naif spokesman said it “cannot comment on whether or not it has been approached by particular entities in respect of particular projects”. Shine Energy’s shares are worth $1,000 on paper and the company will require about $2bn in outside financing to build the power generator. In addition to seeking Naif funding, Shine has applied for federal government underwriting against potential future losses. It was not named among shortlisted projects for a federal energy underwriting program. Energy sector analysts say the extent to which Shine has asked for government subsidy should dismiss outright any suggestion that a coal-fired power station at Collinsville could be independently viable. “Large subsidies are the only way they can get it up and running,” said Tim Buckley, the director of energy finance studies at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. “It’s a project that’s entirely unbankable by any private financier. It’s 100% an ideological exercise, there’s no commercial viability.” Shine’s director of marketing and communications, Kelli Cohen, warned Guardian Australia against printing “inaccurate information” but said the company “can not respond” to any aspect of this story due to commercial confidentiality. This is despite Dodd previously speaking about emissions intensity, potential funding sources, government subsidies and other technical details in interviews on Sky News. “You have not been given an up to date project brief from your source,” Cohen said. Shine did not respond to subsequent attempts to clarify what details might have changed."

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhy is CO2 Rising – Part 2
By Ed Caryl
How much biosphere has been destroyed? Deforestation is a large loss to the biosphere. From Wikipedia:
Global deforestation[92] sharply accelerated around 1852.[93][94] It has been estimated that about half of the Earth’s mature tropical forests—between 7.5 million and 8 million km2 (2.9 million to 3 million sq. mi.) of the original 15 million to 16 million km2 (5.8 million to 6.2 million sq. mi.) that until 1947 covered the planet[95]—have now been destroyed [2][96].”

 
In the 24 years from 1988 to 2012, Brazil alone destroyed 400,000 square kilometers of Amazon rainforest, though that estimate may be low. The good news is that this forest loss has now subsided from over 26,000 sq. kilometers in 2004, to a mere 5000 or so sq. kilometers last year. The forest burners have now moved to Indonesia to make room for oil palms for “green” energy.
The estimate is that 500 million metric tonnes of carbon each year are released into the atmosphere from the Amazon alone from slash fires and decomposition of slash piles. (Slash: The leftover stumps, limbs, and other waste from forest clearing, including selective logging waste.) The Amazon is half of the tropical rain forest. Each hectare of intact Amazonian rain forest contains 190 metric tonnes of carbon, so that 500 million tonnes represents 26,300 square kilometers of forest, the amount destroyed in 2004, so the figures match.

500 million tonnes represents about half the tropical rain forest destroyed, so the total tropical forest annual destruction may be 1 gigatonne of carbon. Russia destroys about as much temperate forest as Brazil does tropical forest, and Russia represents about half the temperate forest destroyed per year. The total is the 2 gigatonnes of carbon each year that is mentioned on the NOAA chart as “land use changes”.
The problem with destroying forest to convert the area to some other use, is that forest soils, whether tropical or temperate, are very poor. Amazonian rain forest soils, when cleared, typically can grow a crop for a year or two, if the burned vegetation ash is returned to the ground. when the forest is removed erosion can wash away the thin topsoil, further depleting fertility. Then the best use of the ground is as cattle pasture, but then the soil turns into a hard, compacted laterite clay surface that cannot be plowed. Reversion to forest is very slow if it happens at all. After 25 years, the average carbon content of soil and above surface vegetation is about 26 metric tonnes per hectare, about 14% of the original carbon. Details here. A tropical forest destroyed is destroyed for a very long time.
The problem with this subject is that there is little accurate data on how much forest is being destroyed per year. The overall uncertainty is a factor of two. Is the contribution to annual carbon emissions 10% or 20% of the total? Oh, and who is doing the cutting? The mafia (or similar), pirates, organized crime. Now think about oil palms, government subsidies…
In the long term, forest destruction has two impacts on the biosphere: It emits a large fraction of the total carbon emitted, and that area destroyed no longer contributes very much to carbon sequestration.

I return to the Wikipedia quote above. If half the primary forest on earth has been lost, then the 120 gigatonnes carbon on that diagram above is changing over time. If that 120 gigatonnes of carbon returning to vegetation has been shrinking by two percent per year, that would account for all the increase in carbon dioxide in the last 50 years. The good news is that it is possible to turn that situation around very quickly with improved forest management, law enforcement, and replanting.

Share this...FacebookTwitterJust how radical has the environmental movement become in Germany?
Well, to give you an idea, Germany’s Umweltbundesamt (Federal Environment Agency), or UBA, which is Germany’s version of the EPA, recently issued a 122-page pamphlet that fiercely defended the alarmists predictions of catastrophic global warming, and used harsh tactics to pillory skeptic US and German journalists and scientists. Read background here and here.

This 123-page pamphlet released by the German Federal Environment Agency (UBA) was written by authors who “have made themselves religious warriors” says German flagship business magazine WirtschaftsWoche. 
But since then, this form of raw, brute state intimidation has been met with harsh reactions from parts of the media, from the right, centre and left.
The latest harsh reaction comes from leading German business and financial magazine WirtschaftsWoche. The article concludes that the UBA has lost its objectivity and have become overzealous.
“Authors have made themselves religious warriors”
The winter and spring of 2013 have been unusually cold; the last 5 winters have been colder than normal, and so it is only natural that people are wondering if the global warming apocalypse is real after all. WirtschaftsWoche writes (my emphasis):
The Federal Environment Agency (UBA) and its President Jochen Flasbarth would like to prevent that question from leading to any doubt. […] In a targeted manner the UBA-authors are insinuating that skeptics, among them science journalists Michael Miersch of ‘Focus’ and Dirk Maxeiner, are either clueless or cozy with the fossil fuel industry. […]

The approach reveals that the issue is now being discussed ideologically instead of scientifically. Instead of being objective, the UBA authors have made themselves religious warriors.”
Another term for religious warrior could be “crusader”, or “jihadist” as in green jihadist. Whatever you choose, infidels like Maxeiner and Miersch are no longer to be tolerated in Germany under Angela Merkel, Peter Altmaier and Jochen Flasbarth. Maxeiner and Miersch, like the US and German scientists listed in the pamphlet, are today official targets of German state persecution.
Wirtschaftswoche also agrees that apparently the climate issue is indeed far from being settled after all, and openly wonders how the German state could think otherwise.
Much within the complex climate subject is still insufficiently understood by the scientists. Admitting that would enhance credibility. But instead of doing that, the UBA pamphlet suggests there is already certainty.The number of studies that are distancing themselves from the original IPCC horror scenarios are piling up.”
TAZ blogger: UBA “has lost every justification for existence”
Not only have major centre-right and centre-left media outlets blasted the UBA’s heavy-handed, one-sided tactics, but so has even a blogger from the very leftist TAZ daily. TAZ blogger Detlef Guertler posted at his site:
‘I understand this pamphlet to be an application to dissolve the Federal Environment Agency’, I wrote yesterday. And: ‘It’s frightening that the Federal Environment Agency has taken over the deplorable habit of Rahmstorfian black lists. Sinister effort.’ A federal agency that denounces single journalists as heretics of the ‘state of knowledge of climate science’ … has lost every justification for existence.”
Guertler feels so strongly about the UBA’s renegade tactics that he confessed agreeing with Henryk Broder’s characterization of the UBA as the Bundesklimakammer (Federal Climate Chamber).

Share this...FacebookTwitterA few days ago Switzerland’s flagship daily the NZZ also commented on the Otto et al paper, which indicates CO2 climate sensitivity was over-estimated and that the worst-case scenarios very likely aren’t going to take place.

Otto et al is just more hard evidence showing earlier models completely miss the barn. Chart source: www.drroyspencer.com.
What we are noticing from the NZZ article is that overall alarmism in Europe is diminishing, fast, even in the media. The title of the NZZ piece is: “Climate is reacting less sensitive to CO2 than thought“.
Recall that some alarmist scientists are still desperately insisting the climate catastrophe is coming, and that it’s just going to take a little longer to get here – like during our great-granchildren’s lifetime. But journalists in Europe are slowly waking up to all the wolf-crying. The cryers of wolf are looking more and more like the town fools. The more people walk away and stop listening to them, the shriller they get.
The report starts by explaining to readers what is meant by CO2 sensitivity, and then tells us the study’s new results:

In a new study on climate sensitivity, the authors ended up with comparably lower values: Their estimated central value is near 2°C of warming, a third less than the UN report.¹ However, the uncertainty is also large in the new study.”
The NZZ also tells readers that the Otto et al study is not just some isolated paper that is bucking a consensus of high CO2 sensitivity, but is “the latest in a number of papers” showing that the prognoses of global warming have been exaggerated. The NZZ quotes climate scientist Andreas Schmittner von der Oregon State University, who said that “most studies of last years have shown a somewhat lesser climate sensitivity“.
What’s more, the NZZ looks at the Transient Climate Response (TCR), which indicates how much the air will warm up by the time CO2 doubles. Here the NZZ writes that the authors project a short term climate reaction of 1.3°C above pre-industrial levels. “That’s 0.5°C warming from today“. The NZZ writes:
Several other recent studies had indicated an over-estimation. With the latest study, this finding is further solidified.”
Another point that the NZZ brings up is that the new study was not able to reduce uncertainty.
Looking at the above figure, one thing is certain: the observations so far show that all the models have been exaggerating and that even Otto et al’s newest estimation is likely to be an exaggeration itself.

From NCAR/UCAR, they’re still trying to stamp out solar influence as a potential cause of the Little Ice Age. One of the things I wonder about is that during low sunspot activity, does the reduced solar-magnetic influence have any effect on Earth’s plate tectoncs and vulcanism? Does a reduced solar-magnetic influence prompt more volcanism? We may get the answer to this question in the coming years as the Ap solar-geomagnetic activity index is at an all-time low in the records.

Study may answer longstanding questions about Little Ice Age
January 30, 2012

BOULDER — A new international study may answer contentious questions about the onset and persistence of Earth’s Little Ice Age, a period of widespread cooling that lasted for hundreds of years until the late 19th century.
Gifford Miller collects vegetation samples on Baffin Island. (Photo courtesy University of Colorado Boulder.)
The study, led by the University of Colorado Boulder with co-authors at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and other organizations, suggests that an unusual, 50-year-long episode of four massive tropical volcanic eruptions triggered the Little Ice Age between 1275 and 1300 A.D. The persistence of cold summers following the eruptions is best explained by a subsequent expansion of sea ice and a related weakening of Atlantic currents, according to computer simulations conducted for the study.
The study, which used analyses of patterns of dead vegetation, ice and sediment core data, and powerful computer climate models, provides new evidence in a longstanding scientific debate over the onset of the Little Ice Age. Scientists have theorized that the Little Ice Age was caused by decreased summer solar radiation, erupting volcanoes that cooled the planet by ejecting sulfates and other aerosol particles that reflected sunlight back into space, or a combination of the two. 
“This is the first time anyone has clearly identified the specific onset of the cold times marking the start of the Little Ice Age,” says lead author Gifford Miller of the University of Colorado Boulder. “We also have provided an understandable climate feedback system that explains how this cold period could be sustained for a long period of time. If the climate system is hit again and again by cold conditions over a relatively short period—in this case, from volcanic eruptions—there appears to be a cumulative cooling effect.”
“Our simulations showed that the volcanic eruptions may have had a profound cooling effect,” says NCAR scientist Bette Otto-Bliesner, a co-author of the study. “The eruptions could have triggered a chain reaction, affecting sea ice and ocean currents in a way that lowered temperatures for centuries.”
The study appears this week in Geophysical Research Letters. The research team includes co-authors from the University of Iceland, the University of California Irvine, and the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. The study was funded in part by the National Science Foundation, NCAR’s sponsor, and the Icelandic Science Foundation.
Far-flung regions of ice
Scientific estimates regarding the onset of the Little Ice Age range from the 13th century to the 16th century, but there is little consensus, Miller says. Although the cooling temperatures may have affected places as far away as South America and China, they were particularly evident in northern Europe. Advancing glaciers in mountain valleys destroyed towns, and paintings from the period depict people ice-skating on the Thames River in London and canals in the Netherlands, places that were ice-free before and after the Little Ice Age.
“The dominant way scientists have defined the Little Ice Age is by the expansion of big valley glaciers in the Alps and in Norway,” says Miller, a fellow at CU’s Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research. “But the time in which European glaciers advanced far enough to demolish villages would have been long after the onset of the cold period.”
Miller and his colleagues radiocarbon-dated roughly 150 samples of dead plant material with roots intact, collected from beneath receding margins of ice caps on Baffin Island in the Canadian Arctic. They found a large cluster of “kill dates” between 1275 and 1300 A.D., indicating the plants had been frozen and engulfed by ice during a relatively sudden event.
The team saw a second spike in plant kill dates at about 1450 A.D., indicating the quick onset of a second major cooling event.
To broaden the study, the researchers analyzed sediment cores from a glacial lake linked to the 367-square-mile Langjökull ice cap in the central highlands of Iceland that reaches nearly a mile high. The annual layers in the cores—which can be reliably dated by using tephra deposits from known historic volcanic eruptions on Iceland going back more than 1,000 years—suddenly became thicker in the late 13th century and again in the 15th century due to increased erosion caused by the expansion of the ice cap as the climate cooled.
“That showed us the signal we got from Baffin Island was not just a local signal, it was a North Atlantic signal,” Miller says. “This gave us a great deal more confidence that there was a major perturbation to the Northern Hemisphere climate near the end of the 13th century.”
The team used the Community Climate System Model, which was developed by scientists at NCAR and the Department of Energy with colleagues at other organizations, to test the effects of volcanic cooling on Arctic sea ice extent and mass. The model, which simulated various sea ice conditions from about 1150 to 1700 A.D., showed several large, closely spaced eruptions could have cooled the Northern Hemisphere enough to trigger the expansion of Arctic sea ice.
The model showed that sustained cooling from volcanoes would have sent some of the expanding Arctic sea ice down along the eastern coast of Greenland until it eventually melted in the North Atlantic. Since sea ice contains almost no salt, when it melted the surface water became less dense, preventing it from mixing with deeper North Atlantic water. This weakened heat transport back to the Arctic and created a self-sustaining feedback on the sea ice long after the effects of the volcanic aerosols subsided, according to the simulations.
The researchers set solar radiation at a constant level in the climate models. The simulations indicated that the Little Ice Age likely would have occurred without decreased summer solar radiation at the time, Miller says.

Northern Hemisphere summer temperatures over the past 8000 years have been paced by the slow decrease in summer insolation resulting from the precession of the equinoxes. However, the causes of superposed century-scale cold summer anomalies, of which the Little Ice Age (LIA) is the most extreme, remain debated, largely because the natural forcings are either weak or, in the case of volcanism, short lived. Here we present precisely dated records of ice-cap growth from Arctic Canada and Iceland showing that LIA summer cold and ice growth began abruptly between 1275 and 1300 AD, followed by a substantial intensification 1430-1455 AD. Intervals of sudden ice growth coincide with two of the most volcanically perturbed half centuries of the past millennium. A transient climate model simulation shows that explosive volcanism produces abrupt summer cooling at these times, and that cold summers can be maintained by sea-ice/ocean feedbacks long after volcanic aerosols are removed. Our results suggest that the onset of the LIA can be linked to an unusual 50-year-long episode with four large sulfur-rich explosive eruptions, each with global sulfate loading >60 Tg. The persistence of cold summers is best explained by consequent sea-ice/ocean feedbacks during a hemispheric summer insolation minimum; large changes in solar irradiance are not required.

Is Scott Morrison handing out half a billion dollars in “go-away” money? Or buying Pacific loyalty?



Of course, it would impolite to tell the blunt truth these days. Instead, it’s being diplomatically described as “climate change funding”.



Scott Morrison will announce $500 million in climate change ­funding when he meets regional leaders in Tuvalu this week, in a bid to rescue his Pacific “step-up” from mounting anger over Australia’s domestic emissions policies.



The funding will be used to protect communities and infrastructure from rising seas and wor­sening storms, help nations ­recover after natural disasters and ensure local health services are better equipped to respond to changing needs.



Of course, it definitely **won’t** be used to buy any [fleets of luxury cars](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/16/first-maseratis-now-bentleys-for-apec-in-papua-new-guinea) for elites flying in for regional junkets.



The Prime Minister, who ­arrives in Tuvalu tomorrow for the Pacific Islands Forum, is facing a growing backlash from Pacific ­nations over emissions, with Fiji Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama yesterday branding climate change an “existential threat” to island nations and urging a rapid end to Australia’s reliance on coal.



His comments followed those of Tuvalu Prime Minister Enele Sopoaga on Sunday, who warned Mr Morrison’s standing among Pacific leaders was on the line over the climate change issue. But Mr Morrison said Australia was working to address its own emissions and would work with Pacific nations to help them cope with the impacts of global warming.



Australia’s emissions are nine-tenths of sod-all. We could completely cease all emissions tomorrow and it won’t make a jot of difference to the global climate, let alone sea levels. If Pacific nations were **really** worried about such things, they should be bullying China, India and the US. But they know perfectly well what the answer from the really big emitters will be. Far easier to morally blackmail Australia.



After all, it’s not like we’re not already throwing away money, hand over fist, on delusional green scams.



“The fact Australia leads the world in per capita investment in clean energy, we have the world’s most successful green bank in the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and that we’re on track to have around a quarter of our electricity needs met by renewables by 2020, all underscores the work underway to reduce our global emissions.”



But, more than anything, this is really about the realities of geopolitics rather than catastrophist fantasies about climate change.



The Pacific “step-up” is one of the Prime Minister’s key priorities amid rising Chinese influence in the region and calls from the US for Australia to play a “great power leadership role” in its strategic backyard.



In other words, Australia is trying to buy Pacific nations’ loyalties before the Chinese do. While it’s a sensible strategy for Australia, it’s also a nice little earner for the Pacific: all they have to do is sit back and watch the big guys throw money at them.

"The last few surviving Asiatic cheetahs live in Iran, where they stalk the hyper-arid landscape, where temperatures swing from -30°C to 50°C. This is the only place in the world a cheetah, most of which live in Africa, will experience snow. Iran is home to the last known population of Asiatic cheetah, a creature which once roamed across vast ranges of west and south Asian countries, from the Middle East to India. Today, the cheetahs are known only from around 15 reserves in Iran, all officially protected by the country’s government. Together with genetic distinctiveness from their African cousins, the Asiatic cheetahs are smaller and more slightly built. Iranian biologists were surprised to learn that the Asiatic cheetahs are mainly found in mountainous regions – a very different proposition from the view expected from wildlife documentaries in which cheetahs pursue sprinting gazelles across open plains.  Camera traps are reliable tools to try to gauge the population of these spotted cats, whose markings are individually unique. However, this technology has been rarely applied to cheetahs across their global range due to the paucity of individuals and their elusive nature. Due to political sanctions, the necessary equipment is not easily available in Iran, and this has prevented a thorough assessment of the species in the past.  Thanks to various donors and partners, including Panthera and Dutch NGO Stichting SPOTS, a monitoring program was recently launched that would fill the gaps in our knowledge about the cheetah that is essential for its protection. Even so the results were surprising, revealing only 40 to 70 cheetahs across the country – smaller even than previous estimates of up to 100. Listed as critically endangered by the IUCN, the Asiatic cheetah is among the rarest cats in the world at subspecies level, after the Amur leopard.  Around 125 game guards protect the cheetah’s range in Iran as Cheetah Guardians, thanks to tremendous efforts of the Conservation of Asiatic Cheetah Project (CACP), the Iranian Department of the Environment (DoE), and UNDP in Iran, which tried to double the number of guards employed by the DoE during the past decade. Equipped with 4WD vehicles and motorbikes, each guard is responsible for protecting around 640km2 of the landscape, an indication that more forces are needed. In order to safeguard the cheetahs, the DoE established more reserves while existing reserves received more resources. In the Iran’s northeast Miandasht Wildlife Refuge has been a key site for the cheetahs after a threefold boom in prey species. As a result, the cheetahs have established a breeding population there, vital to help re-colonise other reserves. As is the case for many wildlife species, the cheetah was little known among the public ten years ago. But with the animals’ plight appealing to the media it has garnered considerable coverage, leaving the public in no doubt about the state of the cheetah’s decline. With united effort from government and NGOs, this year the cheetah even became the first species to appear emblazoned on the Iranian national football team’s jersey during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. So as a symbol of the nation’s wildlife, the public awareness and support the cheetah receives is an important step to ensure its long-term survival. But it is not enough. It is vital to build an expert opinion on what to do about the species’ critically small population, rising mortality from human causes, such as traffic collisions, and falling birth rates.  While further research is needed, we know that Asiatic cheetahs have much lower genetic diversity than African cheetahs, but we are still hopeful that better connectivity between the various reserves to allow cheetahs to intermingle could maintain a basic level of gene flow between small cheetah populations.  We need the authorities to confront and defeat plans for property development and infrastructure such as roads, mines and railways within the main cheetah reserves. For example, a road to be constructed through Bafq Protected Area in central Iran was a major concern, but the DoE managed to stop construction and propose an alternative route. Cheetahs are known to kill small livestock, and claims of cheetahs killing young camel, sheep, and goat are rife among shepherds. Recent cases in different parts of the country have raised concerns that cheetahs could be killed by protective herders. At least five have been known to be killed by herders since 2010, twice the number killed in the previous decade. To try to prevent this, the Iranian Department of Environment and CACP established a programme to compensate for cheetah predation for five years. On August 31 1994 a cheetah was rescued from dying of thirst in central Iran. Named Marita, for nearly ten years she was the only evidence of the existence of cheetahs outside Africa. In 2007, the Iranian Cheetah Society (ICS) designated August 31 as National Cheetah Day, an annual event to draw people’s attention to conservation issues in Iran. The cheetah is lucky to have a day bearing its name, but to survive they will need much more than luck."

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’m late this time around with meteorologist Joe Bastardi’s Saturday Summary (4/20). If you haven’t seen it, then do take the few minutes to do so. He has a short outlook for the coming years.
He starts by showing the global temperature for the last 4 years: “…you can see the fall that is occurring; it’s very plain to see“.

 Snapshot of Joe Bastardi’s Saturday Summary (4/20).
Of course four years do not make a trend. But they do come after 11 years of stagnation. After 11 years of no warming, one would think the warming would finally resume. Instead just the opposite has occurred – and it has been cooling amazingly fast (almost 0.4°C) – thus completely defying the models. Boy, the oceans must have one big appetite!
If the last four years had seen warming, all the alarmists would be jumping up and down right now, hollering that global warming has resumed and that we’re all doomed.

Bastardi:
I’ve seen some outrageous statements being made lately, just simply denying the facts that the previous 12, 13 years have been level. And now you see it falling off. This is because the Pacific Decadal Oscillation has flipped. Though there are much more important things facing our country today, and facing the globe in general, this issue has really been blown out of proportion compared to the importance of some other things. In my opinion, even though I’m involved in it, you might think: ‘You get a lot of attention, why are you trying to downplay it?’ Because it’s a joke! Alright, the global temperatures respond to the sun, the ocean, the large-scale drivers, and not to the other things.
If you just watch as an objective person, if you watch over the coming years, you’ll see this trend continue. Just like you can’t deny it was going up when the oceans were warming up in the 80s – from the very cold levels of the 60s and 70s – you can’t deny that it’s going down now.”
Are Rob Honeycutt and his buddy Dana listening?
Last I heard is that they’ve turned to blaming the oceans for eating up all the lost warming. Unfortunately for them, the bet was on RSS and UAH trends, and not the temperature down somewhere in the ocean depths.
They shouldn’t take it too hard, though, because it’s for charity. And besides, it should come to them as a relief that the world isn’t going to burn up like they thought (or hoped?) it would.

"Denial never dies; it just goes quiet and waits. Today, after years of irrelevance, the climate science deniers are triumphant. Long after their last, desperate claims had collapsed, when they had traction only on “alt-right” conspiracy sites, a hero of the left turns up and gives them more than they could have dreamed of. Planet of the Humans, whose executive producer and chief promoter is Michael Moore, now has more than 6 million views on YouTube. The film does not deny climate science. But it promotes the discredited myths that deniers have used for years to justify their position. It claims that environmentalism is a self-seeking scam, doing immense harm to the living world while enriching a group of con artists. This has long been the most effective means by which denial – most of which has been funded by the fossil fuel industry – has been spread. Everyone hates a scammer. And yes, there are scammers. There are real issues and real conflicts to be explored in seeking to prevent the collapse of our life support systems. But they are handled so clumsily and incoherently by this film that watching it is like seeing someone start a drunken brawl over a spilled pint, then lamping his friends when they try to restrain him. It stumbles so blindly into toxic issues that Moore, former champion of the underdog, unwittingly aligns himself with white supremacists and the extreme right. Occasionally, the film lands a punch on the right nose. It is right to attack the burning of trees to make electricity. But when the film’s presenter and director, Jeff Gibbs, claims, “I found only one environmental leader willing to reject biomass and biofuels”, he can’t have been looking very far. Some people have been speaking out against them ever since they became a serious proposition (since 2004 in my case). Almost every environmental leader I know opposes the burning of fresh materials to generate power. There are also some genuine and difficult problems with renewable energy, particularly the mining of the necessary materials. But the film’s attacks on solar and wind power rely on a series of blatant falsehoods. It claims that, in producing electricity from renewables, “You use more fossil fuels to do this than you’re getting benefit from it. You would have been better off just burning fossil fuels in the first place”. This is flat wrong. On average, a solar panel generates 26 units of solar energy for every unit of fossil energy required to build and install it. For wind turbines the ratio is 44 to one. Planet of the Humans also claims that you can’t reduce fossil fuel use through renewable energy: coal is instead being replaced by gas. Well, in the third quarter of 2019, renewables in the UK generated more electricity than coal, oil and gas plants put together. As a result of the switch to renewables in this country, the amount of fossil fuel used for power generation has halved since 2010. By 2025, the government forecasts, roughly half our electricity will come from renewables, while gas burning will drop by a further 40%. To hammer home its point, the film shows footage of a “large terminal to import natural gas from the United States” that “Germany just built”. Germany has no such terminal. The footage was shot in Turkey. There is also a real story to be told about the co-option and capture of some environmental groups by the industries they should hold to account. A remarkable number of large conservation organisations take money from fossil fuel companies. This is a disgrace. But rather than pinning the blame where it lies, Planet of the Humans concentrates its attacks on Bill McKibben, the co-founder of 350.org, who takes no money from any of his campaigning work. It’s an almost comic exercise in misdirection, but unfortunately it has horrible, real-world consequences, as McKibben now faces even more threats and attacks than he confronted before. But this is by no means the worst of it. The film offers only one concrete solution to our predicament: the most toxic of all possible answers. “We really have got to start dealing with the issue of population … without seeing some sort of major die-off in population, there’s no turning back.” Yes, population growth does contribute to the pressures on the natural world. But while the global population is rising by 1% a year, consumption, until the pandemic, was rising at a steady 3%. High consumption is concentrated in countries where population growth is low. Where population growth is highest, consumption tends to be extremely low. Almost all the growth in numbers is in poor countries largely inhabited by black and brown people. When wealthy people, such as Moore and Gibbs, point to this issue without the necessary caveats, they are saying, in effect, “it’s not Us consuming, it’s Them breeding.” It’s not hard to see why the far right loves this film. Population is where you go when you haven’t thought your argument through. Population is where you go when you don’t have the guts to face the structural, systemic causes of our predicament: inequality, oligarchic power, capitalism. Population is where you go when you want to kick down. We have been here many times before. Dozens of films have spread falsehoods about environmental activists and ripped into green technologies, while letting fossil fuels off the hook. But never before have these attacks come from a famous campaigner for social justice, rubbing our faces in the dirt. • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"

The left claim that the science is settled when it comes to climate change. Well, a case can be made that the research on guns is pretty much settled too, which is why a gun register and background checks won’t work for Ardern’s government.



The changes to the Arms Act proposed by the government are essentially toughening up vetting: in other words, background checks. Background checks don’t work. The problem overseas lies in **enforcement** , which is the same problem that we already have here in New Zealand.



Basically, the police are really hopeless at enforcement.



The research clearly shows that our existing system for licensing is actually best practice, and shouldn’t be messed with.



  
“One possible explanation for why gun licensing works better than background checks: It’s a more straightforward system.  
“It’s far easier as a seller to say, ’Okay, I need to see your permit,’” Crifasi suggested. “And there’s accountability. If my gun is recovered in the hands of someone else, and I’m in a state with licensing, and that person doesn’t have a license, it’s easier to hold me accountable. I can’t say, ‘Oh, sure, I asked for a license,’ because they don’t have a license.“

What our world could be like. Green, no climate disruption, non threatening weather, and most importantly, clean air!
People send me stuff. We’ve spent so much time on Climategate that other more important things have fallen by the wayside. We’ve seen a lot of claims on how green technology will reduce emissions and save the Earth. Often these claims are met with scorn and derision because some of them are just junk ideas as they just don’t deliver on the claims. Windpower, for example.
But every once in awhile something comes along that singularly stands out and deserves special attention because it is so unique, so “outside of the box” thinking, that is truly transcends any doubt or ridicule. It is truly the personification of state of the art green technology.
This simple accessory added to any vehicle offers an improvement on automobile fuel economy of 20% or more. Just think, if everyone in America and the EU installed one of these how much faster emission reduction targets could be met.

Spare a thought for Prince Harry. By all accounts he is finding it difficult to get out of bed in the mornings, due to “eco‐​anxiety.” The _Sun_ reports from Botswana that he believes “everything is good in the world except for us humans.” He’s not the only one struggling. At the UN recently, Greta Thunberg was visibly shaken as she denounced the people who had stolen her dreams of a cooler world with “fairytales of eternal economic growth.”



In case it wasn’t clear before, more radical parts of the “green movement” hold a consistent preconception: that human beings and our innate desire for betterment are _the problem_ where environmental issues are concerned. We are destroying the planet, devouring its finite resources through selfish fertility and consumption decisions, while pumping greenhouse gases into its atmosphere. “A plague on the earth,” is how David Attenborough once kindly described us.



The high priest of this worldview was Paul Ehrlich, who coined the oft‐​repeated assertion that “you can’t go on growing forever on a finite planet.” Prince Charles agrees. Earth simply can’t sustain us if more and more people aspire to Western consumption levels, he says. To save the planet therefore requires curbing population growth, rowing back substantially on consumption (so‐​called degrowth), or both. Little surprise then that contemporary climate change “solutions” from radical environmentalists include economically destructive, rapid carbon mitigation (“Bring on the recession!” as George Monbiot once said) or curbing global population growth.



Yet there’s a big problem here: Ehrlich and Prince Charles’ analysis was and is wrong. Population growth doesn’t “use up” the earth’s finite resources and economic growth possibilities are not finite. That’s because technologies and human ideas are not fixed. Resource constraint worriers ignore that humans adapt, dream up efficiencies, and change behaviours. As countries become much richer, they become better placed, and more willing to, care for the environment. Even on climate change, a classic “externality” problem, it is the same innovative spirit that drives economic progress that will deliver any transition or adaptation to a lower carbon economy and warmer world.



Consider the evidence. If growth in population or consumption were simply about running down scarce resources, we’d expect commodity prices to continuously rise with population or economic growth. Yet from 1980 to 2017, when the world’s population shot up by nearly 70 per cent, prices of a basket of 50 important commodities actually fell by an average of 36 per cent (or 65 per cent, if instead you consider the reduction in time an average human had to work to purchase them).



Population and consumption growth might put pressure on resource availability for any given level of technology or set of demands. But human innovation means, over time, we devise _better_ ideas and forms of technology to access or convert those resources, or shift to other alternatives when prices rise. In the race between the human brain and resource scarcity, we are winning. As my colleague Marian Tupy has said: “the Earth’s atoms may be fixed, but the possible combinations of those atoms are infinite.”



As counterintuitive as it sounds, that same innovation means economic growth doesn’t necessitate more and more resource use either. Greens think of growth as about consuming “stuff.” And for good reason: during and after the industrial revolution, GDP growth really did go hand in hand with energy use growth. But in a service and high productivity world, production and value clearly arises from doing more with less too. The iPhone in your pocket has replaced a clock, diaries, calendars, letters, calculators, photo albums, large telephones, trips to the bank, compasses, a contact book, and much else. Think of all the resources saved! No wonder Ronald Reagan once said “there are no such things as limits to growth, because there are no limits to the human capacity for intelligence, imagination and wonder.”



Again, the distinction between a static and dynamic world is crucial when considering the environmental impact of this. As Tim Harford explains, if we were all suddenly a fair bit poorer, we’d probably substitute a hat and coat for heating in our homes. But this doesn’t mean that if our incomes trebled over the next five decades, we’d crank up the heating and boil ourselves in our homes. In fact, as we’ve got richer over the last quarter of a century, total energy use per person has actually been falling in countries such as the US and UK, even beyond that accounted for by offshoring of manufacturing.



This is one good example of how economic growth helps shift us up the hierarchy of needs. As advanced countries have solved problems of food, warmth, and shelter, people can afford to worry more about the natural world around them more broadly too. Recent global growth has gone hand‐​in‐​hand with the forested area of the planet increasing since 1982 and a continuous fall in fertility, in part because wealthier people want to invest more in the “quality” of their children.



In this light, Prince Harry and Greta’s eco‐​anxiety is a clear sign of privilege. Neither is having to scramble to illegally chop trees for money to survive, overhunt wild animals as a source of a nutritious diet, or spend half their adult lives pregnant to ensure at least a couple of their kids survive. Many around the world aren’t so lucky, or comfortable enough to put the environment first. A UN poll of 10 million people around the globe showed far more worry about their educational opportunities or whether their kids are starving or dying from disease.



Once you understand this: what growth is, how it is driven by human innovation, and what consequences it has, you see how futile and damaging an “anti‐​human” approach to global climate change would be. Drastic mitigation would condemn much of humanity to poorer lives, making us worse environmental stewards in other regards and facing much worse consequences of any warming that occurs. Authoritarian population controls would backfire too, reducing the potential market and payoffs for innovators developing climate change remedies in everything from electric cars to solar panels.



No, the only sustainable, credible route to reducing carbon emissions and adapting to warming will come precisely from the sorts of innovation driving the “fairytales” Thunberg bemoans. Acknowledging this does not preclude modest, economically reasonable policies, such as R&D investments, or even a degree of carbon pricing, to speed up and incentivise innovation and entrepreneurship on low carbon climate solutions. What it does rule out is drastically rowing back on our activities, freedoms, or desires for children.



If Prince Harry is to regain his morning sprightliness, he’ll have to find more faith in economic growth and innovation to the challenges that face us. Human ingenuity, far from being a burden, is the world’s most important resource.

"The electric car trend is still to take off in the UK, with drivers largely put off by up-front costs, according to a survey by the Department for Transport. A measly 5% of respondents were thinking about buying an electric car or van, and only a fifth of them were considering doing so in the near future. Just 0.3% already owned an electric vehicle meaning that, at best, there are a little over one in 20 people who have any interest at all in owning an electric car. In contrast, 14% had contemplated buying a car or van but decided against it, while the most damning statistic is that over half, 56%, had not even thought about the possibility of going electric. There are areas where electric vehicles have established themselves as part of everyday life. There are few more British sights than the electric milk float going about its door-to-door deliveries at the crack of dawn. There are also many successful industrial applications of electric vehicles, such as fork lift trucks or pallet moving vehicles. The reason these applications have had traction is that there is an identifiable niche that the electric powered vehicle option fulfils better than conventional engines. The milk delivery benefits from a quiet electric engine which doesn’t wake up the snoozing masses. Similarly, regulations and health and safety concerns makes electric engines a better choice than petrol and diesel in factories. But for the general public, electric vehicles seem irrelevant. Up to three quarters of the electric cars and vans on the road in the UK are run by businesses and local authorities in fleets, where they can play a major role in meeting emissions targets and improving operating costs. Despite this, electric vehicle sales are often claimed as “record breaking” and at an “all-time-highs” in Britain. Unsurprising, since they are coming from such a low base. Indeed, the latest figures show a spectacular increase of some 121% on pure electric car sales from this time last year, with almost 2,000 such vehicles purchased in 2014. But that figure looks weak in comparison with the 1.1m cars sold overall this year – it is in fact just 0.2% of the overall market. Buyers in other European markets are more positive towards electric cars. In Denmark and the Netherlands, electric vehicles make up 5% of all cars, rising to 20% in Norway where there are more than 35,000 electric vehicles on the road amongst a population of less than 5m. Success in a market like Norway can be attributed less to environmental consciousness than it can well-advised economics: it’s possible to save up to £1,000 a year running an electric vehicle.  They also get a number of benefits including VAT exemption, free car tax, parking and road tolls, as well as various employment tax benefits. In addition, conventional cars (with internal combustion engines) are subject to numerous heavy taxes, including a road use tax and a CO2 tax that makes Norwegian petrol the most expensive in the world.  Of course, electric cars also receive government incentives in the UK – most notably the purchase cost reduction of up to £5,000 (£8,000 for vans). But even with this the electric options are still notably more expensive than internal combustion engine equivalents. The subsidy also seems to affect second-hand car value, which depreciates markedly.  There is also free car tax, which saves you up to £470 a year, and exemption from the London congestion charge of £9 a day, though these incentives are also available to many low emission diesel models, and some low emission petrol vehicles too – of course, hybrid electrics are included too. This rewards system is less favourable in comparison to that in Norway, where the total incentives on offer will amount to roughly half the price of the car.  But it is the running costs in the UK that will save the buyer the most, with a difference of £200 a year to power an electric such as the Nissan Leaf versus £1,300 for a similar sized petrol model. However, despite the impressive value here, many will be put off by the high purchase costs. The Department for Transport survey highlights how emphasising running cost savings could improve the public attitude. A massive 85% of respondents saw cost as the most important factor to consider when buying a car. At the same time, a third were put off electric vehicles because of the cost – second only to battery issues around so called range anxiety and doubts over present technology, which can be overcome with education, experience and improving infrastructure. Overall, reducing cost was the most popular means to encourage electric vehicle sales, in line with a US survey in one of the most successful electric vehicle markets in the world, California, where 37% of owners were driven by economic not environmental concerns. There are other means to get the benefit from electric vehicles such as car sharing and car clubs, options which have the potential to be more environmentally friendly and cheaper. But we appear wedded to a consumer capitalist car system whereby private ownership is all-important. While commentators may believe we are at a tipping point, significant market penetration of electric cars is still some time away unless these cars and vans become (and are widely seen as) more affordable for ordinary people."
"The experience of visiting a zoo is about to change dramatically. The Next Generation Zoo concept is based on how animals use space in the wild, giving them more freedom and better using the resources available to most zoos. Take Philadelphia Zoo, for example. It is a small, city-based institution, which like many zoos has suffered from the lack of space or opportunity to expand. In the past, this has meant animals were restricted to limiting enclosures. But new walkways between enclosures are allowing monkeys and now tigers greater freedom of movement. The way animals use space in the wild is actually quite similar to the way  we humans use space. Wildlife biologists call the space a wild animal uses its home range or its territory. I have travelled to all seven continents and even to the North Pole, so my home range is the whole planet. But because I only really use a few areas with a high frequency, such as my home, work and relatives’ houses, these areas probably account for 95% of my space use. The rest is travelling between the three main areas I use or sporadic visits to exotic places. Many animal species in the wild do a similar thing: they have a few places they like to sleep, some drinking points, social gathering space, toilet areas and places they go to find food. Thus, while a wild monkey might have a home range of 12 hectares Brazilian rainforest, in reality it only uses one hectare distributed across a few points of its home range. Field biologists call this its “core area”. What this tells us is that animals (rather like humans) spend a lot of time commuting from frequently used place to frequently used place. While people might complain about the need to commute, this is more related to crowded public transport than the actual travelling. May is National Walking Month and if it were practical most people would find walking a more rewarding experience than mechanised transport. If our species was designed to do one thing well, by evolution, it is walking – something our ancestors had to do to fulfil their survival needs. Not to mention it helps with many diseases including obesity. Next Generation Zoos have embraced this concept by creating raceways that allow animals to walk around the zoo. The Philadelphia Zoo has hundreds of metres of mesh tubes, which monkeys can walk along and substantial raceways that tigers can track along. These are not roads to nowhere – some of them may end in viewing points and others in a different enclosure.   So, rather like a train-line, these raceways can connect animal enclosures together, expanding the areas open to species for exploration and exercise. As well as giving them more space, animals get more freedom to use different spaces for different activities, such as sleeping or foraging much as they would in the wild. So while due to planning or other restrictions a zoo may not be able to construct a huge tiger enclosure this does not matter as you can connect many small enclosures together. It can also allow social species to choose with whom they are going to hang out. This is the idea behind Philadelphia Zoo’s 360° concept, designed by Jon Coe. Taking the concept of train-line system of raceways further by including nodes, which are essentially junction boxes, a zoo can start to rotate animals between enclosures. For example, an enclosure that is escape-proof for a bear will also keep in a big cat. Thus, depending on the number of enclosures in the zoo a species could have access to tens of different enclosures during a year by being rotated through them. Once the herbivores have been rotated elsewhere, predators could be given access to their enclosures, which would be a very stimulating experience for them. The map of a zoo would start to look like the London Underground with the animals having vast arrays of opportunities to choose where they are going. It is likely that many animals will enjoy the journey of travelling around the zoo above the public, experiencing new sights and sounds. Feeding stations, toys and viewing points can be included in the raceways making them more interesting to the animals. In terms of animal welfare, this system will allow animals to use the zoo environment more as they would use their habitat in the wild. They will no longer need to stare at the same old four walls for the rest of their life. Instead, they will have the opportunity to travel and go to different places. This will be beneficial for both mental and physical wellbeing. Zoo animals, just like their human visitors, are becoming overweight. I have seen zoo-housed crocodiles with potbellies, something we never see in the wild, and this issue can be best addressed by promoting physical activity. For the visitor, these changes should make zoos more dynamic institutions and less like museums. Because animals are on the move, it’ll be necessary to seek out the ones you want to see, making the experience much more like the wild. This will make animal viewing a more rewarding experience. The thrill of seeing a wild animal is in part the hunt. While the cost of implementing this kind of system is not cheap, it will be considerably cheaper than building new exhibits. I for one think it will encourage zoos to renovate enclosures rather than constructing news ones or building many, potentially smaller, simpler spaces that animals need, such as a sleeping space, a watering hole or just a place to admire the view over a lake. I think the orang-utans and their friends are going to like these changes."

One must be careful not to express hurty feelings in today’s snowflake world. At least that is what Alan Jones is finding out. He’s been told by his employer that if he makes any more remarks along the lines of suggesting Scott Morrison should shove a sock down Jacinda Ardern’s throat he’ll have his contract terminated. 



What shouldn’t be overlooked in this is the small matter of a nervous man at a bank terminating a lucrative advertising contract with the station. I wonder what was uppermost in Macquarie Media Chairman Russell Tate’s mind when hauling Jones over the coals? Mr Tate should bear in mind that Alan Jones is number one in the news talk ratings and without ratings, he’ll find it’s not just the nervous man at the bank terminating his advertising.



What also shouldn’t be overlooked is the rather larger matter of free speech. Alan Jones is employed as a talkback host to broadcast his opinions on matters he feels will be of interest to his listeners. They may not necessarily reflect the views of the organisation that employs him but that should not be his concern. His job is to get ratings to attract advertising so the company can make a profit and make little Mr Tate look good.



Scott Morrison said the comments were “disappointing” and “way out of line”. “I have two daughters so you can expect that’s how I would personally feel about it”. What is that supposed to mean? Does he mean that the comments are okay if directed at a man but not acceptable if at a woman? What sort of lily-livered world are we living in? In high profile positions, whether held by male or female, what comes with the territory is the same. I find Mr Morrison’s comments disappointing.



Jaqueline Maley writing in the Sydney Morning Herald said Ardern’s crime was to “lecture” Australia about climate change at the Pacific Islands Forum. She writes that the extent of what she said was that Australia “has to answer to the Pacific” on its climate policy, which is an outrage precisely because it’s stating the obvious, and who does she think she is to do that. Jaqueline, who describes herself as a columnist and senior journalist, is obviously not bright enough to realise that therein lies the crime which is one of hypocrisy.



Alan has to be mindful of what he says but Jacinda can go freely slagging off Australia for treating coal mining, a major contributor to their economy, the same way as we treat agriculture for exactly the same reason. Why is no one saying that we must answer to the Pacific in the same way? This is precisely why Alan Jones, quite rightly, suggested Scott Morrison should (metaphorically) shove a sock down her throat. 



Australia shouldn’t have to wear blatant hypocrisy from an utter lightweight and a complete clown. I notice those comments haven’t been disputed in the ensuing fiasco so we must assume that we can take them to be an accurate and honest description of the person concerned.



According to Alex Carey of news.com.au a slew of companies, namely four, have deserted Alan’s programme. One of the companies, Koala said “climate change is real, violence against women starts with words and the bloke has had too many chances”. Give me strength! I ask you, who are the pussies running that outfit? They don’t sound very Aussie to me.

A reader who posts under the name “tokyoboy” sent a link to a very interesting sea level record from the Japanese Meteorological Agency. It covers the period 1906–2010, and when I first saw it I thought they’d made some mistake.
So I got their data, and plotted it up. I also got the satellite records for the area. Finally, I got records of one of the sites that the Japanese used, but I obtained it from the PSMSL records. All of them agree very well, so I am forced to assume that there are no obvious errors in the Japanese records. Figure 1 shows the results:
Figure 1. Japanese sea level records. Two records marked “Japan” are from the citation above. They are averages of long-term records since 1906 (4 sites, blue line), and shorter-term records since 1960 (16 sites, red line). Satellite records (green, 1993-2010) are from the University of Colorado interactive wizard. Wajima records (purple, 1930-2010) are from the PSMSL. 
You can see why I thought there was a mistake. Sea level around Japan rose steadily from 1906 to 1950. Then it dropped for fifteen years and bounced around until 1980. Since then it has risen again, but it is about 20 mm lower than it was in 1950.

Now, I can’t find anything at all wrong with the data. The satellite record agrees with the Japanese averages, as does the PSMSL record. So we have to assume it is accurate.
But it is unlike any record I’ve seen of the global average change in sea level. That global record climbs steadily over the century.
Image added by Anthony via WikipediaSo I fear I have no great insight into what is going on. Over the last 80 years, the sea level in Japan was level, went up, went down, went back up, and now is not far from where it started.
I’m happy for suggestions and comments, as I’m in mystery over this one. It’s one of the great things about the climate, always more puzzles to solve.

"As a therapist, I was drawn to the Guardian long read (Therapy Under Lockdown: ‘I’m just as terrified as my patients are’, 23 April) but it didn’t resonate with me. What’s interesting to me is that we are not all necessarily “hapless victims” with “nothing to do but cower in our homes”. Many of us value slowing down, blue skies, clean air, and newly discovered neighbours.  Some couples are facing each other more squarely and experiencing breakthroughs – some parents are enjoying more time with their children. Others struggling with understandable anxiety are valuing the support of therapy. Video sessions – for some – seem to offer greater opportunities for intimacy than face-to-face interactions. Differing experiences of lockdown may, in many cases, be circumstantial. As for whether therapy can help – perhaps, having trained more recently than Gary Greenberg, I’ve benefited from a different approach. As a hospice practitioner and bereavement counsellor, I learned the value of facing mortality and preparing for death. Furthermore, my professional training at Re-Vision was a training in uncertainty. We were profoundly aware of climate change and environmental destruction – problems we likely wouldn’t solve. We didn’t embark on our careers with the belief that we could necessarily “name our pain” and move on. We learned the art of bearing the seemingly unbearable. In answer, therefore, to Greenberg’s question “Is there a role for therapy in a pandemic?” mine is a very resounding “Yes!”Celia UrbachLondon • There has been some concern in the psychotherapy community about the way our work is depicted in Gary Greenberg’s account of moving his psychotherapy practice online in the context of the current pandemic, not least among those who work with populations of refugees, homeless people, BAME and others who are not strangers to being helpless and unsafe. Some of us have spent decades dragging psychotherapy beyond a ghetto of white, western, middle-class privilege, and into the real world of multiculturalism, social inequality and postcolonial consciousness. Presenting a pre-1960s, US, private-practice version as representative of psychotherapy in the 21st century is a somewhat less than helpful contribution.Dick BlackwellMember of the Institute of Group Analysis and of the Psychotherapy and Counselling Union"
"Bioenergy and biofuels have an important role to play in lowering the use of carbon-intensive fossil fuels – a point underscored by the IPCC report which confirmed the need for further research to improve such technology. A key challenge is creating alternative transport fuels, which are currently overwhelmingly fossil-fuel dependent, and responsible for 25% of greenhouse gas emissions in the EU. Of the renewable energy alternatives such as wind, tidal and solar power, it is only non-edible biomass (broadly, any biological matter derived from plants or other organisms) that can offer a low-cost, “drop-in” sustainable transport fuel. Such a liquid biofuel with a high energy density would fit easily into the enormous global fuel distribution networks that already exist. Other renewables such as wind and solar, though well-suited to powering static homes and industry, would require significant breakthroughs in battery technology before they could compete with gasoline, diesel or liquid biofuels. With transport and emissions growing, an alternative is needed, fast. Biofuels derived from waste could replace 16%, or 37m tonnes, of oil used by road vehicles in the EU alone by 2030. But history has shown how introducing new and transformative technologies can be slow, especially when they seek to usurp the highly-embedded infrastructure of the status quo.  Each year India produces more than 200m tonnes of inedible agricultural waste such as rice and cotton stalks, unsuitable for either human consumption, animal fodder or bedding. Most is burned illegally to speed up the process of crop rotation. This releases huge quantities carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, and wastes valuable hydrocarbons that could be put to use. Europe produces 900m tonnes of agricultural, forestry and food waste – all are rich in energy-filled sugars.  Which waste stream is used as a raw material feedstock for biofuels will differ from region to region, so a key challenge is to develop the technology that can process biomass with very diverse physical and chemical properties. For example, pine bark, switchgrass, corn husks, and starches. Putting this to use would bring substantial benefits to industry and the economy: instead of paying to burn and bury biomass waste, companies could sell it as the starting point of creating valuable gasoline, diesel and jet fuels. At the European Bioenergy Research Institute (EBRI) we are working on the engineering necessary. Solutions include thermochemical conversion, for distributed power generation such as to small farms and telecommunications towers. Thermochemical processes, such as pyrolysis, use heat (rather than burning) to force a chemical reaction. This can be dramatically accelerated and steered by the use of catalysts to lower the barriers to chemical bond breaking. At high temperatures, the chemical bonds between carbon, hydrogen and oxygen atoms in biomass break. The products include a solid, called biochar (like charcoal, but not derived from coal), which is used as a soil enhancer or a solid heating fuel. It also produces a liquid that can be used as a biodiesel to power combustion engines, and a small amount of biogas that can be burned to sustain the pyrolysis heat reaction, introducing a degree of self-sufficiency that reduces the overall cost of the process. Similar approaches pursued by private and state-funded businesses worldwide could deliver a double whammy of eliminating the carbon dioxide emissions from burning waste and at the same time yielding high energy density fuels. British Airways has this month committed to buy 50,000 tonnes of aircraft jet fuel derived from biowaste to be manufactured at a plant in Thurrock, Essex, as part of its deal with sustainable fuel company Solena. And one of the biggest champions of biofuels is the US military, currently offering US$4 billion in loans to companies able to help commercialise and push forward the technology required. It’s important to end society’s dependence on the use of non-renewable, carbon-based fuels. But this cannot be done at the expense of food crops (using corn to create ethanol, for example) or land used for food crops, as was the case with so-called first generation biofuels. The pressure this has put on food security in some parts of the world has blackened biofuels’ reputation. But it’s crucial not to throw the baby out with the bathwater: the IPCC report urges us to explore the potential of all alternative energy sources. Newer, second generation biofuels can use non-edible plants (such as grasses) that can grow on soils that cannot sustain food crops. Better yet, careful selection and processing of waste biomass can accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels – we cannot simply write off biofuels as a credible solution to the world’s future energy needs, as it has been by some. Bioenergy solutions are more practical, economic and immediate than many alternatives. The authors of the IPCC report are absolutely right to highlight the urgent need to alter policy and investment strategies. Funding agencies, private industry and NGOs must work together to focus research and development efforts in bioenergy, and identify projects that will deliver rapid change, without compromising environmental and farming needs. The clock is ticking."
"Do we have enough onshore windfarms, or do we have too many? And who decides what “too many” looks like? The Conservative Party has announced it would end subsidies for new onshore wind farms if it won the next election, and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has demonstrated an aggressive approach that has seen two thirds of planning applications for onshore wind farms rejected in the last year – 164 projects halted since January.  For example, under the ministerial power to call in a planning decision, Pickles rejected the plan proposed jointly by Wind Prospect and EDF for a six turbine, 12MW wind farm near Bridlington, Yorkshire – one of ten onshore wind farms rejected by call-in over the past year – in doing so overturning the decision of a planning inspector. Is this war on windfarms wise? Tory peer Lord Deben was reported as saying the UK had “enough” onshore wind projects, and that though they will continue to be important after 2020, “it is not a decision we need to make now”. The Committee on Climate Change which he chairs reiterated that increasing onshore wind capacity during the 2020s was likely to be the most cost-effective means for the UK to meet its carbon emissions targets. According to the committee, while there is sufficient capacity online and in the pipeline to meet 2020 targets, this relies on there being sufficient investment in other renewable technologies. Beyond 2020, there will be choices to be made on how to decarbonise Britain’s energy generation system. The most cost-effective method entails more onshore wind development through the 2020s; doing anything else faces raising costs with knock-on effects on energy prices and affordability. Clearly the actual outcome will depend a lot on politics. Trade association Renewable UK stated, rather bitterly, that it is “unfortunate that we’ve reached a point where the Conservatives are allowing UKIP to dictate Tory energy policy”, calling Tory efforts to mollify the party’s rural electoral heartlands ahead of next year’s election “ill-considered, short-term policy-making on the hoof” and likely to damage what is becoming a flagship British industry. According to the Committee on Climate Change, the most cost-effective means to hit the emissions reductions targets for 2020 is 15GW of onshore wind up and running by then, rising to 25GW by 2030 – on the basis that it is “relatively low cost”. But if not that, then what? The UK already has around 10GW of wind capacity on and offshore, which according to National Grid needs to more than double to 26GW by 2020. If onshore wind projects, the far easier and cheaper of the two, are to be slowed or even halted, the task becomes considerably more difficult.  It will be made even harder still if the government persist with its plan to halt funding for large solar farms. That’s another technology Pickles has targeted, although his rejection of one in Suffolk has been overturned by judicial review. Given policies like this, David Toke at Aberdeen University suggests that the UK will fall far short of its target for 15% energy generated from renewables by 2020 agreed with the EU.  This has all come about despite public support for onshore wind farms in the UK remaining high. In the last survey conducted by the Department for Energy and Climate Change, 70% were in favour. Public support for solar was even higher – 85%. Yet for specific projects objections are raised about intrusion and, more prosaically,in the case of wind farms, their possible impact on house prices. Another issue for wind is noise, and in particular infrasound. While audible noise even at very low levels can be annoying, which means the exact location of a wind farm is key, the claim that significant heath problems arise from ultrasound seems to have been roundly disproved.  Among critics, much is made of the problems stemming from over-reliance on wind and solar, which by their nature are intermittent, depending on the weather. However, in the case of wind, a Royal Academy of Engineering study concluded there would be no major problems integrating intermittent energy from wind into the grid until it contributed more than 20% of the national demand. Once major contributions from offshore wind and other renewables, including solar, pushed their contribution beyond 20%, new grid balancing strategies will be needed, but there are plenty of options. It’s not technology that’s the problem. While there are disagreements on the role of nuclear power, the relative merits of renewables and the subsidies they both require, all agree that onshore wind is the cheapest non-fossil fuel energy source. The question is whether nimbyish responses to the changing face of energy generation are allowed to overshadow what agreement there is."
"Planet of the Humans is an environmental documentary that has enraged renewable energy experts and environmentalists, with some calling for its high-profile executive producer, Michael Moore, to apologise. It was released for free less than two weeks ago, and at the time of writing had had close to 5m views on YouTube.  Across its 102 minutes, the film’s producer and narrator, Jeff Gibbs, weaves a disjointed narrative that renewable energy is just as bad as fossil fuels, high-profile environmentalists are corrupted by capitalism and population growth is the great unspoken enemy. “It is truly demoralising how much damage this film has done at a moment when many are ready for deep change,” said the Canadian activist and journalist Naomi Klein. “There are important critiques of an environmentalism that refuses to reckon with unlimited consumption and growth. But this film ain’t it.” Moore has continued to defend the film against a swath of critical articles. Why are so many people so angry? Here are some of the key issues, but this is not even close to being an exhaustive list. Associate Prof Mark Diesendorf, an energy systems and sustainability expert at the University of New South Wales, tells Guardian Australia the film’s commentary on renewable energy is “out-of-date, superficial, simplistic, misleading and very biased”. It criticises renewable energy – particularly solar and wind – in part because you need varying amounts of materials, energy and metals to make them. For anyone who has thought for more than a minute about what it takes to build that solar panel or those wind turbines, it should be no revelation that some materials and energy are needed. There’s no such thing as a free lunch. But the film leaves the viewer thinking there is no net gain from renewable technologies and does not, for example, look at any cradle-to-grave analysis of the technologies it criticises. “The myth that life-cycle energy invested [and carbon emissions] in building renewable energy technologies is comparable with the lifetime energy generation is false,” says Diesendorf. “Solar panels generate the energy required to build themselves in one to two years of operation, depending on the type of panel and location and their lifetime is about 20 years; large wind turbines in three to 12 months, depending on size of turbines and location, and their lifetime is 25 to 30 years.” In the film Gibbs says: “I learned that solar panels don’t last forever either.” You would think most people would know that. Early in the film, Gibbs walks with an environment group protesting a plan to put up 21 wind turbines at Lowell Mountain in Vermont, a row that played out in 2011 (another hint at the age of the film). An unnamed campaigner tells Gibbs the power grid needs to run idle when the wind drops and that this causes a “bigger footprint” than just running the grid off fossil fuels. Gibbs takes the speaker’s word but Diesendorf says this is an old myth disproved by real world examples of power grids running with high penetrations of renewable energy – with and without storage such as batteries and hydro power. The pace of change and development in the renewable energy industry is rapid so a film that wants to inform viewers should be as up-to-date as possible. But the film is riddled with footage, segments and issues that are a decade or so old. Gibbs attends the launch of the Chevy Volt, a car launched 10 years ago. He criticises it because it’s recharged from a power grid in Michigan dominated by coal. Taking a very old example of an electric car operating in one place should not be the basis for forming a judgment about the role of electric cars in 2020, yet the film does. Gibbs tours a “football field-sized” solar installation called the Cedar Street solar array in Lansing, Michigan. An energy boss says to camera that the panels have an efficiency of a “little less than 8%” and that the array could power only about 10 city homes a year. What the film doesn’t say is that the array was installed as a pilot project in 2008. One energy writer to have looked closely at many of the claims in the film is Australian Ketan Joshi who says looking at a solar array from 12 years ago is “an absolute eternity in solar development years”. Diesendorf says panels with an 8% efficiency “were on the market several decades ago” and now most commercial panels have an efficiency above 20%. What’s happened to the cost of solar panels since 2008? Analysts Wood Mackenzie say they fell about 90% between 2010 and 2019. The film spends time looking at biomass energy or, more specifically, one subset of biomass technology that is essentially burning trees and woodchips. Gibbs has been a long-time biomass critic (an old article of his includes a photograph taken while filming footage that appears in the film suggesting that a scene showing clear-felled trees is at least 10 years old). Burning trees for energy is very problematic but there are reasons why under some circumstances it is not as bad as burning fossil fuels from a greenhouse gas perspective. One reason is part of climate change 101. Burning fossil fuels liberates carbon atoms that were removed from the Earth’s active carbon cycle millions of years ago. Burning trees moves CO2 back into the biosphere that was sequestered only in recent decades. To an uninformed viewer, the film might look to be getting some purchase when it shows high-profile environmentalists – namely the author and activist Bill McKibben – supporting burning wood. McKibben founded his 350.org climate group at Middlebury College, and the film has footage of him at an opening of a biomass gasification plant there, saying technology like that should be everywhere. That footage was from 2009 and as McKibben has pointed out since the film was released, he very publicly denounced the idea of burning wood for energy in 2016. The film did not make this clear. McKibben says he heard about the plans for the documentary last year: “I wrote the producer and director to set the record straight, and never heard back from them. That seems like bad journalism, and bad faith.” Gibbs says he did not get McKibben’s communication and even if he had he would not have changed the film. That aside, Diesendorf says the film’s treatment of bioenergy is simplistic because while some methods, such as ethanol from corn, are environmentally damaging, ethanol from waste starch is not. He says the film creates a false impression that bioenergy as expected to have a large contribution to energy needs in the future. “The truth is that some see it playing a minor role while almost all the others reject it entirely. Hardly anyone sees it as playing an important role.” Planet of the Humans is a film that is almost entirely devoid of solutions to the existential crisis that its producers say they are deeply concerned about. It rightly raises questions about rampant consumption and the planet’s dwindling ecosystems. As some of the examples also show, the film is long out-of-date and there’s no evidence that attempts were made to revise its content or its premise as new information became available and, presumably, the film sat idle in multiple parts for many years. Gibbs, Moore and fellow producer Ozzie Zehner, who is featured prominently, have defended the documentary. Gibbs says they had “gone to great lengths” to talk to wind and solar experts. “We need our environmental leaders, but we are in the wrong story,” he says in an interview with the Hill. “We are asking questions about what we say is going to save the world, and it should be permitted to have discussions among people who believe in climate change – and know the environment is in trouble – about what’s going to work and what’s not going to work. “That was our intent – to trigger a discussion and raise a lot of questions, but we don’t have all the answers.” Moore adds: “We wanted to ignite a discussion, and that’s happened.” He’s certainly right about that."

I thought Julie-Anne Genter was Associate Transport Minister, but it seems she is Associate Health Minister as well. When you think about the Department of Health, you tend to think about overworked doctors, overworked nurses, waiting lists, sewage in the walls (that turned out to be non-existent), cancer drugs, diabetes…



But Julie-Anne Genter, new, self-appointed Associate Minister of Health does not think about any of those things. Her biggest concern about the health service is… its carbon footprint.



Yes, really. Maybe she can see carbon dioxide too, like Greta Thunberg.



Do you think Julie Anne Genter thinks before she speaks? Do you think she thinks about anything apart from climate change? Do you think in trying to change our view on climate change or to get us to be as obsessive as her, she works out how nutty she sounds before she says stuff? 



Genter is after the health service.   
Not on hospital care, not on patients not getting treatment, not on waiting lists, not on their debt, not on the fact there are too many DHBs, not on the staffing shortages, not on the diabetes epidemic, not on the obesity crisis, not on any health related matter that bogs this country’s health fiscal and social system down.   
But on climate change. Yes, she’s after the hospitals on climate change.   
**And in doing so, she’s sticking yet another knife into the farmers, the backbone of our economy and foreign income success. She wants hospitals serving less meat and less milk to help their carbon footprint.**



This woman is dangerous. Really dangerous. Many people in the hospital are on special diets, that may include increased protein. But Julie-Anne thinks they can get all that from a nutburger and a glass of almond milk. Not to mention that almond milk is significantly more expensive than the real thing.



Do you even think your average hospital worker has time to even consider what their hospital’s carbon footprint is? Or do you think in the old ED department they might be a bit more worried about the knifings, heart attacks, overdoses, and road carnage? But no, ol’ Genter is banging on about the carbon footprint. 



These Greenies are so anti-farming that they forget that it is the backbone of our economy. Well, no… they probably don’t forget. They just don’t care. They lost touch with economic reality a long time ago.



It’s almost like she’s a caricature, and yet she is a woman of power. She is a Minister in the government, a person who can affect real change.   
And yet under a system groaning with systemic trouble, leaking buildings, hundreds of millions of debt, sacked boards and appointed commissioners, all she can muster her energy to produce is yet another time wasting, touchy feely, woke pile of crap, in the form of an edict, to pedal yet again her wacky, out of touch, totally inappropriate agenda.   
As for the farmers, what must they think? Along with the Emissions Trading Scheme, the levies, the water quality attacks, and now an open warfare plan to undermine all they do.



  
I **s she working for the enemy? Is this economic treason? How obscure, weird, and unusual do you need to be before literally everyone writes you off as a joke?**





She is a joke, but the trouble is, about 6% of voters fail to see the Greens for what they really are… dangerous hypocrites who will ruin our economy and our country, all for the sake of a doctrine that is fantasy at best and criminal at worst.



I know hospital food is often dreadful, but if JAG gets her way, it is about to get much worse. Enjoy your tofu, folks. It will be yet another reason to get out of the hospital as quickly as possible and it just might end the obesity epidemic overnight. Maybe that has been her plan all along.

Is Corbynite anti-Semitism taking root in the left wing of Australian politics? There have been disturbing rumbles for years in leftist politics, as the anti-Semitic “Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions” (BDS) has become practically an article of faith.



Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi has appeared at rallies where placards depicted Jews as monkeys and pigs, while others advocated the murder of Israelis. Greens leader Richard di Natale denies Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish state. When a Greens activist left a bag of “shekels” on a Melbourne Jewish councillor’s desk, the Executive Council of Australian Jewry stated that “A toxic anti-Jewish culture has ­become well entrenched in the far left of the Greens”.



Now a disturbing campaign is being waged by leftists against Australia’s most prominent Jewish politician.



A senior government front­bencher has accused failed ­independent candidate Oliver Yates and Greens-aligned lawyer Julian Burnside of being “pathetic extremists”, labelling the campaign against Josh Frydenberg’s eligibility to sit in parliament as anti-Semitic.



Housing Minister Michael Sukkar also rounded on Kooyong resident and climate ­activist ­Michael Staindl who has mounted a High Court challenge to the Treasurer’s re-election on the claim that Mr Frydenberg was ­entitled to Hungarian citizenship through his mother, a Holocaust survivor…



Frydenberg’s mother, Erica Strausz, was officially designated “stateless” on her arrival in Australia. As a Jew, she had been stripped of her Hungarian citizenship.



Trevor Poulton — a lawyer who has written a book called The Holocaust Denier — had previously told The Australian he was working with Mr Yates’s “Kooyong Independents Group” to test the Treasurer’s citizenship status.



To be fair, Poulton insists that the book doesn’t reflect his own views. Yet its story of a Melbourne policeman who is “woken” to the “truth” about the Holocaust often comes across as a thinly disguised polemic.



In an extraordinary attack under parliamentary privilege, Mr Sukkar, the member for the Melbourne-based seat of Deakin said the campaign against Mr Frydenberg was driven by “a small number of disgruntled, debauched political activists”.



He described it as “so ­offensive, so disgusting and so ­abhorrent…True to form, the citizenship challenge has also been supported by the other failed candidate in Kooyong, the Greens’ Julian Burnside.



“Burnside is on the record as supporting the BDS, the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions, movement against Israel, which is of its nature anti-Semitic.



“Burnside has also trivialised the Holocaust by equating Peter Dutton on social media to a Nazi officer — something which Holocaust survivors have said publicly is deeply offensive to them.



“What is with these pathetic extremists?”



Burnside has also denied any association with Staindl’s High Court challenge, although he has also questioned Frydenberg’s eligibility, and continues to support BDS.



After a long history of promoting Jewish interests, the left in Australia has now been skirting dangerously anti-Semitic territory for years. Is it because prominent Jews like Frydenberg have dared cross over to conservative politics? Or is something more sinister infecting left politics in this country?



Some at least in Labor have been wary of holding hands with leftist Jew-haters.



Speaking in 2017, then Labor deputy leader Tanya Plibersek warned the questions about Mr Frydenberg’s eligibility for parliament were “getting into pretty disturbing territory”.



  
Yet Labor’s new leader has proudly posed for selfies with anti-Semite Jeremy Corbyn.



Labor needs to take a long look at the company it is keeping.

Share this...FacebookTwitterJoe Bastardi’s WeatherBELL Analytics presents its latest Saturday Summary.

At about the 5:20 mark, Joe shows how a lack of ice at the North Pole in the summertime is really nothing unusual. Above is the North Pole in 1962 in the summertime.
Joe comments, “If this were occurring up there now, everybody would be going out of their minds. […] All the mainstream media and enviro-blogs would go crazy, right?”
Then Joe shows how the North Pole looks today:

 Of course Arctic sea ice cover reaches it’s low in September and the above picture could change. The point is that an ice-free North Pole would be nothing new.
As Joe explains, Arctic summer sea ice extent is very much dependent on ocean cycles. Once the AMO goes negative again, we’ll likely be seeing ice extent like what we saw at the end of the 1970s.

"**A tequila bar has applied to be classed as a place of worship to allow it to open while it is in tier three.**
James Aspell, owner of 400 Rabbits in Nottingham, said it was a tongue-in-cheek gesture to highlight the ""unfair"" rules faced by hospitality venues.
From Wednesday, bars in tier three areas can only offer takeaway and delivery.
However places of worship are allowed to welcome people from the same household or bubble.
Mr Aspell, who opened the bar five years ago, said he had submitted an application to Nottingham's registrar general to reopen the bar as The Church of 400 Rabbits.
""It's tongue-in-cheek but it's come from a serious place,"" he said.
""We think the tier restrictions announced last week and how they're targeted at hospitality businesses like mine seems incredibly unfair. It could be months before we're allowed to open again.
""We looked at the list of every business or venue that's allowed to open under the new system and it said pretty much every other type of business apart from bars and restaurants.
""In Nottingham they're even allowing the Christmas market to go ahead, which is right outside our door - so there'll be crowds of people attending and we're not even allowed to open.
""So we've decided to have a bit of fun with it but the main reason is to shine a light on the ridiculousness of the rules themselves.""
Mr Aspell said the Places of Worship Registration Act 1855 required applicants to have people signed up to the congregation - which he plans to do through a dedicated website.
""We sent in all the information requested in the application form - the layout of the building and the timetable of what we're doing etc,"" he said.
""Then you need to prove you have a congregation - I think the minimum is 20 households - so that's the next step.
""I'm not anticipating it being a quick decision at all. They [the registrar general] might just throw it straight in the bin but hopefully they'll contact me fairly soon.""
A spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care said: ""Transmission data shows us that hospitality premises are places where infections are more likely to be spread.""

"Take a hard look at the painful process of de-carbonising the UK’s electricity supply, and it’s clear that the options on the table are not great. From the outset, changes to the system generate further problems to be solved. Decommissioning the most polluting coal plants is the place to start, but given that they contribute 30-40% of the country’s electricity supply, this leaves an energy gap that requires filling. Could wind replace coal? The government has an ambitious programme for expanding domestic offshore wind, with the recently commissioned London Array off the East Anglian coast currently producing a world-leading 650MW. But as UK electricity demand ranges from 38-58GW, the energy generated by the London Array and other wind farms is a mere drop in the ocean of what will be required. Could fracking be the answer? A successful domestic shale gas initiative could provide the UK with a greater security of gas supply, possibly cheaper electricity, and a much-needed backup capacity for the rapidly growing wind power sector. Even so, shale gas isn’t low carbon energy and, critically, it’s a finite resource. What about nuclear energy? It’s low carbon and has the potential to produce relatively low cost, reliable electricity. Although nuclear power often sparks debates over safety, a comparison of the number of deaths caused by energy source shows that watt-for-watt, nuclear power causes far fewer fatalities than coal, oil or gas. With support from the British government (and British taxpayers) a consortium led by EDF, the French firm that runs the UK’s current nuclear reactor fleet, is to build a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point C in Somerset. This will provide 3.2GW of baseload power, equivalent to around 5-7% of the country’s electricity demand and enough to power 5m homes. Other companies including Horizon and NuGen also propose to build further nuclear power stations in the UK. Problem solved then? Probably not. Meeting the UK 2050 climate change targets would require in excess of 16GW of nuclear power. No other nuclear plants are guaranteed, and even the most optimistic projections suggest Hinkley Point C will not start generating power until 2023. With costs estimated at an eye-watering £14-16 billion, it comes as no surprise that the barrier to more nuclear power stations is the very large, high-risk capital investment required with large nuclear reactors. But there may be another option: the small modular reactor (SMR), generating power from 300MW down to a very small 10MW. Their definition as “modular” stems from the potential for parts to be precision-engineered on a production line with minimal assembly on site. In principle, factory production drives costs down and reactor reliability up. Currently, the technology’s immaturity prevents a detailed economic evaluation of its potential to deliver cost effective power. However, given external factors such as the future price of gas, carbon taxes and the success of carbon capture and storage, SMRs could still be extremely competitive. The UK parliamentary Energy and Climate Change select committee is examining the potential of SMR, and the outcome of this and other studies could significantly influence the direction of UK energy policy. The main advantage of SMRs is the greatly reduced construction cost. The income from building and selling the first SMR could fund the second, and then a third, and so on until the combined output of the reactors reaches that of a single, large reactor in same the gigawatt range as Hinkley Point C. This would reduce the financial risk associated with large nuclear power stations considerably. It would also reduce the barriers to market entry to a level where smaller firms and utilities could enter, increasing competition and in theory reducing costs further. There are other advantages: SMRs can better exploit passive safety features – those that are immediate in the event of a failure, and require no human intervention. For example, as the reactor core is smaller it produces less heat, and this removes the complete reliance of larger reactors on a dependable coolant to prevent a meltdown. In fact, many designs can dissipate heat through the reactor pressure vessel itself, using natural convection to maintain circulation. The reduced reliance on coolant – typically water – means SMRs could be set up away from coastal sites and moved close to major industrial complexes or cities. They can be made to load follow – adjusting output to match fluctuating demand – and the waste heat they generate can be harnessed to provide heat for homes or buildings, or for use in industrial processes.  Downsized nuclear reactors are by no means a new concept. The UK’s first generation Magnox reactors were small – all under 300MW. And small, self-contained “navalised” reactors are used to power ships – icebreakers, floating reactors used in Russia to bring heat and power to remote locations far from the grid, aircraft carriers, and submarines.  Indeed, the UK submarine fleet is powered by small pressurised water reactors, maintained by Rolls-Royce. With home-grown construction and maintenance expertise, the UK should be taking advantage of these skills to develop and deploy its own SMR design.  The US already recognises the potential of SMRs and has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into helping its nuclear industry design a suite of SMR reactors at a test location at Savannah River nuclear laboratories. If successful, US firms will gain a strong commercial lead in a potentially global supply chain. The question is whether the UK will match America’s ambition."

One White House staffing issue may actually be great news for anyone who uses air conditioning or heating in their home or car.



The recent resignation of Trump administration energy adviser George David Banks means the loss of one of the strongest advocates for the U.S. to go along with much of the world in phasing out the use of hydrofluorocarbon HFC‐​134a, the most popular commercial heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) refrigerant.



Banks called for the U.S. to adopt the Kigali Amendment to the 1987 Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete stratospheric ozone.



Although the U.S. is a signatory to the Montreal Agreement, it isn’t bound to uphold the 2016 Kigali Amendment, a separate protocol, which gradually ends the usage of HFC‐​134a on the grounds that it would mitigate some global warming. Kigali has nothing to do with stratospheric ozone.





The Kigali Amendment is an inappropriate protocol purporting to stop global warming that was grafted onto a stratospheric ozone treaty.



Only the Senate can make this decision, but it should use this opportunity to take a stand against the Kigali Amendment, because it would needlessly raise the cost of HVAC while doing little to protect the environment.



HFCs, while miniscule in concentrations, are very potent greenhouse gases, and one study argues that banning them would prevent 0.35 to 0.5 degrees of warming by 2100.



But Andrew Jones, who runs Climate Interactive, a popular site that estimates the effects of various policies, toldScience magazine, “I’m not really buying it,” referring to the 0.5-degree Celsius estimate.



He noted that the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates the effect to be closer to the 0.1-degree figure. The study cited by Kigali proponents is an outlier among much lower estimates.



HFCs do no significant harm to stratospheric ozone and are the most recent in a series of widely‐​deployed refrigerants. Through the 1950s, ammonia was the go‐​to chemical used for HVAC, but it also had a way of exploding into catastrophic and fatal residential fires.



Stable chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) replaced them. They are so stable that when leaked they survive all the way to the stratosphere, where the molecule is broken down, releasing highly reactive chlorine that destroys stratospheric ozone.



CFCs were then replaced by hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) which ate less ozone, with one‐​third of the chlorine per molecule. That was still too much for critics, so that’s when the HFCs came into the picture. They have no chlorine.



There are many possible replacements for HFC‐​134a, and among them are hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs), which are actually a bit more efficient at cooling than their predecessor and don’t seem to require major changes in compressor hardware. If the world is in a rush to ban the HFCs, HFOs are likely the refrigerant of choice.



The problem is they’re expensive. Two companies, Honeywell and Dupont, hold most of the patents for HFO refrigerants they have branded as Solstice and Opteon; that makes them much more pricey. It’s rumored that the two companies will soon go on an advertising blitz to tout the benefits of their substitutes for HFC-134A and counteract the high price. 



HFC‐​134a, out of patent and made in China, goes for a bit under $7 per pound. Solstice costs $71. A 3500‐​square‐​foot house’s heat pump will require approximately 15 pounds, or $105 worth of HFC‐​134a, but a whopping $1,056 worth of Solstice, and that’s without installer markup. A similar ratio applies to the three pounds that a car air conditioner uses.



Our friends in the EU have already mandated the elimination of HFCs for car air conditioners. Yet, Daimler stopped using the new HFO because under certain conditions (a severe head‐​on collision), it can lead to an aggressive fire.



It is now selling its E‐​class Mercedes with HFC‐​134a, and a legal fight has broken out over its sale. Volkswagen prefers inert carbon dioxide (CO2) as a refrigerant, and while it must be run at a much higher temperature than existing predecessors, the CO2 isn’t going to catch fire.



There may be an interesting co‐​benefit of using carbon dioxide. Manufacturers in Norway have devised a way to use waste heat to warm water. That’s a pretty nifty two‐​fer in the household appliance business.



Forcing Kigali down the world’s throat will stampede the cooling industry into very expensive HFOs. We’ll be forced to buy their more expensive air conditioners because they’re supposedly good for the planet, but the mainstream numbers show an undetectably low mitigation of global warming. 



All this of course is very good for DuPont and Honeywell, but not so for your wallet or the planet. Might we be hindering the development of cheaper alternatives like carbon dioxide compressors that can heat water while cooling the air?



Kigali is an inappropriate protocol purporting to stop global warming that was grafted onto a stratospheric ozone treaty.



Putting that legal faux‐​pas aside, does the Trump administration and two‐​thirds of the Senate really want to raise the price of a new heat pump by more than $1,000 for a virtually unmeasurable impact on global warming?

"The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, promised EasyJet that green taxes would not be levied on airlines six months before the company was given a £600m coronavirus crisis loan with no environmental conditions attached, newly released documents show. Direct lobbying against environmental taxes by Britain’s biggest airline are revealed in Freedom of Information Act responses obtained by Unearthed, Greenpeace’s investigations unit.  Evidence of the lobbying came as airlines across Europe were set to receive more than €26bn (£22.7bn) in taxpayers’ money for coronavirus bailouts with no binding environmental conditions attached, according to data compiled by Transport & Environment, Carbon Market Watch and Greenpeace. The meeting with Johan Lundgren, the boss of EasyJet, took place shortly after Shapps’s appointment as transport secretary last year. During the meeting, Shapps reassured the CEO he wanted the Department for Transport to be pro-aviation. In a separate meeting a month earlier with the chief executive of Heathrow, John Holland-Kaye, Shapps also stated that he wanted to reorient the transport department to be “more proactive in promoting aviation”. The easyJet boss used his meeting to criticise the Netherlands’ plans to levy green taxes on airlines, while Shapps “agreed this was not a way forward”. Environmental taxes on aviation to cut greenhouse gas emissions could involve a tax on departing passengers, a fuel tax, or making airlines pay for their emissions, all measures discussed in EU institutions.  But Lundgren said his company would instead be setting up its own sustainability targets, which would involve “gold standard” carbon offsetting, and that EasyJet was involved in the research and development of electric flights. Shapps said the government was committed to investing in electric flights. Minutes of the meetings with Lundgren reveal little talk bout any imperative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from aviation, or aviation’s contribution to the government’s new, legally binding target to reduce emissions to net zero by 2050. Emissions from aviation reached record levels last year, and in the past five years have risen by 26%; the sector is responsible for 12 percent of CO2 emissions from all transport sources. This month, with EasyJet flights hit by the coronavirus pandemic, Lundgren asked for and was given a £600m government bailout. The failure to attach any environmental conditions to the loan was a missed opportunity, campaigners say. Fiona Nicholls, climate campaigner at Greenpeace, said: “Carbon offsetting will not clean up aviation’s carbon emissions, just create the illusion it does. EasyJet is peddling snake oil and it’s shocking that the secretary of state seems so willing to buy it. “A green levy on frequent flyers offers the UK a fair more effective way of tackling the sector’s huge impact on our planet. Rather than dismissing the case out of hand, Grant Shapps needs to look again and take this moment to promote a measure that will genuinely have an impact on the climate emergency.” The loan to EasyJet was part of state financial support worth €26bn, either sought, or received, by airlines since the pandemic spread across Europe. None of the bailouts had environmental conditions attached. A spokesperson for EasyJet said: “We recognise we have a responsibility to minimise the impact of our flights and so are focused on both operating efficiently now, and on the development of electric aircraft in the future. Since the technological solution is not yet available, in the interim we offset the carbon emissions from the fuel used for all of our flights on behalf of all of our customers. The Committee on Climate Change says cutting greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 is necessary, affordable and desirable. Here are some of the actions needed to make that happen: • Petrol and diesel cars banned from sale ideally by 2030 and 2035 at the latest. • Quadrupling clean electricity production from wind, solar and perhaps nuclear, plus batteries to store it and connections to Europe to share the load. • Connection of new homes to the gas grid ending in 2025, with boilers using clean hydrogen or replaced by electric powered heat pumps. Plus, all homes and appliances being highly efficient.   • Beef, lamb and dairy consumption falling by 20%, though this is far lower than other studies recommend and a bigger shift to plant-based diets would make meeting the zero target easier. • A fifth of all farmland – 15% of the UK – being converted to tree planting and growing biofuel crops and restoration of peat bogs. This is vital to take CO2 out of the air to balance unavoidable emissions from cattle and planes. • 1.5bn new trees will be needed, meaning more than 150 football pitches a day of new forests from now to 2050. • Flying would not be banned, but the number of flights will depend on how much airlines can cut emissions with electric planes or biofuels.  “We have always said that taxing passengers is not the right approach, as this provides no incentives for airlines to improve the carbon efficiency of their flying, it simply acts as a revenue raiser for governments. The way for aviation to address climate change is to invest in new technology; a tax will simply reduce the funds available to airlines for investment, while only having a very marginal effect on emissions.” A separate meeting on 20 August last year with Holland-Kaye came as Heathrow’s expansion was under increasing scrutiny following the net-zero emissions target adopted by the British government that summer. Shapps told the Heathrow CEO that the national policy statement containing airport expansion plans was still government policy, “subject to future confirmation that it remained value for money”. In the past Shapps has been a vociferous supporter of Heathrow expansion, and he admitted to Holland-Kaye that he felt a “personal conflict of interest” discussing the matter, given his previous statements.  Since their meeting, Heathrow’s expansion has been thrown into doubt after the appeal court ruled in February that the government’s airline national policy statement was illegal, because ministers had not adequately taken into account the government’s commitments to tackle the climate crisis when drawing it up. Heathrow Airport is appealing against the judgment in the supreme court. A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “Aviation contributes around £14bn to the economy and creates half a million jobs. It is only right that we champion this sector, while continuing our work to make UK aviation the cleanest and greenest in the world.” “The sector must play its part in reaching the UK’s net zero by 2050 target. That’s why we are working with industry to develop new technologies, fuels to cut emissions and are taking a leading role driving international action for the sector.”"

When President Donald Trump declared in September his ambition of sustained US economic growth of between 3pc and 4pc per year, economists baulked.



A survey from the National Association for Business Economics found an overwhelming majority thought growth would slow by the end of this year, with significant headwinds thereafter from the effects of an ageing population. The Congressional Budget Office thought potential US GDP growth would slow to just 1.9pc per year.



The risks of trade wars started by renegotiating the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement and abandoning the Trans‐​Pacific Partnership, the potential for actual conflict with North Korea, and proposed clampdowns on immigration, would surely bring uncertainty that would dampen investment.



Well, the forecasters have been wrong, for now at least. Though the larger structural challenges remain, last week’s GDP numbers show the US growing at 3pc for the second quarter in a row. Business investment on new equipment increased at an 8.6pc annualised rate. The US unemployment rate has fallen to 4.2pc. All this before the Republicans have even delivered on their tax cut and reform package, which they are hopeful will slash the US federal corporate income tax rate from 35pc to 20pc, and lower marginal income tax rates too.



Sure, economic risks still exist. Only a fool would forecast sustained uninterrupted growth. But one shouldn’t write‐​off the Donald’s chances of delivering the robust economic performance he promised.



After working its way through Congress the final tax package could change substantially. Free‐​market critics are right that it seems a missed opportunity for broader, more substantial reform.



Nevertheless, should it be delivered, the economists Laurence Kotlikoff, Seth Benzell and Guillermo Lagarda estimate it alone could add between 3pc and 5pc to the level of GDP in the long‐​term. This would translate into wage rises of between 4pc and 7pc.



Critics of course will claim that Trump cannot take credit for this recent uptick in economic performance, because he has not fundamentally altered economic policy.



Though big on rhetoric in his campaign, there has no been no major infrastructure push. Republican attempts to overturn Obamacare and its taxes and mandates failed. Even tax reform hasn’t happened yet. But business leaders do appear to truly believe that economic growth prospects have improved under the new president, and when looking at the administration’s paradigm shift on regulation compared with the Obama era, it’s easy to see why.



All the time the media is focused on the Russia investigation and what Trump is tweeting, the US executive and Congress are slowly undertaking the biggest assault on the regulatory state since Ronald Reagan, if not before him. There have been some major public actions, of course — pulling out of the Paris climate agreement was a big signal the Trump administration would prioritise growth. Just last week Congress repealed a host of regulations in relation to banks. The real revolution, however, is coming through a combination of inaction, repeal and the setting of frameworks for new regulation that could substantially curb the regulatory state.



Back in August the American Action Forum compared Donald Trump’s regulatory performance in his first 200 days as president to Barack Obama’s. Trump, they concluded, had “imposed: 1/​20th of the lifetime costs, 1/​11th of the annual costs, and 1/​8th of the paperwork” through new regulations.



This week, the US Chamber of Commerce has tallied up Trump’s deregulatory actions, estimating that 29 executive orders straight from the president’s desk and 100 additional directives from government agencies have shrunk or eliminated regulatory requirements.



That’s before the efforts from the Republican‐​controlled Congress. They have been using the Congressional Review Act, a vehicle to repeal recent regulations and rules announced by regulatory agencies, to vote their disapproval on rules which came in at the end of the Obama presidency. Trump has subsequently repealed 14 regulations, with another pending. In fact, some Republicans are even examining the prospect of using a loophole in the Act to review old regulations and guidance from years before for which no report was submitted to Congress.



For new regulations, Trump has implemented a “one‐​in, two‐​out” rule akin to something the government in the UK has done. The administration is also keen to introduce more stringent regulatory budgets. Even in areas where legislative activity has floundered, such as healthcare, Trump’s recent executive order gives guidance that could relax regulations to allow people to be able to obtain renewable short‐​term insurance for far lower premiums than under Obamacare.



Individually, some of these actions are small fry. Others are more substantial. But the direction of travel is clear. Under Trump, there is an executive that believes in the power of supply‐​side economics, that wants to lower marginal tax rates on work and investment, and that wants a permissive, light‐​touch regulatory state.



To be sure, huge economic challenges remain. The US long‐​term fiscal outlook is still dreadful, almost entirely due to unreformed entitlement programmes in the face of an ageing population.



A break up of NAFTA negotiations really could lead to lots of short‐​term disruption. As with all economies on the technological frontier, the US economy in the coming decades could be transformed by artificial intelligence and new technologies with significant social consequences.



Yet political discourse is far less fatalistic in the US than in the UK about the ability for policy to improve matters. Trump is going to pull the levers of lower taxes and less regulation to try to pull the US economy back to higher growth in the coming years. And you’d be foolish to write him or America off.

Share this...FacebookTwitterCan We Expect Extreme Weather?
By Ed Caryl
The latest rallying cry from the catastrophic AGW crowd is that we can expect more heat waves, roaming heat waves, popping up unexpectedly and unpredictably. We hear this from Kevin Trenberth here (and refuted by Willis Eschenbach here), and from the PIK here. What about this? Is there any trend toward more heat waves and extremes?

Figure 1: Plot of zonal mean temperature anomaly versus the average over those same years. The 1998 and 2009 El Niños are clearly visible.
Above is a plot with three-month resolution of temperature trend by latitude and time from 1990 using GISS figures. This plot illustrates increasing volatility as one moves from the tropics to the poles. One problem with this plot is that there are few weather stations in the Arctic and Antarctic, so weather at one station represents a rather large area, so one storm system in the Arctic will have more weight than a similar system in the mid-latitudes or tropics. Another problem is that the Arctic had a series of warm periods in 2005 to 2007, and 2009 to 2012, resulting in a warm decade. The warm blobs north of 60 degrees north represent fewer than 10 stations.
A more realistic view will be that of satellites. The satellite coverage, especially in the Arctic and Antarctic, is total compared to surface stations. Here is a plot of tropical, northern hemisphere mid-latitude, and Arctic temperature anomalies over the satellite era.
Figure 2 is a plot of RSS satellite temperature anomaly for three latitude bands, tropical, from -20° to +20°, 20° to 82.5°, and 60° to 82.5°. The Arctic latitude band is offset downward by 1.5°C for clarity (scale on the right). The resolution is one month.

Figure 2: It is easy to see that the Arctic has much more temperature volatility than either the tropics or mid-latitudes, even though the mid-latitude plot includes the Arctic.
One can also see this volatility in Figure 1. But the question of the day is: Is that volatility increasing? To see that, I plotted the absolute value of the differential, the month to month difference, of the data in figure 2. These are plots of the temperature extremes, both cold and hot. The results are Figures 3, 4, and 5.

Figure 3: Plot of the absolute value of the extremes, month to month, for the tropics, 20° each side of the equator. The trend line is an order-3 polynomial.
As one can see in Figure 3, the temperature extremes have nearly no trend at all, just a slight rise in the 1980’s, and a very slight fall in this century. There are peaks around the time of El Niños, followed by calm weather after them.

Figure 4: Plot of the absolute value of the temperature differences, month to month, for the mid-latitudes, 20° to 82.5° north. The trend line is an order-3 polynomial.
In the mid-latitudes, extremes are larger than in the tropics because the arctic extremes are included. The trend was down in the 1980’s, up in the 1990’s, and down in this century.

Figure 5: Plot of the absolute value of the temperature swings, month to month, for the Arctic. The trend line is an order-3 polynomial.
In the Arctic, extremes are much larger. But the trend was down in the 1980’s, then flat with a slight recent reduction since 2007.
No evidence of a trend in increasing extremes
Is there any evidence in the past for an increase in extreme events in the future? A big, round, resounding NO. In fact, the evidence suggests the future may have fewer extreme events. This makes sense from the fact that as the Arctic warms, the temperature differential between the Arctic and the tropics becomes less. It is temperature difference that drives storms. The PIK and Kevin Trenberth are ignoring observations and playing out their climate catastrophe fantasies in computer models.

Last October, I blogged about _Comer v. Murphy Oil USA_, a lawsuit in Mississippi alleging that the defendant oil, coal, utility, and chemical companies emit carbon dioxide, which causes global warming, which exacerbated Hurricane Katrina, which damaged the plaintiffs’ property. Mass tort litigation specialist Russell Jackson called the case “the litigator’s equivalent to the game ‘Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon.’” In a brief that Cato was due to file this week, I framed the operative question as, “When a butterfly flaps its wings, can it be sued for the damage any subsequent tsunami causes?”   
  
  
The plaintiffs asserted a variety of theories under Mississippi common law, but the main issue at this stage was whether the plaintiffs had standing, or whether they could demonstrate that their injuries were “fairly traceable” to the defendants’ actions. The federal district court dismissed the case but a dream panel (for the plaintiffs) of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held that the plaintiffs could indeed proceed with claims regarding public and private nuisance, trespass, and negligence.   
  
  
In my blog post, I predicted that the Fifth Circuit would take up the case _en banc_ (meaning before all the judges on the court, in this case 17) and reverse the panel. And this was all set to happen — even though eight judges recused themselves, presumably because they owned shares of defendant companies — with _en banc_ argument slated for May 24. I was planning to head down to New Orleans for it, in part because the judge I clerked for, E. Grady Jolly, was going to preside over the hearing (the only two more senior active judges being recused).   
  
  
But a funny thing happened on the way to legal sanity. On Friday, not half an hour after I had finished editing Cato’s brief, the court clerk issued a notice informing the parties that one more judge had recused and, therefore, the _en banc_ court lacked a quorum. As of this writing, I still don’t know who this judge is and what circumstances had changed since the granting of the _en banc_ rehearing to cause the recusal. And indeed, by all accounts the Fifth Circuit is still figuring out what to do in this unusual (and, as far as I know, unprecedented) situation where a court loses a quorum it initially had — _having already vacated the panel decision_.   
  
  
In short, the court could decide that the vacatur stands and either remand to a (now‐​confused) district court or rehear the case in a new random panel assignment. More likely, however, the court will now reinstate the terrible, horrible, no good, very bad panel decision — and we’ll tweak our brief to make into one that supports the defendants’ inevitable cert petition.   
  
  
All in all, an illustration of the absurdity both of litigating climate change politics in the courts and of forcing judges (including Supreme Court justices) to withdraw from cases for owning a few hundred dollars’ worth of stock. If that’s all it takes to corrupt federal judges, we have bigger problems than trial lawyers run amok!

"**Door-to-door carol singing should ""probably not"" take place in Scotland this Christmas, the country's national clinical director has suggested.**
Professor Jason Leitch was responding to questions after new advice for England said it would be allowed in groups of up to six people.
He said the Scottish government had not yet taken a position on the issue.
But he was ""worried"" about door-to-door singing and his ""instant advice"" was that should probably not happen.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said they would look at any changes to the advice in England, and consider whether there was a case for a similar change in Scotland.
On Sunday, the UK government published its latest guidance on the rules which will apply in England over the Christmas period.
It said carol singing and carol services could take place as long as those involved followed advice on singing safely.
Door-to-door carol singing is also allowed, but groups must contain a maximum of six people.
The rules have been introduced because singing increases the risk of transmitting the virus through small droplets and aerosols in the air.
At her daily briefing, Ms Sturgeon said she had not yet looked at the English guidance.
However, she was ""not aware"" of any change to the general advice that singing was one of the things which could help transmit the virus.
Prof Leitch said that if anything, the evidence about the aerosol transmission of the virus had ""hardened"" - especially in unventilated spaces.
He acknowledged it was ""very hard"" for people to not be able to sing in choirs and at worship services, but that remained the advice.
Prof Leitch added: ""We haven't taken a position on outdoor carol singing.
""That would be less risky than indoor, but you have to remember that we have restrictions on the numbers that can meet, and door-to-door would also worry me.
""Going from door to door, I'm afraid we would be presented with the same challenges as we were at Halloween. So my instant advice is probably not.""
Children were advised to stay at home and not go guising door-to-door at Halloween.
The English guidance also says that Santa's grottos can open if they are in venues which are allowed to open under the tier system of Covid restrictions.
Ms Sturgeon said this was ""an important issue"" for a lot of people.
""I know we are working on guidance for Santa's grottos. I am not sure if it has been published in full yet, so we will publish that as soon as possible.""
Prof Leitch said the guidance had been worked on ""over the weekend"" and would be published soon."

Here we have a press release in 1999 (email 3384) from Environmental Media Services (Fenton Communications, operator of RealClimate.org) sent on behalf of the WWF to help bolster the Kyoto Protocol.
I loved this line:
Cities including New York and Tokyo may face flooding; large swathes of Latin America will suffer from drought and Australia’s Great Barrier Reef may be destroyed unless more is done to stop global warming, the World Wildlife Fund for Nature warned Tuesday.
There’s that weasel word “may” and of course no timeline is given. Here we are a decade later and this press release sounds like it could have been written yesterday for Durban. The gloom and doom hasn’t changed.
The other fun part is this: 
WWF commissioned the Climatic Research Unit at Britain’s University of East Anglia to conduct research into various climate change scenarios over the next few decades.
It projected that sea levels would rise between three-quarters of an inch to four inches per decade. This would threaten low-lying U.S. coastal cities such as New York, Boston, Baltimore and Miami with flooding. The Japanese cities of Tokyo and Osaka among others would also be at risk, it said.
I wonder how that research was accomplished and how much money was involved. “Commissioning” a scientific study usually means a predetermined result. Anyone have any idea what these commissioned studies were?
I’m pretty sure New York, Boston, Baltimore, and Miami are still here. Ditto for Tokyo and Osaka.
Here’s the full email:

"Starfish along much of the North American Pacific coast are dying in great numbers from a mysterious starfish wasting syndrome. As yet the cause of the syndrome is unidentified, and it’s not clear whether it’s a due to an environmental change, disease or or something else.  The early signs vary by species affected and include a deflated appearance, unnatural twisting of the body, and small lesions on the surface that increase in size and number. The wasting often progresses rapidly, leading to the softening of the starfish’s hard body, loss of arms, and eventually complete disintegration and death, sometimes over a period as short as few days. Similar die-offs have occurred before in the 1970s and the 1990s, but never before at this magnitude and over such a wide geographic area. The current bout of this wasting syndrome was first noted in ochre stars (Pisaster ochraceus) in June 2013 along the coast of Washington state during monitoring surveys conducted by researchers from Olympic National Park. As ONP is part the Multi-Agency Rocky Intertidal Network (MARINe), a long-term monitoring effort that extends down the whole west coast, researchers from Alaska to California were quickly alerted.  The majority of early observations were made in intertidal (tidepool) habitats and as a result most of the early reports were for ochre stars, the most common in the habitat, but others species affected include the mottled star (Evasterias troschelii), leather star (Dermasterias imbricata), and six-armed stars (Leptasterias).  In August, divers investigating subtidal habitats reported massive die-offs of sunflower starfish (Pycnopodia helianthoides) just north of Vancouver, British Columbia. Shortly afterwards, other subtidal sea star species in the region began showing signs of wasting. During October and November, a similar mass death of starfish occurred in Monterey, California, with another die-off of sunflower and ochre stars around Seattle, Washington, with the syndrome spreading throughout the Puget Sound. In mid-December, substantial numbers of wasting starfish were spotted around southern California. By the turn of the year it had been reported in 45 of the 84 MARINe sites from Anchorage to San Diego sampled since that summer, and in the last few months it has spread to Mexico and parts of Oregon, which had previously been unaffected. It is also intensifying, appearing at additional sites in those regions already affected.  In subtidal habitats, the sunflower star is typically the first species to succumb, followed by the rainbow star (Orthasterias koehleri), giant pink star (Pisaster brevispinus), giant star (Pisaster giganteus), mottled star, ochre star and sun star (Solaster), leather star (Dermasterias imbricata), vermilion star (Mediaster aequalis), six-armed stars, and bat star (Patiria miniata). We don’t know whether the syndrome spreads sequentially from one species to the next, or if some species simply take longer to express symptoms, but the usually large populations of ochre and sunflower stars have experienced massive, geographically expansive (if patchy) and well-documented declines. Other species are less abundant, so the impact of the syndrome is not as clear. Ecologists consider both sunflower and ochre stars to be keystone species because they have a disproportionately large influence on other species in their ecosystem. In fact it was ochre stars that Robert Paine experimented on when he coined the term keystone species in 1969. After removing many ochre seastars, a voracious predator of mussels, from his test area, he found that mussels out-competed other species and dominated areas where previously many species were attached to the rocky shore. Hence seastars were necessary to maintain the species composition. So it’s anticipated that the sheer number of starfish of different species that have died may lead to radical change the seascapes in the subtidal (below the tidal line) and intertidal (between high and low water marks) zones. This is what has occurred after widespread death of particular marine species on previous occasions, resulting in dramatic ecosystem-wide changes. From extensive samples collected researchers have begun to identify the agent behind the syndrome, and the environmental conditions that may have led to the outbreak. One of the top priorities is to confirm that an infectious agent is involved, and if so what it is. Molecular sequencing work of samples is underway at Cornell University to identify possible viruses and bacteria that could be causative agents.  Current thinking is that there is an infectious agent involved, likely a pathogen. Importantly there is no evidence at all that links the current wasting event to the ongoing disaster at the Fukushima nuclear facility in Japan. Long-term monitoring by MARINe groups and other partners along the entire west coast provides the information to compare distributions of different starfish species over 30 years.  MARINe has also developed a tracking log that can be downloaded from the seastarwasting.org website, which researchers, divers, and members of the public can use to report their observations, gathering information to help identify further outbreaks."
"The 2014 World Cup in Brazil is over. It brought much joy, and huge disappointment for the hosts – perhaps even worse than the Maracanazo in 1950. Now attention in Brazil will turn to hosting the next great inter-cultural event, the 2016 Rio Olympics. And the football world will plan for the next World Cup in another BRIC country, Russia in 2018.  But the global challenges faced by us all cannot just be addressed in four-year planning rounds. Climate change, biodiversity loss, deforestation and growing social and economic inequalities: these are all facing tipping points over the next 50 to 60 years, requiring some long-term thinking by governments and policymakers in both the fast-growing and already affluent countries of the world.  Thomas Piketty has shown in his hugely influential book, Capital in the 21st Century, that income in most countries is now distributed more unequally than in the 1970s, and the projections into the future are for this to worsen. The rich are getting relatively richer, the poor are getting relatively poorer, and the middle is becoming increasingly squeezed. There is evidence that unequal countries are unhappier.  The income Gini coefficient for Brazil is high, which means that relatively few people are reaping the rewards of Brazil’s economic successes of recent times. The same is true for all other BRIC countries, but many affluent nations too. Even in Germany and other northern European countries, which have traditionally been more equal, the Gini coefficient has been rising over the past two decades. If this trend continues, the world will increasingly become like the unequal parts of Brazil, not the other way around.  But citizens will not accept rising levels of inequality for long. The recent World Cup-related protests in Brazil show that people are discontent with poor public services and diverted public expenditure on infrastructure, like football and athletic stadiums, that appear to enrich those parts of the economy that are already wealthy. This might be a sign of things to come.  Brazilians are demanding better education and transport, as well as a clampdown on widespread corruption. Now that the World Cup is over, it is these issues that will keep Brazilian policymakers awake at night, not the host’s dismal performance in the semi-finals.  Another tipping point in the making is in the Amazon, the world’s largest rainforest. It is hugely important as one of the world’s most biodiverse places and a “carbon sink” of planetary importance. It is also crucial for regulating the weather for large parts of the North Atlantic area. There is evidence that the Amazon’s dry season is becoming longer, due to climate change and decades of deforestation. Less rainfall, more forest fires and continuing deforestation – these factors are already reinforcing one another, risking a dangerous tipping point for the entire rainforest. By the middle of this century large parts of the Brazilian Amazon could have become dry savannah with immense implications for the world’s carbon cycle and weather patterns, not to mention the planet’s gene pool. Although Brazil’s economy is greener than most of its peers, with less-than-average carbon emissions per capita, its hydropower and biofuel revolution have been contributing to deforestation. Large scale soy and maize plantations – largely for export to China – are also to blame. While the Brazilian government is trying to protect the Amazon from unregulated agricultural expansion, some agri-businesses have been lobbying hard for less stringent protection of the Amazon.  Brazil’s commodities-based export economy is not sustainable in the long-run. If Brazil’s wealth continues to be dependent on extractive models, which do not account for all of their, what economists call, externalities, then the Amazon will not survive, and we will breach more planetary boundaries.  There are alternative models of development that promise more equitable and sustainable futures. We demonstrate how communities in both affluent and developing countries are already taking action to build resilient and sustainable lifestyles in our forthcoming book, Ecocultures: Blueprints for Sustainable Communities. Ecocultures are exemplars in the art and science of sustainable living. For us, ecocultures are communities with high social capital, showing strong internal coherence and equity, as well as with close connections to nature. One of our case studies is from the south of Brazil. The Céu do Patriarca ecovillage is a self-organised, ecologically-driven community in the state of Santa Catarina. Established 25 years ago, the community has become a model for increased social, ecological and personal well-being and resilience. Our argument is not that we all have to move to ecovillages in the middle of the rainforest. But policymakers can learn from the design principles of these ecocultures, exploring opportunities for scaling them up to city, regional or even national levels.  This scaling-up has already begun. There are excellent examples of sustainable practices in Brazilian cities, such as Curitiba. Urban agriculture, for example, can reconnect people to nature, as well as provide local food to urban, and particularly disadvantaged, communities. In many ways the world is condemned to radically change its ways of life to face the challenges ahead. Ecocultures could provide policymakers in Brazil, and in other countries, with important lessons on how to transition to a more sustainable and equitable future. This might just save the planet. Brazil, though, might not want a World Cup for at least another 64 years."

Much of Northern Europe, including Britain, is suffering under the coldest winter and spring of the last 30 to 100 years. The Northeastern part of the United States has had a record cold March. The record cold in Europe has killed thousands and cost billions. It was not supposed to be this way.



Back in 1998, scientist Michael Mann published a paper with the famous “hockey stick” showing a sharp rise in global temperatures. Mr. Mann and others argued that if global action was not taken immediately, then the temperature rise would be rapid and uncontrollable. Much of Mr. Mann’s work was the basis for Al Gore’s famous film _An Inconvenient Truth_. What has turned out to be an inconvenient truth is that Mr. Mann and his allies were sloppy in their research and engaged in a campaign to disparage their critics.





It’s hard for believers to admit they’re wrong.



The United Kingdom’s Met Office has been a major source of global temperature data in recent decades, and has been heavily relied upon by global‐​warming proponents. On March 12, a report written by David Whitehouse and published by the Global Warming Policy Foundation concluded that “there has been no statistically significant increase in annual global temperatures since 1997.” In the accompanying chart, using the same official data from the Met Office that the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change uses, it can be easily seen that global temperatures have not been rising as predicted by the best‐​known climate models.



According to the Global Warming Policy Foundation, “The report shows that the temperature standstill has been a much discussed topic in peer‐​reviewed scientific literature for years, but that this scientific debate has neither been followed by most of the media, nor acknowledged by climate campaigners, scientific societies and prominent scientists.” Lord Turnbull, former Cabinet secretary and head of the Home Civil Service, commented: “Dr. Whitehouse is a man who deserves to be listened to. He has consistently followed an approach of examining observations rather than projections of large‐​scale computer models, which are too often cited as ‘evidence.’ He looks dispassionately at the data, trying to establish what message it tells us, rather than using it to confirm a pre‐​held view. “Those of us who have studied “public choice theory” are not particularly surprised that many scientists and their media followers are in denial about what is increasingly obvious — that is, most of the climate projections were just plain wrong. If a person has a strong vested interest in a particular point of view and obtains government grants to show what politicians want to hear, or if he has been very public in his beliefs based on faulty data or information, it is hard to say, “I was wrong.” Politicians embrace any theory that justifies more taxing, spending and regulating because their power increases along with the accompanying financial opportunities. Nobel laureate, economist and philosopher F.A. Hayek explained how there are limits to the knowledge that any one individual can possess, yet many have the “fatal conceit” that they know more than they do, and thus, they think they can plan and predict in ways they cannot. It is no surprise that climate models were wrong. For them to have been right, the model builders would have had to know all of the significant variables that affect climate, and the magnitude and interaction of each of those variables. There is virtually no single variable on which scientists are in total agreement about the magnitude of its effect. Carbon dioxide (CO2), for example, is considered to be very bad by most global‐​warming alarmists, including many officials in governments. We know that some level of CO2 is necessary for life, but we do not know the optimum level. The higher the level, the more rapidly plants grow, and the cheaper food becomes. It is just as plausible to say that there is too little CO2 in the atmosphere as that there is too much to maximize human well‐​being.





One of the world’s foremost experts on climate change, professor Roger Pielke Jr. of the University of Colorado at Boulder, recently wrote: “Flooding has not increased over the past century, nor have landfalling hurricanes. Remarkably, the U.S. is currently experiencing the longest‐​ever recorded period with no strikes of a Category 3 or stronger hurricane.” These anecdotes, along with a cold March, prove nothing one way or the other except that human beings know very little about what drives the climate.



Germany has spent more than 100 billion euros ($130 billion) on subsidizing the solar industry; yet, as _Der Spiegel_ reported, “the 1.1 million solar systems have generated almost no power” this winter, and Germany is forced to import power from elsewhere. They are paying three or four times the U.S. rate for electricity, making many of their industries noncompetitive. The U.S. has been equally stupid. Even _The New York Times_ has acknowledged that the U.S. ethanol experiment has been a disaster. It has actually increased carbon emissions and the price of fuel and world food, which really whacks the poor — all because of a “fatal conceit.”

"Mayors from many of the world’s leading cities have warned there can be no return to “business as usual” in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis if humanity is to escape catastrophic climate breakdown. City leaders representing more than 750 million people have published a “statement of principles”, which commits them to putting greater equality and climate resilience at the heart of their recovery plans.  Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York City and one of the signatories to the statement, said: “Half-measures that maintain the status quo won’t move the needle or protect us from the next crisis. “We need a new deal for these times – a massive transformation that rebuilds lives, promotes equality and prevents the next economic, health or climate crisis.” Many cities have already announced measures to support a low-carbon, sustainable recovery, from hundreds of miles of new bike lanes in Milan and Mexico City to widening pavements and pedestrianising neighbourhoods in New York and Seattle. In London, Sadiq Khan announced plans on Wednesday to give more space to cyclists and pedestrians across the capital in an effort to encourage “green and sustainable travel” and prevent a spike in car use and pollution after the lockdown. The move came as Transport for London modelling revealed there could be a 10-fold increase in cycling, and up to five times the amount of walking, compared with pre-coronavirus levels, if people returned to work but avoided public transport. Khan, who is vice-chair of the C40 group, said he was determined to “build a better future” in the aftermath of the pandemic. “Covid-19 has exposed the inequality in our society and deep flaws in our economy, which fail people from deprived communities more than anyone else,” he said. “We need to come out of this embracing a new normal and with a renewed drive to address the climate emergency.” In Greater Manchester, council leaders have unveiled plans to give more space for people walking and cycling across the region. With £5m of funding from the mayor, local authorities are planning a range of measures from extending pavements to creating one-way streets, removing through-traffic from residential neighbourhoods and building extra cycle lanes. Last week, mayors from cities in Europe, the US and Africa held talks as part of a newly formed C40 economic task force. They agreed to coordinate efforts to map out plans to support a low-carbon, sustainable recovery from the crisis. Mark Watts, the chief executive of C40, said mayors had a lot of power to protect their citizens and shape the direction of the recovery. “There is now a hell of a lot of collaboration among very powerful politicians who do think a green economic recovery is absolutely essential,” he said. “We are talking about collectively creating funds that they all put money into, which would then support electric vehicles, support rollout of cycle lanes, support retrofitting of buildings … C40 cities using the hundreds of millions of dollars in their pension funds for this and getting very good long-term returns.” The statement of principles has so far been signed by mayors representing 33 world cities from Los Angeles to Lisbon, São Paulo to Seoul, Melbourne to Mexico City. The statement warns that the recovery from Covid-19 “should not be a return to ‘business as usual’ – because that is a world on track for 3C or more of overheating.” It also states that immediate action on the climate will “accelerate economic recovery and enhance social equity, through the use of new technologies and the creation of new industries and new jobs”. Mike Bloomberg, the C40 board president and a former mayor of New York City, said: “This taskforce is committed to helping city leaders as they work on economic recovery in ways that lead us forward into the future, not back into the past. The principles we’ve outlined will guide our efforts to develop a new normal – one that is greener, healthier, and more prosperous for everyone.”"
"**India's economy has contracted for a second successive quarter, plunging the country into recession. Will improving car sales, a marker of growth, help drive a modest rebound in the near future? Nidhi Rai reports.**
Ashwin Arya recently bought a brand new Toyota Glanza for his family. The 30-year-old, who lives in Betuk, a town in Madhya Pradesh state, bought the car in June, when most of India was still shut after the world's longest coronavirus lockdown.
""My father had met with an accident and we desperately needed a car,"" Mr Arya said.
Mr Arya says the family had planned to buy a new vehicle even before the pandemic struck. But his father's accident hastened the purchase.
""My father has to go to work everyday. My mother and sister also use it for their daily activities. We needed a car for basic mobility as public transport is not good in Betul.""
On the back of such buying by customers like Mr Arya, the Indian automobiles sector, which contributes 7% to the country's Gross Domestic Product or GDP, recorded a good month in October. It's a small sign of hope for the Indian economy, which has now recorded two successive quarters of negative growth.
Many economists expect the economy to return to expansion mode as early as the December quarter if the pickup sustains. Some experts say the latest contraction - 7.5% - is still a positive sign, compared to the previous quarter's figure, 23.9%. Their optimism is backed by improving car sales and services sector performance as Covid case numbers fall and the promise of a vaccine grows.
Retail sales of automobiles in October 2020 were up by 5.1% compared to the previous month, according to Care Ratings. But they were still down by 23.9% compared to last year.
One reason for the slight improvement, experts believe, is pent-up demand. This also coincided with the festive season - the Hindus festivals of Dussehra and Diwali, which spur a lot of buying, account for 35-40% of total sales of the year.
The complete shutdown of public transport during the lockdown also created an urgency for private vehicles, prompting some people to buy them in case of another lockdown. And there are also first-time buyers who probably prefer not to use public transport or ride-hailing apps for fear of catching the virus.
""I think everyone is concerned with safety and therefore they prefer their own vehicle,"" says Abhishek Jain, who runs a used car store in Mumbai city.
But, much like other sectors in the economy, the sluggish growth in the auto sector too can't be entirely blamed on the coronavirus.
It has been in a slump since 2019 because of new emission standards, rising fuel charges, higher interest rates on loans and an overall slowdown in the economy.
In the last two years, more than 300 dealerships across the country have shut, according to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers.
""I don't know if we are back on our feet - we are looking at things on a month-on-month basis,"" says Vikram Kirloskar, vice chairman of Toyota Kirloskar Motors, India's fourth-largest car maker.
""Our order book is looking good. But we cannot plan for three months down the line.""
It also depends on the overall economy, says Manohar Bhat, vice president of sales and marketing at Kia Motors India. That is, if the economy starts growing again, people feel confident and spend money.
""If people feel rich, they will buy vehicles. So commenting on the future is going to be difficult as we all know that the economy is not doing well and will not do well in the next year,"" he said.
Although retailers expect pent-up demand from earlier in the year to be spread across the next six months, they are sceptical of any significant uptick.
Experts also agree that the current rebound may be deceptive. And auto makers believe sales are bound to fall steeply next year.
""I am not very hopeful,"" Vinkesh Gulati, president of the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations, said.
""Whatever positive [signs] we have seen, they will not continue. January onwards things are not looking good as of now."""
"The climate crisis will make insurance unaffordable for many people, particularly those in regional areas, as the damage from extreme weather events increases, a consumer group has warned. In a submission to the royal commission into natural disasters sparked by last summer’s unprecedented bushfires, the Consumer Action Law Centre calls for an urgent independent inquiry into the cost of insurance in light of heightened risks linked to global heating.  The group’s recommendations include the introduction of an insurance price monitor to prevent consumers being exploited, a standard definition of key terms such as “fire” in industry contracts and a modernised regime of what “standard cover” means so policies can be easily understood and compared. Gerard Brody, the Consumer Action Law Centre’s chief executive, said there was a risk home insurance could become unaffordable in the wake of last bushfire season, leaving many uninsured or under-insured. He said the issue had been compounded by the Covid-19 pandemic as many people affected by bushfires in regional communities later lost the income they relied on from tourism and hospitality. “Insurance promises to offer peace of mind, but with delayed claims, confusing policies that don’t always provide the expected coverage and woeful responses to financial hardship by the insurance industry we’re concerned that home insurance still isn’t working for many people,” Brody said. The law centre’s call follows similar warnings elsewhere. Murich Re, the world’s largest reinsurance company, last year told the Guardian that climate change could make cover for ordinary people unaffordable as it attributed US$24bn of losses from the Californian wildfires on human-induced heating. In October, the Reserve Bank of Australia found it was increasingly important that investors and institutions manage carbon risk, and warned insurers were the most directly exposed to climate change. It said inflation-adjusted insurance claims for natural disasters were more than twice as large last decade as the one before, and was likely to continue to grow. The Consumer Action Law Centre said since the summer bushfires it had received reports from community organisations in regional areas of significant delays in insurers undertaking assessments or arranging quotes for bushfire damage in remote parts of Victoria. It said problems spanned different types of natural disaster, citing an Australian Competition and Consumer Commission inquiry into insurance in northern Australia that found premiums had increased far more in that part of the country than elsewhere over the previous decade after insurers adopted a more fine-grained assessment of the greater risk in the north from cyclones and floods. The group said rising costs were increasingly being worn by people who needed insurance most, when historically risk had been shared across the community. “We have significant concerns about how this will play out as the impact of climate change worsens, particularly for regional parts of Australia where climate change means bushfires will be more frequent and more severe,” Brody said in the centre’s submission to the royal commission. “It was recognised in the letters patent of this royal commission that this is the reality Australia is facing. For Australians who live in areas increasingly at risk from bushfires, premiums are going to continually (and sometimes rapidly) increase. “If homeowners cannot afford to rebuild due to the cost of premiums or the impacts of underinsurance, then they will be forced to leave their community.” Consumer Action’s recommendations include the government introducing outstanding recommendations from the banking royal commission relating to insurance as a matter of urgency to ensure people were treated fairly. Submissions to the natural disasters royal commission close on Tuesday. A final report is due in August."
"How can animals, from ants to people, form social groups with individuals working successfully together for a common good? So Charles Darwin asked in 1859, perceiving the existence of cooperative behaviour as a threat to his theory of evolution. Such behaviour remains one of the biggest unanswered questions in science – one that our study, published in Ecology Letters, set out to answer with the help of a highly social bird, the sociable weaver. It’s easy to see why animals should behave selfishly: if you are to pass on your genes to the next generation you should aim to look after yourself, protect your resources, find a mate and reproduce – why would you care about others? As a result of such selfish interests conflict is rife in nature. But what is less well known is that cooperation is also widespread and can be observed at almost any level of biological organisation.  There has been much progress since Darwin, and we now understand a great deal more about how animals may benefit from working together. Although several important theories have been developed and tested over the past decades, kin selection theory has perhaps caused the greatest advance in our understanding of cooperation in animals. Introduced by Bill Hamilton in the 1960s it states that if an individual cooperates with its relatives, this individual may indirectly pass on its genes to the next generation. This is now generally accepted as the main explanation behind cooperation at the family level.  Cooperation, however, can be observed at a much larger scale, with large social groups working successfully together to construct and maintain a common good outside the context of breeding. How kin selection might promote such large social groups is much less straightforward, due to the usually low average levels of relatedness and the social dilemmas faced by individuals within those group. A well-known and widespread social dilemma is a phenomenon called the tragedy of the commons.  Under the tragedy of the commons, social benefits are highest in groups that cooperate, but selfish individuals do better within cooperative groups. If selfishness prevailed, public goods would become over-exploited and society would collapse. Examples from human society include over-exploitation of fish stocks, our failure to efficiently deal with climate change, and the collapse of the society of the original inhabitants of Easter Island. How do animals avoid such collapse and manage to keep freeloaders at bay? To find out, our research team at the University of Sheffield, led by Professor Ben Hatchwell, turned to sociable weavers (Philetairus socius) as a model system. This small passerine bird is extremely social and builds the largest nest of any bird – communally housing hundreds of individuals, weighing more than a tonne, and lasting for decades.  Their massive nest consists of individual nest chambers embedded within a communal thatch. The latter requires separate investment from the colony members and does not emerge from investment in the individual nest chambers. By studying the thatch we can investigate how the birds work together to maintain their public good. After detailed observations of their behaviour and tests to reveal the genetic relationships among the colony members, we found the birds contributing to thatch building did so above their own nest chamber. This indicates self-directed thatch building. However, we also found that these thatchers’ neighbours were often relatives, and that as they also benefited this suggests the thatch-building might be directed towards kin. In trying to corroborate that idea, we found that relatedness to near neighbours predicted thatch building: the more related an individual is to its neighbours, the more likely it is to contribute to the communal good.  Finally, we found related individuals tend to share the use of nest chambers and thus share the benefits of their communal investment among relatives. So these sociable birds benefit from having good neighbours, and from maintaining healthy family relationships – a lesson to us all, no doubt. Despite low relatedness at colony level, social organisation of relatives within the colony leads to communal investment being enjoyed by relatives, as well as contributing to the overall thatch important for the nest as a whole. This is the first study to show that kin selection may encourage the animal effort required to communally build and maintain a structure, and as such it may be relevant to the many other species that build some sort of structure. However, for that most cooperative of species, humans, the mechanism our study revealed is unlikely to apply directly.  Other solutions to the problem of cooperation exist, such as the enforcement of laws and agreements. Perhaps it is these we must turn to – the enforcement of sustainable fishing practices, for example – to ensure the tragedy of the commons is not replicated on a global scale."
"The dread that many people are feeling these days about the coronavirus is nothing new to those acquainted with climate grief. As terrible as the virus is, the heatwaves, droughts, fires and floods driven by an overheated planet have killed many more people. And if current trends persist, the death toll will increase exponentially through the end of the century. In the face of so much loss, grief is understandable. In his bestselling book How to Change Your Mind, journalist Michael Pollan reports that 80% of terminally ill patients in clinical trials at Johns Hopkins and New York universities felt less anxiety and depression after taking psychedelic drugs. Mark Hertsgaard, environment correspondent for the Nation and author of HOT: Living Through the Next Fifty Years on Earth, interviewed Pollan about whether those same drugs might also benefit people struggling not with their own death as much as the death of loved ones, future generations, and civilization as we know it. The interview has been edited for length and clarity. MH: Let’s be clear – in those clinical trials, terminally ill patients took psychedelic drugs under close medical supervision, right? But the results sound remarkable MP: Yes. Most of them had remarkable journeys that reset their thinking about death in many ways, removing their fear completely. And in most cases their depressions lifted. MH: Do those experiences and your other research suggest that psychedelic drugs can be an antidote to climate grief? MP: The first person I talked to about this was Rachael Petersen, an environmentalist. She worked at the World Resources Institute developing software that allows you to watch fires around the world in real time to see whether deals to protect lands, specifically in the Amazon, were being honored or not. This was incredibly depressing work. She watched the Earth burn in real time and as a result entered into a serious depression. She received psychedelic therapy, and while it was not a panacea she felt it helped her, allowed her to reset and continue to do this difficult work. MH: How did that reset happen? MP: I can’t speak for her, but one of the things psychedelics can do is [help] people find more hope in their circumstances. After these experiences, they tend to feel less isolated and more connected – more connected to other people, to the community, and to nature. It made her realize that there were a cohort of people like herself who’d been working on this issue a long time. They’ve seen us go backwards under the Trump administration, and they’re incredibly discouraged to the point of despair. To call it an antidote is perhaps a bit strong, but having an experience like this may help them deal with their depression. MH: If ‘antidote’ is too strong, would ‘treatment’ be a better word? MP: Yeah, I think it is a potential treatment. Does it fix the environmental crisis? No. But keeping these people mentally healthy is very important to all of us. This could shift their thinking in ways that allow them to go on doing really hard work that they might otherwise give up in despair. I think the challenge is to organize a study, take a group of people who struggle with climate grief, and see if this could indeed help them sustain their commitment. MH: But climate grief is different in important ways from an individual facing a terminal diagnosis. Climate grief is not necessarily about your own death but more about the death of the world around you – a kind of collective, civilizational death MP: Yeah, and here’s what the parallels break down a little bit, because part of what psychedelic therapy seems to do for individuals is reconcile them to death. And that sort of acceptance is the last thing you want in a climate activist! MH: Are psychedelics relevant to climate grief in any other ways? MP: Yes, and this applies not so much to activists as to all of us. Researchers at Imperial College London found that a single experience on psychedelics, specifically psilocybin, changes measures of what is called “nature connectedness” – the extent to which you feel you are a part of nature. In people who had a single psilocybin journey scores of “nature connectedness” went up consistently and fairly dramatically. This rings true to me and to many of the people I’ve interviewed. You are less likely to objectify nature after a psychedelic experience. A high dose psychedelic experience often shrinks the ego. The ego typically perceives the world as if there’s a single subject – you – while everything else is an object. This sort of egotism, I think, is at the heart of our environmental crisis – our ability to objectify nature and see ourselves as standing outside of it. Once you objectify something, it becomes a thing you can use for your own purposes, that you can exploit. So, to the extent the psychedelic experience seems to bring down these walls of ego and open up this powerful sense of connection, it has – at least theoretically – the potential to shift consciousness around the environment. And God knows we need that. MH: You’re a parent. I’m a parent; my daughter just turned 15. A big part of my climate grief relates to the future she’s going to inherit. And not just her but the countless other kids around the world in her generation. Can psychedelics be helpful to parents dealing with climate grief? MP: I think potentially [it can], to the extent that many years of doing this work has dug a certain groove in your mind. There’s a beautiful metaphor one of the neuroscientists working on psychedelic research in London offered me. Think of your mind as a hill covered in snow, and your thoughts are sleds going down that hill. The more rides on those sleds over time, the deeper become the grooves. After a while, there’s no other way to go down the hill but in those grooves. Think of psychedelics as a fresh snowfall that fills all the grooves, allowing you to take a new path down the hill. MH: I’ve covered climate change as a journalist for 30 years, and when people ask, I always say that the only solution to climate grief for me is taking action – doing something to make me feel I’m having an effect on this. Taking action is clearly a climate solution. Are psychedelic drugs, in a different way, also a climate solution? MP: No, I wouldn’t go that far. I think they could be a climate tool, to help us fight the battle, keep up our morale. I think the action we take around our food choices – giving up meat, for example – is more certain to have a positive effect than taking psychedelics … But what’s exciting and new is that we’re coming to recognize psychedelics’ therapeutic value. We face existential crises on the order of someone facing a terminal diagnosis. And the fact that psychedelics can help those people is reason enough to explore their relevance for people facing that more collective sense of existential dread.

The U.S. economy is in its 10th year of economic expansion, and state government budgets are benefiting from a solid growth in tax revenues. State general fund revenues have grown 40 percent since 2010. Many of the nation’s governors have used the growing revenues to expand spending programs, whereas others have pursued reductions in taxes.



That is the backdrop to this year’s 14th biennial fiscal report card on the governors, which examines state budget actions since 2016. It uses statistical data to grade the governors on their taxing and spending records — governors who have cut taxes and spending the most receive the highest grades, whereas those who have increased taxes and spending the most receive the lowest grades.



Five governors were awarded an A on this report: Susana Martinez of New Mexico, Henry McMaster of South Carolina, Doug Burgum of North Dakota, Paul LePage of Maine, and Greg Abbott of Texas. Eight governors were awarded an F: Roy Cooper of North Carolina, John Bel Edwards of Louisiana, Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania, Jim Justice of West Virginia, Dennis Daugaard of South Dakota, David Ige of Hawaii, Kate Brown of Oregon, and Jay Inslee of Washington.



Governors of every state are having their fiscal choices shaped by the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. State income tax bases are tied to the federal tax base, so gover‐ nors have been considering which federal changes to conform to. Also, the capping of the federal tax deduction for state and local taxes has increased the bite of those taxes for millions of households. The cap has increased the relative burden of living in a high‐​tax state, and it may induce higher out‐​migration from those states over time.



The state fiscal environment is also being shaped by recent Supreme Court decisions regarding online sales taxes and public‐​sector labor unions. Furthermore, the legalization of marijuana has created a new source of revenue for some states.



This report discusses these fiscal policy developments and examines the tax and spending actions of each governor in detail. The hope is that the report encourages more state policymakers to adopt the fiscal approaches of the top‐​scoring governors.



Governors play a key role in state fiscal policy. They propose budgets, recommend tax changes, and sign or veto tax and spending bills. When the economy is growing, governors can use rising revenues to expand programs, or they can return extra revenues to citizens through tax cuts. When the economy is stagnant, governors can raise taxes to close budget gaps, or they can trim spending.



This report grades governors on their fiscal policies from a limited-government perspective. Governors receiving an A are those who have cut taxes and spending the most, whereas governors receiving an F have raised taxes and spending the most. The grading mechanism is based on seven variables, including two spending variables, one revenue variable, and four tax-rate variables. The same methodology has been used on Cato’s fiscal report cards since 2008.



The results are data-driven. They account for tax and spending actions that affect short-term budgets in the states. However, they do not account for longer-term or structural changes that governors may make, such as reforms to state pension plans. Thus, the results provide one measure of how fiscally conservative each governor is, but they do not reflect all the fiscal actions that governors make.



Tax and spending data for the report come from the National Association of State Budget Officers, the National Conference of State Legislatures, the Tax Foundation, the budget agencies of each state, and news articles in _State Tax Notes_ and other sources. The data cover the period January 2016 through August 2018, which was a time of budget expansion in most states.1 The report rates 43 governors. It excludes the governors of Alabama, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, New Jersey, and Virginia because of their short time in office, and it excludes Alaska’s governor because of the peculiarities of that state’s budget.



The following section discusses the highest-scoring governors and the differences between governors of the two political parties. The section after that looks at recent developments that have affected state fiscal policy, including the 2017 federal tax law, recent Supreme Court rulings, and the legalization of recreational marijuana. Appendix A discusses the report card’s methodology. Appendix B provides summaries of the fiscal records of the 43 governors included in the report.



Table 1 presents the overall grades for the governors. Scores ranging from 0 to 100 were calculated for each governor based on seven tax and spending variables. Scores closer to 100 indicate governors who favored smaller-government policies. The numerical scores were converted to the letter grades A to F.



 **Table 1: Overall grades for the governors**





The following five governors received grades of A:



All the governors receiving a grade of A in this year’s report are Republicans, and six of the eight governors receiving an F are Democrats. There have been some high-scoring Democrats on past Cato report cards, but Republican governors tend to focus their agendas more on tax and spending cuts than do Democrats.



This Cato report has used the same grading method since 2008. In that year, Republican and Democratic governors had average scores of 55 and 46, respectively. In 2010, their average scores were 55 and 47; in 2012, 57 and 43; in 2014, 57 and 42; and in 2016, 54 and 43.



That pattern continues in the 2018 report. This time, Republican and Democratic governors had average scores of 55 and 41, respectively. Republicans received higher scores than Democrats, on average, on both spending and taxes, although the Republican advantage on taxes was greater than on spending.



When states develop budget gaps, Democratic governors often pursue tax increases to balance the budget, while Republicans focus on spending restraint. When the economy is growing and state coffers are filling up, Democrats tend to increase spending, while Republicans tend to both increase spending and pursue tax cuts.



Figure 1 shows state general fund spending since 2000, based on data from the National Association of State Budget Officers.3 Spending soared between 2002 and 2008 and then fell during the recession as states cut their budgets. Since then, spending has bounced back strongly and has grown at an average annual rate of 3.7 percent since 2010.



 **Figure 1: State general fund spending**





Education is the largest area of state spending. It accounts for 30 percent of total state budgets, with about two-thirds of the spending going toward K–12 schools and one-third going toward higher education.4 Over the most recent five years of data, state-funded K–12 spending grew at an average annual rate of 4.3 percent.5



The other key driver of state budgets is Medicaid, which is funded jointly by federal and state taxpayers. This giant program pays for the health care and long-term care of 75 million people.6 Medicaid accounts for 29 percent of total state spending. State-funded Medicaid spending grew by 6.0 percent in 2015, 4.1 percent in 2016, 7.8 percent in 2017, and about 7.3 percent in 2018.7



On the revenue side of budgets, states enacted overall net tax cuts in 2014 and 2015 but swung to net tax increases in 2016, 2017, and 2018.8 Cigarette and gasoline tax increases have been pursued by both Democratic and Republican governors. Since 2015, 16 states have enacted cigarette tax increases and 19 states have enacted gas tax increases.9 By contrast, income tax policy divides the parties, with many Democrats supporting increases and Republicans supporting decreases.



The federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 cut individual and corporate income tax rates, but it also changed individual and corporate tax bases. Those base changes affected state tax systems because nearly every state with an income tax conforms to the federal income tax base to some extent.10



The states are about evenly split between those that automatically conform to federal tax changes (“rolling conformity”) and those that occasionally pass legislation to conform to the federal code that exists at a particular date (“fixed conformity”). There are also a few states that update their tax bases selectively, choosing to conform to only some parts of the federal tax code.



In most states, individuals start their state income tax calculations with federal adjusted gross income (AGI). In other states, individuals start with federal taxable income or a state-specific measure of income. Consider the expansion of standard deductions and the elimination of personal exemptions under the 2017 federal tax law. Those changes altered state tax bases in those states that start with federal taxable income and in states that use federal definitions of deductions and exemptions.



Other federal tax changes altered state tax calculations for itemized deductions, child credits, small business capital expensing, and other items. The new federal deduction for pass-through businesses will affect the tax bases of states that conform to federal taxable income. Other states will have to decide whether to add this new deduction to their codes.



All in all, the 2017 federal tax reform generally broadened state tax bases and thus boosted state tax revenues. In recent months, governors and state legislatures have wrangled over how much of the increased state revenues to return to taxpayers.



South Carolina’s situation is representative of that faced by many states. A state report noted that if “the state doesn’t take action to account for the federal changes, South Carolina would receive a few million dollars more in income tax revenue but, by default, create a duplicative tax system that would likely be a nightmare to tax filers. Meanwhile if legislators decide to conform to federal reform without making major changes to the state’s tax code, South Carolina could generate a whopping $200 million in extra revenue. . . . Yet another option would be for the state to conform to the federal code and make changes to the state’s tax code to offset the extra revenue.”11



As a fixed conformity state, if South Carolina does not respond to the federal change, taxpayers will deal with new tax rules that differ between their federal and state returns. A second option would be for South Carolina to pass legislation simply conforming to the federal law, but that would result in a large state tax increase. A third option would be to pass legislation conforming to federal law but also cutting state taxes. That approach is favored by South Carolina’s governor, Henry McMaster, but he and the legislature have not yet agreed on a plan to do so.12



Other states have pursued different paths. The best response has been from states that have conformed to the federal law but cut state income tax rates to hold taxpayers harmless, such as Idaho and Georgia. Idaho, for example, conformed to the federal tax law, which raised the state’s taxes by about $100 million a year, but Governor Butch Otter more than offset that increase by signing legislation that cut individual and corporate income tax rates and saved taxpayers about $200 million.13 Other states, such as Michigan and Nebraska, offset the tax-increasing effect of the 2017 federal tax law with state tax base adjustments rather than tax rate cuts. Still other states conformed to the federal law and pocketed the extra cash rather than giving it back to taxpayers. Colorado, for example, will pocket at least $200 million a year in extra state tax revenue and state policymakers plan to spend it.14



The government workforce is heavily unionized. In 2017, 36 percent of state and local government workers were members of labor unions, which was five times the private-sector share of 7 percent.15 About two-thirds of government education workers are members of unions.16



The union share in state and local government workforces varies widely, from less than 10 percent in North Carolina to about 70 percent in New York.17 Union shares are correlated with state rules regarding collective bargaining. Three-quarters or more of the states have collective bargaining for at least some state and local workers. But North Carolina, Virginia, and some other states ban collective bargaining in the public sector.



Public-sector union shares are also correlated with “agency shop” rules. These rules require workers to either join their workplace union or pay the union an agency fee. In 2018, 23 states were agency-shop states, and 27 states were right-to-work states, where workers cannot be forced to join a union or pay union fees.18 Right-to-work states generally have lower union shares in their workforces.



Union rules for public employees changed in June 2018 when the U.S. Supreme Court decided _Janus v. American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees_ (AFSCME). In that case, the court found that public employees cannot be forced to pay agency fees as a condition of their employment.



This ruling will weaken unions in state and local governments. The _New York Times_ predicted that public-sector unions “are going to get smaller and poorer in the coming years” and cited experts who expect membership to shrink by 10 to 30 percent. As the _Times_ noted, “in the five years after Michigan passed a law ending mandatory union fees in 2012, the number of active members of the Michigan Education Association dropped by about 25 percent.”19



A drop in union membership would improve government finances because lawmakers would have more flexibility to restrain costs and improve state efficiencies. Unions tend to use their political power to push for higher wages and benefits. On average, public-sector unions increase compensation levels for their members by about 8 percent.20 When he was running for governor of Illinois in 2002, Rod Blagojevich apparently promised AFSCME large wage increases for their members if he was elected in return for their support on his campaign.21



Unions reduce government efficiency in other ways. Unions tend to protect poorly performing workers, they often push for larger staffing levels than are required, and they discourage the use of volunteers in government activities. They also tend to resist the introduction of new technologies and to create more rule-laden workplaces.



In Wisconsin, Governor Scott Walker signed into law public-sector union reforms in 2011. These reforms imposed restrictions on collective bargaining, including rules requiring that unions be recertified every year. Walker also signed legislation in 2015 making Wisconsin a right-to-work state. In response, the share of Wisconsin’s public-sector workers who belong to unions plunged from 50 percent in 2011 to 19 percent in 2017.22 With the _Janus_ ruling, we may see similarly large drops in union membership in other states.



Before a U.S. Supreme Court decision in 2018, businesses were generally not required to collect online sales taxes for a state unless they had a physical presence in that state. That approach limited online taxation and allowed e-commerce to boom over the past two decades.



Prior to the ruling, large businesses with physical property or employees in many states, such as Amazon, collected online sales taxes, but the physical presence rule shielded smaller businesses from the compliance burden of collecting all the different sales taxes across all the states that their customers lived in. There are more than 10,000 state and local jurisdictions in United States that impose sales taxes.



The 2018 Court decision, _South Dakota v. Wayfair_ , overturned the physical presence rule and opened the door to broader online taxation.23 In the decision, the court identified features of South Dakota’s online tax approach that it viewed favorably. South Dakota’s law exempts small online retailers whose revenue from South Dakota falls below a certain threshold and who complete fewer than a certain number of transactions in the state. And South Dakota has a single state-level administrator of sales taxes and fairly uniform sales tax bases and rates statewide. In response to the Supreme Court’s approval of South Dakota’s approach, many other states are modifying their online sales tax efforts to conform to it.



Some analysts fear, however, that the _Wayfair_ decision will lead to a “wild west” of states aggressively expanding their taxation beyond their borders.24 In turn, that would advantage larger online businesses over smaller ones.25 Even when the physical presence standard held, many states stretched it with a patchwork of tax rules tied to computer cookies, airport stopovers, and other dubious measures of presence. The _Wayfair_ decision may encourage states to adopt simpler approaches to taxing online commerce, but we will have to see.



The _Wayfair_ decision has caused consternation among the five states that do not impose statewide retail sales taxes. New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu issued a press release declaring that the state “will erect every possible and constitutionally permissible legal and procedural hurdle to prevent other states from forcing our businesses to collect sales and use taxes. . . . We will send a message to every out-of-state taxing jurisdiction and authority. If you try to come into our state and force our businesses to collect a sales tax in a manner that violates our laws or the United States Constitution, you will be in for the fight of your life.”26 Montana officials are also concerned about the Supreme Court decision.27 One Montana newspaper said that the ruling “will create a huge and expensive burden for small and medium-size Montana businesses that sell online but don’t have the capacity or financial ability to track and collect sales taxes.28



Online sales are still less than 10 percent of all retail sales, so there is no desperate need for states to grab more revenue in this manner.29 About half of all e-commerce is already taxed. Uncollected e-commerce taxes are, at most, $13 billion nationally, which is only about 4 percent of total U.S. sales tax collections.30



Despite the rise of online sales, sales tax revenue has kept pace with the growth of the economy over the past three decades. General sales tax revenues as a percentage of gross domestic product have dipped only slightly, from 2.1 percent in 1990 to 2.0 percent today.31



States that expand their online sales tax efforts should minimize the compliance burden on businesses by simplifying their sales tax structures. They should also offset the added revenues collected with a reduction in sales or income tax rates.



Recreational marijuana is now legal in Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont, Washington State, and the District of Columbia. One incentive for states to legalize marijuana is to raise tax revenues. All these jurisdictions except Alaska impose special retail sales taxes on marijuana, ranging from 10 percent in Nevada and Maine to 37 percent in Washington State.32 In addition, Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, and Nevada impose taxes on growers. Vermont policymakers have not yet settled on tax rates.



In 2017, Colorado raised $247 million from marijuana taxes, Washington State raised $319 million, and Oregon raised $70 million.33 Cato’s Jeffrey Miron estimates that nationwide legalization could raise about $12 billion for federal, state, and local governments.34



However, we do not know the tax rates in states that may legalize pot in coming years, nor do we know the consumer responses to those taxes. If states set their tax rates too high, a substantial part of consumer demand will continue to be satisfied on the black market. A recent empirical study found that the “medium-run elasticity of demand for marijuana is higher than the consensus estimates for cigarettes or gasoline.”35 Thus, policymakers should take care to keep marijuana tax rates low.



Legalizing recreational marijuana will be on the ballot this November in Michigan, and governors and legislators in many other states are considering legalization. North of the border, recreational marijuana will be legal nationwide in Canada starting in October 2018.



The 2017 federal tax reform law was the largest overhaul of the federal income tax in decades. The law changed deductions, exemptions, and tax rates for individuals while also changing the tax base and rates for businesses.



One key reform was the capping of the federal deduction for state and local taxes (SALT) at $10,000. That cap, along with the doubling of the standard deduction, will reduce the number of households deducting state and local income, sales, and property taxes from 42 million in 2017 to 17 million in 2018.36 For taxpayers who continue to take the deduction, the average benefit will be much smaller.



Before this change in the law, federal deductibility effectively subsidized high-tax states and encouraged them to load taxes onto high earners. It also encouraged government expansion. As the Congressional Budget Office noted of the SALT deduction, “Because of the subsidy, too many [government] services may be supplied, and state and local governments may be bigger as a result.”37



With the capping of the deduction, millions of households will feel a larger bite from state and local taxes, and thus become more sensitive to tax differences between the states. The tax law may increase the outflow of mainly higher-income households from high-tax states to low-tax states. The states where SALT deductions were the largest relative to incomes were high-tax states such as New York, New Jersey, and California.38



If high earners move out of high-tax states in substantial numbers, it would be a blow to state revenues. In New York, the top 1 percent of earners pay 41 percent of state income taxes, and in New Jersey the share is 37 percent.39 In California, the top 1 percent pay a remarkable 50 percent of state income taxes.40



The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) publishes data showing the interstate movements of tax-filing households.41 The data show that 2.8 percent of households moved between states in 2016. There are an average 2.1 people per household in the IRS data.42



Some states gain residents from interstate migration, and some states lose them. The largest loser from interstate migration is New York. In 2016, it lost 218,937 households to other states and gained 142,722 households from other states, for a net loss of 76,215. The other states with the largest net migration losses were Illinois (41,965 households); New Jersey (25,941); California (25,913); Pennsylvania (19,516); Massachusetts (14,549); Ohio (13,254); Connecticut (12,254); Maryland (12,068); and Michigan (10,325).



Where did those domestic migrants go? The largest net inflows were to Florida (95,072 households); Washington State (30,480); North Carolina (25,601); Colorado (24,672); Arizona (24,211); Oregon (21,729); Texas (19,414); South Carolina (18,519); Georgia (17,798); and Nevada (14,236). These 2016 migration flows generally reflect extended trends. New York has been losing residents to other states for decades, while Florida has been gaining residents for decades.



Each state’s attractiveness can be measured by the ratio of gross inflows to gross outflows. States losing population have ratios less than 1.0, whereas states gaining population have ratios greater than 1.0. New York’s ratio was 0.65 in 2016, meaning that for every 100 households that left the state, only 65 households moved in. Florida’s ratio was 1.45, meaning that 145 households moved in for every 100 that left.



Even before the new federal tax law, Americans tended to move from higher-tax states to lower-tax states. Looking at the 2016 migration flows, 286,431 households (consisting of 578,269 people) moved, on net, from the 25 highest-tax states and the District of Columbia to the 25 lowest-tax states in that single year. Taxes are measured as state and local sales, property, and individual income taxes as a percentage of personal income.43



Figure 2 plots state migration ratios on the vertical axis and state tax ratios on the horizontal axis. The figure shows a clear negative relationship between migration ratios and tax levels. On the left, states have lower taxes and net in-migration (a ratio greater than 1.0). On the right, states have higher taxes and net out-migration (a ratio less than 1.0).



 **Figure 2: Tax levels and net migration ratios, 2016**





Of the 25 highest-tax states, 24 had net out-migration. Of the 25 lowest-tax states, 17 had net in-migration. The figure includes a fitted regression line that shows the correlation between interstate migration and tax levels.44



Interstate migration is influenced by many factors other than taxes, including job opportunities, housing costs, and climate. Experts disagree on how large a role taxes play in migration, but that role will certainly increase under the 2017 federal tax law. A recent Cato Institute study explored these relationships in more detail.45



The new federal tax law has ushered in an era of increased interstate tax competition. Governors should rethink their tax codes with an eye to retaining and attracting residents and businesses. They should consider how to reduce tax rates and improve the efficiency of their state’s public services to give their taxpayers more value for their money.



This study computes a fiscal policy grade for each governor based on his or her success at restraining taxes and spending since 2016, or since 2017 for governors who entered office in that year. The spending data used in this study come from the National Association of State Budget Officers (NASBO) and, in some cases, from the budget documents of individual states. The data on proposed and enacted tax cuts come from NASBO, the National Conference of State Legislatures, news articles in _State Tax Notes_ , and many other sources.46 Tax-rate data come from the Tax Foundation and other sources.



This year’s report uses the same methodology as the 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, and 2016 Cato fiscal policy reports. The report focuses on short-term taxing and spending actions to judge whether the governors take a small-government or a big-government approach to fiscal policy. Each governor’s performance is measured using seven variables: two for spending, one for revenue, and four for tax rates. Their overall score is calculated as the average of their scores in these three categories. Tables A.1 and A.2 summarize the governors’ scores.



 **Table A.1: Spending and revenue changes**





The two spending variables are measured on a per capita basis to adjust for state populations that are growing at different rates. Also, the spending variables measure only the changes in general fund budgets, which are the budgets that governors have the most control over. Variable 1 is measured through fiscal 2019, and variable 2 is measured through fiscal 2018. Variables 3 through 7 cover changes from January 2016 to August 2018, or from January 2017 to August 2018, for governors who entered office in 2017.



For each variable, the results are standardized so that the worst scores fall near zero and the best scores fall near 100. The scores for each of the three categories — spending, revenue, and tax rates — are calculated as the average score of the variables within the category, with one exception: the cigarette tax rate variable is quarter-weighted because that tax is a smaller source of state revenue than the other taxes measured in its category. The average of the scores for the three categories produces the overall grade for each governor.



This report uses publicly available data to measure the fiscal performance of the state governors. There are, however, some unavoidable problems in such grading. For one, this report card cannot fully isolate the policy effects of the governors from the fiscal decisions of their states’ legislatures. Governors and legislatures both influence tax and spending outcomes, and if a legislature is controlled by a different party, a governor’s control may be diminished. To help isolate the performance of governors, variables 1 and 3 measure the effects of each governor’s proposed, although not necessarily enacted, policies.



Another factor to consider is that the states grant governors differing amounts of authority over budget processes. For example, most governors are empowered with a line-item veto to trim spending, but some governors do not have that power. Another example is that the supermajority voting requirement to override a veto varies among the states. Such factors give governors different levels of budget control that are not accounted for in this study.



Nonetheless, the results presented here should be a good reflection of each governor’s fiscal approach. Governors who received a grade of A have focused on reducing tax burdens and restraining spending. Governors who received a grade of F have pursued government expansion. In the middle are many governors who gyrate between different fiscal approaches from one year to the next.



Below are highlights of the fiscal records of the 43 governors covered in this report. The discussions are based on the tax and spending data used to grade the governors as well as on other information that sheds light on each governor’s fiscal approach.48 Note that the grades are calculated based on each governor’s record since 2016, or since 2017 if that year was the governor’s first in office.



Doug Ducey, Republican Legislature: Republican



Grade: C Took office: January 2015



Doug Ducey has a background in business and finance, and before taking office he was the head of Cold Stone Creamery. As governor, he has overseen fairly lean budgets, with general fund spending rising 1.3 percent in 2017 and 2.0 percent in 2018. In 2016, Ducey approved pension reforms that trimmed benefit costs and gave new hires the option of a defined-contribution pension plan.



When Ducey was running for office, he promised that he would not raise taxes, and he has signed into law some modest tax cuts.49 He has approved legislation to end sales taxes on some business purchases, to reduce insurance premium taxes, to increase depreciation deductions, and to index income tax brackets for inflation.



However, Ducey also signed into law an extension of a temporary sales tax surcharge to fund education.50 The 0.6 percentage point addition to the sales tax rate raises more than $600 million a year. Additionally, Ducey imposed a new car registration charge on Arizonans, which will raise about $149 million a year.51 These actions amount to substantial tax increases.



Arizona voters had been gearing up to make a big decision on taxes on the November 2018 ballot. They were to decide whether to hike the top individual income tax rate by 4.46 percentage points to fund more school spending. However, the Arizona Supreme Court shot down the measure on technical grounds in late August.52



Asa Hutchinson, Republican Legislature: Republican



Grade: C Took office: January 2015



Former U.S. congressman and federal official Asa Hutchinson entered the Arkansas governor’s office in 2015. Hutchinson campaigned on a middle-class tax cut, which he delivered soon after taking office. He signed into law reduced tax rates for households with annual incomes of less than $75,000, which has saved them about $90 million a year. As the governor said, “Arkansas has been an island of high taxation for too long, and I’m pleased that we are doing something about that.”53



In 2017, Hutchinson approved a further $50 million in tax cuts, primarily for moderate-income individuals.54 And in 2018, as a task force was considering major tax reform, Hutchinson proposed cutting the top individual income tax rate from 6.9 percent to 6.0 percent. He would offset the lost revenue with budget surpluses and the closure of narrow tax breaks.55



Jerry Brown, Democrat Legislature: Democratic



Grade: D Took office: January 2011



Governor Jerry Brown received poor grades on previous Cato report cards, and he does so again on this one. He scored poorly on both taxes and spending.



California’s general fund budget increased 4.0 percent in 2017 and 6.2 percent in 2018, and it is set to increase 9.2 percent in 2019.56 Under Brown, the state’s general fund budget rose 52 percent between 2011 and the enacted amount for 2019. State government employment has risen 12 percent since 2013.57



Perhaps Brown’s most wasteful spending is on the state’s high-speed rail project, which despite its high cost will do little to relieve congestion. The projected cost of the project has soared from $33 billion to $77 billion, and officials admit it could rise to $98 billion.58 And those are just the capital costs: taxpayers will also be hit by a share of the project’s operating costs if it is ever completed.59



Brown has been lucky in that revenues have poured into the state’s coffers from growth in Silicon Valley in recent years. However, the next recession will cause a crisis for the California budget, as have past recessions. That occurs because spending keeps rising but state tax revenues are very dependent on high earners and capital gains. In California, the top 1 percent of earners pay 50 percent of all state income taxes, but their tax payments are highly variable.60



Despite the recent surge in state revenues, Brown and the legislature keep piling on more taxes. In 2017, Brown approved a transportation funding bill that raised taxes by $5 billion a year.61 The law increased the state’s gasoline tax by 12 cents per gallon and the diesel tax by 20 cents per gallon. It also imposed a new annual fee on all vehicles. However, voters will have a chance to repeal the new fuel and vehicle taxes on this November’s ballot by approving Proposition 6, the result of a petition that garnered more than 900,000 signatures.



It will be interesting to see which way voters go. In 2016, voters approved Proposition 56, which increased cigarette taxes by $2 per pack to raise $1.3 billion a year.62 And they approved Proposition 55, which extended the state’s top income tax rates for high earners ranging from 10.3 percent to 13.3 percent.63 The latter rate is the highest in the nation.



According to the _Los Angeles Times_ , “The higher tax rates were first implemented in 2012 when voters approved Proposition 30 during a time of severe budget crisis. Under the measure, those rates were set to expire in 2018. Since [then], the state’s revenues have improved dramatically, but Gov. Jerry Brown warned of future deficits unless Proposition 55 was approved.”64 With the growing economy of recent years, any risk of deficits stems from fast-growing spending, not from a shortage of revenue.



In 2017, Brown pushed a bill through the legislature to extend California’s cap-and-trade system for greenhouse gas emissions.65 The system was implemented in 2012 and amounts to a large tax on Californians. Limits on emissions impose costs on businesses and consumers through higher prices on energy and other products.66 The system, for example, is expected to increase gasoline prices from 15 cents to 63 cents per gallon by 2021.67



Auctions of emissions permits raise revenue for California’s “Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund,” which spends money on a range of politically favored projects, including Brown’s high-speed rail system.68 The fund will raise $1.8 billion in revenue in 2018.69



Brown has pushed other taxes in recent years. His administration proposed a new tax on residential and business water meters that would raise about $100 million annually. However, the legislature has not yet acted on that proposal.



John Hickenlooper, Democrat Legislature: Divided



Grade: D Took office: January 2011



John Hickenlooper was an entrepreneur who founded a series of restaurants and brewpubs before entering politics. He first served as mayor of Denver, then was elected governor in 2011. Despite Hickenlooper’s success in business, he has not brought a business emphasis on cost control to the governor’s office.



Under Hickenlooper, general fund spending has ballooned. Spending rose 6.8 percent in 2018 and is expected to rise 7.5 percent in 2019. State government employment has soared under Hickenlooper, rising 16 percent over the past five years.70



Hickenlooper supported a large individual income tax increase on the ballot in 2013, which would have replaced Colorado’s flat-rate 4.63 percent tax with a two-rate structure of 5.0 and 5.9 percent. That increase was rejected by voters by 65 to 35 percent.71



As Colorado’s economy has grown in recent years, revenues have poured into the state’s coffers. A recent story in the _Denver Post_ began, “Colorado’s sunny economic outlook is making it rain tax dollars.”72 Under the state’s Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR), strong revenue growth triggers automatic refunds to taxpayers, and state officials are expecting to issue refunds in the coming years. TABOR is a useful safeguard against government overexpansion, but Hickenlooper wants to change the law so that the state can spend more.73



Colorado will receive hundreds of millions of dollars a year in extra tax revenue as a result of the 2017 federal tax law, and this money will automatically flow into the state’s coffers because it is a rolling conformity state. But rather than using this windfall to reduce state tax rates, the governor and legislature have decided to spend it.74



The state government also has a new source of revenue: marijuana. Citizens legalized it for recreational use on the 2012 ballot. The state is collecting growing amounts of revenue from the product, up to $247 million by 2017.75 Hickenlooper signed a bill raising the marijuana sales tax rate from 10 percent to 15 percent.



Dan Malloy, Democrat Legislature: Democratic



Grade: D Took office: January 2011



Governor Dan Malloy received poor grades on previous Cato report cards because of his large tax increases, and this report tells the same story. In 2011, Malloy raised taxes by $1.8 billion annually. In 2015, he raised taxes by another $900 million annually. He increased the top individual income tax rate and extended a corporate income tax surcharge. He also increased the cigarette tax rate, broadened the bases of the sales and income taxes, and increased health provider taxes.



In 2017, Malloy signed into law increases in cigarette taxes, hospital taxes, and taxes on ridesharing services, as well as on other items, to raise about $400 million annually. In 2018, Malloy proposed raising more than $100 million a year by increasing gasoline taxes.76 He also proposed further increases in cigarette taxes.



Despite all these tax increases, Connecticut faces large budget gaps because of sluggish economic growth. Connecticut’s economy has lagged other states for years, and the state’s high and rising taxes are not helping.77 The state has a troubled fiscal future, with some of the highest debt and unfunded retirement liabilities per capita of any state.



Individuals and businesses have been leaving Connecticut in droves. The state’s interstate migration ratio is 0.74, one of the worst in the nation, which means that 100 households are leaving the state for every 74 households moving in.78 For households that earn more than $200,000 annually, Connecticut has the worst interstate migration ratio in the nation, at 0.48.



John Carney, Democrat Legislature: Democratic



Grade: D Took office: January 2017



John Carney has had a long political career. Before entering office as governor, he was a member of the U.S. Congress, Delaware’s lieutenant governor, and Delaware’s secretary of finance. He also served on the staff of Joe Biden during Biden’s time as a U.S. senator.



In his first year as governor, Carney approved large tax increases. He signed bills raising corporate franchise taxes, realty transfer taxes, alcohol taxes, and cigarette taxes.79 These tax increases will raise more than $200 million annually. Carney also proposed a plan to raise individual income taxes, but that plan was not passed.



However, in a concession to interstate tax competition, Carney signed a repeal of Delaware’s estate tax, which may have been costing the state revenue by encouraging wealthy individuals to flee. As the repeal’s main sponsor, Rep. Mike Ramone, said, “We came to the realization that it was absolutely necessary to do [estate tax repeal] because we were losing more in income tax than what we would gain in estate tax.”80



Rick Scott, Republican Legislature: Republican



Grade: B Took office: January 2011



Governor Rick Scott received an A on Cato’s 2012 and 2016 report cards. Although he was edged out of the top spots on this report, he still scores highly.



Florida’s low taxes and nice climate have made it the largest in-migration state in the nation. People from high-tax states are particularly drawn to Florida by its lack of income and estate taxes. That inflow will likely increase in the wake of the 2017 federal tax law.



Scott has worked to make Florida an attractive destination for people and businesses. In 2012, Scott raised the exemption level for the corporate income tax, eliminating the burden for thousands of small businesses. In 2013, he approved a temporary elimination of sales taxes on manufacturing equipment. In 2014, he signed into law a $400 million cut to vehicle fees.



In 2015, Scott approved a large cut to taxes on communication services and modest reductions in sales and business taxes. In 2016, he proposed more than $900 million in tax relief, including a cut to the sales tax on commercial rents and an exemption for manufacturers and retailers from the corporate income tax.81 The legislature did not approve those proposals but did pass Scott’s plan to eliminate sales taxes on manufacturing equipment.



In 2017, Scott proposed more than $600 million in tax cuts, including a large cut to the tax on commercial leases. The legislature scaled back Scott’s plan and passed a smaller cut to the commercial lease tax.82 In 2018, Scott signed into law another package of cuts, including another cut to the commercial lease tax.



Scott championed, and the legislature passed, a state constitutional amendment requiring a two-thirds vote of each chamber to increase taxes. Amendment 5 will need a 60 percent vote on the November 2018 ballot to be added to the state constitution.



Nathan Deal, Republican Legislature: Republican



Grade: B Took office: January 2011



Governor Nathan Deal earned a D on the 2016 Cato report due to his poor performance on both spending and taxes. He did better on this report. State spending has increased fairly briskly, but Deal signed into law major tax reforms in 2018.



In the past, Deal has supported tax increases. He supported a ballot measure in 2012 to increase sales taxes, but voters shot down that plan by a large margin.83 Then, in 2015, Deal signed into law a large increase in gasoline taxes, hotel taxes, and other levies to raise more than $600 million a year.



In recent years, Georgia’s strong economy has filled state coffers with revenues. Also, the 2017 federal tax reform was expected to create a state revenue windfall of about $1 billion a year. Under pressure to offset that windfall, Deal backed legislation in 2018 that cut taxes by more than $1 billion per year when phased in.84 The law doubled standard deductions and reduced the top income tax rate for individuals and businesses from 6 percent to 5.75 percent in 2019 and then to 5.5 percent in 2020.



Deal has signed into law other tax changes. He reduced the ad valorem tax on cars and approved a sales tax exemption for data center equipment. He also approved a remote sellers tax that is expected to raise more than $400 million a year in state and local revenues.



David Ige, Democrat Legislature: Democratic



Grade: F Took office: December 2014



Before being elected governor of Hawaii, David Ige was a state legislator and a manager in the telecommunications industry. He defeated the previous governor, Neil Abercrombie, in the 2014 Democratic primary. Ige pointed to Abercrombie’s tax increases as one cause of his defeat, but Ige is repeating his predecessor’s misguided high-tax approach.



In 2016, Ige proposed increases in gasoline taxes and vehicle registration fees. In 2017, he approved a bill to create a state earned-income tax credit but offset the cost by reinstating higher income tax rates on high earners that had expired in 2015. The state’s top income tax rate jumped from 8.25 percent to 11.0 percent, raising about $50 million a year.85



Ige also approved a bill to raise the state’s hotel room tax and extend a surcharge of the general excise tax, which is similar to a sales tax. These tax hikes, which are expected to raise about $2.4 billion over 13 years, will fund a boondoggle rail transit project that is suffering a large cost overrun.86



C. L. “Butch” Otter, Republican Legislature: Republican



Grade: B Took office: January 2007



Former congressman Butch Otter is in his third term as governor of Idaho. He has a fairly pro-growth record on taxes, but state spending has risen quickly in recent years.



In 2012, Otter signed legislation cutting the corporate tax rate from 7.6 to 7.4 percent and the top individual income tax rate from 7.8 to 7.4 percent. In 2015, he proposed cutting income tax rates and ending property taxes on business equipment, but those cuts did not pass.



However, in 2015, Otter approved an increase in the gasoline tax. In 2016, he said he was against the tax cuts that were being considered by the legislature because they would jeopardize his spending priorities.87 And in 2017, Otter vetoed a bill that would have eliminated Idaho’s 6 percent tax on groceries.88



The 2017 federal tax reform bill is projected to provide Idaho with an annual revenue windfall of about $100 million. To his credit, Otter used that opportunity to approve a bill that conformed Idaho’s taxes to the federal tax code while cutting the corporate tax rate and reducing individual income tax rates.89 These cuts will reduce Idaho’s taxes by about $200 million a year.



In 2018, Otter signed a bill to reduce unemployment insurance taxes, which will save Idaho businesses $115 million over three years.90



Otter scores poorly on spending. The general fund budget increased 7.3 percent in 2017 and 5.8 percent in 2018. Spending is expected to increase 5.1 percent in 2019.91



Bruce Rauner, Republican Legislature: Democratic



Grade: B Took office: January 2015



Businessman Bruce Rauner took office as Illinois’s governor in 2015 eager to fix his state’s severe fiscal problems. Illinois has large unfunded pension and health care obligations, and its pension and health costs already consume one-quarter of the state budget.92 The state also has about $7 billion in IOUs to businesses that have contracted with the state.93 Illinois bonds are the worst-rated state bonds in the nation. As Moody’s Investor Service said, “Illinois has increasingly become an outlier among the 50 states” for its dire fiscal situation.94



Unfortunately, the state legislature has dug in its heels against Rauner’s proposed fiscal reforms. In a 2017 budget standoff, Rauner agreed to raise income taxes, but only if the tax hikes were temporary and accompanied by other reforms. However, the legislature overrode his veto and passed a budget with no structural reforms that increased the individual income tax rate from 3.75 percent to 4.95 percent and the corporate tax rate from 5.25 percent to 7 percent.95 Those increases will cost Illinois taxpayers $5 billion a year.



In 2018, Rauner proposed trimming state worker pension and health care costs and using the savings to partly roll back the 2017 tax hikes.96 But the legislature — led by House Speaker Mike Madigan — blocked the reforms. Madigan has been in office for 48 years and has remarkable behind-the-scenes power over House members, Senate members, and the state judiciary.97



The large 2017 tax increases have not solved Illinois’s budget woes, and the state’s budget continues to be structurally imbalanced.98 The legislature is pushing for even higher taxes and wants to replace the state’s flat income tax with a progressive, or multirate, tax. Kristen McQueary, a member of the _Chicago Tribune_ editorial board, recently observed that “Illinois lawmakers want [a multirate tax] today after loading up more than $130 billion in unfunded pension liabilities, $6.4 billion in unpaid bills and structural deficits so profound that the state has the worst credit rating in the nation and became the first in U.S. history to fall to near-junk status.”99



A state constitutional amendment would be needed to enact a multirate income tax, and to pass, that amendment would require a supermajority vote from the legislature and 60 percent approval by the voters.



However, higher taxes would not help Illinois’s economy, which has trailed the national economy for years. Illinois suffers from chronic net out-migration to other states, and _Chief Executive_ magazine recently graded it the third-worst state in the country for business.100 McQueary noted that higher taxes are not the answer: “Illinois is experiencing an alarming exodus of residents already . . . They don’t want to pay more of their money toward a lousy, debt-ridden state government.”101



Perhaps Rauner’s most important act as governor was to initiate the court challenge to labor union agency fees that led to the U.S. Supreme Court decision _Janus v. American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees_ (AFSCME) in June 2018. The case regarded the ability of governments to charge agency fees to their workers who had not joined the workplace union.



Rauner filed a lawsuit challenging agency fee rules as unconstitutional violations of the First Amendment. A district court judge dismissed the suit, saying that the governor did not have standing to sue. However, a subsequent suit by Mark Janus and other plaintiffs wound its way to the Supreme Court, leading to the June decision, in which the court found that public employees cannot be forced to pay such fees as a condition of their employment.



The _Janus_ ruling will weaken unions in state and local governments, which in turn will provide policymakers with more flexibility to restrain government spending. As Rauner said, the ruling will allow for “much different compensation structure, much more flexibility, much more balance of power between the insiders and the outsiders.”102



Eric Holcomb, Republican Legislature: Republican



Grade: D Took office: January 2017



Eric Holcomb entered office in 2017 after a career in the U.S. Navy and numerous public service positions, including being an adviser to former governor Mitch Daniels.



Holcomb scored poorly on taxes in this report. In 2017, he signed a large transportation bill that increased the state’s gasoline tax from 18 cents to 28 cents per gallon and imposed new fees on vehicle owners. The fees included a new $15 vehicle registration fee, a $50 fee for hybrid car owners, and a $150 fee for electric car owners. The bill will raise about $700 million annually.



In 2018, Holcomb signed further tax measures into law. These included cutting sales taxes on software and increasing income taxes by conforming the state code to changes under the 2017 federal tax law.



Matt Bevin, Republican Legislature: Republican



Grade: D Took office: December 2015



Before his election as governor of Kentucky, Matt Bevin was an officer in the U.S. Army, worked in the financial industry, and owned several businesses. He and his wife have nine children.



Governor Bevin did not make major tax changes his first couple years in office, only approving some narrow breaks, such as a $3 million sales tax credit for aviation fuel. Then, in 2017, he called for larger reforms, including repealing the business inventory tax and the death tax. As he said, “Kentucky has a very complicated, convoluted, non-user-friendly tax code” that “should be simplified, so that it doesn’t penalize the very people we need for our future success.”103



In 2018, Kentucky passed its largest tax reform bill in decades and Bevin’s signature was not on it. The legislature passed the tax overhaul in April, Bevin vetoed it, and he was overridden.104 The bill raised revenues but reduced income tax rates.



The reform replaced multirate personal and corporate income taxes with flat-rate structures. Individual rates of 2 to 6 percent and corporate rates of 4 to 6 percent were replaced with a 5 percent flat rate for both individuals and businesses. The reform also simplified the corporate tax base, broadened the individual income tax base, broadened the sales tax base to include more services, and increased the cigarette tax by 50 cents per pack.



In a letter explaining his veto, Bevin said that the bill fell “far short of comprehensive tax reform” and that he disagreed with the legislature’s revenue projections.105 Bevin seemed to approve of the general direction of tax reform, but he disapproved of the particular bill sent to him. Overall, the tax changes are expected to raise about $240 million a year, but the tax code will be simpler and more supportive of economic growth.



Kentucky’s growth has lagged that of its neighbor Tennessee for years. Kentucky has suffered net out-migration to other states, while Tennessee has enjoyed in-migration. This recent tax reform, along with a 2017 right-to-work law signed by Bevin, should help Kentucky start catching up with its more prosperous neighbor.



Kentucky’s general fund spending jumped 8.2 percent in 2017, but this increase slowed to 1.7 percent in 2018. Bevin proposed a range of spending cuts and a roughly flat budget for 2019, but the state legislature passed a spending increase over his veto. State government employment has been trimmed by 3 percent since Bevin entered office.106



Bevin’s 2018 state of the state address called for reforms to Kentucky’s public pensions, which have some of the lowest funding levels in the nation. The legislature passed, and he signed, some modest changes. Pension spending has risen from 5 percent of Kentucky’s general fund spending in 2008 to 15 percent today.107



John Bel Edwards, Democrat Legislature: Republican



Grade: F Took office: January 2016



John Bel Edwards is a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, and he served eight years with the U.S. Army as an airborne ranger. Edwards went on to serve in the state legislature before being elected governor in 2015.



Edwards has spent much of his two and a half years in office pushing for higher taxes. Facing a budget shortfall in 2016, Edwards embraced a slew of tax increases. He signed into law higher taxes on alcohol, cigarettes, health care providers, vehicle rentals, business inventories, and other items, in addition to increasing corporate franchise taxes and broadening the sales tax base.108



The 2016 deal also included a “temporary” increase in the sales tax rate from 4 percent to 5 percent. However, when that hike was set to expire in 2018, Edwards and the legislature decided to retain about half of the increase for another seven years, so the state’s sales tax rate currently sits at 4.45 percent.109 Louisiana’s government will also receive a revenue infusion of more than $200 million a year because the state’s tax code automatically conformed to the 2017 federal law.110



In 2017, Edwards proposed a gross receipts tax which would have raised more than $400 million per year, but the state legislature quickly shot down the bill.111



Paul LePage, Republican Legislature: Divided



Grade: A Took office: January 2011



Governor Paul LePage is a staunch fiscal conservative. He has restrained spending and cut state employment by 7 percent since taking office.112 LePage has signed into law cost-cutting reforms to welfare and health programs, and he has decried the negative effects of big government: “Big, expensive welfare programs riddled with fraud and abuse threaten our future. Too many Mainers are dependent on government. Government dependency has not — and never will — create prosperity.”113



LePage has fought against Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, calling it a “boondoggle.” Maine voters approved a ballot measure in 2017 to adopt the expansion, but LePage continues to fight it with legal filings to the state’s Supreme Court. LePage said, “We don’t mind helping people get health care, but it should not be free. ‘Free’ is very expensive to somebody.”114 He has proposed conditions for implementing the expansion in a fiscally responsible way.



LePage has been a persistent tax cutter. In 2011, he approved large income tax cuts, which reduced the top individual rate, simplified tax brackets, and reduced taxes on low-income households. He also increased the estate tax exemption, cut business taxes, and halted automatic annual increases in the gas tax.



In 2013, LePage vetoed the legislature’s budget because it contained tax increases, including an increase in the sales tax rate from 5.0 percent to 5.5 percent. However, the legislature overrode his veto.



In 2015, LePage proposed a plan to reduce the top individual income tax rate from 7.95 percent to 5.75 percent, reduce the top corporate tax rate from 8.93 percent to 6.75 percent, eliminate narrow tax breaks, repeal the estate tax, and raise sales taxes.115 When the legislature rejected the plan, LePage said that he would veto any bills sponsored by Democrats. In the end, the legislature passed a budget that included substantial tax cuts over the veto of LePage, who wanted even larger cuts. The plan cut the top personal income tax rate from 7.95 to 7.15 percent, reduced taxes for low-income households, increased the estate tax exemption, and made the previous sales tax rate increase permanent.



In 2016, LePage pushed for more tax cuts. In his state of the state address, he proposed reducing the individual income tax rate to 4 percent over time and repealing the estate tax.



In November of that year, voters narrowly passed, by a 51–49 margin, an initiative (Question 2) to impose a 3 percentage point income tax surtax on households earning more than $200,000 a year to fund education. LePage opposed the hike.



LePage’s budget in January 2017 called for repeal of the surtax and a major overhaul of the state’s tax system.116 He proposed replacing the multirate individual income tax with a 5.75 percent flat tax, cutting the corporate tax rate, eliminating the estate tax, raising the exemption level on retirement income, and offsetting some of the revenue loss by broadening the sales tax base and raising lodging taxes. After a battle with the legislature and a government shutdown, a deal was struck to increase education spending but repeal the surtax on high earners imposed in 2016.117



In 2018, LePage proposed conforming to changes under the 2017 federal tax law. Simple conformity would raise taxes by about $300 million a year, so the governor proposed to offset the taxpayer cost with tax cuts for lower-income taxpayers, a corporate tax rate cut from 8.93 percent to 8.33 percent, and estate tax reductions.118 The legislature failed to pass the plan.



Maine’s tax battles never end. An initiative on the ballot this November (Question 1) would, if passed, impose a 3.8 percentage point surtax on payrolls and nonwage income of higher earners to fund a new universal home care program for seniors.



Larry Hogan, Republican Legislature: Democratic



Grade: C Took office: January 2015



Larry Hogan won an upset victory in 2014 in Democratic-leaning Maryland. Hogan has enjoyed high favorability ratings in polls, and he has nudged Democrats in the legislature toward tax relief. In one early move, he used his executive authority to cut highway tolls and fees for state services.



In 2016, Hogan proposed a package of tax cuts for families and businesses. The plan would have reduced taxes on seniors and low-income families, reduced business fees, and cut taxes on businesses located in certain parts of the state. The legislature did not pass the plan.



In 2017, Hogan proposed a “More Jobs for Marylanders” plan, which involved tax credits for manufacturing businesses.119 The legislature passed the complex plan, which involves different levels of tax benefits by geographic area and the monitoring of recipient businesses, including the number of jobs they create and the training they provide. Hogan has also approved other narrow breaks that attempt to micromanage the economy through the tax code.120



In 2018, to offset automatic tax increases created by the new federal tax law, Hogan signed into law bills to increase the state’s standard deduction and earned income tax credit.



Hogan’s focus on narrow breaks for selected businesses is misguided. Instead, he should aim to cut taxes broadly by chopping Maryland’s 8.25 percent corporate income tax rate. Hogan has not made Maryland’s tax climate worse, but he should spearhead reforms to simplify and reduce taxes across the board.



Charlie Baker, Republican Legislature: Democratic



Grade: D Took office: January 2015



After a career in the health care industry and state government, Charlie Baker was elected governor of Massachusetts in 2014. He has enjoyed high popularity among Republicans and Democrats.



In running for office, Baker said that he would not raise taxes, and he started out on the right foot. A 2014 ballot measure repealed automatic increases in the gas tax. In supporting that change, Baker said, “I’m not talking taxes, period. Not talking taxes, because as far as I’m concerned we have a long way to go here to demonstrate to the public, to each other and to everybody else that this is a grade-A super-functioning [highway department] machine that’s doing all the things it should be doing.”121



In 2016, Massachusetts voters approved the legalization of recreational marijuana, despite the opposition of Baker. In 2017, a marijuana legalization bill imposed a combined excise and sales tax on the product of up to 20 percent.122 The state will raise about $60 million from those taxes in the second half of 2018.



Also, in 2016, Baker approved a bill imposing a 20-cent-per-ride tax on ridesharing services such as Uber, with 5 cents of that tax going to the competitor taxi industry.123 In 2018, Baker proposed a tax on short-term rentals, such as Airbnb, and was still working on the details with the legislature as of August.124



Baker’s largest tax increase came in July 2018, when he approved a 0.63 percent payroll tax to finance a new paid family leave benefit.125 The new tax is expected to funnel an enormous $800 million a year into a new government bureaucracy, which will then hand out benefits to recipients.



The Massachusetts constitution requires that the state income tax be levied at a flat rate, which is currently 5.1 percent. In 2018, there was an effort to put on the November ballot a constitutional measure to impose a new “millionaires” tax on top of the current flat rate. Democrats had pushed the measure partly to encourage turnout at the polls. Fortunately, the state Supreme Court struck down the effort in June. Baker stayed quiet about the proposal.126 Residents of Massachusetts have voted against imposing a progressive income tax five times since 1960.127



Rick Snyder, Republican Legislature: Republican



Grade: B Took office: January 2011



After a successful business career, Rick Snyder came into office eager to solve Michigan’s economic problems. The governor has pursued important reforms, such as restructuring Detroit’s finances and signing into law right-to-work legislation.



Snyder has made important tax reforms. He repealed the damaging Michigan Business Tax and replaced it with a less harmful corporate income tax. In 2014, he helped push through a large reduction in property taxes on business equipment to spur capital investment.



In 2015, he signed into law a mechanism that will automatically decrease state income taxes whenever general fund revenue growth exceeds inflation by a certain percentage. The mechanism will go into effect in 2023.



However, Snyder has also increased taxes. In 2015, he increased gasoline taxes and vehicle fees to raise more than $500 million a year. Snyder and the legislature pushed through this tax package despite Michigan voters having rejected by an 80–20 margin a sales and gas tax increase for transportation on a May 2015 referendum (Proposal 1). That rejection was “the most one-sided loss ever for a proposed amendment to the state constitution of 1963.”128 Yet later that year, Snyder and the legislature hiked taxes for transportation anyway.



In 2017, Michigan enacted pension reforms for public school employees, enrolling new hires in a defined contribution plan with the option of a hybrid plan. This reform, championed by Snyder, will substantially reduce the system’s future costs. The American Legislative Exchange Council called it “one of the biggest success stories across the states in 2017” in terms of fiscal reforms.129 That same year, Snyder also approved a bill banning local governments from imposing taxes on food and soda.



In 2018, Snyder signed legislation to offset the expected tax increase caused by the 2017 federal tax law. The legislation increases the state’s personal exemption and reduces state revenues by about $180 million a year.130



In November 2018, Michigan voters will consider an initiative to legalize and tax recreational marijuana. Under the initiative, both a 10 percent excise tax and the state’s 6 percent sales tax would be imposed on the product.131



Mark Dayton, Democrat Legislature: Republican



Grade: D Took office: January 2011



Governor Mark Dayton scored poorly on previous Cato report cards, and he does so again on this one. His poor grades have stemmed from his large spending increases and tax hikes. Under Dayton, Minnesota’s general fund spending has increased by 49 percent in 7 years (2011–2018); it rose 4.7 percent in 2017 and 8.0 percent in 2018.



In 2013, Dayton approved a package that raised annual revenues by $1 billion, which was almost 5 percent of total state tax revenues. The package increased the top individual income tax rate from 7.85 percent to 9.85 percent and hiked the cigarette tax by $1.60 per pack.



In 2014, Dayton reversed course and approved tax cuts of about $500 million a year, including reductions to income taxes, estate taxes, and sales taxes on business purchases. But Dayton reversed again, and in 2015 and 2016 he proposed raising taxes by hundreds of millions of dollars a year, although those proposals did not pass the legislature.



With a budget surplus in 2016, Republicans in the legislature proposed major tax cuts, including reductions in property taxes on business equipment. It seemed as if Dayton might reach a compromise on these cuts, but the bill that passed the legislature included a drafting error, and Dayton refused to sign it.132 That same year, Dayton proposed raising gas taxes and vehicle fees by $400 million a year.133



In 2017, Dayton and the legislature feuded again over a budget surplus. Dayton’s budget called for $300 million in tax cuts, but the legislature wanted to cut $1.15 billion. They reached a compromise on a grab bag of cuts, many of which will do little to spur economic growth, such as expansions in tax credits.



The bad blood between Dayton and the legislature continued in 2018. Minnesota enjoyed further surpluses and is expected to receive a revenue windfall of about $400 million a year if it conforms to the 2017 federal tax law. Dayton wants to increase education spending, expand low-income tax credits, and reverse some of the previous year’s tax cuts that he did not agree with.134



The legislature sent Dayton a bill to increase education spending and modestly cut individual and corporate tax rates. However, Dayton vetoed it because he did not want to cut corporate taxes and because the plan did not include low-income tax credits.135 Without a compromise on federal tax conformity, Minnesota residents will be left with a higher tax burden and a more complicated tax code.



Phil Bryant, Republican Legislature: Republican



Grade: B Took office: January 2012



Phil Bryant was a member of the Mississippi House of Representatives, state auditor, and lieutenant governor before being elected governor in 2011.



Bryant signed into law major tax cuts for businesses and individuals in 2016. His most important reform was phasing out, over 10 years, the corporate franchise tax, which is imposed on businesses in addition to the state’s corporate income tax.136 The tax currently raises about $260 million a year. Bryant gets credit for approving the measure, but business tax reform was mainly driven by the legislature.



The 2016 tax package included other reductions. It cut taxes for self-employed individuals and cut the bottom individual and corporate income tax rates, from 3 percent to zero.137



Bryant also scores highly on spending in this report. Although Mississippi’s general fund budget jumped during his first few years in office, it has been flat since 2016. Also, state government employment has been trimmed by a few percentage points in recent years.



Steve Bullock, Democrat Legislature: Republican



Grade: C Took office: January 2013



Governor Steve Bullock scored very well on spending in this report. Slower-growing state revenues in recent years have prompted restraint on the spending side of the budget.



However, Bullock’s grade on this report card was pulled down by his proposed and enacted tax increases and his vetoes of tax cuts passed by the legislature. One plan he vetoed in 2015 would have trimmed the corporate tax rate, reduced the number of individual income tax brackets, and simplified the income tax base.



In 2016, Bullock proposed raising the individual income tax rate on top earners from 6.9 percent to 7.9 percent. He has also proposed raising taxes on beer, wine, and spirits, and he proposed a $30 million tax on investments in a workers’ compensation fund.138 These proposals were rejected by the legislature.



Bullock succeeded in getting transportation-related tax increases passed. In 2017, he signed into law an increase to the gas tax of 6 cents per gallon and higher charges on vehicles.139



In November, Montana voters will decide on the ballot (Initiative 185) whether to increase cigarette taxes by $2 per pack to fund an extension of the state’s Medicaid program. Bullock is a strong supporter of the plan.140



Pete Ricketts, Republican Legislature: Nonpartisan



Grade: B Took office: January 2015



Pete Ricketts is an entrepreneur and a former executive with TD Ameritrade. He is a conservative who favors tax reductions and spending restraint.



In 2015, Governor Ricketts vetoed a gas tax increase, arguing that Nebraska should solve its infrastructure challenges without tax hikes. The legislature overrode him to enact the increase.



While running for governor, Ricketts campaigned on property tax reduction, and he signed into law relief for homeowners, businesses, and farmers in 2015. Since then, he has supported further property tax relief. After the 2018 Supreme Court decision regarding online sales taxes, Ricketts said, “Any increased revenue attributable to total enforcement of our sales tax laws must be steered towards property tax relief.”141



In 2017, Ricketts supported a major tax overhaul that would have cut the top individual income tax rate from 6.84 percent to 5.99 percent and the corporate tax rate from 7.81 percent to 5.99 percent.142 The cuts would have been phased in over time and contingent on state revenue growth. In his state of the state speech, the governor said, “If we want to outpace other Midwestern states, we have to be competitive on taxes.”143 Unfortunately, the legislature did not pass the plan.



In 2018, Ricketts supported a plan to cut property taxes and corporate taxes. The property tax cuts would take the form of income tax credits for local property taxes paid, and the top corporate tax rate would be cut from 7.81 percent to 6.84 percent.144 Again, the plan did not pass the legislature.



However, Ricketts did sign into law a bill that adjusts the state tax code to offset the tax-raising effects of the 2017 federal tax law.145 The bill changed the Nebraska tax base rather than cutting tax rates, but it will provide relief of about $300 million annually.



Brian Sandoval, Republican Legislature: Democratic



Grade: D Took office: January 2011



Brian Sandoval came into office promising no tax increases, but in 2015, he made a giant U-turn and signed into law the largest tax increase in Nevada’s history, at more than $600 million per year. The package included a $1 per pack cigarette tax increase, an extension of a previous sales tax hike, an increase in business license fees, a new excise tax on transportation companies, and an increase in the Modified Business Tax.



However, the worst part of the package was the imposition of a whole new business tax, the Commerce Tax.146 This tax is imposed on the gross receipts of all Nevada businesses above a threshold size. The tax has 26 different rates based on the industry. It is a complex and distortionary tax.



The Commerce Tax was imposed to increase education funding, even though Sandoval and the legislature had been directly rebuked by the public in 2014 for their effort to impose a new tax for education. In a November 2014 ballot, Nevada voters had overwhelmingly rejected, by a 79–21 margin, the adoption of a new franchise tax to fund education. In recent years, there have been numerous efforts to repeal the Commerce Tax.



Meanwhile, Sandoval and the legislature have been handing out narrow tax breaks to electric car companies, data centers, and other favored businesses. In 2014, Sandoval approved a deal to provide $1.25 billion in special tax breaks and subsidies over 20 years to Tesla. In 2016, Sandoval supported legislation to raise hotel taxes and provide a $750 million subsidy to relocate the Oakland Raiders to Las Vegas.147 Under Sandoval, Nevada’s tax policy entails large tax increases for businesses in general but narrow breaks for the lucky few.



In 2016, Nevada voters approved the legalization of recreational marijuana, and the state imposed the general sales tax and a 15 percent wholesale tax on the product. In 2017, Sandoval signed a bill imposing an additional 10 percent retail sales tax on recreational marijuana.148



Sandoval scores poorly on spending in this report. State government employment is up 17 percent since he entered office.149



Chris Sununu, Republican Legislature: Republican



Grade: B Took office: January 2017



Chris Sununu is a former business owner and executive, as well as a former member of the New Hampshire Executive Council.



New Hampshire is a low-tax state with no personal income tax, but it does impose two major taxes on businesses, the Business Profits Tax and the Business Enterprise Tax. Under the previous governor, in 2015, the state passed reforms to trim the rates of both taxes. In 2017, Governor Sununu signed legislation to further reduce the rates of both taxes.150 The Business Profits Tax will fall from 7.9 percent to 7.5 percent in coming years, and the Business Enterprise Tax will fall from 0.675 percent to 0.5 percent.151 Sununu also signed legislation to increase the dollar limit on capital expensing for small businesses.



Susana Martinez, Republican Legislature: Democratic



Grade: A Took office: January 2011



Susana Martinez was a prosecutor for 25 years and is now in her eighth year as governor of New Mexico. Martinez did well on previous Cato reports, and she receives the top score on this edition because of her spending restraint, tax cuts, and opposition to tax increases. New Mexico’s general fund budget has been roughly flat in recent years, and she has built a reputation for vetoing wasteful spending. State government employment is down about 4 percent over the past three years.152



On taxes, Martinez has pursued reforms to make New Mexico more competitive. In 2012, she signed a bill reducing gross receipts taxes on inputs to construction and manufacturing. In 2013, she pushed through a cut to the corporate income tax rate, from 7.6 to 5.9 percent, phased in over five years.



With revenues from energy production stagnant in recent years, balancing New Mexico’s budget has been a challenge. But Martinez has held firm against tax increases proposed by the legislature. In 2017, she vetoed bills that would have increased taxes by $350 million a year, including increases to gas taxes, vehicle fees, freight truck charges, gross receipts taxes, and hospital taxes.153



Her veto message said, “From the beginning, I have said that I will not raise taxes, yet the legislature continues to try to force tax increases on New Mexican families and small businesses.”154 The public is resistant to tax increases as well. On a 2017 ballot in Santa Fe, people voted down, by a 58–42 margin, a new excise tax on sweetened drinks that would have funded education.155



In 2018, Martinez told the legislature that any budget bills that included tax increases were dead on arrival.156 The good news is that “a revenue uptick driven by an oil drilling boom in southeastern New Mexico” has made budgeting a little easier this year.157



Martinez has continued to use her veto pen on tax-hike bills. As one recent news report said, “Gov. Susana Martinez, who has been resolute in opposing all tax increases throughout her two terms in office, has vetoed legislation that would have imposed a $100 fee on pet foods.”158



Andrew Cuomo, Democrat Legislature: Divided



Grade: D Took office: January 2011



Governor Andrew Cuomo was originally seen as a centrist Democrat who reduced taxes and reformed public pensions. But in recent years, he has moved to the left on economic policies, and his grade is lower on this report than on past ones.



In 2014, Cuomo signed into law a package of business tax reforms. The package cut the corporate income tax rate from 7.1 percent to 6.5 percent, reduced the corporate tax rate on qualified manufacturers from 5.9 percent to zero, ended a separate bank tax system, ended a surcharge on utility customers, and reduced the property tax burden on manufacturers.159



In 2016, Cuomo approved individual income tax cuts in a compromise with Republicans in the legislature. The cuts are being phased in over time and will reduce tax rates on middle-income taxpayers.160



In 2017, Cuomo reversed course and extended tax hikes on high earners to raise about $4 billion a year. The top state income tax rate in New York is 8.82 percent, atop which New York City adds a 3.876 percentage point tax. Those rates encourage taxpayers with high incomes to leave the state, which undermines the economy and the state budget. Because the top 1 percent of earners in New York pays 41 percent of the state’s income taxes, even a small out-migration of those taxpayers has a substantial impact on the budget.161



In 2018, Cuomo approved a new “congestion charge” in Manhattan on taxis and ride-hailing services, such as Uber, that will raise more than $400 million a year.162 He also proposed other tax increases in his most recent budget.



Cuomo’s tax increases on high earners are particularly shortsighted, given the capping of deductions for state and local taxes under the 2017 federal tax law. New York already has the lowest ratio of domestic in-migration to out-migration of any state, at 0.65.163 For every 100 households moving out of New York, just 65 are moving in.



In his 2018 state of the state address, Cuomo patted himself on the back for making the state tax code “more progressive.”164 But in the address, he also criticized the new federal deduction cap for state and local taxes, even though that reform makes the federal tax code “more progressive.”



In an effort to shield New York from increased tax competition, in 2018 Cuomo signed into law mechanisms to convert part of now-nondeductible taxes into deductible employer payroll taxes and charitable contributions. The schemes may not be effective or pass muster under federal tax law, but more important, they attempt to evade the reality that New York desperately needs a leaner government with lower taxes.165



Roy Cooper, Democrat Legislature: Republican



Grade: F Took office: January 2017



Governor Roy Cooper entered office in 2017 after serving as North Carolina’s attorney general for 16 years. Cooper scored poorly on both spending and taxes in this report. The state’s general fund budget rose 4.3 percent in 2018, and Cooper proposed a 6.5 percent budget increase for 2019. The legislature enacted a lower spending increase for 2019 over Cooper’s veto. Last year’s budget bill was also passed over his veto.



On taxes, Cooper has tried to block efforts by the legislature to make pro-growth reforms. The governor vetoed tax legislation in 2017 but was overridden by the legislature. That law cut the flat individual income rate from 5.499 percent to 5.25 percent and the corporate tax rate from 3.0 percent to 2.5 percent. The bill also changed the individual income tax base, the franchise tax, and sales taxes on business inputs. Altogether, the law will cut taxes by more than $900 million annually.



A similar scenario played out in 2018. Governor Cooper’s budget proposed freezing the phase-in of corporate income tax reductions and some of the personal income tax reductions. He wanted higher revenues to fund a spending increase. The legislature rejected the proposals and passed the budget over Cooper’s veto.166 The adopted budget includes a smaller spending increase, retains the 2017 tax cuts, and conforms the state’s tax code to recent federal changes. As of June 2018, Cooper had vetoed 14 bills during his year and a half in office, and the legislature had overridden 11 of those vetoes.167



Doug Burgum, Republican Legislature: Republican



Grade: A Took office: December 2016



Doug Burgum is a former entrepreneur and software company executive who is in his first term as governor. He promised that he will restrain spending, run an efficient government, and not raise taxes.168 So far, he has honored those promises. He has also fulfilled a campaign promise to take an annual salary of just $1.



North Dakota’s boom from energy production turned into a bust after 2014 as the price of oil plunged. The strong economy had created a gusher of government revenue fueled by rising severance taxes on oil production. State policymakers had expanded the budget rapidly during the boom, so when the bust in revenues came, budget cuts were needed.



Since Burgum entered office in December 2016, his focus has been on fiscal restraint. State government spending was cut by 5 percent between the 2015–2017 biennium and the 2017–2019 biennium.169 Earlier this year, the governor called for further reductions. He issued a directive that “agencies slash budgets 5 percent or 10 percent, with the larger ones responsible for the bigger cuts. He also called for agencies to identify an additional 3 percent reduction as a cushion against commodity price swings. Additionally, Burgum called for a 5 percent reduction in agency staffing when they begin preparing their plans for the next two-year budget.”170 State government employment is down 4 percent since Burgum entered office.171



This year, there is hope that energy tax revenues are on the rise again, but Burgum’s budgeting is still cautious. He vows to keep a tight grip on spending: “The culture has been, a bigger budget you’re a winner and the smaller budget you’re a loser . . . We need to change the culture.”172 He is promising not to over-expand the budget this time around: “We have to rebuild our savings and not spend every single dime we bring in.”173



John Kasich, Republican Legislature: Republican



Grade: B Took office: January 2011



John Kasich has a generally fiscally conservative record as governor of Ohio. He has approved numerous tax reductions. In 2013, he signed a law cutting individual income tax rates by 10 percent, with the top rate falling from 5.93 to 5.33 percent. The plan also exempted a portion of small business income from taxation. To partly offset the revenue loss, the plan broadened the base of the state sales tax and raised the sales tax rate. In 2014, the income tax rate reductions were accelerated and personal exemptions were increased.



In 2015, Kasich approved further income tax rate cuts. Individual rates were slashed across the board, and the top rate dropped to 5.0 percent. The 2015 legislation also allowed taxpayers to exempt the first $250,000 of business income, with just a 3 percent tax rate above that threshold. The revenue losses from the 2015 tax cuts were partly offset by a cigarette tax increase from $1.25 to $1.60 per pack.



In 2017, Kasich proposed reducing the number of individual income tax brackets from nine to five and cutting the top tax rate to 4.3 percent. The revenue loss would be partly offset by raising sales taxes and cigarette taxes.174 The legislature approved only small individual and business tax cuts and reduced the number of individual income tax brackets from nine to seven.



General fund spending rose briskly in Kasich’s earlier years in office, but spending has been roughly flat in recent years, and he scored well on spending in this report.



Mary Fallin, Republican Legislature: Republican



Grade: D Took office: January 2011



Governor Mary Fallin scored well on previous Cato report cards, but in recent years she has supported a series of large tax increases.



In 2016, she approved tax increases on oil and gas leases as well as base-broadening measures for the income tax. The same year, Oklahoma voters soundly defeated, by a 59–41 margin, a major tax hike (Question 779) at the ballot box. The initiative, opposed by Fallin, would have increased the state sales tax rate by one percentage point.



Despite the strong anti-tax message delivered by voters in 2016, Fallin supported large tax increases in 2017. She signed into law tax increases on motor vehicle purchases, the energy industry, sporting event tickets, and other items. She also approved a tobacco “fee” of $1.50 per cigarette pack that had passed the legislature with a majority vote, but the state Supreme Court struck it down as a tax increase, which, according to the state constitution, must pass with a supermajority vote.



The tax increases continued in 2018. Fallin and state legislators caved to pressure from the state teachers’ lobby and enacted a bill to raise more than $450 million a year to fund higher teacher pay.175 The package included a dollar-per-pack increase in cigarette taxes and higher taxes on gas and energy production.



Kate Brown, Democrat Legislature: Democratic



Grade: F Took office: February 2015



Kate Brown, an attorney and former legislator, became governor of Oregon in 2015 after Governor John Kitzhaber resigned during a corruption scandal. Oregon has enjoyed a strong economy in recent years, which has raised state revenues and encouraged government expansion. General fund spending rose 13.9 percent in the 2015–2017 biennium and is expected to rise 10.3 percent in the current 2017–2019 biennium.176



Even with the state’s coffers filling up, Governor Brown has sought numerous tax increases. In 2016, she pushed for a large package of tax and fee hikes, including higher cigarette and business taxes. She also signed into law increases in the state’s lodging tax.



Brown supported Measure 97 on the November 2016 ballot, which would have imposed a new gross receipts tax on businesses to raise $3 billion a year.177 However, Oregon voters soundly defeated the measure by a margin of 59–41.



Brown did not accept the anti-tax message delivered by voters in 2016, and she kept pushing for tax hikes in 2017. She signed into law a transportation package that increased taxes by more than $500 million per year. This package included a gas tax increase, higher vehicle fees, a new statewide payroll tax to fund transit, and even a new bicycle excise tax at $15 per bicycle. She also approved tax increases on health insurance and hospitals.178



In 2018, the governor signed legislation decoupling the state tax base from the tax reductions for pass-through businesses under the 2017 federal tax reform.



Tom Wolf, Democrat Legislature: Republican



Grade: F Took office: January 2015



Tom Wolf was elected governor in 2014 after a career running a family business. However, his fiscal policy actions have undermined the environment for business growth in Pennsylvania.



In 2015, Wolf and the state’s Republican-controlled legislature battled over how to close a budget gap, with Wolf pushing for large tax increases and Republicans opposing. One area of possible agreement was swapping a sales tax increase for a property tax cut. In the end, the budget passed with no major tax changes.



In 2016, Wolf’s budget proposed more than $2 billion in annual tax increases, including a higher individual income tax rate, severance taxes on natural gas production, increases in sales taxes, and higher tobacco taxes. In the end, the legislature agreed to $675 million per year in tax increases, including a $1 per pack increase in cigarette taxes.



In 2017, Wolf pushed another package of tax hikes totaling $1 billion a year, including higher severance taxes, a broadening of the sales and corporate tax bases, and insurance premium taxes. He ultimately signed into law a smaller package of almost $200 million a year, which included online sales taxes, internet gaming taxes, and other charges. In 2018, Wolf continued to push for higher severance taxes that would raise about $250 million annually.



All of these tax increases have not stabilized Pennsylvania’s finances. On a per capita basis, the state is among the 10 worst for debt and unfunded pension liabilities, and it has one of the lowest credit ratings from Standard and Poor’s.179



Gina Raimondo, Democrat Legislature: Democratic



Grade: D Took office: January 2015



Gina Raimondo has a background in economics, law, and the venture capital industry. As Rhode Island’s treasurer in 2011, she made the news for successfully pushing through major reforms of the state’s pension system, including benefit reductions.



As governor since 2015, Raimondo has a fiscally moderate record, and she was the highest-scoring Democrat on Cato’s 2016 report card. Her score was pulled down this time by above-average spending increases and cigarette tax increases. But, to her credit, she is calling for a law change to give her a line-item veto to reduce wasteful spending.



Raimondo has signed into law several modest tax cuts, including reductions in taxes on pension income, sales, alcohol, and cuts to the corporate minimum tax. She also called for, and the legislature passed, a reduction in unemployment insurance taxes on employers.



However, Raimondo approved cigarette tax increases in 2015 and 2017, and she has called for further cigarette tax increases in 2018 even though the state’s tax rate is already $4.25 per pack. Raimondo has also proposed broadening the sales tax base and raising various business fees.



Henry McMaster, Republican Legislature: Republican



Grade: A Took office: January 2017



Before entering the governor’s office in 2017, Henry McMaster served two years as lieutenant governor, eight years as attorney general, and four years as U.S. attorney for South Carolina. McMaster is off to a fiscally conservative start as governor by offering a restrained budget this year, supporting pension reforms, vetoing tax increases, and proposing income tax reforms.



In 2017, McMaster vetoed a transportation bill that raised gas taxes by 12 cents per gallon and jacked up vehicle fees. He pointed out that one-quarter of current gas taxes are siphoned off for nonroad activities.180 Unfortunately, the legislature overrode his veto, and when phased in, the new law will increase taxes and fees by about $600 million annually.181



In 2018, McMaster proposed cutting each individual income tax rate in the state’s multirate system by 1 percentage point, with the cuts phased in over five years. The bill would have provided $2.2 billion in tax relief over those first five years.182 In his state of the state speech, the governor said, “Taxes of all kinds at all levels add up — little by little — to smother growth. . . . We must respect the right of the people to their own money, for their own purposes, according to their own priorities.”183



The governor supports measures to conform South Carolina’s tax code to the changes made by the 2017 federal tax law. Simply conforming to the federal tax code would result in a substantial state tax increase, so McMaster wants to offset that increase with tax cuts. However, he and the state legislature have not yet agreed on a plan to do so.184



Like many states, South Carolina faces a large funding gap in the public employee pension system. McMaster is calling for a major overhaul.185 He proposes closing the state’s defined-benefit plan to new entrants and moving to a defined contribution plan. For the legacy pension system, he proposes raising the age of retirement and reducing cost-of-living adjustments.



Dennis Daugaard, Republican Legislature: Republican



Grade: F Took office: January 2011



Governor Dennis Daugaard earned a poor grade on this fiscal report card because of his support of large tax and spending increases.



Daugaard began his tenure opposed to tax increases and a defender of South Dakota’s low-tax environment. In 2012, for example, he came out on the side of voters who defeated a ballot measure to raise the state’s sales tax from 4 percent to 5 percent.



But over time, Daugaard reversed course. In 2015, he signed into law substantial increases in gas taxes, excise taxes on vehicles, and vehicle fees. In 2016, he signed into law an increase in the sales tax from 4.0 percent to 4.5 percent. That tax hike generated a large increase in overall state revenues because sales taxes are the dominant source of revenue for South Dakota.



Daugaard has been a vocal proponent of expanding the ability of states to tax interstate commerce. In 2016, the governor “signed S.B. 106, which requires some remote sellers to collect and remit sales tax to the state even if they have no physical presence. Acknowledging that S.B. 106 was essentially written as a legal brief, the state quickly began moving the law through the courts by suing Wayfair and two other large online retailers.”186



In _South Dakota v. Wayfair_ , the state argued that the U.S. Supreme Court should overturn its 1992 decision, _Quill v. North Dakota_ , which held that states may only tax out-of-state sellers if those sellers maintain a physical presence in the state. The Court ruled in favor of South Dakota in June 2018, opening the door for every state to be more aggressive in collecting online sales taxes.



South Dakota policymakers had promised that they would reduce the sales tax increase they had passed in 2016 to the extent that they were able to raise online sales tax revenue.187 Time will tell whether they follow through on that promise.



South Dakota voters will have a chance to weigh in on taxes this November. Advocates have placed a $1 per pack increase in the cigarette tax on the ballot (Measure 25). Voters in neighboring North Dakota soundly defeated such a cigarette tax increase on the ballot in 2016 (Measure 4) by a 62–38 margin.



Bill Haslam, Republican Legislature: Republican



Grade: D Took office: January 2011



Governor Bill Haslam received a B on the 2016 Cato report. But his grade on this report is weighed down by substantial spending increases in recent years. The state general fund budget rose 4.7 percent in 2017 and 9.8 percent in 2018. State government employment has been trending upwards since 2013.



Haslam scores much better on taxes. In 2016, his big reform was repealing the “Hall tax,” which was a 6 percent tax on dividends and interest. Tennessee has no broad-based income tax, but it had this anti-savings levy. The reform reduces the tax by one percentage point a year until it is gone.



In 2017, Haslam signed a transportation bill that increased the gas tax by 6 cents per gallon, increased the diesel tax by 10 cents per gallon, and increased vehicle fees. But Haslam also approved cuts to the franchise and excise tax on manufacturers, the sales tax on food (from 5 percent to 4 percent), and taxes on aviation fuel.



In 2018, Haslam signed a bill decoupling the state tax code from certain changes under the federal tax law that would have increased taxes for some businesses. The decoupling will reduce state taxes by more than $100 million when phased in.188



The economy of Tennessee has boomed in recent years. The state’s low taxes are a magnet for people and jobs, and it has one of the highest rates of net domestic in-migration in the nation.189 As the _Wall Street Journal_ recently reported, “AllianceBernstein Holding LP plans to relocate its headquarters, chief executive and most of its New York staff to Nashville, Tenn., in an attempt to cut costs. . . . In a memo to employees, AllianceBernstein cited lower state, city and property taxes compared with the New York metropolitan area among the reasons for the relocation. Nashville’s affordable cost of living, shorter commutes and ability to draw talent were other factors.”190 A recent change by Haslam to the business tax helped entice the firm to relocate to Tennessee.191



Greg Abbott, Republican Legislature: Republican



Grade: A Took office: January 2015



Greg Abbott was the attorney general of Texas under Governor Rick Perry, who served 14 years in office. Abbott assumed the governorship in January 2015 with a reputation as a fiscal conservative. Abbott scores highly on spending in this report because the Texas general fund budget has been flat in recent years. 



Abbott’s conservative reputation has also been affirmed on tax policy. He has taken aim at the state’s damaging franchise tax, the Margin Tax. In 2015, he signed into law a 25 percent cut to this tax, which saved Texas businesses $1.3 billion annually. He also approved legislation to scrap needless annual licensing fees on doctors and other professionals, saving them $125 million a year.



In his 2017 state of the state address, Abbott again attacked the franchise tax, stating, “As far as I’m concerned, the only good tax is a dead tax. We must continue to cut the business franchise tax until it fits in a coffin.”192 In his proposed budget he said, “The legislature must prioritize the phase-out of the rightfully ridiculed business franchise tax.”193



Abbott’s budget recommended cutting the franchise tax rate to save businesses an additional $250 million per year. Both the Texas House and Senate passed bills to cut the franchise tax in 2017, but they did not agree on a compromise.194



Gary Herbert, Republican Legislature: Republican



Grade: C Took office: August 2009



Gary Herbert is in his third term as governor of Utah. His grades on past Cato report cards were rather poor. General fund spending has soared under his tenure, rising at a compound annual growth rate of 5.4 percent since 2010. Spending slowed to 1.6 percent in 2017 and rose 5.2 percent in 2018. However, Utah’s population has grown quickly, so spending growth is less excessive on a per capita basis.



In 2015, Herbert approved substantial tax increases. He raised gasoline taxes and approved a statewide property tax hike. He also signed legislation in both 2015 and 2018 to make it easier for local governments to raise their sales taxes.195



There were few changes to Utah’s taxes in 2016 and 2017. But in 2018, the governor and legislature agreed to modest tax cuts to offset state tax increases created by federal tax reform. These cuts reduced the personal and corporate income tax rates from 5.0 percent to 4.95 percent.



Alas, Herbert reversed course again and is supporting a tax increase on the November 2018 ballot (Question 1). Utah voters will decide whether to hike gasoline taxes by 10 cents per gallon to raise about $180 million a year.196 Most of the new revenues will go to education spending, not transportation, because of pressure on legislators from school lobby groups.



Phil Scott, Republican Legislature: Democratic



Grade: B Took office: January 2017



Phil Scott came to the governor’s office after 8 years as Vermont’s lieutenant governor and 10 years in its Senate. He is also a former small-business owner.



Scott has battled with the Vermont legislature over the state’s budget, and he has issued numerous vetoes. In 2017, Scott vetoed the first budget bill sent to his desk because it omitted his reforms to cut costs on teachers’ health care.197



In 2018, the governor battled with the legislature over property taxes to fund schools. He vetoed two budget bills that contained property tax increases before letting a third pass without his signature.198 Instead of tax increases to fund schools, he proposed to save money by reducing the number of support staff in schools.



Also, in 2018, Scott vetoed a paid family leave bill that would have funded subsidies through a new payroll tax of more than $16 million a year. In his veto message, he said, “I cannot support legislation which adds or increases taxes on Vermonters. . . . After years of constantly increasing taxes and fees, Vermonters need a break. They need the opportunity to keep more of what they earn. At the same time, our businesses need a stable and predictable environment in which they can invest, grow and create more good jobs.”199 He also noted that the costs of such a program would invariably be greater than the $16 million initially raised by this tax.



Vermont is a high-tax state adjacent to New Hampshire, which is a low-tax state that does not have an individual income tax. For years, Vermont has suffered from net out-migration to other states, while New Hampshire has gained from in-migration. The 2017 federal tax law will make Vermont’s high taxes even more painful for the state’s residents and will likely exacerbate out-migration. Scott has noted this problem, and he has promised to weed out inefficiencies in Vermont’s government.



In 2018, Scott approved a bill passed by the legislature to legalize marijuana. Vermont is the first state to legalize recreational marijuana through legislation rather than through a popular initiative.200 The state is currently studying how best to set up a marketplace for the product.



Jay Inslee, Democrat Legislature: Democrat



Grade: F Took office: January 2013



Governor Jay Inslee is the worst-scoring governor on this report card. His appetite for tax and spending increases has been insatiable.



Inslee has pushed relentlessly for tax increases. He originally campaigned on a promise not to raise taxes, but he proposed more than $1 billion in higher taxes in his first budget in 2013.201 In 2014, he proposed a new tax on capital gains and increases in cigarette taxes and other taxes. In 2015, he approved a gas tax increase as well as higher taxes on businesses. In 2016, he proposed broadening the bases of various taxes to raise funding for education.



In his budget for the 2017–2019 biennium, Inslee proposed increasing the state’s business and occupation tax rate to raise more than $1.1 billion a year, creating a new capital gains tax of 7.9 percent to raise more than $800 million a year, and creating a carbon tax to raise more than $900 million a year.202 Most of his proposed tax hikes did not make it through the legislature, but Inslee did sign into law an increase in the state property tax and online sales tax to raise $1.5 billion annually.203 He also vetoed legislation to reduce the business and occupation tax rate.



Inslee has continued to advocate for a carbon tax even though the idea has been rejected by both the state legislature and Washington’s voters. In November 2016, voters rejected a carbon tax (Initiative 732) by a solid 59–41 margin. But in the wake of that defeat, Inslee has continued to push for such a tax; his latest plan is designed to raise at least $750 million in its first year and growing amounts after that.204 So far, the plan has failed to pass the legislature.



Carbon-tax supporters keep trying, and they have put another scheme on the ballot for November 2018. Voters will decide on Initiative 1631 whether to impose a new tax on carbon emissions to raise about $800 million a year by 2027.205 The tax would be collected from various industries, although the plan exempts certain politically favored industries.



Inslee scores poorly on spending in this report. The current biennial general fund budget is up 17 percent over the prior budget.206 State government employment has risen more than 7 percent since Inslee took office.207



Jim Justice, Republican Legislature: Republican



Grade: F Took office: January 2017



Jim Justice has one of the more interesting backgrounds among the governors. He built a major farm business that was the largest grain producer on the East Coast, and he also owns a major coal company and numerous other businesses. With a net worth of about $1.6 billion, he is West Virginia’s richest person.



Justice was elected as a Democrat in November 2016. But in August 2017, he announced at a rally with President Trump that he was switching to the Republican Party. 



On the campaign trail, Justice implied that he would not raise taxes, but in his first budget he proposed tax hikes of $400 million annually.208 He proposed to increase the state’s sales tax rate from 6.0 percent to 6.5 percent and to create a new “commercial activities tax” on business gross receipts.209



Those tax changes did not pass, but Justice did sign into law a package of transportation-related taxes and fees, including increased taxes and fees on gasoline, vehicle registration, vehicle sales, and drivers’ licenses. Those increases will raise about $140 million annually.



In 2018, schoolteachers in the state went on strike to demand higher pay. This high-profile action led the governor and legislature to agree to pay raises for teachers and other state workers.



Justice has taken one very positive fiscal step. He proposed cuts to the state’s high property taxes on machinery, equipment, and inventory.210 Those taxes raise the cost of investment and are a substantial barrier to growth in manufacturing. The governor has proposed phasing in reductions to the taxes over seven years.



Scott Walker, Republican Legislature: Republican



Grade: D Took office: January 2011



Governor Scott Walker has reformed Wisconsin’s retirement plans and labor union rules for government workers. He has also signed into law numerous tax cuts. However, on this and previous Cato report cards, his grade is pulled down by his above-average spending increases.



Walker approved individual income tax cuts in 2013 and followed up with further cuts for low- and middle-income taxpayers in 2014. Wisconsin’s five income tax brackets were reduced to four brackets with lower rates. The state’s standard deduction was increased, and various modest tax breaks for businesses were passed. Walker also approved substantial property tax relief.



In 2016, Walker battled against the legislature regarding raising taxes to fund transportation. As Walker said, “Raising taxes and fees is not the answer. . . . I am confident we can do better than placing new taxes on Wisconsin citizens.”211



However, Walker could have done more to reduce the anti-growth parts of Wisconsin’s tax code, particularly its high 7.9 percent corporate tax rate. Wisconsin ranks poorly on the Tax Foundation’s state business tax climate index.212



Instead, Walker has focused on giving individual companies special breaks. He spearheaded the huge “incentives” package Wisconsin is giving the Taiwanese firm Foxconn to build a manufacturing plant in the state. The package is worth more than $3 billion in spending subsidies and tax breaks.213 In 2018, Walker supported a $100 million package of special tax breaks for paper company Kimberly-Clark.214 It would make more sense for Walker to cut the corporate tax rate for all businesses rather than playing winners and losers with the tax code.



In 2017, Walker proposed a cut to the bottom two individual income tax rates to save taxpayers about $100 million a year. The legislature nixed that plan. Walker ended up signing into law a repeal of the state’s alternative minimum tax, reduced property taxes on machinery, and a few small corporate tax changes.



In 2018, Walker championed and signed into law rather silly rebate checks of $100 per child to families. He also proposed that the new revenues expected from online sales taxes be offset by other tax reductions.



Matt Mead, Republican Legislature: Republican



Grade: B Took office: January 2011



The Tax Foundation reports that Wyoming has the best tax climate for businesses in the nation.215 Wyoming has neither a corporate nor an individual income tax. Governor Matt Mead has not tampered with that efficient tax structure. However, he has raised other taxes, including gas taxes in 2013 and vehicle and driver fees in 2017. He also signed a 2017 law to impose sales taxes on remote sellers.



Mead scores very well on spending. With coal production down in recent years, Wyoming has faced economic adjustments and stagnant state revenues. Mead and the legislature have focused on closing budget gaps with spending restraint. In 2016, Mead signed into law a package of spending reductions that combined specific program cuts with across-the-board reductions. Later, Mead and the legislature cut Wyoming’s 2019–2020 biennium budget 5 percent from the previous biennium’s budget. State government employment has also been trending downward since 2015.216

43 For details, see Chris Edwards, “Tax Reform and Interstate Migration,” Cato Institute Tax and Budget Bulletin no. 84, September 2018.

47 The National Association of State Budget Officers compiles tax changes proposed by governors, and the National Conference of State Legislatures compiles enacted tax changes. However, these data sources have substantial shortcomings, so I examined hundreds of news articles and state budget documents to assess the major tax changes during each governor’s tenure. Tax changes seriously proposed by governors, tax changes vetoed by them, and tax changes signed into law were all taken into account. It is, however, difficult to measure this variable in an entirely precise manner. Legislation creating temporary tax changes was valued one-quarter as highly as legislation creating permanent tax changes.



48 For simplicity, all of the changes in general fund spending mentioned in this report are overall increases in spending, but the report card was scored on the basis of per capita change in spending. Also note that all spending data refer to state fiscal years rather than to calendar years.

 **ACT Party** : 



Last week, the prime minister was on the international stage and in the glare of global media where she normally excels. But she seriously stumbled by lecturing our friend and closest ally, Australia, about their climate change record. (This follows her earlier criticism of Australia’s immigration laws.) She also had a crack at our Pacific neighbours for not electing enough women to political roles. Why is the prime minister concerning herself with the domestic policies of foreign countries, especially when matters at home aren’t exactly rosy?



 **The Podcast**



In last week’s episode of Politics in Full Sentences, David, Brooke and Ruwan discussed why Jacinda Ardern has been lecturing our friends overseas, why Andrew Little called ACT’s three strikes law “fascism”, whether he will give prisoners the right to vote, and ACT’s new campaign for Fair Firearm Laws. 



**Economy in Trouble**



While Jacinda Ardern is happy to travel overseas and lecture other countries about climate change and identity politics, New Zealand’s economic growth is slowing, and her government’s policies are making the situation worse. **Labour has introduced or increased at least five taxes.** It is stifling freedom and opportunity by shutting down charter schools, banning offshore oil and gas exploration, and forcing entire industries to sign up to collective employment agreements. 



The wastefulness coming out of Wellington is worse than it has been for years – there’s free university for kids who don’t need it and Shane Jones is spending almost $1,000,000 to get each ‘neph’ off the couch (See below.) If New Zealand is to survive the next recession, government must get back to basics. Labour doesn’t know how to manage the economy. ACT has a plan to keep the economy growing with one low tax rate, by restraining red tape, and by cutting wasteful spending in Wellington.



 **‘Buy-Back’ Gets Old, Low-Powered Guns**



We’ve crunched the numbers and it appears the government’s gun ‘buy-back’ is failing. ACT understands only 15 per cent of military-style semi-automatic owners have attended a buy-back event, and in some cases, they’ve only handed in some of their firearms to test the water. According to Police:



 _7573 firearms owners have been processed, handing in a total of 10,844 prohibited firearms and 46,129 parts and accessories. The amount compensated to firearms owners is a total of $22.4 million._



According to the buy-back price list, the average part in ‘new or used condition’ is $179. If police paid the average for parts, then $8.3 million was spent on parts. That leaves $14.1 million to buy 10,844 firearms, or $1,300 each. According to the price list, however, the average centre-fire semi-automatic rifle – the type used in Christchurch – costs $2,556 in used condition. The conclusion is that the taxpayer is buying old and low-powered firearms in poor condition. The buy-back is not attracting high-powered firearms at all. In addition, the numbers suggest most people are handing in only one firearm. But if estimates of 1.5 million firearms and 250,000 licensed firearm owners are correct, the average person has six.



 **Fair Firearm Laws**



Last week, ACT launched a new campaign to restore dignity to our democracy. The government’s rushed, undemocratic gun laws treated 250,000 firearm owners with contempt. ACT has done what the government should have – we consulted with experts and the gun community to come up with sensible changes that balance the rights of law-abiding firearm owners and the need for public safety. More than 1,000 people signed up to the campaign in the first 48 hours. This support is critical as we build toward the 2020 election. Please [share our campaign](https://fairfirearmlaws.act.org.nz/) with your networks so we can turn 1,000 people into 10,000.



 **$1,000,000 a Job**



We’re used to politicians being wasteful with your money. National, under Steven Joyce and Simon Bridges, built a formidable corporate welfare machine. But Shane Jones is on another level. He has to spend $3,000,000 of your money _every single day_ to get through the $3 billion Provincial Growth Fund. Over the weekend, Jones said he had created “well over” 1000 jobs. If we assume 1500 jobs have been created, and with $1.38 billion of taxpayer money committed, you are paying almost $1,000,000 for every job created through the PGF. Jones promised to “get the nephs off the couch”, but we suspect that, with ACT’s 17.5 per cent company tax rate, firms could do a much better job at creating employment.



 **Bureaucratic Madness #1**



It’s déjà vu. The 2019 Rugby World Cup schedule means some games will be played outside bar licensing hours. Pubs and clubs are having to apply for special licenses but are being turned down by licensing committees. It seems wrong that they should have to apply for a special license and be knocked back when we know from 2015 that people watching the rugby at their local are not troublemakers. David didn’t enter politics to be the MP responsible for letting people watch rugby at their local every four years. But, if absolutely necessary, ACT will challenge parliament and the government to change the law so common sense can prevail.



 **Bureaucratic Madness #2**



Francie Perry is a constituent of David’s in Epsom. She has grown strawberries for 40 years and employs 1200 Kiwis. Her business requires overseas workers to pick berries because New Zealanders won’t do the work. The problem is that the immigration bureaucracy has blocked her from bringing workers into the country – even though this could put her out of business. This case encapsulates the disconnect between business and bureaucracy. Bureaucrats with power but without accountability can destroy livelihoods, killing off the entrepreneurial spirit our country depends upon as they go. TVNZ and Mike Hosking have covered the story.

Readers may recall I reported last year on Al Gore’s attempt to prop up slumping viewership in his mishmash of programming satellite channel Current TV by hiring Keith Olbermann. It seems that idea didn’t work out well and I can’t say I’m unhappy with this news:

Founders Al Gore and Joel Hyatt have issued a big bloviating statement saying that Elliot Spitzer will replace Olbermann which you can read here. Yeah, like anyone is going to watch that.
I got a kick out of this part of their statement: 
All of these additions to Current’s lineup are aimed at achieving one simple goal — the goal that has always been central to Current’s mission: To tell stories no one else will tell, to speak truth to power, and to influence the conversation of democracy on behalf of those whose voices are too seldom heard.
In that case Al, tell me when you are going to do a report on your “high school science” that couldn’t even get the basics right. See Al Gore and Bill Nye FAIL at doing a simple CO2 experiment. No one else seems to want to tell that story, so I’ll offer it to you free of charge, just say the word.
In related news, I also hear that Al Gore is exploring a new climate game show concept with these guys to be called “Wheel of Forecasts”…

"Icy winters and arid summers are creating salty soil. In some regions, increasing aridity concentrates naturally occurring salt in the soil, while in others, rising seawater has contaminated the groundwater with sea salt. New research suggests plants are riding a calcium wave just to survive in the increasingly salty, or saline, soils that have become a problem the world over.  Humans have contributed to increased soil salinity, as land and water use alters water tables, and human-influenced climate change shifts rainfall and air temperature patterns. While it seems counter-intuitive, even field irrigation increases soil salinity. All water applied to the soil contains some salt. As plants are unable to absorb salt, once evaporation removes the water the plant cannot use what is left is the salt, which builds up over time. During icy winters, salt is flung onto the ground in ever increasing quantities to manage snow and ice. Over the past 50 years the application of salt on roads and walkways has increased dramatically: in 1960, around three million tonnes of salt were spread on North American roads; today, that figure is 20 million tonnes. Come spring, rain runoff carries salt from the road and shoulders onto surrounding soils and into the water table. The cumulative effects of salt application to roadways and walkways are marked. Some freshwater river watersheds have seen salt levels rise between 100% and 250%. And these levels rise every year. This poses a significant problem as salt is, generally speaking, toxic to plants – as many a school student will have conclusively demonstrated in classroom experiments, and “salting the earth” was a tactic used by victorious armies to punish their foes and make it harder to reinhabit the land. Rooted to the spot, plants cannot escape the toxic effects of salt, so rising salinity is a serious risk to both crop production, and more widely an entire ecosystem’s health. Recent research by Won-Gyu Choi and his colleagues, in the laboratory of Simon Gilroy at the University of Wisconsin, has found that calcium plays a key element in plants’ initial response to salt. When plants sense salt they respond by creating a “calcium wave”, an elevated concentration of calcium ions that passes in a ripple from the point of salt perception, throughout the plant. The wave is created by the release of calcium that the plants store within their cells. The study’s authors used a novel system to observe changes in calcium within plant cells, by engineering plants that would create a protein that fluoresces according to the level of calcium present. When they exposed plant roots to various stimuli including cold, touch, or  stress, the plants generally responded with elevated calcium concentrations at the point of application. When roots sensed salt, calcium rose at the point of contact, followed by neighbouring cells in a continuous wave travelling at two cells per second throughout the plant. The calcium wave travelled from the roots all the way to the tips of the shoots and leaves above ground within two minutes. When the plants’ shoots received the signal, they altered what they were doing. In fact, they mounted what might best be described as a defence response. Having received the calcium wave message, plant tissues reconfigured their cellular functions – manufacturing new molecules that help the plant contend with salt, by adjusting water balance within the plant, and setting up barriers to salt invasion of the plant tissues. The authors are  certain that it was the calcium wave that created this response by using chemicals that inhibited the passage of calcium. Won-Gyu Choi and colleagues speculated that the calcium is released from a special compartment within the cell, stored for this purpose. This requires the action of special proteins, which form a pore that opens in order to release calcium from the compartment. Examining plants where the pore proteins no longer functioned, they found the calcium wave no longer travelled properly through the plant. Without the ability to create this calcium wave transmission, they found those plants were unable to mount a defence against salt. These plants also exhibited poor growth in the presence of salt relative to normal plants. Won-Gyu Choi and colleagues discovery has revealed an important mechanism that plants use to contend with salty soil. The calcium wave that plants create in their roots to inform the rest of the plant that salty times are ahead has striking similarities to our nervous system.  In humans, calcium is also used to signal from one neuron to another when we experience stress, such as pain. When you get salt in a wound, the signals your brain receives also have a calcium wave element to them, as firing neurons trigger each other in a chain reaction that carries information from peripheral nerves to the brain in a fraction of a second. It turns out plants are using an analogous system to transmit information about salt stress, but rather than being received by a centralised brain, they inform every cell of the plant’s body.  Hopefully, we will be able to use this information in future to help plants alleviate the stress caused by salty soils and better contend with a saline environment – as long as we’re planning to eat plants, or animals that feed on them, we will need to give them all the help we can."

One of the classic examples of the failure of politicians to communicate with the citizenry is found in a video of Romanian tyrant Nicolae Ceausescu, giving what turned out to be his last speech to the teeming masses gathered in a square in Bucharest.



Oblivious to the mood of the people, Ceausescu is at his bombastic, self‐​important best until he realizes that the chants from the crowd below are not praise, but something rather to the contrary.



The look on his face: priceless.



You could say that Sen. Robert Bennett, R‐​Utah, and Rep. Alan Mollohan, D-W.V., have just experienced their Ceausescu moments. Both longtime incumbents were booted from office by their constituents Tuesday in a fashion that, while not quite as bloody as Ceausescu’s departure, was still pretty gory in political terms.





The political class seems to believe they have carte blanche to do as they please.



America is a democratic republic, complete with an excellent Constitution that politicians still feel compelled to acknowledge, if not take seriously. So the growing communications gap between voters in places like Utah and West Virginia and the politicians who have been “representing” them, while worrisome, is not irreparable. Solving it should be a high priority for all involved.



The communication problem involves the accelerating realization on the part of many Americans that the essence of America, namely, a respect for the dignity of the individual, which inherently involves the government leaving the individual alone, has been pretty much forgotten by politicians in Washington, D.C., the state capitals and city councils around the nation.



Which explains why public employees now make on average 30% more than their private sector counterparts — and 70% more in benefits.



The political class seems to believe they have carte blanche to do as they please. While they have been turning a deaf ear to increasingly vocal expressions of frustration by the American people, if the trend in primary voting continues, our Washington elite may just be jarred awake.



Examples abounded even before Utah and West Virginia made their statements this week. Take the town hall meeting in Washington state last summer in which a young Marine veteran said to six‐​term Rep. Brian Baird, “Now I heard you say tonight about educating our children, indoctrinating our children, whatever you want to call it.”



The congressman denied wanting to indoctrinate, but the young father simply responded, “Stay away from my kids.”



Virtually all of the 400 or so people in the hall rose as one in loud applause.



It was another Ceausescu moment. The congressman had no clue the people of his district weren’t interested in the federal government concerning itself with the education of their children.



The Declaration of Independence says governments are created to secure our rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. In other words, to leave us the hell alone. That is what makes for American Exceptionalism, despite President Obama’s claim that all nations are exceptional. No, they are not, not in the way America is.



Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton demonstrated clearly how most politicians don’t understand this when she said on MSNBC, “When I ask people, ‘What do you think the goals of America are today?’ people don’t have any idea. We don’t know what we’re trying to achieve.”



America to Hillary: It doesn’t take a village; we get along fine when we each strive to achieve our own goals, thank you very much.



As I write these words, across my desk comes a press release from Bloomberg telling me that 18‐​term Rep. Henry Waxman wants Congress to ban the use of smokeless tobacco in Major League Baseball dugouts. This is part of our communications problem. Read my lips, Henry: It is none of Congress’ business if baseball players want to use smokeless tobacco (or any other kind of weed, for that matter).



And this is the encouraging thing about the Tea Party movement. It is made up of average Americans who are sick to death of politicians regulating, taxing, controlling and limiting individual choice.



This bipartisan communications problem is also exemplified by a joint press conference held just before the start of the lamentable 111th Congress by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Said Reid, “Sen. McConnell and I believe … that we are going to work in a bipartisan basis … to solve the problems of the American people.”



Whoa! See how simple the communications problem is? They think we sent them to Congress to solve our problems when we sent them there to see to it that we are left alone to solve our own problems. Add to that the fact that many of our problems have been created by Congress, and we have the basis for a healthy, peaceful revolution.



Some 85% of Americans like their health care, so Congress shoves a government‐ mandated system down our throats. Taxes are way too burdensome, so Congress is contemplating a value‐​added tax to add to our burden. We spend billions of dollars on wars in the Middle East for no rational reason. Climate change proves to be a wildly exaggerated issue, yet Congress still plans on raising taxes on energy to solve this nonexistent problem.



The list is long, and the frustration grows daily.



Talk about a failure to communicate. According to a recent Pew Research Center Poll, 78% of Americans don’t trust the federal government. As Ronald Reagan famously put it, “The nine most terrifying words in the English language are: ‘I’m from the government and I’m here to help.’ ”

Guest Post by Ira Glickstein
The Unified Theory of Climate post is exciting and could shake the world of Climate Science to its roots. I would love it if the conventional understanding of the Atmospheric “Greenhouse” Effect (GHE) presented by the Official Climate Team could be overturned, and that would be the case if the theory of Ned Nikolov and Karl Zeller, both PhDs, turns out to be scientifically correct.
Sadly, it seems to me they have made some basic mistakes that, among other faults, confuse cause and effect. I appreciate that WUWT is open to new ideas, and I support the decision to publish this theory, along with both positive and negative comments by readers.

Correlation does not prove causation. For example, the more policemen directing traffic, the worse the jam is. Yes, when the police and tow trucks first respond to an accident they may slow the traffic down a bit until the disabled automobiles are removed. However, there is no doubt the original cause of the jam was the accident, and the reason police presence is generally proportional to the severity of the jam level is that more or fewer are ordered to respond. Thus, Accident >>CAUSES>> Traffic Jam >>CAUSES>> Police is the correct interpretation. 
Al Gore made a similar error when, in his infamous movie An Inconvenient Truth, he made a big deal about the undoubted corrrelation in the Ice Core record between CO2 levels and Temperature without mentioning the equally apparent fact that Temperatures increase and decrease hundreds of years before CO2 levels follow suit.
While it is true that rising CO2 levels do have a positive feedback that contributes to slightly increased Temperatures, the primary direction of causation is Temperature >>CAUSES>> CO2. The proof is in the fact that, in each Glacial cycle, Temperatures begin their rapid decline precisely when CO2 levels are at their highest, and rapid Temperature increase is initiated exactly when CO2 levels are their lowest. Thus, Something Else >>CAUSES>> Temperature>>CAUSES>> CO2. Further proof may be had by placing an open can of carbonated beverage in the refigerator and another on the table, and noting that the “fizz” (CO2) outgasses more rapidly from the can at room temperature.
Moving on to Nikolov, the claim appears to be that the pressure of the Atmosphere is the main cause of temperature changes on Earth. The basic claim is PRESSURE >>CAUSES>>TEMPERATURE.
PV = nRT
Given a gas in a container, the above formula allows us to calculate the effect of changes to the following variables: Pressure (P), Volume (V), Temperature (T, in Kelvins), and Number of molecules (n). (R is a constant.)
The figure shows two cases involving a sealed, non-insulated container, with a Volume, V, of air:
(A) Store that container of air in the ambient cool Temperature Tr of a refrigerator. Then, increase the Number n of molecules in the container by pumping in more air. the Pressure (P) within the container will increase. Due to the work done to compress the air in the fixed volume container, the Temperature within the container will also increase from (Tr) to some higher value. But, please note, when we stop increasing n, both P and T in the container will stabilize. Then, as the container, warmed by the work we did compressing the air, radiates, conducts, and convects that heat to the cool interior of the refrigerator, the Temperature slowly decreases back to the original Tr.
(B) We take a similar container from the cool refrigerator at Temperature Tr and place it on a kitchen chair, where the ambient Temperature Tk is higher. The container is warmed by radiation, conduction and convection and the Temperature rises asymptotically towards Tk. The Pressure P rises slowly and stabilizes at some higher level. Please note the pressure remains high forever so long as the temperature remains elevated.
In case (A) Pressure >>CAUSES A TEMPORARY>> increase in Temperature.
In case (B) Temperature >>CAUSES A PERMANENT>> increase in Pressure.
I do not believe any reader will disagree with this highly simplified thought experiment. Of course, the Nikolov theory is far more complex, but, I believe it amounts to confusing the cause, namely radiation from the Sun and Downwelling Long-Wave Infrared (LW DWIR) from the so-called “Greenhouse” gases (GHG) in the Atmosphere with the effect, Atmospheric pressure.
Some Red Flags in the Unified Theory
1) According to Nikolov, our Atmosphere
“… boosts Earth’s surface temperature not by 18K—33K as currently assumed, but by 133K!”
If, as Nikolov claims, the Atmosphere boosts the surface temperature by 133K, then, absent the Atmosphere the Earth would be 288K – 133K = 155K. This is contradicted by the fact that the Moon, which has no Atmosphere and is at the same distance from the Sun as our Earth, has an average temperature of about 250K. Yes, the albedo of the Moon is 0.12 and that of the Earth is 0.3, but that difference would make the Moon only about 8K cooler than an Atmosphere-free Earth, not 95K cooler! Impossible!
2) In the following quote from Nikolov, NTE is “Atmospheric Near-Surface Thermal Enhancement” and SPGB is a “Standard Planetary Gray Body”
NTE should not be confused with an actual energy, however, since it only defines the relative (fractional) increase of a planet’s surface temperature above that of a SPGB. Pressure by itself is not a source of energy! Instead, it enhances (amplifies) the energy supplied by an external source such as the Sun through density-dependent rates of molecular collision. This relative enhancement only manifests as an actual energy in the presence of external heating. [Emphasis added]
This, it seems to me, is an admission that the source of energy for their “Atmospheric Near-Surface Thermal Enhancement” process comes from the Sun, and, therefore, their “Enhancement” is as they admit, not “actual energy”. I would add the energy that would otherwise be lost to space (DW LWIR) to the energy from the Sun, eliminating any need for the “Thermal Enhancement” provided by Atmospheric pressure.
3) As we know when investigating financial misconduct, follow the money. Well, in Climate Science we follow the Energy. We know from actual measurements (see my Visualizing the “Greenhouse” Effect – Emission-Spectra) the radiative energy and spectra of Upwelling Long-Wave Infrared (UW LWIR), from the Surface to the so-called “greenhouse” gases (GHG) in the Atmosphere, and the Downwelling (DW LWIR) from those gases back to the Surface.
The only heed Nikolov seems to give to GHG and those measured radiative energies is that they are insufficient to raise the temperature of the Surface by 133K.
… our atmosphere boosts Earth’s surface temperature not by 18K—33K as currently assumed, but by 133K! This raises the question: Can a handful of trace gases which amount to less than 0.5% of atmospheric mass trap enough radiant heat to cause such a huge thermal enhancement at the surface? Thermodynamics tells us that this not possible.
Of course not! Which is why the conventional explanation of the GHE is that the GHE raises the temperature by only about 33K (or perhaps a bit less -or more- but only a bit and definitely not 100K!).
4) Nikolov notes that, based on “interplanetary data in Table 1” (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Moon, Mars, Europe, Titan, Triton):
… we discovered that NTE was strongly related to total surface pressure through a nearly perfect regression fit…
Of course, one would expect planets and moons in our Solar system to have some similarities.
“… the atmosphere does not act as a ‘blanket’ reducing the surface infrared cooling to space as maintained by the current GH theory, but is in and of itself a source of extra energy through pressure. This makes the GH effect a thermodynamic phenomenon, not a radiative one as presently assumed!
I just cannot square this assertion with the clear measurements of UW and DW LWIR, and the fact that the wavelengths involved are exactly those of water vapor, carbon dioxide, and other GHGs.
Equation (7) allows us to derive a simple yet robust formula for predicting a planet’s mean surface temperature as a function of only two variables – TOA solar irradiance and mean atmospheric surface pressure,…”
Yes, TOA solar irradiance would be expected to be important in predicting mean surface temperature, but mean atmospheric surface pressure, it seems to me, would more likely be a result than a cause of temperature. But, I could be wrong.
Conclusion
I, as much as anyone else here at WUWT, would love to see the Official Climate Team put in its proper place. I think climate (CO2) sensitivity is less than the IPCC 2ºC to 4.5ºC, and most likely below 1ºC. The Nikolov Unified Climate Theory goes in the direction of reducing climate sensitivity, apparently even making it negative, but, much as I would like to accept it, I remain unconvinced. Nevertheless, I congratulate Nikolov and Zeller for having the courage and tenacity to put this theory forward. Perhaps it will trigger some other alternative theory that will be more successful.

"Coral reefs: fragile, delicate, and in danger? Actually coral reefs can be the first line in defence against incoming storms, reducing the power of incoming waves by 97%, even during hurricane-force winds. Most (86%) of this wave energy reduction happens at the reef crest, a thin narrow band at the highest point of the reef where waves break first. Our study published in the journal Nature Communications found that the risk reduction provided by reefs is relevant to some 200m people worldwide, and it is these people that may have to bear the costs if reefs continue to be degraded. These are the people in the villages, towns, and cities in low-lying, risk-prone coastal areas below 10 metres elevation and within 50km of coral reefs, mostly in Indonesia, India, and the Philippines. You may be surprised to learn that the US is ranked seventh on this list of nations, due to the high density of cities living near the reefs around south-east Florida. We conducted a more conservative analysis, looking at only those living below 10 metres elevation and within just 10km of a reef, which still represents 100m people.  The risk these people face is growing because of the rate of coastal development and climate change, compounded by reef loss and degradation in tropical areas. Reef degradation, particularly the kind that we have seen across the Caribbean has particularly devastating effects. Small reductions in the height of reefs, particularly at the reef crest, means substantially greater wave energy passes through the reef to strike the coastline. If you reduce the height of a breakwater that runs the length of your coast by 30cm (12 inches) – and the loss on coral reefs has sometimes measured much more – then you can expect to see a major impact on the coastlines. But there is reason for optimism. At a time when towns, cities and countries are making major investments in climate and weather-related hazard protection, we found that coral reef protection makes economic, ecological and practical, risk-reduction sense. The average cost of building artificial breakwaters is US$19,791 per metre, compared to $1,290 per metre for projects focused on coral reef restoration. And of course healthy coral also provides a beautiful tourist attraction and has other benefits for fisheries. But this restoration has to be done properly. Treating coral reef conservation as a joint exercise with storm risk reduction is a new field of science and practical application. It would pay to heed the lessons of past projects that have sought to use other habitats in this way. Tsunamis and storms across the Indian and Pacific oceans in recent years have spurred much interest in restoring mangroves as a storm defence, for example, but some of the mangrove restoration has been poorly conceived – for example, by planting mangroves as “bioshields” in places where they did not naturally occur. These projects are doomed to failure as the mangroves generally die. On this basis, we don’t suggest creating new reefs in places they did not naturally occur. Reef restoration will almost certainly require adding to the height and complexity of existing reefs in order to enhance their wave-breaking power. There will inevitably be trade-offs to make between the conservation and risk-reduction goals. Cautious conservation may favour using reef rubble or natural materials to grow the reef, but if these are unavailable, cement or rocks might have to do to. To deliver actual risk reduction means improving those reefs that will protect the most people – not necessarily the most remote and diverse reefs that have often been the focus of conservation. We know that corals can recover. There has been significant recovery in many places around the world from the severe coral bleaching that occurred in the extremely warm El Niño year of 1998. Recovery was most sustained where other stresses on the reef, such as pollution, were managed well. Done well, restoring reefs can be money well spent with many benefits. We shouldn’t be investing just in grey infrastructure like seawalls and breakwaters that will further degrade coastal habitats. Instead we have the opportunity to also invest cost effectively in “blue” ecological infrastructure – the sea wall nature has provided us."

By John West (elevated from a comment in Unthreaded Weekend, inspired by Casey at the Bat)
Welcome to the WUWT Sports channel! For the debut game we have “The Cause” vs. “The Skeptics”:
First inning: Gavin Schmidt is up to bat for “The Cause”.
http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2007/12/a-barrier-to-understanding/
Norman Page steps to the mound and blisters one in:
“what year would you reconsider the CO2 – Warming paradigm if the CRU Global annual mean temperature is cooler than 2005 – 2009…?”
Schmidt swings: 
“You need a greater than a decade non-trend that is significantly different from projections. [0.2 – 0.3 deg/decade]”
And it’s a miss! A decade +1 of essentially no trend (slight cooling):
http://www.woodfortrees.org/plot/wti/from:2001/plot/wti/from:2001/trend
Strike 1.
http://www.realclimate.org/?comments_popup=2019Note
Page steps down to give John Henriksen a chance; He gives it all he’s got with this pitch:
“what would FALSIFY [linking CO2 to ‘warming’]?”
Schmidt swings again:
”that the stratosphere is not cooling as expected (this is a cleaner test than the surface temperatures because there are less extraneous factors)”
And it’s a miss! The stratosphere hasn’t been cooling in over a decade:
http://www.acd.ucar.edu/Research/Highlight/stratosphere.shtml

http://www.arl.noaa.gov/documents/JournalPDFs/RandelEtal.JGR2009.pdf
Strike 2.
http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/09/how-much-will-sea-level-rise/comment-page-4/#comments
Richard Wakefield steps up and pitches:
”How many more years of no acceleration [in SLR] will it take to abandon AGW theory?”
Gavin swings:
“AGW is based on the radiative impact of CO2 and other atmospheric constituents – none of those things depend on sea level rise.”
Hit……..Foul Ball. Misdirection doesn’t answer the question. SLR is one of the claimed major impacts of AGW and often presented as evidence for GW. If sea level rise remains constant or drops I find it hard to believe that wouldn’t damage the AGW case among both laymen and impartial scientists considering how many times temperature increase has been connected to sea level rise and the “it’s accelerating” touted as proof it’s anthropogenic. Later in the same thread: “Do you have peer reviewed papers that shows that the cause of B (sea level rise) is because of AGW?” — Wakefield; ”Response: Yes. Domingues et al (2008). – gavin”. So, if SLR is caused by AGW and SLR stops where does that leave AGW? A cause without its signature effect? LOL.
http://www.realclimate.org/?comments_popup=6013
Now, Steve Shaw takes the mound, digs in, and throws a curve ball:
”To clarify what I am wrestling with, whether CO2 warms the planet isn’t the issue. The issue is whether we have enough information yet to say authoritatively that the next 40 years will be more like 1980-2000 than like 2000-2010, in the amount of increase. This is fundamental to determining appropriate public policy. ….. I just need some specific aspects pinned down.”
Schmidt doesn’t swing:
It’s in there, right through the strike zone into the catchers mitt: Obviously, this question is absolutely germane to the “debate”, if we can’t answer “yes”, and explain why in a Willis type elevator speech, then, what the heck is all the hullabaloo about? But instead of commenting with what should be an “easy” answer, this question is relegated to The Bore Hole (#383).
Strike 3; You’re OUT! 
Next up at bat its “The Mann” himself and “The Skeptics” are in disagreement over whether they really need to send a picture up to the mound. But we’ve run out of time ….. signing off.

I knew Jacinda Ardern and her CoL had plunged the country into a financial crisis when our local hospital this week announced that all its inpatient beds were full and the overflow had filled the A&E beds with emergency admissions. They have declared a “code red”. Because they have no money they have also cancelled all elective surgery, with the expected reduction in the quality of life for all those on the waiting lists: lists that had been thrown into chaos by the recent doctors’ strike.



Apparently, the waiting list was 3 to 4 months, but now that all elective surgery has been cancelled it could be anywhere from 6 months to 18 months. We are living in a first-world country, aren’t we?



Our PM has money to spray around the Pacific Islands, to fund the ill-conceived firearms buyback scheme (that incidentally won’t save a single life), but not to fund hospitals properly to save lives and reduce the suffering of those that pay her salary. The same people who also fund the cost of flying her to all her self-promoting overseas stage shows. We must also not forget the billions we give away to the Climate Scam, the UN, the Clinton Foundation and all the others.



As people on the BFD have pointed out, the health, wellbeing and prosperity of the citizens should and must come first, and this should be Jacinda’s only and main focus. Whatever happened to her “Wellbeing” budget? Our local hospital and I would like to know.

"Hormone-disrupting pollutants in the urban rivers of South Wales are having adverse effects on the health and development of wild birds such as dippers.  Research we’ve undertaken in collaboration with the Universities of Saskatchewan and Exeter, alongside staff from the Natural Environment Research Council, shows that the chicks of dippers feeding along urban rivers have depressed thyroid hormone activity – in the case of one thyroid hormone by almost 50%. Urban dippers hatch fewer female chicks than those nesting in rural rivers nearby, while urban chicks are also underweight by comparison with their rural counterparts. Dippers are thrush-sized river birds that feed exclusively on fish and insects, and they acquire pollutants through this river-sourced diet. Our earlier evidence had shown already that urban dippers lay eggs with significantly increased levels of pollutants – particularly PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) and PBDE (polybrominated diphenyl ethers), which have been used as flame-retardant chemicals in textiles, building materials, plastics and vehicles. Indeed, the concentrations of PBDEs in the eggs of Wales’ urban dippers are among the highest ever detected in songbirds anywhere in the world. These elevated concentrations are enough to explain adverse effects on chick development. All in all, these are worrying signs that could have negative implications for the breeding and survival of dippers and potentially other wild birds and animals that use urban rivers as habitat. The use of plants and animals like dippers as indicators of environmental safety or quality is a long-standing idea. The most celebrated example is the canary – which in mining regions such as South Wales were once carried far underground to warn colliers of the presence of suffocating gases: if the bird stopped singing and fell from its perch, it was a bad sign for the men and children who also worked in the mines. Might it be possible that dippers are a modern-day example that is at least as good? Over the last 30 years, I’ve investigated how a range of environment changes has affected dippers and their biology. In the 1980s, it was possible to show how problems such as acid rain reduced the numbers of insects that dippers used as prey, leading to equally marked reductions in dipper numbers. Where there was a scarcity of calcium-rich prey (critical for egg-shell formation and found in fish, freshwater shrimps and snails), dippers laid lighter eggs with thinner shells. And, in rivers polluted by insecticide residues or PCBs from local agriculture or industry, concentrations of these chemicals accumulated in dipper eggs to reveal the most affected regions and river systems. In one case, contaminants in eggs even pinpointed a single pollution source from a scrapyard that had been missed by the local regulatory authority. The concept of dippers as river indicators has been picked up in other nations too. In Canada and North America, researchers such as my collaborator Christy Morrissey used eggs of the American dipper to reveal patterns in the pollution climate across whole continents. Canadian rivers, for example, were generally cleaner and lower in persistent pollutants than those in Europe. Morrissey and I also used dippers to reveal where migrating Pacific salmon “bio-transported” pollutants from the continental shelf into Pacific river systems. In Nepal and India, we’ve used another dipper species, the brown dipper, to investigate how agricultural intensification affected Himalayan river ecosystems through pollution, altered river habitats and reduced food abundance. Now, this story of dippers and their powerful value as indicator species has once more come home to Wales – and to very same mining areas where canaries were once taken underground. Only 30 years ago, the rivers of the South Wales coal field were grossly polluted by sewage and colliery discharges, and dippers were nowhere to be seen. As these and other urban rivers have been progressively cleaned-up, dippers have once again started to breed in numbers along these formerly polluted rivers. But our new findings show how this story has a twist in the tail. Although they’re breeding again along South Wales’ urban rivers, dippers once again appear to be telling us something. Despite cleaning up gross pollution, subtle toxic effects might well persist in the urban environment, as shown by the persistent pollutants present in dipper eggs and in the apparent effects on their chicks. As with the canaries of old, this is a warning that we should heed."
"**England could face a third wave of coronavirus if ministers do not ""get the balance right"" with restrictions, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab says.**
He defended the move to a tiered approach when England's lockdown ends on Wednesday, saying the curbs are needed to ""bear down"" on the pandemic.
MPs will vote on the system on Tuesday, with Labour undecided on its stance.
The PM has told MPs the restrictions will expire on 3 February in a bid to stop a Commons rebellion.
In a letter to all MPs and peers, Boris Johnson said rules could be eased in December, MPs could vote again in January and the tier system could end in February.
But Labour's shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said her party's support was ""not unconditional"" and they were seeking ""clarity"" about the tier system.
It comes as a further 12,155 people have tested positive for coronavirus, bringing the UK total to 1,617,327.
There have been another 215 deaths of people who had tested positive for the virus within the previous 28 days, the total under that measure now being 58,245.
England's new system will see regions placed in one of three tiers: medium, high and very high.
In total, 99% of England will enter the highest two tiers, with tight restrictions on bars and restaurants and a ban on households mixing indoors. Only Cornwall, the Isle of Wight and Isles of Scilly will be in the lowest tier.
Elsewhere in the UK, Northern Ireland has begun a two-week circuit-breaker lockdown, while in Scotland each area has been placed in one of five tiers.
In Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford said pubs, restaurants and bars will be subject to stricter restrictions - which are not yet finalised - in the run-up to Christmas. They will come into force from Friday, 4 December.
When asked whether there could be a third national lockdown, Mr Raab told the BBC's Andrew Marr the government was ""doing everything we can to avoid that"".
But he said there was a ""risk"" of a third wave ""if we don't get the balance right"".
He told Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday the tiers would be downgraded in areas where the virus was in retreat, saying: ""We are starting with a more restrictive approach than previously with the localised approach.
""But that allows us to ease up when we are confident the virus is going down and stabilised - there's a review every two weeks.""
Asked whether the government was looking at breaking counties into smaller areas for the tiers, given differences in rates of the virus within tier areas, Mr Raab said: ""The problem is you've got to get the geographic size sufficiently effective that you don't find the smaller enclaves of lower level virus shooting up because they are not subject to the restrictions in the high levels around them.""
Labour's Ms Nandy told the BBC's Andrew Marr her party ""will act in the public interest"".
""We need to know first of all that these measures are tough enough to get control of the virus, otherwise what we are asking businesses to do is go through significant pain, people laid off, some businesses at risk of collapsing, without being able to show that this is worth it,"" she said.
She added that there also needed to be ""proper support"" in place.
Meanwhile, in a bid to answer MPs' concerns, Mr Johnson wrote to them outlining a timeline of when - and how - the tiered approach will end.
In his letter, Mr Johnson said:
In his letter to the public, the prime minister urged people to support the new system and ""work together"" with tiering, testing and vaccines.
He said: ""We can't blow it now. We can't just throw it all away - not when freedom is in sight.""
**By Ellie Price, political reporter, BBC News**
'Tis the season to be jolly careful, said Boris Johnson last week. And he needs to be, with a potential rebellion of his own MPs to worry about.
His letter to all MPs is a change of tone from yesterday when Michael Gove warned it wasn't just ministers who had to take difficult decisions, but MPs too.
This morning, the foreign secretary went for the more reassuring approach and piled on the domestic diplomacyâ¦.
""We are listening"", he said.
One Tory MP told me this morning that the letter was ""nice"" but he still hadn't decided how to vote.
Many Tory MPs are waiting for an impact assessment- looking at the economic, social and health effects of the tier system, due to be published on Monday.
So far, Labour haven't said they will support the measures, but they've never voted against Covid health restrictions in the past.
Writing in the Sunday Times, Conservative Damian Green, MP for Ashford in Kent - a tier 3 area - said he will vote against the restrictions on Tuesday.
He said that in Kent there was ""an extraordinary divergence in Covid rates"" and there was ""no logic"" in putting the whole county in the same tier.
""The new approach punishes rural areas next to large towns or cities and is bound to reduce public acceptance of these restrictions,"" he said.
Tory MP Steve Baker said he wanted to see the data the government was basing its new system on.
He tweeted that MPs were ""glad to share in the burden of decision"", but added: ""That's why we need the information necessary to show the government's restrictions will do more good than harm, in full and in time.""
But writing in the Sunday Times, Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England Jenny Harries warned: ""If we relax our guard and the virus spreads too quickly then all the hard-won progress will be undone.""
She said that once the lockdown ends in England ""there is no other way to keep the virus under control"", urging people to ""hold on a little longer"".
On Saturday, a further 479 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in the UK, bringing the total to 58,030. There were also a further 15,871 positive cases registered in the past 24 hours."
"**A student house has been issued with a closure order for holding parties that breached coronavirus restrictions.**
Manchester City Council said action was taken after the house in Fallowfield ""persistently"" went against the rules.
This included a party with more than 70 guests in September despite the city being subject to enhanced measures to stop the spread of the virus.
Under the order imposed at Manchester Magistrates' Court, it is a criminal offence to have visitors to the house.
The ruling prevents anyone apart from the tenants, emergency services and parties acting for the landlord from entering the property for the next three months.
In September, people in Greater Manchester were banned from mixing with other households indoors or outdoors.
The council said 183 letters had been sent to student households alleged to have breached Covid restrictions and 16 visits had been made to properties where a second breach had been reported since September.
Police have also issued 185 fixed-penalty notices to students for breaches, a spokesman for the authority said.
Councillor Nigel Murphy, deputy leader of Manchester City Council, said the ""overwhelming majority"" of students have ""done the right thing in the face of incredibly difficult circumstances"".
""My sympathies are with students whose university experience has been impacted by Covid, however there is no excuse for the incredibly reckless behaviour we have seen in this situation,"" he said.
In September, students in Manchester were warned not to attend freshers' events and avoid big parties because of the pandemic.
About 1,700 Manchester Metropolitan University students then had to self-isolate after 127 tested positive for Covid-19.

This morning the Supreme Court issued its long awaited decision in the case of Jeffrey Skilling. The most important aspect of the case concerned the so‐​called “honest services” statute. That law has been an amorphous blob that federal prosecutors could suddenly invoke against almost anyone. All nine justices acknowledged the law had problems, but only three–Scalia, Thomas, and Kennedy–said the law was unconstitutionally vague. The other six justices bent over backwards to “save” the law from invalidation–they ruled that the law should be narrowly interpreted. Here is, I think, the most telling passage from the majority’s ruling: 



“As to arbitrary prosecutions, we perceive **no significant risk** that the honest services statute, as we intrepret it today, will be stretched out of shape.”



Instead of strict rules and limits on government power, the Court is content to offer leeway to the prosecutors–some risk of arbitrary prosecutions is acceptable you see.   
  
  
The burden ought to be placed on the government–legislators and prosecutors ought **to be able to justify every single case**. Instead, this Court needs to be persuaded that a **significant risk** of abuse exists. Here is a passage from a Supreme Court case from years ago that gets it right: 



“A criminal statute cannot rest upon an uncertain foundation. The crime, and the elements constituting it, must be so clearly expressed that the ordinary person can intelligently choose, in advance, what course it is lawful for him to pursue. Penal statutes prohibiting the doing of certain things, and providing a punishment for their violation, should not admit of such a double meaning that the citizen may act upon the one conception of its requirements and the courts upon another.”



The second issue in the case concerned Skilling’s right to an impartial jury trial. And it came as no surprise that the Court embraced a prosecutor‐​friendly view of the Sixth Amendment. Skilling argued that the climate in Houston following the collapse of Enron was so hostile that he should have been granted a change in venue. He’s right about that. The prosecution should be indifferent as to whether they present their incriminating evidence in Houston or another city. Instead, the Court shifts the burden to the accused and sniffs, “sorry, you have not clearly proven to us that you were prejudiced by biased jurors. If someone could prove beyond a reasonable doubt that they had a biased jury, well that would be another story.”   
  
  
Here’s a modest proposal: This summer each justice should represent some persons accused of crimes.

"**The mass Covid testing of students, so they can go home safely for the Christmas break, is starting at many universities across the UK.**
Universities are opening temporary testing centres where hundreds of thousands of students will be checked for Covid this week before they leave.
Students have been asked to take two tests, three days apart.
If they test negative, many students will leave university in the ""travel window"" starting from 3 December.
But testing is voluntary and it will not be available in all universities.
The UCU lecturers' union has warned about the reliability of the testing plans and says there could be ""chaos"".
Caleb Shaw, a journalism student at the University of the West of England in Bristol, is taking a test on Monday.
""I know I'm less likely to get seriously ill with it,"" he says, but he wants to get a test to protect his family.
""If I get a test then I can make sure I don't bring it home to them. It would be stupid to not take advantage of it,"" Caleb says.
The university is using its sports centre as a temporary testing site until 6 December with 90 staff and students helping with the testing process.
Inshaal Ahmad, a students' union sabbatical officer at the University of Bradford, says most students seem supportive of the testing.
He says many students at Bradford live in multi-generational households, including older relatives, and want to ""be on the safe side"" and not risk bringing the virus back from university.
Testing at Bradford will continue until 6 December and as with other universities, booking slots for tests will also be a way of staggering the times when students can leave, within the ""travel window"" that ends on 9 December.
The mass testing is intended to reduce the risk of spreading coronavirus as students travel away from their term-time addresses.
Sports halls and rooms on campus are being converted into testing centres, where students will take ""lateral flow"" swab tests, which will provide results within an hour, with the outcome sent by email or text.
Two tests are recommended to increase accuracy - and students will be expected to travel soon after a second negative result, with students in England and Wales encouraged to leave within 24 hours.
If students get a positive result, they will have to take another test to confirm - and if they have coronavirus they will have to stay and self-isolate.
Most universities are providing testing - 130 ""expressed an interest"" in taking part in the scheme, according to the Department for Health and Social Care.
But the National Union of Students says there should be capacity for all students who want a test to get one before Christmas.
""We are not aware of how universities will decide which students are tested if testing is oversubscribed,"" says the NUS.
The UCU lecturers' union says the approach to testing has been rushed and confused and the last-minute arrangements will be a ""recipe for chaos"".
The union said it had ""grave concerns"" and ""testing so many people and following necessary safety measures would be an extremely challenging operation"".
But not all universities in Northern Ireland are planning to offer testing.
""Testing will help to break the line of transmission amongst students, especially when they are infected but are not aware of it,"" said Professor Steve West, vice chancellor at the University of the West of England.
Bradford's vice chancellor, Professor Shirley Congdon, told students the tests ""offer extra assurance to you, your families, friends and community"".â¨"
"**Peak rail fares should be suspended over Christmas and mass testing should be provided for transport workers to avoid travel ""chaos"" when restrictions ease, Labour has said.**
Three households in the UK will be able to form a ""bubble"" from 23-27 December.
A surge in travel is expected and Labour wants a ""comprehensive travel plan"" presented to Parliament.
Network Rail chairman Sir Peter Hendy has been appointed to assess how prepared road and rail networks are.
The Department for Transport said on Friday that plans are being prepared to reduce disruption on roads and railways, including 500 miles of roadworks being cleared and extended train timetables.
Labour has warned that more than two million people travelled by train between Christmas and New Year in previous years, plus millions more by car.
It said suspended peak fares between 23 and 27 December would reduce the risk of overcrowding on trains either side of peak hours.
Train staff, bus drivers and highway personnel should also be mass tested, Labour said.
Shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon said: ""This is too important for the government to ignore or leave until the last minute. This is about protecting lives and livelihoods.""
Labour also argued that planned engineering works on the East Coast Mainline - which will close London King's Cross station for six days from Christmas Day - should be delayed from 27 December.
And it said Highways England should postpone non-essential road maintenance to reduce congestion and travel delays.
Melanie Clarke, customer service director for Highways England, said the ""current plan"" was to remove ""non-essential"" roadworks from 20 December to 4 January 2021.
The Department for Transport said it will publish measures aimed at easing travel disruption next week, and Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has urged people to plan their journeys ""very carefully"".
The start and the end of the five-day travel window is expected to be very busy.
Cheaper advance train tickets went on sale on Friday for Christmas travel, about eight weeks later than usual because of delays in finalising timetables during the pandemic.
To allow social distancing capacity on board trains is restricted and some operators are preventing passengers from boarding without a pre-booked ticket.
London North Eastern Railway, which normally uses London King's Cross station for its Anglo-Scottish trains, has warned that alternative routes will be ""very busy and should also be avoided""."

On Dec. 10, Randy Schekman, a UC Berkeley professor, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The day before, he published an op‐​ed in London’s Guardian, titled “How journals like Nature, Cell, and Science are damaging science,” in which he announced that he will henceforth refuse to send manuscripts for peer‐​reviewed consideration to these prestigious science journals.



Schekman’s accusation is that these journals are distorting science by being biased towards the “flashiest” research, i.e. papers that generate headlines such as “Global Warming Will Kill Billions, Scientist Finds,” rather than the best research.





Do science journals’ propensity for flashy research result in biased research?



This matters more than one might think, because governments and universities disproportionately make their award and funding decisions based on the research published in the prestige journals.



So, if Science and Nature differentially publish flashy research, and publishing there will deliver funding and tenure, scientists are naturally going to gravitate toward trendy topics and produce flashy research. It’s a cycle that perpetuates Armageddon‐​style headlines that compel politicians to disburse more money, for more research, ultimately buying a beach house for the doom‐​saying scientists.



This leads to the question: do the journals’ propensity for flashy research result in biased research?



Unfortunately, yes; especially when it comes to climate science.



Just take a look at Science’s “Perspectives” pieces, which are really opinion pieces posing as literature reviews. Despite the fact that global warming has been prominent for about 25 years now, Science has yet to publish one Perspectives piece summarizing the body of refereed science indicating that far too much warming may have been predicted.



That should not be the case, because every new forecast of climate change should have an equal probability of producing a more or less dire result. That’s what happens with weather forecast models as new information comes in. Once it has been established that increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide should raise surface temperature a certain amount, each new piece of information should either raise or lower the forecast.



But scientists aren’t incentivized to look under the less‐​flashy rock. In fact, they threaten their own well‐​being if they do.



If scientists aren’t doing their due diligence, is Schekman right that the journals aren’t doing theirs either? It’s easy to find out. I reviewed 13 months of both Science and Nature, and sorted every article or story about climate change or its impact into three piles: worse, better, or neutral compared with previous studies.



Of the 115 entries, 23 made the “neutral” pile, 83 were in the “worse” stack, and nine were in the “better.” The probability of the journals not having a bias is as likely as a coin being flipped 92 times and showing heads or tails fewer than nine times.



The number is: 100,000,000,000,000,000.



You can look this up in a binomial probability table, which shows the average number of times you have to flip a coin 92 times to get this result.



The obvious “publication bias” by these two journals is very troubling, because the resultant public funding and tenure could have some pretty nasty consequences.



This creates horrific effects, especially when the issues are policy‐​related. Summaries of the scientific literature are used to guide policymakers, but if the published research is biased, then so must be the summaries; leaving policymakers no option — not being scientists themselves — but to embrace what is inevitably touted as “the best science.”



Recently, the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its fifth “Scientific Assessment” of climate change, which is, in effect, a massive literature review. Since the most prestigious journals carry the most weight, the literature that is reviewed is itself biased. The result? Even the most accurate and comprehensive review must create a biased picture.



The result is very bad policy: cap‐​and‐​trade schemes, carbon taxes, and ugly windmill and solar arrays that produce little power but appeal to the politician’s need to “do something.” All ultimately driven by scientists behaving rationally, but badly.

"**There have been more than 1.6 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and about 60,000 people have died, government figures show.**
However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus and other measures suggest the number of deaths is higher.
**Find out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:**
If you can't see the look-up click here.
After the first peak in April, cases started rising again in July, with the rate of growth increasing sharply in September and October, before falling again in the past two weeks.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 16,170 confirmed cases.
It is thought the infection rate was much higher during the first peak in spring, but testing capacity at the time was too limited to detect the true number of daily cases.
The data for cases can also be broken down by region and comparing the change in those figures by week gives a sense of where there has been a recent increase in newly-reported infections.
Coronavirus infections in England have fallen by about a third during lockdown, according to a major study carried out by Imperial College London.
While some of the worst-hit areas saw the biggest improvements, cases have remained relatively high across England, according to the React-1 study, which is based on tests of more than 100,000 people between 13-24 November.
The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), suggest about one in 185 (16,400 people) in Wales had the virus in the week ending 21 November.
In Northern Ireland rates are thought to be decreasing at around one in 145 people (about 12,700 people), while in Scotland, the figure was one in 115 (about 45,700 people).
The average number of daily deaths began to rise again in September, following the first peak in April.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 648 deaths.
Of these, 555 deaths were in England, 51 in Wales, 38 in Scotland, and four in Northern Ireland.
Rules were amended over the summer to include deaths in the coronavirus total only if they occurred within 28 days of a positive test. Previously in England, all deaths after a positive test were included.
England has seen the majority of UK deaths from Covid-19. Using the 28-day cut-off, there have been more than 52,000.
Although hospital admissions for Covid-19 remain below the levels seen in the spring, there are big regional disparities.
The North West, North East and Yorkshire, and Midlands have seen the highest number of admissions but the situation in all three now appears to be improving.
Cases have risen across large parts of England, with other spikes in areas of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The red areas on the map below are those currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people.
Restrictions have been tightened across the UK in an effort to tackle the number of rising cases.
In England, each local authority has been placed in one of the new three tiers following the end of the recent national lockdown.
Wales has announced a range of further measures, including a ban on pubs, restaurants and cafes serving alcohol, from Friday 4 December.
In Northern Ireland, a further two-week ""circuit-break"" lockdown began on 27 November.
Scotland has a five-tier system of alert levels with different measures in place in different parts of the country.
UK leaders have agreed to allow up to three households to meet indoors during a five-day Christmas period of 23-27 December.
When looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways.
Government figures count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus.
But there are two other measures.
The first includes all deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, even if the person had not been tested for the virus. The most recent figures suggest there had been almost 70,000 deaths by 20 November.
The second measure counts all deaths over and above the usual number at the time of year - that figure was more than 75,000 by 20 November.
The most recent figures available from the ONS are for the third week of November, which show there were 14,276 deaths registered in the UK.
Some 3,038 of these deaths involved Covid-19 - 199 more than the week before.
Deaths normally do rise at this time of the year, but the data from the ONS and its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland show the second wave of the virus has pushed the death rate above the average seen over the past five years by about 21%.
Overall, the figures are still well below the peak of 9,495 deaths recorded in a week, reached on 17 April.
The ""R number"" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to.
If R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow.
The government's current estimate for the R number across the whole of the UK is 0.9 to 1.
The estimate for England is 0.9 to 1, while for Scotland it is 0.8 to 1. The estimate for Wales is 0.8 to 1 and in Northern Ireland it is 0.9 to 1.1.
The government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions."
"**At least eight people have been killed and 52 injured after a prison riot in Sri Lanka which saw guards clash with inmates, officials have said.**
The inmates had launched protests amid a surge of coronavirus infections in the prisons, demanding early release on bail and better facilities.
Police spokesman Ajith Rohana said guards had ""used force to control an unruly situation"" in the Mahara prison.
Around 1,000 cases have been reported from the country's overcrowded prisons.
Media reports say prison guards had opened fire to contain the riot. Local news reports quoted residents who said they had seen a ""massive fire"" on the premises.
Deputy Inspector Ajith Rohana told BBC Sinhala that the injured had been admitted to the local Ragama hospital.
Mr Rohana added that a contingent of elite police commandos had been called to tighten security around the prison, and five police teams had also been deployed.
This is the latest in a series of prison riots that have taken place in Sri Lanka in recent weeks, as the number of Covid-19 cases in jails continues to increase.
In the capital Colombo, a group of protesters at Welikada jail launched a protest on the top of a prison roof asking that they be granted bail.
Another group of inmates at the Agunakolapalassa prison have been protesting for eight days, alleging that conditions in their prison have worsened.
Rights groups say some 26,000 people are housed across facilities that have a capacity of about 10,000.
Sri Lanka experienced a surge in virus cases last month when two clusters - one at a garment factory and another at a fish market - emerged last month.
According to Johns Hopkins University, there are now 23,484 cases in Sri Lanka with 116 deaths reported."

Recent political tumult and the election of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency have driven anxious commentators to lament the collapse of a post‐​1945 “liberal world order.” Nostalgic for the institution building and multilateral moment of the early postwar era, they counsel Washington to restore a battered tradition, uphold economic and security commitments, and promote liberal values. On closer inspection, while it is true that the postwar world was more prosperous and peaceful than what came before, the claim that a unitary “liberal order” prevailed and defined international relations is both ahistorical and harmful. It is ahistorical because it is blind to the process of “ordering” the world and erases the memory of violence, coercion, and compromise that also marked postwar diplomatic history. It loses sight of the realities and limits of the exercise of power abroad, the multiplicity of orders that arose, and the conflicted and contradictory nature of liberalism itself. While liberalism and liberal projects existed, such “order” as existed rested on the imperial prerogatives of a superpower that attempted to impose order by stepping outside rules and accommodating illiberal forces. “Liberal order” also conflates intentions and outcomes: some of the most doctrinaire liberal projects produced illiberal results. This nostalgia is harmful because framing the world before Trump in absolute moral terms as a “liberal order” makes it harder to consider measures that are needed to adapt to change: the retrenchment of security commitments, the redistribution of burdens among allies, prudent war‐​avoidance, and the limitation of foreign policy ambitions. It also impedes the United States from performing an increasingly important task: to reappraise its grand strategy in order to bring its power and commitments into balance.



According to a view popular in Washington, D.C., and other capitals around the world, the United States used its power and idealism for more than 70 years to create a security and economic order that transformed the world. This world order was liberal because the United States was liberal. “Liberal” in this context means the pursuit of security both through the spread of liberty, in the form of free markets and democratic constitutions, and the rule of law, in the form of rule‐​based international institutions. Today, defenders of that order fear that President Trump and a set of regressive forces are laying waste to it. They claim the consequences are grave: we are witnessing the “end of the West as we know it,”1 the abandonment of “global leadership” by its “long‐​time champion,”2 and a “coming Dark Age.”3 _Foreign Affairs_ , the house organ of the foreign policy establishment, recently asked 32 experts whether the “liberal order is in peril.” Most agreed it is, with 26 respondents registering a confidence level of 7 out of 10.4 Alarmed by the political tumult of our time, nostalgists recall the post‐​1945 moment of institution building and benign internationalism and call for its reclamation.



They are, however, in the grip of a fiction. Liberalism and liberal projects abounded in the past 70 years. But the dream of a unitary, integrated global system organized around liberalism is ahistorical. In truth, the pre‐​Trump world was a more brutal and messy place than the nostalgia allows. To be sure, there was liberalism, and it did help define postwar international relations. Broadly speaking, the post‐​1945 period was, on many measures, more prosperous, less violent, and more collaborative than what came before. One defect of “liberal order” nostalgia is that it exaggerates these qualities and simply leaves out too many contrary historical realities. Other critics have already noted the gap between nostalgia and history and that the postwar world was never “whole.” At times the liberal order was neither very liberal nor very orderly. There may be “islands of liberal order, but they are floating in a sea of something quite different.”5



Not only do nostalgists get the history wrong, they fail to confront what “world ordering” actually entails. The main critique in this paper is that the fetish for “liberal order” has obscured what is involved in the process of “ordering” — or attempting to order — the globe. The United States, as the leading actor in the orthodox narrative, emerges as a power that created order through a benign internationalist vision, consensus building, and institution creating. But the successes and failures of that order also flowed from coercion, compromise, and rougher power politics. As the ordering superpower, the United States did not bind itself with the rules of the system. It upended, stretched, or broke liberal rules to shape a putatively liberal order. Appeals to the myth of a liberal Camelot flow from a deeper myth, of power politics without coercion and empire without imperialism.



This fuller narrative is also a story of tragic limits. The world was not so easily subjugated. Efforts to spread liberalism often contained the seeds of illiberalism. Multiple orders collided and met the limits of their reach and power. Efforts to create a liberal order ended up accommodating illiberalism. Liberalism itself proved to be a conflicted thing. At times, projects to advance it had unexpected results. As it happens, the pursuit of “liberal order” is not just an antidote to the current difficulties suffered by the international system but a source of them.



Ideas about “order” matter and have weighty policy implications. Just as material power enables or forecloses certain choices, ideas condition and constrain a country’s grand strategic decisions. Those who lament the fall of the “liberal order” are saying, in effect, that some ideas are illegitimate and should be off the table. They worry that “populism” and “isolationism” endanger traditional ideas that were once dominant, leading America to abandon its manifold commitments overseas, in turn driving the world into disorder. When they call for the reclamation of the old order, they also call for the perpetuation of American primacy. By contrast, this paper argues that the exaggerated notion of the “liberal order” and its imminent collapse is a myth of the foreign policy establishment and leads America to overstretch.



This analysis is divided into three parts. First, I examine the lamentations for a lost world, unpacking what such lamentations claim about how the world “was” before its dissolution allegedly began. Liberal order nostalgia performs two functions: by denying the violent coercion, resistance, and unintended consequences of “world ordering,” it sanitizes history into a morality tale and delegitimizes arguments for revision and retrenchment. The lamentations also give an alibi to American primacy, attributing its demise to forces external to it. By reducing the issue to one of inadequate political will, and by blaming either elites or the public at large for failing to keep the faith, “liberal order” lamentations dodge the painful question of how such an excellent order could produce unsustainable burdens, alienate its own citizenry, and provoke resistance.



In the second section, I demonstrate that “liberal order” rhetoric is ahistorical and therefore largely mythical. The claim that a single, internally consistent, and consensual order predominated for more than 70 years, with liberal projects producing liberal results, fares poorly when compared with the major patterns of international relations from 1945, in the spheres of both security and commerce. Conversely, the claim that American statecraft is now being turned upside down is hyperbolic, and blind to the quiet victories that orthodox U.S. grand strategy is winning under the Trump presidency. 



Lastly, I argue that “world order” nostalgia is harmful. There is a prudent case for retrenchment, and a diplomacy of deterrence, power sharing, and accommodation, through which the United States could pursue security in a multipolar world. For an overstretched superpower to address the imbalance of power and commitments, it will have to look beyond ritual incantations.



The prospect of major change in the international system is attracting a new wave of literature about “world order.” Recent crises and political revolts have prompted security experts on both sides of the Atlantic to announce the coming of end times. The rise of pernicious “isms” — economic protectionism, authoritarian nationalism, political tribalism, superpower unilateralism — has triggered these fears, along with the gauntlets being thrown down by revisionist powers threatening U.S. hegemony in the Persian Gulf, Eastern Europe, and Asia. In the United States, the focal point of this eschatology is the presidency of Donald Trump. After the election of an erratic, coarse demagogue to the nation’s highest office in November 2016, security experts lamented the passing of a postwar structure that civilized international life, presided over by a benign American hegemon.



What is being threatened? The objects of anxiety are a “liberal world order,” which allegedly held sway for 70 years, and even the end of “the West” itself. The life of this order is normally periodized from the end of World War II in 1945 to the recent past. As the storyline goes, the United States as benevolent hegemon designed and underwrote a “global, rules‐​based” economic and security order that transformed the world.6



After its chief competitor, the Soviet Union, collapsed in 1989–1991, it extended this strategy globally. Proponents of liberal order draw on the logic of hegemonic stability theory.7 According to that theory, one dominant state exercises such a preponderance of power that it lessens the insecurities that lead to arms races and spirals of alarm, enabling other states to ease their security competitions with neighbors and rivals, relax their arms programs, and focus on economic growth. More ambitiously, it not only reshapes institutions and markets but remakes the preferences of other states. To its admirers, this order, for all its imperfections, achieved unprecedented general peace and prosperity. It was based on a harmony of interests between the United States and the rest of the world. It made the world a single system or “whole,” as Council on Foreign Relations president Richard Haass claims.8 Revision of the order, and retreats by the hegemon, will lead to increased disorder.



On the campaign trail Donald Trump explicitly threatened the status quo. He denounced allies as delinquent and threatened to shred alliances, tolerate nuclear proliferation, re‐​erect tariff walls, and abandon international agreements. To security traditionalists who oppose Trump, his revisionist challenge accelerates the collapse of a “liberal order” under a transnational assault by authoritarian forces. In a state of shock, they seek orientation in an ahistorical myth about the world before this dark age. As Princeton’s Aaron Friedberg tweeted, “After WWII US built a system of democratic states, tied together by trade, institutions and common values — a liberal order. Now it needs to defend that order against the illiberal powers it tried to incorporate after the Cold War.”9 Historian Jeremy Suri charges that Trump is plunging the world into a great regression by “launching a direct attack on the liberal international order that really made America great.” The elements of this order include “a system of multilateral trade and alliances that we built to serve our interests and attract others to our way of life.” Suri explains:



Through the European Recovery Program (the Marshall Plan), the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (now the World Trade Organization), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the World Bank, among other institutions, the United States led a postwar capitalist system that raised global standards of living, defeated Soviet communism, and converted China to a market economy. Through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in Europe and a web of alliances in Asia and the Middle East, the United States contained aggressive states, nurtured stable allies, and promoted democratic reforms when possible.10



This sunny “highlights package” offers a strangely bloodless retelling of history. It is a euphemistic rendering of the Cold War and the actual practice of anti‐​Soviet containment by the superpower and its proxies. The Bay of Pigs, napalm, East Timor, the shah of Iran, and the Contras fade into the background. That this pristine retelling should come from distinguished historians of American diplomacy like Friedberg and Suri suggests how seductive the vision of an earlier and better order has become. Trump, too, is complicit in this mythmaking. Like his opponents, he frames his own election in stark terms. Trump speaks of a dark prehistory of “globalism,” of open borders, predatory capitalism, futile wars, and general American victimhood, and a return to wholesome nationalism, industrial regeneration, civilizational rebirth, and, of course, making America “great.”11



What was the liberal order, as its defenders define it? If an “order” is a coming together of power with social purpose, a “world order” is an international design of institutions, norms, and patterned relationships that defines the global balance of power.12 Some commentators argue that for a viable world order to emerge in a time of turbulence, the United States may have to compromise. Amitav Acharya, Michael Mazarr, and Henry Kissinger seek to revive the concept of world order, but unlike those of other “world order” visionaries, their proposed designs are pluralistic and require the United States to temper its universalism for the sake of stability and negotiated coexistence in a polycentric world.13



By contrast, the liberal order is a missionary project that looks to extirpate rival orders and demands the perpetuation of American dominance. As an ideal type, the “liberal order” entails a copious number of norms and institutions, suggesting that good things go together. In accounts of the postwar liberal order, many or all of the following features appear, though with varying emphasis: the rule of law and the supremacy of “rules,” humanist globalism and humanitarian development, free trade, multilateral cooperation, the security provision of the United States (principally through its permanent alliances), and a commitment to liberal progress through the advocacy of democratic and market reforms. Its institutions span the United Nations, NATO, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the Trans‐​Pacific Partnership (TPP), the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (followed by the World Trade Organization), the IMF, and the World Bank. A commitment to protocols and the bridging of divides figure centrally. Hence phrases like “open, rule‐​based international economy” abound.14 The “order,” proponents argue, embodied also a pattern of behavior, or, as Jake Sullivan at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace explains, a “system of norms, institutions, and partnerships” whereby, under the hegemon’s stewardship, collective cooperation trumped competition for relative advantage, significant shares of sovereignty were ceded for the benefits of collective action, and a global consensus spread.15 An “illiberal order” would presumably be the opposite of these things: politically and economically divided and closed, authoritarian, uncooperative, coercive, and disrespectful of rules and norms.



The liberal order is necessarily hierarchical. To speak of liberal order is to speak also of American primacy, with the former depending on the exercise of the latter. Nostalgists do not deny that the American superpower upheld it partly through overwhelming military strength. However, they emphasize the nonbloody uses of force, for example, deterring and dissuading adversaries, reassuring and uniting allies, and preventing conflict. And they stress the consensual, attractive quality of American hegemony. Postwar continental Europe therefore stands out as a favorite area of emphasis, as an “empire by invitation.”16



Most anxious observers agree that a significant “fall” is occurring.17 To explain it, they weigh heavily an alleged loss of political will within the West. Leading theorists of liberal order, such as Princeton’s G. John Ikenberry, have long warned that “the hallmarks of liberal internationalism — openness and rule‐​based relations enshrined in institutions such as the United Nations and norms such as multilateralism — could give way to a more contested and fragmented system of blocs, spheres of influence, mercantilist networks, and regional rivalries.”18 Once optimistic that the order would withstand geopolitical challenges and prove resilient, Ikenberry now fears a different kind of insurgent threat, flowing not from hostile subversive states but from within. Working‐ and middle‐​class populations, he suggests, may lose faith in the order as democracy degenerates.19



Similar complaints have arisen across the Atlantic. Warnings against U.S. disengagement are a staple of rhetoric from security thinkers in allied countries.20 For Robin Niblett, director of the internationalist Chatham House, Trump replicates and feeds on the destructive forces that powered “Brexit,” forcing liberalism into retreat.21 For the University of Exeter’s Doug Stokes, as for Ikenberry and Niblett, domestic discontent may unravel the worldwide arrangements that best served America’s “globalized” interests. For the old order to reproduce itself, it must make a new settlement with the American working class.22



Most of these diagnoses have a common premise. All offer an upbeat, potted history of the world created in and after 1945. Many then blame the crumbling of that world on agents or forces that are separate from it.23 If the order is perishing, they argue, it is being assassinated rather than dying from its internal failures. They have little to say about the significant reverses that occurred while the order reigned. These included some of America’s most disastrous wars, geopolitical chaos in the Persian Gulf from the Iran‐​Iraq War to the present sectarian breakdown, resurgent jihadi Islamism, the greatest act of urban terrorism committed by a nonstate actor in history, the eurozone crisis, the economic regression of Russia under “shock therapy,” mounting and unsustainable debt, the global financial crisis, the entrenchment and immobility of wealth, and the growing underclass of working poor. Rather than attributing to the old order the failures that occurred on its watch, nostalgists blame mismanagement, or popular fatigue, or “populism” and demagogues that whipped up mass discontent. They give credit to the order and U.S. primacy for benign developments, discounting other possible contributors such as the deterrent effects of nuclear weapons or the memory of World War II. That the order may have been complicit in its own undoing is hardly considered.



Nostalgia for a lost order is not just the complaint of self‐​styled liberal internationalists of any particular faction. It has a wider provenance among those who believe today’s choice lies between continuing American primacy and chaos. The strength of the consensus is reflected in a Brookings Institution paper, coauthored by former high‐​ranking officials in the administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama, urging the White House to revert to a traditional posture, upholding an order favoring openness, human rights, and peace, and claiming that this is the only viable grand strategy for the United States.24 The hawkish intellectual Robert Kagan argues that the order established after World War II was a “liberal enlightenment project” that is now “challenged by forces from within and without,” not only because of popular fatigue with the burdens of international leadership but because Americans have forgotten the reasons their country adopted the role as the world’s guarantor and stabilizer.25 Primacists such as Robert Lieber, Thomas Wright, and Eliot Cohen issue similar warnings.26



The prominence of neoconservatives among this chorus is ironic. Critics once accused neoconservatives of violating the principles of liberal order with their bellicose unilateralism, by agitating for preventive war in Iraq in March 2003 without an explicit UN mandate, and by justifying torture. But this reflects the paradoxical problem at the heart of liberal “world ordering.” On the one hand, under most popular visions of liberal order, the hegemon creates a world based on deference to institutions and rules. But actual international life includes hostile, noncooperative forces that refuse to defer. Thus the liberal order includes conflicting rather than complementary rules and principles. It contains “veto players” like Russia or China with different conceptions of order. The protection and enforcement of such an order, and the enforcer’s own preponderance, rests upon selection and the exercise of a hegemon’s privilege.



Liberal world orders typically involve several impulses, namely, internationalism, integration, and imperialism.27 That last, imperialism, is the most contentious. Historically, world orders, with their trading protocols and monetary regimes, and control of sea lanes, commercial routes, and access to raw materials, are designed and imposed by the strong. The opening of Asian markets, a celebrated feature of liberal order, was also a pre‐​1945 byproduct of violent and imperial coercion, imposed on China by Great Britain through the Opium Wars and on Japan by American Commodore Matthew Perry with the threat of naval bombardment in 1853–1854.



Proponents of liberal order occasionally admit that what is sometimes framed straightforwardly as a rule‐​bound order is in fact a system of imperial power (and vigilante privilege) exercised by a hegemon. Robert Cooper, the former diplomat and adviser to Prime Minister Tony Blair, argued that if the world had a civilized core that deserved lawful conduct, there was also a barbarous periphery that warranted “rougher methods of an earlier era.”28 “Among themselves,” he wrote, “the postmodern states operate on the basis of laws and open co‐​operative security” but “in the jungle, one must use the laws of the jungle.”29 One‐​time advocate of American empire Michael Ignatieff admitted that being an imperial power “means enforcing such order as there is in the world and doing so in the American interest. It means laying down the rules America wants (on everything from markets to weapons of mass destruction) while exempting itself from other rules (the Kyoto Protocol on climate change and the International Criminal Court) that go against its interest.”30 At the height of the war on terror, jurists advising the George W. Bush administration used a similar logic to justify the suspension of the rule of law and Geneva conventions.31 One can defend these inconsistencies as necessary, or not. That they continually recur suggests that liberal “world ordering” is an inescapably compromised process.



The United States is an imperial power, even if it is distinct from former empires. It may lack the land hunger of empires past and look different from European or Asian imperialisms. It was averse to formal annexation, refused to claim the mantle of empire, and made a succession of retreats, from Vietnam, Lebanon, and Iraq. But it still throws its weight around in imperial ways: through coercion, subversion, or patronage, it penetrates the sovereign autonomy of other states to constrain their choices. The political economy underlying American interventions was at times coercive, as in the structural‐​adjustment programs visited on developing countries from Eastern Europe to Latin America. Leading primacists who speak up for liberal world ordering have earlier acknowledged that the American project overseas must be necessarily imperial, albeit in this case of a distinctively informal “American” kind, involving the forceful suppression of revolt, hard‐​nosed enforcement of parameters around other states’ policies, and the exercise of unequal bargaining influence.32 But for the most part, today’s lamentations for a dying liberal order do not acknowledge the necessarily imperial component. This is the imperialism that does not know itself.



Invocations of the liberal world order have become the ritualized language of the foreign policy establishment. In the academy, there is a well‐​established scholarly study of “world orders.”33 But too often, especially among think‐​tank specialists and the foreign policy commentariat, the liberal order’s admirers assert what they ought to prove. In that respect, President Trump’s former deputy assistant for strategic communications at the National Security Council, Michael Anton, was right to argue that the foreign policy establishment has become a “priesthood,” fonder of recapitulation than argumentation.34 It repeats its axioms but neglects to ground its vision in a careful reading of history or the present. A good example is an article by Edward Luce in June 2017, mourning the internal defeat of Western liberalism and a new world “disorder.” To demonstrate the imminence of disorder under Trump, Luce did not examine what Trump was actually doing beyond the decision to withdraw from the Paris climate change agreement, which is not an unprecedented pullback. The many Trump administration moves that have affronted Moscow go unmentioned: for example, the reinforcement of NATO through increased funding of the European Reassurance Initiative; and the bombing of the Assad regime, Putin’s ally, in April 2017. Instead, Luce cited the statements of two allies who were wondering where Trump’s behavior would lead, gossip about personality clashes in Trump’s court, and corroborating statements from other figures in the foreign policy establishment who take the “liberal order” as an article of faith, betraying a confirmation bias. Without evidence, he then accused President Obama of “global retrenchment.”35 Typical of the genre, Luce contrasted these recent failures with the postwar internationalism and institution building of President Harry Truman.



To be reprimanded for violating established norms of American “global leadership,” against the exalted standards of Truman, is an occupational burden that comes with the presidency. Before Trump, critics had accused presidents Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama of retreating from a long‐​standing commitment to a liberal world order. The charge that Washington is abandoning a noble Trumanite diplomatic past is less an observation than a political predisposition, substantively shallow yet part of the framework within which debate is conducted. International history after 1945 is more fraught.



Accusations that U.S. presidents are flouting a long‐​standing postwar liberal order rely upon a mythologized account of history. When presidents wage war unilaterally, topple governments, coerce allies, threaten abandonment, disregard the demands of international institutions, practice economic protectionism, or cultivate illiberal allies and clients, they may or may not be practicing prudent statecraft. Either way, their behavior is unexceptional. They are not departing from tradition.



Let us revisit history first in the area of trade and political economy. President Trump disturbs defenders of the liberal order partly through his economic nationalism, his promise to rebuild American manufacturing industries by erecting protective tariff walls, and his withdrawal from the Trans‐​Pacific Partnership (TPP). The extent to which U.S. membership in the TPP represented a long‐​standing commitment to liberal order is doubtful, given that the United States signed the agreement in February 2016 and withdrew in January 2017, and given that the agreement’s intent was to exclude and contain China as much as to integrate other Asian economies. Nonetheless, nostalgists assert that Washington’s commitment to free trade was a central pillar of liberal order. Identifying the marketing precepts of the Washington consensus with liberal order, they present Washington’s various “Open Door” policies as both a cause and symptom of the world’s liberalization.



Without question, the United States in the postwar period dismantled the economic architecture of the British Empire. It strove to reshape the international economic environment on its terms, to establish and exploit the dollar as the reserve currency, to promote open markets, and to make a world safe for the penetration of American capital. How far did that process, that long‐​standing commitment to the “Open Door,” represent a liberal drive for free trade?



In reality, there was not one but several postwar economic orders. As Michael Lind cautions:



Globalization on a large scale, characterized by the emergence of transnational corporations and supply chains, got underway only in the 1990s and 2000s. Mass immigration to the United States and Europe is also largely a post–Cold War phenomenon. The euro and the Eurozone date back only to 1999. Labor mobility within Europe is also a relatively recent policy. Controversial “megaregional” trade pacts like NAFTA, the TPP, and TTIP [Trans‐​Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership], which go beyond old‐​fashioned tariff reductions to rewrite much domestic legislation, go back only to the 1990s.36



Niall Ferguson, too, observes that “truly free trade, truly free capital flows and large‐​scale migration across borders did not begin until the 1990s.”37 Earlier decades saw capital controls, fixed exchange rates, and periodic returns to tariff barriers. One major pillar of the postwar order was U.S. ally, democratic Japan. Under U.S. military protection, that same country instituted, in the words of Claremont McKenna College’s Leon Hollerman, “the most restrictive foreign trade and foreign‐​exchange control system ever devised by a major free nation.”38 The long‐​running competition with the Soviet Union moved the United States to deliberately encourage the economic growth of its Asian allies, but under the shield of a neomercantilist state. In other words, in identifying the U.S.-led order with market and trade liberalization, nostalgists historicize what are in fact a quite recent set of post‐​1989 international arrangements. From this perspective, a liberal order did arrive, only it came later, in the age of post‐​1989 unipolarity.



There is a more basic defect in recollections of the liberal order. During the postwar era, the United States persistently flouted liberal economic principles and imposed restrictive measures when it suited. Indeed, major powers have not historically risen through free trade and passive governments. Ascending powers have typically risen partly through the deliberate, visible, and intervening hand of an activist state.39 So too with America. All U.S. presidents have had to manage the tension between the commitment to the “Open Door” and the demand for industrial protection at home. The subsidy, the tariff, the quota, and the bilateral voluntary‐​restriction agreement have remained part of America’s repertoire. As a recent study of global data by Gowling WLG reveals, the United States is a “long‐​term and prolific proponent of protectionist policies,” and the world order it presides over is notably protectionist.40 Since the 2008 financial crisis, the United States has imposed tariffs worth $39 billion, while the world’s top 60 economies have adopted more than 7,000 protectionist trade measures worth more than $400 billion. The United States and the European Union both accounted for the highest number of protectionist measures, each exercising more than 1,000, with India a distant third at 400.41 America’s trade protectionism has the highest impact on other countries. Foreign farmers would be baffled by the claim that the old order embodied free trade, when the United States persistently granted agricultural subsidies and other mechanisms limiting foreign governments’ access to U.S. consumers.42



The reversion to protectionism has precedents from before the global financial crisis. Some of the most strident advocates of open markets and the dismantling of trade barriers have in practice done the opposite. One was President Ronald Reagan. Reagan had championed the cause of free trade as a foundation of progress and peace. Yet as president, he increased the proportion of imports subject to restrictions by 100 percent from 1980, as well as tightened quotas, introduced “voluntary restraint agreements” and new duties, raised tariffs, and strengthened the Export‐​Import Bank in order to protect the recovery of U.S. industries, especially automotive, computer‐​chip, and steel.43 Reagan justified these steps on the grounds that he was forcing economic competitors to trade freely. Regardless, his policies were a long way from Adam Smith.



President Clinton also championed free trade, in words and deeds. He drove through NAFTA, a free trade zone uniting North America’s three largest economies, and pushed for China’s admission to the WTO under “most favored nation” status. Yet under Clinton, rice subsidies that continued during his administration enabled U.S. growers to dump their product onto the markets of vulnerable rural countries such as Haiti, Ghana, and Indonesia at depressed prices. Clinton has since apologized to Haiti for the devastation that these arrangements inflicted on the country.44



President George W. Bush emulated Reagan rhetorically, invoking the principles of free trade and unfettered markets. Yet in 2002, he increased steel tariffs by 30 percent, only to back down 20 months later under threat of punitive countertariffs by the European Union, a protectionist bloc in its relations with many countries beyond its borders. Confronted with the prospect of economic meltdown in the crisis of 2008, Bush intervened in the market with strongly protectionist measures, including bailouts of major firms, claiming, “I have abandoned free‐​market principles to save the free‐​market system.”45 The reintroduction of protectionist measures today, then, is not such a sudden or radical departure as is sometimes claimed, though Trump’s open enthusiasm for a “trade war” does mark a difference. There is a defensible logic to the position that in order to practice free trade a country needs a viable economy to practice it with. Reagan and Bush’s contortions on the issue reflect the inherent difficulty of liberal projects, whose architects often feel impelled to compromise with illiberal pressures. A world where even the most avowed exponents of free trade continually resorted to protectionism, though arguably more free and liberal than what had gone before or than what might have prevailed otherwise, was still not the “flat” free‐​market capitalist world we are being invited to be nostalgic for.



Nostalgists claim that one dividend of American hegemony has been the economic liberalization of the globe, or large parts of it. They could point, for example, to the transformation of China into a wealthy capitalist economy that has lifted its population out of “a dollar a day” poverty. But this liberalizing process is more conflicted than potted histories suggest. Beijing achieved rapid industrial revolution and the movement of its workforce from the field into the factory through authoritarian and illiberal measures: involuntary‐​resettlement urbanization schemes, population control through forced abortion and compulsory sterilization, severe working conditions, repression of civil society, including trade unions, labor, and human‐​rights activists, and internet surveillance, among other measures. The People’s Republic has consistently ranked low on the Freedom Index.46



A more direct application of U.S.-backed liberalism happened in Russia. After communist rule collapsed in 1991, at the urging and advice of the United States’ government and economists, Moscow embarked on a program of “shock therapy” to restructure Russia around the principle of market exchange, adopting accelerated privatization of state industries, deregulation, fiscal discipline, and the shedding of price controls. This experiment was a major effort in the project to enlarge the global liberal order at a rapid clip. It had the support of the leading institutions of global capitalism, the IMF, World Bank, and U.S. Treasury Department. Harvard academic Jeffrey Sachs, one of Russian liberalization’s architects from 1991 to 1993, set out the program’s logic in _The_ _Economist_ , a journal that champions the cause of the liberal world order. “To clean up the shambles left by communist mismanagement, Eastern Europe must take a swift, dramatic leap to private ownership and a market system. West Europeans must help it do so.”47 “Swift, dramatic leap,” a vast program grounded in classical liberal economics, took on the tempo and zeal of the revolutionary communism it aimed to replace. These rapid reforms replaced an oppressive and failed communist system. They did so at Washington’s continual insistence that Russia reform itself on “our conditions.” But the results on many measures were disastrous: capital flight and deep recession; slumping industrial production; malnutrition; the rise of criminality — a criminalized economy, in fact — intertwined with a corrupt oligarchy enjoying a concentration of wealth; and the decline of health care and an increased rate of premature deaths.48 As Nobel laureate and former World Bank chief economist Joseph Stiglitz observed, by eschewing the more gradualist path of Poland or China, the consequences of the program were profoundly illiberal.49 “Liberal order” visionaries are quick to give their ideas credit for the prosperity of nations from Western Europe to the Pacific Rim, finding causation in correlation. They deny such a direct link between their ideas and the problems of post‐​Soviet Russia.50 Yet it is hard to accept that measures like sudden privatization and the rise of monopolies in a corrupt country were not related to asset stripping and capital flight or that “eliminating the housing and utilities subsidies that sustained tens of millions of impoverished families” did not play a major part in the social ruin that followed.51 Western technocrats, diplomats, and politicians were deeply implicated in the new order’s design. 



Lamentations for the end of the liberal order are also heard in the realm of “hard” security. The U.S. hegemon, nostalgists warn, is losing (or has lost) the political will to underwrite the international system through a commitment to permanent alliances and to intervene to bring order out of chaos. Part of the current intellectual confusion flows from the conflation of liberalism, which is supposedly peaceable, consensual, and benign, with the process of “world ordering.” It is here that defenders of the old order present their most misleadingly anodyne account of history. A review of the actual experience of the past 70 years suggests that the process of “world ordering” must at times be coercive. For all the attractions of American hegemony abroad, there has also been resistance and imposition.



To understand how the superpower met that resistance and imposed itself, we must go beyond the romanticized postwar moment of Trumanite internationalism in the late 1940s. Consider both ends of the chronology as it is usually presented, from 1945 until the recent past. Admirers trace the restructuring of international life in that first year to the visionary institution building that President Truman oversaw amid World War II, such as the United Nations Conference on International Organization in San Francisco and its main creation, the UN Charter. In this rendering, the founders conceived the liberal order through a collaborative process of institution building. The narrative is strikingly nonviolent.



In fact, to create the conditions for that visionary world making, the liberal order was conceived in blood. Only months later, the same U.S. president launched two atomic strikes on Imperial Japan, immolating and irradiating two of its cities after blockade, firebombing, and starvation had not broken its will. He did so to put down an adversary that had been brutally pursuing a rival vision for an Asian order of its own. In order to create an order, Washington swept aside a competitor by introducing a genocidal weapon into the world. There are powerful arguments that this was the “least bad” choice available.52 Tellingly, though, in panegyrics for a dying liberalism, the words “Hiroshima” and “Nagasaki” hardly appear.



If there were liberal principles that underpinned the UN as it was founded in 1945, they were at first self‐​determination and sovereignty rather than democracy and human rights. The world order was hardly born “liberal” in the sense implied today: recall that two of the permanent five members of the UN Security Council were totalitarian communist states, and two of the democracies were managing colonial empires that they would not relinquish for decades. Then and now, modern liberalism is antithetical to the grave exertion of state power still practiced in 58 countries, the death penalty. To be sure, the birth of the post‐​1945 world order did advance some liberal ideas broadly. The general norm against imperial aggression was one. This, however, was not strong enough to prevent or dislodge China’s seizure of Tibet, the bids of Turkey and Greece to grab Cyprus, Israel’s occupation of Gaza and the West Bank, India’s occupation of Kashmir and annexation of Goa, Indonesia’s occupation of East Timor, or indeed the Soviet Union’s occupation of Eastern Europe.



At the other end of the chronology, the present moment, consider that the U.S. hegemon has been waging a “war on terror” against Islamist jihadi groups since the 9/11 attacks of 2001. In pursuing the liberal cause of democratization as an antidote to terror, Washington entered the age of “enhanced interrogation” and preventive war. Now, with new weapons (drones) at hand, Washington conducts a sustained campaign of extrajudicial assassinations, often without the consent of host countries and without seeking formal permission or mandates. It has conducted renditions of suspected terrorists without trial. Reluctant to deal with live captives in indefinite detention, a more liberal president from 2009 increasingly avoided the dilemma by killing them. Meanwhile, whatever benefits it has wrought, American unipolarity was not peaceful or liberalizing for the unipolar power. The first two decades of the unipolar _Pax Americana_ after 1989, which made up less than 10 percent of America’s history, generated 25 percent of the nation’s total time at war. That period is more bellicose by an order of magnitude than the preceding eras of bipolarity and multipolarity, in terms of frequency if not intensity.53 Whether in Iraq and Libya, or now with U.S. assistance to Saudi Arabia’s indiscriminate bombardment of Yemen, this proclivity to continuous war making has not created a “liberal” condition of peaceful order. At home, there is a continuous state of alarm and vigilance, whereby “normality” is permanently suspended by an unending state of exception. This, combined with an encouraged state of paternalism where citizens are encouraged to be passive consumers of events, has helped weaken the checks and balances of the republican Constitution.54 Detention without trial, secret, warrantless surveillance, unauthorized wars, torture, covert “black sites” — these are not the obvious features of a robust liberal constitutional order. If large parts of the world have not accepted liberalism in major areas of civic life, neither has the United States.



Instead of a full reckoning with diplomatic history, nostalgists frame history around the positive creation of new architectures and schemes. Thus the Marshall Plan (1948–1961) figures centrally in America’s postwar historic mission, based on, as Benn Steil puts it, “the moral primacy of democratic government and free economic exchange.”55 This absolute, almost platonic account of the past has little room for other, less‐​celebrated events from the same era, such as the British‐ and U.S.-backed overthrow of Iranian prime minister Mohammad Mossadegh in 1953, deposed despite his commitment to national independence and secular democracy. In this picture, the violence and compromises of hegemony, moral and strategic, almost vanish.



Nostalgia for the liberal order also overlooks the reality that it was enforced through coercion. In the same era, a defining episode in the postwar assertion of American hegemony was the Suez crisis of 1956. In that hinge event of the Anglo‐​American relationship, the U.S. Sixth Fleet stalked and harassed British ships in the Mediterranean, fouling their radar and sonar, menacing them with aircraft and lighting them up at night with searchlights.56 With the British pound and oil supplies under pressure, President Dwight Eisenhower threatened Britain with the simple formula of “no ceasefire: no loans.” Patronage could be rapidly withdrawn, regardless of recent history, blood ties, or shared visions of Western‐​enforced order. The United States enforced its interpretation of that order by targeting its ally’s vitals.57



Between those two moments in time, the United States practiced geopolitics ruthlessly. It partly did so in the course of its long security competition with the Soviet Union. Strikingly, the Cold War as it was actually conducted and lived — where two superpowers did not allow rules, sovereignty, multilateralism, and institutions to constrain them when the stakes were high — does not occupy a prominent place in the mytho‐​history. Hardly anywhere in nostalgic reminiscences do there appear the numerous coups that were sponsored or supported by Washington. These interventions linked to the United States since 1945 may or may not have been defensible. They certainly violated one of the claimed core principles of “liberal,” “rules‐​based” order, that of self‐​determination.



The United States not only overthrew governments (sometimes democratically elected ones) — or attempted to — in Albania, Ghana, Guatemala, Greece, Cuba, Chile, Iran, El Salvador, Nicaragua, South Vietnam, Argentina, and Grenada. It also supported violently illiberal forces, from Islamist mujahideen in Afghanistan‐​Pakistan and President Hosni Mubarak’s oppressive state in Egypt to the Indonesian Suharto regime and its death squads. A mainstay of U.S. hegemony in the Persian Gulf is its partnership with Saudi Arabia, an absolutist state that beheads apostates and survives by making concessions to Wahhabi theocrats. It is currently waging a brutal campaign against rebels in Yemen that, according to Amnesty International, includes attacks that are “indiscriminate, disproportionate or directed against civilians and civilian objects, including funeral gatherings, schools, markets, residential areas and civilian boats.”58 NATO allies on the European continent for decades included authoritarian Portugal and Greece. West Germany, the poster child of the liberal order, did not have elections during its first four years, and its proud social democracy retained officials who had been security elites in the Third Reich.59 Former Nazi mandarins stuffed the highest levels of government, including the Foreign Office and the Interior and Justice Ministries. Several former Nazi generals would later become senior commanders in the Bundeswehr. And in the 1948 Italian elections, the CIA helped ensure the electoral defeat of communists by funding anti‐​communist parties, forging documents to discredit the Communist Party, and warning Italians that if they publicly supported the party they would be barred from entering the United States. For the sake of liberalism in the long term, the United States exercised its privileges. If the deliberate subversion of a democratic election abroad with “fake news,” bribes, and coercion represents the antithesis of liberal world order, as Trump’s critics now suggest, then Washington attacked that order in the period of its creation. Coups, partisan electoral interventions, the cooptation of illiberal actors, and the flouting of international law made American hegemony unexceptional.



In dismantling the power of old European colonial empires, the United States erected a form of domination that had an imperial quality of its own. Consider one of its more ambitious ventures in liberal ordering: the invasion and remaking of Iraq. The occupiers of Iraq regarded themselves as liberators. After invasion, though, the United States also projected power over Iraq’s interior governance in imperial fashion and with a liberal program, with all the tensions this implies. Director of the Coalition Provisional Authority Paul Bremer applied a program of rapid liberalization not only through the well‐​known de-Ba’athification and disbanding of the Iraqi Army, but through the order for “the full privatization of public enterprises, full ownership rights by foreign firms of Iraqi businesses, full repatriation of foreign profits … the opening of Iraq’s banks to foreign control, national treatment for foreign companies and … the elimination of nearly all trade barriers.”60 The United States continued to impose itself on Iraqi politics when it wanted, demanding and receiving the resignation of elected prime minister Ibrahim al‐​Jaafari in May 2007. Intended to implant market democracy, these measures infringed the country’s sovereign democratic will. In other words, the liberators were freeing the Iraqis to conform with the occupier’s preferences.



It remains hard to have an empire without imperialism. Yet many visions of liberal order erase the historical process of imperialism, decentering, as Jeanne Morefield argues, “imperial violence while simultaneously positing the necessity of imperial action.”61 If liberalism at a basic level is an enlightenment project committed to liberty, equality, and limitations on state power, and if “world ordering” requires imperialist power projection, it is hard to fuse them without friction. Some may conclude from this historical record that, in the history of American hegemonic “world ordering,” liberalism was missing in action. On each occasion, critics have accused the United States of betraying its own liberal traditions in the pursuit of power. But it is hard to believe that a republic whose leaders so often and so intensely enunciate liberal principles is really driven by secret, amoral cynicism. A more troubling possibility should be considered. Liberalism is a powerful engine of American statecraft, but that statecraft often violates liberal principles. As a dogma of foreign policy, liberalism is jealous, intolerant, and messianic. Applied unchecked, it leads to its own illiberal opposite.62 The practitioners of rough geopolitics were not necessarily hypocrites. They often believed they were serving the ultimate cause of forging a liberal peace under American oversight but that to do so they had to accommodate illiberal allies and pitilessly destroy liberalism’s enemies. In this way, a superpower attempting to create a liberal order permits itself to employ unsentimental methods.



Thus in February 2017, David Petraeus could recall sincerely that “to protect freedom here at home, we adopted a foreign policy that sought to protect and, where possible, promote freedom abroad, along with human rights and rule of law,” invoking American values such as “political pluralism” and “a free and open society.”63 Yet as commander in Iraq, Petraeus sought to reverse that country’s implosion and salvage victory by compromising these standards. To that fight, he brought pragmatic, byzantine divide‐​and‐​exploit methods, paying for the defection of former Iraqi insurgents and working with Shia paramilitary units not known for their commitment to the Hague conventions. As director of the CIA, Petraeus advocated and implemented a campaign of “signature” drone strikes, whereby the assailant knowingly targets a group gathering — at a funeral for an al Qaeda member, for instance — because of their suspicious behavior and association, rather than through verified identification of the presence of individual persons. Such strikes, therefore, can also threaten noncombatants and the innocent.64 To bolster the struggling rebellion in Syria, Petraeus later in 2015 advocated luring away and recruiting “opportunistic” members of the jihadist Jabhat al‐​Nusra, then formally affiliated with al Qaeda.65 This is not the place to arbitrate the wisdom and legitimacy of such measures. Dealing with conflicts in such places is a choice of agonies, and no doubt Petraeus and his peers regard themselves as guarding Americans while they sleep and trafficking with lesser evils to keep greater ones at bay. But note that a senior advocate of liberal order can also advocate measures that risk “crowd killing” and that involve enlistment of members of jihadi terrorist organizations and collaboration with sectarian governments. Champions of liberalism must somehow navigate their ideals through the illiberal demands of warfare.



Nostalgists for the liberal order also betray a shallow conception of their central idea, liberalism. They conflate liberalism with other desirable phenomena, like capitalism and democracy. They neglect the possibility of illiberal democracy, and illiberal capitalism. Majority democratic rule does not equate with, or necessarily produce, a liberal protection of individual rights such as the presumption of innocence or trial by jury, a liberal tolerance for opposition and dissent, or a constitutional order that separates powers and constrains government through an independent judiciary or a free press. Capitalism can also be illiberal, as the Chinese Communist Party demonstrates. One of America’s long‐​term allies, Singapore, evolved as a supervised market democracy that curtailed the right to dissent. South Korea, an ally and protectorate within America’s Asian system, evolved first as a dictatorship under authoritarian founding fathers who were also modernizers, Syngman Rhee and Park Chung Hee. These authoritarians nurtured the _chaebol_ business groups, Hyundai, Daewoo, and Samsung. Free markets took root first as highly protected markets under unfree political conditions. Such contradictions are absent from liberal‐​order panegyrics.



As it is recalled, the “liberal order” embodies the permanent commitment of the United States to alliances and institutions without coercion. A broader historical perspective suggests, however, that Trump’s coercive treatment of allies is less of a break with the past than is often thought. In reality, the United States has often coerced allies with threats of abandonment and punishment.66 In 1954, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles threatened Europe with an “agonizing reappraisal” of alliances. In 1973 and 1974, President Richard Nixon and his national security adviser Henry Kissinger suspended intelligence and nuclear cooperation with Britain to punish noncooperation over a U.S.-initiated declaration of principles and the privacy of bilateral and UK‐​European Economic Community discussions. The United States has used the threat of abandonment to persuade allies and clients to cancel their nuclear programs, including West Germany, Japan, and Taiwan, while threatening adversaries with sanctions or preventive war. The demand that European allies shoulder more of the burden of military expenditure has been a staple of U.S. diplomacy, from President Eisenhower to former secretary of defense Robert Gates. Despite Britain spending blood and treasure in Afghanistan and Iraq to support the war on terror and cement its standing in Washington, President Obama made a blunt threat that departing from the European Union would place the UK at the “back of the queue” when seeking a bilateral free trade agreement. Assured commitment to institutions and allies through only positive solidarity is a false memory. This underlines the pattern whereby Washington underwrites a liberal world order not by adhering to its principles but by stepping outside them, practicing punishment, threats, and bribes that it would not accept if directed at itself. 



In “liberal order” litanies, another persistent claim is that the order was “rules‐​based.” It was not. Rules exist, and flouting them can have costs. But at critical moments for strong states such as the permanent five members of the UN Security Council, rules proved to be slippery; they were invoked, stretched, arbitrarily altered, or ignored, as interest permitted. The unreality of nostalgic legalism was illustrated in the summer of 2016 by two adversaries who both at different times have appealed to “rules” as the arbiter of international order. China defied the unanimous ruling of the Permanent Court of Arbitration, which found against its territorial claims, and continued to expand into the South China Sea and seize disputed waters, islands, and shoals. At the same time, the United States appealed to China to respect the “legally binding” verdict yet had not even ratified the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea that it urged China to observe. From ignoring the International Court of Justice over the mining of Nicaraguan harbors in 1986 to bombing Serbia in 1999 without a UN mandate, the United States has infringed on the letter of international law when it has found that other interests or values were compelling. It exercised a vigilante’s privilege. So too did other major powers. For less powerful and emerging states, the writ of liberal order was often remote, as they “routed around” rules to pursue their interests. In this century, Africa, from the Great Lakes region to the Sudan, has seen millions butchered, displaced, and unavenged. The era may have involved greater degrees of “rule following” than earlier eras. But it was not “based” on the observation of rules, at least not for the major powers. To rebrand this fraught history of power politics as an era of rule‐​bound civility is perverse. There is nothing intrinsically wrong in calling for the conservation, or restoration, of an order on the basis that it represents something better. In this case, though, the nostalgia rests on delusion — about what the world was and what it can be.



The debate around “liberal order” is consequential. Memories of what went before will condition the ability of the United States and its allies to navigate their way ahead. At issue here is neither the legitimacy of American power in the world nor many of its benefits. If there was to be a superpower emerging from the rubble of world war in midcentury, we should be grateful it was the United States, given the totalitarian alternatives on offer. Under America’s aegis, there were islands of liberty where prosperous markets and democracies grew. U.S. internationalism rebuilt Western Europe and East Asia and successfully contained Soviet communism. The central issue is whether this created a wider “liberal” system, and whether the actual historic process of world ordering can even be achieved by liberal means. The answer, in both cases, is no. Even at its zenith, America did not have the power to reorder the world so fundamentally. Its more ambitious efforts to do so generated illiberal as well as liberal results. The limits on power and knowledge are too strong for any world ordering to be so straightforward and benign.



How do we best explain these contradictions? The most accurate answer is not that the United States cynically preached liberalism while practicing realpolitik. Liberalism is an authentic and powerful engine of U.S. diplomacy. It is a pillar of the American diplomatic mind. But it was never all‐​conquering. Long before Trump, large swaths of the globe (and of American statecraft) were unsubjugated by it. Today’s lamentations confuse two phenomena, liberal ideals and institutions on one hand and a hegemon’s world ordering on the other. To underwrite the order it promoted, the superpower exercised prerogatives in ways that cannot adequately be labelled “liberal,” implicitly claiming a privilege to do so. Except in atypical circumstances, large liberal projects require murky bargains. At worst they contain the seeds of their own unraveling, especially in the countries that become laboratories for the most doctrinaire attempts.



Endless recall of the “liberal order” is not only ahistorical. It is harmful. It damages the intellectual capacity to diagnose the failures of the recent past. It harms the effort to construct a workable design for the future. It impedes Washington from undertaking a needed reassessment of its grand strategy that has put the United States where it now is: struggling under the weight of spiraling debt, confronting multiplying foreign conflicts and domestic discord, and set on a collision course with rivals. Appeals to take up the burden, again, of spreading liberalism overseas presupposes the worldview of idealistic technocrats, confident in their capacity to reprogram the world despite growing evidence to the contrary. At a time when a sober reappraisal and some retrenchment is needed, both Trump and his critics undermine that task by peddling ahistorical reductionism. There is a better, non‐​Trumpian critique to be made of a failing foreign policy consensus, and on behalf of an alternative order based on a wiser combination of restraint, deterrence, and power sharing.



A review of the United States’ current grand strategic situation suggests that a clear‐​eyed stock taking is in order. Trump’s presidency doesn’t signify a general retrenchment of the United States and a retreat from international commitments. Under Trump, Washington’s growing commitments still exceed its power. The United States feels its capacity to impose order strained, even with the significant investments it already makes. As Richard Betts once suggested of the annual defense budget, half a trillion dollars is more than enough.67 It is in the size of the policy ambition relative to capabilities, rather than merely the size of those capabilities, where the dangerous imbalance lies. Despite his threats to overturn the old order, the power of the foreign policy establishment and its habitual ideas have steered Trump to quickly conform to the fundamentals of traditional U.S. grand strategy.68 He now aggressively reasserts U.S. primacy. If he poses a danger, it is not from abandonment but overreach. On its current course, the United States is prone to two forms of self‐​inflicted wounds: self‐​encirclement, whereby a state undermines its own security by provoking resistance and counterpower; and imperial overextension, whereby a state expands to the point where the costs outstrip the benefits.69



The United States is accumulating record deficits and growing, unsustainable debts. According to the Congressional Budget Office, federal debt will reach 150 percent of GDP by 2047.70 Because repayment obligations are the first, compulsory items in expenditure and because heavy fiscal burdens beyond a certain proportion of debt‐​to‐​GDP tend to choke economic growth,71 a growing debt load directly impedes the country’s ability to sustain its way of life alongside its extensive international commitments. U.S. grand strategy also gives Washington a proclivity to continuous wars that it chooses to fund through deficits. According to one estimate, U.S. wars from 2001 to 2016 had a budgetary cost of approximately $4.79 trillion, taking into account indirect costs such as interest on borrowing and through‐​life care for veterans.72 Those wars have led to further geopolitical crises and demand for further commitment. Conflict‐​induced anarchy in Iraq and Libya created footholds for the Islamic State and, by upsetting the balance of power in the Persian Gulf, opened the way to a Saudi‐​Iran cold war that now implicates the United States.



The Trump administration has not reversed this imbalance but aggravated it. It has significantly increased the defense budget, while significantly reducing taxes. It has embarked on a deficit‐​financed military buildup, a pattern that historically increases imbalances in the economy and triggers a “boom‐​bust” cycle, and where overreaching wars (like Iraq) and financial meltdowns (like the global financial crisis) are linked.73 The final 2018 defense budget is expected to be 13 percent higher than that of 2017.74 The United States’ grand strategy of primacy saddles it with defense and national security expenditures that amount to over 68 percent of discretionary spending, taking into account the base budget and overseas contingency operations and support for veterans affairs, homeland security, and the nuclear weapons program.75



Meanwhile, the overall direction so far of President Trump’s foreign policy has been to multiply America’s security commitments and entanglements. The United States has implicated itself more deeply in the geopolitics of the Persian Gulf. Trump has intensified America’s confrontation with Iran by abandoning the multiparty settlement on Iran’s nuclear program. He has reinforced U.S. patronage of Saudi Arabia and the Gulf monarchies, while hardening Washington’s alignment with Israel by recognizing Jerusalem as its capital. By November 2017, Trump had increased the number of troops and civilians working for the Department of Defense in the Middle East by 33 percent.76 At the time of writing, the status of America’s commitment in Syria is not clear, with the administration both promising to withdraw yet indicating it would stay to defeat the remnants of the Islamic State, and threatening to continue to punish Syria for chemical weapons use. He increased the U.S. commitment to the Afghanistan‐​Pakistan theater. Lastly, the Trump administration’s _National Security_ _Strategy_ openly acknowledges competition against “revisionist” powers Russia and China.77 And its _Nuclear Posture_ _Review_ expands the conditions under which the United States would threaten nuclear use and plans an increased arsenal of low‐​yield nuclear bombs.78 Escalating rivalries are the likely result. Not only is this imbalance between power and commitments financially difficult to service. It also makes the country harder to govern. Recurrent clashes over federal budgets and the increasing tradeoffs between consumption, investment, and defense lead to periods of paralysis. We see a dangerous interaction between domestic discord and foreign policy failure.



These deteriorating circumstances make it imperative for Washington to conduct a cold reassessment of its grand strategy. It needs to ask what works and what doesn’t, to rank its interests into a hierarchy and distinguish what is vital from what is desirable, to assess what is achievable, and what costs and sacrifices it can bear. The growing demand on already scarce resources, from the mounting costs of defense to the current and future burdens of entitlements, means that it will be difficult for the superpower to increase its extraction of resources from its population base. For a reassessment to be realistic, the country must be able to consider retrenchment, burden shifting, the accommodation of potential rivals, and the limitation of commitments. History suggests strategies that bring a state’s power and commitments into balance and that can successfully prevent overstretch, insolvency, or exhaustion.79 To do this, decisionmakers can draw on an American tradition of prudential, realist thinking about aligning resources and goals. As Samuel P. Huntington summarized it, to address the gap between ambitions and capabilities, states can attempt



to redefine their interests and so reduce their commitments to a level which they can sustain with their existing capabilities; to reduce the threats to their interests through diplomacy; to enhance the contribution of allies to the protection of their interests; to increase their own resources, usually meaning larger military forces and military budgets; to substitute cheaper forms of power for more expensive ones, thus using the same resources to produce more power; to devise more effective strategies for the use of their capabilities, thereby securing also greater output in terms of power for the same input in terms of resources.80



If, however, Washington is held to a fictitious and demanding historical standard, this exercise will be impossible. If “liberal order” visions prevail, it will be deemed immoral even to consider an alternative of restraint. A pernicious byproduct of such nostalgia is its reductionism, whereby traditionalists assert a false choice between primacy or “global leadership” on one hand and inward‐​looking isolation on the other. Accordingly, advocates of primacy brand today’s realists who call for retrenchment as Trumpian.81 By contrast, if Washington can be liberated from the burdensome historical fantasy that hegemonic nostalgists impose upon it, then it can gain a clearer‐​sighted appreciation of the choices now before it.

"Westpac has promised to stop supporting thermal coalmining, joining other major financial institutions in promising it will not back the fossil fuel industry through investments or loans beyond 2030. It leaves ANZ as the only big Australian bank not to have pledged to get out of thermal coal, the dirtiest fuel used in mass electricity generation.  Environmental activists said Westpac’s commitment, which over the next decade includes not taking on new thermal coal customers and limiting support for mines or projects in existing coal basins, was “another nail in the coffin” of the thermal coal industry. It came as Westpac decided to not pay an interim dividend to shareholders after it posted a first-half profit slide because of hefty impairment charges related mainly to the Covid-19 pandemic. Australia’s second-largest lender reported a 70% slump in cash earnings to $993m for the six months ended 31 March, from $3.30bn a year earlier. Net profit was down 62% to $1.19bn. A bank statement released on Monday said Westpac recognised climate change was one of the most significant issues that would affect long-term prosperity of the global economy “and our way of life”. It committed the bank to managing its business in alignment with the goals of the Paris climate agreement, including a transition to an economy that has “net zero” greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. In a list of principles, the bank said climate change was a financial risk, that addressing it would create opportunities and called for the re-introduction of a carbon price. It promised to lend another $3.5bn to climate solutions over the next three years and ensure its financing of electricity plants supported a path to zero emissions. “Westpac’s preferred policy position is that a broad, market-based price on carbon is the most effective, affordable, flexible and equitable means of achieving emissions reductions at the least cost across the economy,” it said. On thermal coal, it said it would support existing customers as it reduces its exposure to the fossil fuel to zero over the next decade. It would continue to offer finance for metallurgical coal, used in steel production, while supporting technology developments to reduce the steel industry’s dependence on it. On oil and gas, it said it would assess their role in the transition to a low carbon economy while providing finance in line with its commitment to the Paris deal. Climate activist group Market Forces said Westpac’s commitment on electricity lending should “squeeze out” new coal power plants and make it near impossible to finance new gas generation. It pointed to an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report that found meeting the Paris goal of keeping global heating as close to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels as possible meant energy from gas must fall 25% below 2010 levels by 2030. The group’s executive director, Julien Vincent, said the bank’s stance was a nail in the coffin of thermal coal and a warning to the federal government if it planned to boost fossil fuels on the way out of the Covid-19 pandemic. “This plan shows it won’t be happening with Westpac’s cooperation,” Vincent said. “Last year, the Commonwealth Bank was the first to commit to be out of thermal coal by 2030 along with all three of our general insurers. Now, anyone trying to operate a coalmine or power station in Australia by the end of this decade will need to do it without Westpac as well.” Market Forces said it hoped the new policy meant Westpac would reverse its recent lending trends, including $5.4bn in loans to coal, oil and gas projects since 2016, far more than the bank made available to renewable energy projects. The activist group found Westpac increased its new investments in fossil fuel projects by 8% in 2018-19 compared with the previous year. The bank said its overall exposure to climate polluting industries, including longstanding investments, fell by 16%. The Investor Group on Climate Change, representing institutional investors with funds under management worth about $2tn, said Westpac’s policy was a positive step that reinforced a global trend among international financiers to strike out or limit coal financing. The group’s chief executive, Emma Herd, said in the past few months some of the world’s biggest funders of coal projects, including Japanese banks Sumitomo Mitsui and Mizuho, had ruled out directly funding new coal plants. Others, such as HSBC, had tightened existing policies. May House, an economic analysts with the Australian Conservation Foundation, welcomed the announcement and called on financial institutions to ensure their financing and investment portfolios were focused on both rebuilding the economy and addressing climate change and biodiversity loss. “For Australia’s big four banks, this does not end at setting an exit date for financing thermal coal, but should extend to ruling out funding any new or expanded oil and gas projects,” she said."

Where will we hold Australia,  
we who have no other country?  
Not Indigenous, merely born here.



Australian politics is periodically rocked by “progressive” fads which generate much sound and fury but ultimately fizzle out because Australians are by and large simply too sensible to indulge such flights of fancy. In the late 90s, it was the Republic push which excited the tiny minds of the inner-city left. But while the luvvies worked themselves into a backslapping lather during their aptly-named “Con-Con”, the sensible mass of ordinary Australians overwhelmingly rejected it when it came to a referendum. The political-media elite likewise keep assuring each other that their imaginary “climate emergency” is “the great moral challenge of our time”: at election after election, Australian voters have quietly begged to differ.



The current fad for Australian “progressives” is a constitutionally-enshrined “Indigenous Voice”. Even the elites are slowly realising that enshrining racial separatism in the nation’s foundational legal document is going to be a hard sell. Enthusiasts like Noel Pearson are tying themselves into ever-more ridiculous knots, trying to deny the obvious.



Cape York leader Noel Pearson says the truth is out about the just movement for a First Nations voice in the constitution and now only lies can defeat it.



Which is kind of rich, considering what comes next.



“Our opponents in the Institute of Public Affairs attempt to put a liberal philosophical sheen on Andrew Bolt’s argument that a First Nations voice would constitute separate treatment on the basis of race in the constitution,” he said.



“This argument succeeds only if you ignore the truth that our claim is on the basis of our being indigenous to this country, not on the basis of race.”



  
If Pearson has finished calling a spade a rectangular manual earth-moving implement, perhaps he would care to explain how that **isn’t** about race?



He might also care to reconcile that claim with his previous statement that:



The essence of indigeneity … is that people have a connection with their ancestors whose bones are in the soil. Whose dust is part of the sand. I had to come to the somewhat uncomfortable conclusion that even Andrew Bolt was becoming Indigenous because the bones of his ancestors are now becoming part of the territory.



If Pearson truly believes that statement, then I, with generations of ancestors whose bones are in the soil of my land, am as indigenous as he. In which case, separate “indigenous recognition” for he but not for me can **only** be on the basis of his race.



Pearson should just admit that he, like every other Australian, already **is** recognised in the constitution: **This Act, and all laws made by the Parliament of the Commonwealth under the Constitution shall be binding on the courts, judges, and people of every State and of every part of the Commonwealth**.



What he, like all the other “Voice” proponents really want is a constitutionally enshrined separate status for just one race of people in Australia. **Apartheid** , we used to call that.

"**A hairdresser who council officials said repeatedly refused to shut during the Covid-19 lockdown has been forced to shut and is due in court.**
Sinead Quinn, owner of Quinn Blakey hairdressers in Bradford, ""repeatedly"" opened several times during lockdown, Kirklees Council said.
She is due before magistrates on Monday.
The council said Ms Quinn and customers who used the salon had been ""illegal, selfish and reckless"".
More Yorkshire stories
Hairdressers were required to close from 5 November under national lockdown restrictions.
Ms Quinn, who was issued with fines totalling Â£17,000 for repeatedly opening, was found to be trading again on Friday.
On Saturday the council submitted a closure notice meaning only the owner, occupier, or someone who lives at the premises could enter.
It also applied for a court order under the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 which if broken it meant an even higher fine and/or prison term.
Previously Ms Quinn said on Instagram she did not accept the fines issued since 9 November, and posted a notice on the salon door quoting the Magna Carta.
Councillor Paul Davies said the council sympathised with businesses suffering under lockdown restrictions but said ""public health must come first"".
""The actions taken by [Ms Quinn] and those who have given her custom during this period have been illegal, selfish and reckless,"" he said.
""[She] has wilfully endangered herself, her customers, the wider community and our staff.""
He said the pandemic had had a ""devastating"" impact on livelihoods and the council did not want to penalise businesses, but said the lockdown rules were needed to lower infection rates and save lives and Quinn Blakey was given ""every opportunity to do the right thing"".
""Public health must come first. We have been left with no choice,"" he said.

"**Moderna is filing for US and European emergency regulatory approval of its coronavirus vaccine so that it can be recommended for widespread use.**
Regulators will look at trial data for the mRNA vaccine and decide if it is safe and effective enough to recommend for roll out.
Clinical studies show the jab is more than 94% effective at protecting people from becoming ill with Covid-19.
Pfizer, which has a similar jab, has already filed for the same US approval.
UK regulators are also reviewing data on the Pfizer vaccine, as well as another type of Covid vaccine from AstraZenca and Oxford University for emergency approval.
Moderna says it hopes to gain UK approval soon, now that it has trial data from 30,000 volunteers - including high risk groups like the elderly - that suggests it works.
In those studies, 15,000 people received the real vaccine while the other participants got placebo injections. No serious side effects were reported.
During the studies, 185 people in the placebo group fell ill with Covid-19, and some severely so.
In comparison, there were 11 cases in the vaccine group and none were severe.
Full trial data has not been released, but will be published in a peer-reviewed journal in due course.
The three front-runner vaccines have different pros and cons.
The AstraZeneca jab is cheaper - around Â£3 ($4) for a dose, compared to around Â£15 ($20) for the Pfizer vaccine and Â£25 ($33) for Moderna's.
And it is potentially easier to distribute because it does not need to be stored under ultra-low temperatures.
But its efficacy in trials - between 62% and 90% - is a bit lower than the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.
The UK has already pre-ordered doses of all three vaccines:
Dr Alexander Edwards, associate professor in biomedical technology at the University of Reading, said: ""This is great news indeed - the more trial data that we have, the greater confidence we have that vaccines can be used to blunt the human cost of Covid-19.
""As the numbers of cases reported grows, confidence grows that this amazing protection will be maintained in a product that can be rolled out to protect the public.""
Meanwhile, the UK's new minister responsible for vaccine rollout, Nadhim Zahawi, said vaccination would not be compulsory, but that society might expect people to get immunised.
He told BBC's World At One: ""I think the very strong message that you will see, this is the way we return the whole country, and so it's good for your family, it's good for your community, it's good for your country to be vaccinated.
""And, ultimately people will have to make a decision."""

The draft national curricular standards released yesterday, as I wrote earlier, will in all likelihood do little or no educational good if adopted. They'll either be ignored or, if hard to meet, dumbed-down.   
  
That said, the really troubling question is not whether the standards will do any good, but whether they will do much harm.   
  
The answer: Oh, they'll do harm. They'll move us one step closer to complete centralization of education, which portends many potentially bad things, from total special-interest domination to even more wasteful spending.   
  
Perhaps the most concerning possibility is that complete centralization -- meaning, federalization -- will lead to nationwide conflict over what the schools should teach, much as we are seeing in Texas right now and witnessed in the 1990s, the last time Washington tried to push ""voluntary"" national standards. Back then national standards in several subjects were proposed, and a national firestorm was set off over what they did, and did not, contain.   




The Common Core State Standards Initiative folks clearly learned from the nineties experience, assiduously avoiding even the appearance of mandating the reading of specific literary works and focusing instead on skills. (The draft standards include a lot of reading exemplars but don't require knowledge of any specific literary pieces). As a result, the response so far seems much less heated than occurred in the nineties, though critiques of the proposed standards certainly do exist. Once control over language arts skills and mathematics is fully centralized, however, can we really expect specific content standards in literature and other subjects to be left entirely to states and districts?   
  
It seems unlikely: Once Washington connects receipt of federal funding to performance on national standards for some subjects, it is very likely to expand into others. After all, aren't science, history, and other topics as important as reading and math?   
  
""Promoting"" science is a huge favorite of federal politicians, so it's certainly hard to imagine science -- and the freighted questions about human origins and climate change that go with it -- not becoming a target for nationalization. Similarly, since many public schooling advocates argue that we must have government schools to create good citizens, it's hard to envision the controversy-laden subjects of history and civics not entering the sites of federal politicians. And when they do, we can either expect the sparks to fly, or the standards that are set to be so milquetoast as to be meaningless.   
  
Wait. Am I being overly alarmist about this, trying to start a trumped-up slippery-slope scare to undermine the current national standards push?   
  
Nope. National standards supporters are already talking about targeting science and history. For instance, in the forward to _International Lessons about National Standards_, a recent report from the national-standards-loving Thomas B. Fordham Institute, it is written about the CCSSI: 





Our authors would prefer for science to be included in this first round, and we’d like to get to history sooner rather than later.



And Fordham is not alone. Indeed, the CCSSI folks have already been talking about creating national science and social studies standards!   
  
When should all kids learn evolution, if at all? How much Hispanic history should students know? How many Founding Fathers should high school grads be able to identify? What caused the Civil War? Is global warming a major threat? Are we a Christian nation? How these and numerous other bitterly contested questions will officially be answered will suddenly have to be duked out by every American, and the winners will get to dictate to the entire nation.   
  
So the language arts and math standards revealed yesterday are, almost certainly, just the camel's nose under the tent. Unfortunately, that means the whole destructive beast isn't far behind.

From “The Hockey Schtick“, some inconvenient truth that breaks Mann’s already broken hockey stick into even smaller pieces. A new paper finds significant cooling of Atlantic Ocean over past millennium, making the MWP warmer in terms of sea surface temperature than today. Since land temperatures (including forest lands of Sheep Mountain and Yamal) respond significantly to ocean temperatures (the ocean is the big kahuna of global heat sinks) it is a pretty safe bet that those favored trees (including YAD 061) experienced warmer temperatures during the MWP than today. The eastern tropical North Atlantic reconstruction of SSTs was based on foraminiferal (marine plankton shells) Mg/Ca ratios that resolves multidecadal variability over the past 1700 years. see below:

The paper, published December 29th, 2011 in the journal Paleoceanography finds that Atlantic Ocean surface temperatures have significantly cooled over the past millennium, since the Medieval Warming Period from about 950-1200 AD.
Summer-Fall Sea Surface Temperatures (SSTs) shown in top graph. Iceland Sea Surface temperatures have also declined over the past 1200 years (4th graph). Note also the significant increase of solar irradiance from the Little Ice Age 1550-1850 to the latter 20th century (5th graph).Key Points: 

Monsoon season SST is reconstructed for the past 3 millennia
Over the past 1700 years, several intervals show multidecadal SST variability
Late medieval cooling amounts to approximately 0.5 degree Celsius

Multidecadal variability and late medieval cooling of near-coastal sea surface temperatures in the eastern tropical North Atlantic 
Henning Kuhnert et al
Multidecadal variations in Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SST) influence the climate of the Northern Hemisphere. However, prior to the instrumental time period, information on multidecadal climate variability becomes limited, and there is a particular scarcity of sufficiently resolved SST reconstructions. Here we present an eastern tropical North Atlantic reconstruction of SSTs based on foraminiferal Mg/Ca ratios that resolves multidecadal variability over the past 1700 years.
Spectral power in the multidecadal band (50 to 70 years period) is significant over several time intervals suggesting that the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) has been influencing local SST. Since our data exhibit high scatter the absence of multidecadal variability in the remaining record does not exclude the possibility that SST variations on this time scale might have been present without being detected in our data. Cooling by ∼0.5°C takes place between about AD 1250 and AD 1500; while this corresponds to the inception of the Little Ice Age (LIA), the end of the LIA is not reflected in our record and SST remains relatively low.
This transition to cooler SSTs parallels the previously reconstructed shift in the North Atlantic Oscillation toward a low pre-20th century mean state and possibly reflects common solar forcing.

"**A mass Covid-19 vaccination programme will need the full support of the executive in order to be delivered, the Ulster Unionist Party leader has said.**
Steve Aiken urged the first and deputy first ministers to present a united front on the importance of the vaccine.
Mr Aiken said Northern Ireland was moving to ""a critical stage"" of the pandemic.
On Sunday, the Department of Health reported three more coronavirus-related deaths and 351 new cases in NI.
It brings the department's overall death toll, which is based on deaths from any cause within 28 days of a positive test, to 986.
GPs in NI are preparing for a mass vaccination programme to begin next month.
Speaking on BBC One's Sunday Politics Mr Aiken said: ""All of the executive should be working together and getting the same message out.
""Now is not the time for backbiting but what we must be doing is supporting [Robin Swann] because we must support our health service to get through this stage.""
Mr Aiken said he would ""love"" the first and deputy first ministers to ""keep coherent with the message they have come out with in the past week"", saying ""they must do that because we're moving to a critical stage"" of the pandemic.
Speaking about the vaccines, Mr Aiken said: ""I really do hope that the various vaccines, their efficacy will be proved and they will be given the approval for their rollout to start.""
He called on Stormont to focus on helping the economy to recover and dealing with the pandemic in the new year.
""We need to be doing this to be able to make sure we can come out the other side and make sure our health service isn't overwhelmed,"" he said.
The UUP leader added that the ""most important thing"" for the people of Northern Ireland to doing was to support the health minister.
On Saturday, the Department of Health reported nine more coronavirus-related deaths and 315 new cases of the virus in Northern Ireland.
It brings the department's overall death toll, which is based on deaths from any cause within 28 days of a positive test - to 983.
Meanwhile, it emerged that GPs in Northern Ireland are planning to deliver Covid-19 vaccines for people aged over 80 who do not live in care homes from 4 January.
Doctors have been advised to ""assume"" the GP vaccination programme will begin on that date.
Approval is anticipated for two vaccines in the coming weeks.
The JCVI (Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation) group will decide on who should be first in line to receive it, but it has been widely reported that care home residents and health and social care workers will be the first priority groups.
GPs will be central to the programme's roll-out, with Northern Ireland relying on them along with health trusts to ""urgently"" begin administering the doses once the drugs are licensed, according to a letter from the Health and Social Care Board sent to GP practices.
The initiative is a ""major undertaking"" by GP practices to ""help bring the pandemic under control"" according to the head of general medical services at the HSCB, Dr Margaret O'Brien.
""Whilst clarity is still required on a number of issues, including the date of approval and delivery of the vaccine, the exact storage requirements and priority groups, the situation is developing at pace and there is a need to plan for the earliest possible commencement of the vaccination programme,"" said Dr O'Brien.
""We do however have enough information to be able to start to plan for a Covid-19 vaccination programme.""
""This is the light at the end of the tunnel that so many of us have been waiting for,"" said Dr Alan Stout, chair of the GP committee at the British Medical Association.
Dr Stout said the intention is ""to get started this side of Christmas"" but acknowledged the rollout will be ""massively challenging"".
Health and social care frontline workers are expected to be vaccinated in the first phase, followed by residents and staff of care homes and the clinically vulnerable.
Without regulatory approval, plans for vaccine delivery are at this stage provisional.
The vaccination programme will be on a phased basis, and will run well into 2021, according to the Department of Health.
Plans include a public information campaign to encourage take up among the public."

In any simple global formula, there should be at least two clearly identifiable sources of uncertainty. One is the sensitivity (d(melt)/dT) and the other is the total available ice. In the TAR, the latter never comes into it in their analysis (i.e., the ‘derivation’ of the GSIC formula) — but my point is that it *does* come in by accident due to the quadratic fudge factor. The total volume range is 5-32cm, which is, at the very least, inconsistent with other material in the chapter (see below). 5cm is clearly utterly ridiculous.

Email 1461, Milind Kandlikar, 2004
With GCMs the issue is different. Tuning may be a way to fudge the physics. For example, understanding of clouds or aerosols is far from complete – so (ideally) researchers build the “best” model they can within the constraints of physical understanding and computational capacity. Then they tweak parameters to provide a good approximation to observations. It is this context that all the talk about “detuning” is confusing. How does one speak of “detuning” using the same physical models as before? A “detuned” model merely uses a different set of parameters that match observations – it not hard to find multiple combinations of parameters that give the similar model outputs (in complex models with many parameters/degrees of freedom) So how useful is a detuned model that uses old physics? Why is this being seen as some sort of a breakthrough?

The question we should all be asking is where has honest objective journalism gone? Has it been cremated or is it lying in a mass media grave where it has decomposed down to its bare bones?



It doesn’t matter whether it’s what we are viewing, hearing, or reading; 95 per cent of what we are fed is left-wing-biased diatribe. Why is that? Where do today’s so-called journalists get their bias from? Universities? Journalism schools? On the job indoctrination? It’s not hard to come up with the answer. All three.



What we have been witnessing for quite some time now is a global phenomenon amongst all forms of media where there is a compulsion to depict the Left always in a favourable light. It has become a habit with the media that this is done with scant regard for truth or objectivity. What is important is the narrative – THEIR narrative.



Politics, climate change or any number of other subjects which should be debated are not anymore because the media take a stance that they deem to be the right and only one, and if too many alternative views are expressed then the comments are terminated. This, of course, is the modus operandi of the Left. **Rather than encourage debate, shut it down.**



The obvious next step in this sequence brings us to free speech. Free speech is fine with the Left as long as they are the ones doing the speaking, which a dutiful and compliant media will lap up as if they’ve just been given Black Forest cake for dessert. I chose Black Forest cake because it comes from the Black Forest region of Germany which is renowned for its fairy tales, which a lot of the news is nowadays. There is a reservation, though;, I got the idea from CNN talking about the world’s best desserts, so it could very well be FAKE NEWS!



The irony in all of this, of course, is that it is the Left of the media (the vast majority) who are losing viewers, listeners and readers. CNN is a leading example and many others aren’t too far behind.



They need to wake up. Right-wing and conservative readers read the news too.

Computer Room 1, University of East Anglia Jan 13, 2009 - somewhere in here is the email and the data
Guest Post by David M. Hoffer
Since both ClimateGate 1&2 there has been considerable confusion in regard to how the emails were obtained, how the FOIA requests were managed, and what was or wasn’t possible in that context.  There is no simple answer to those questions.
The ClimateGate emails span a period of nearly two decades.  During that time period, email systems evolved substantially in terms of technology, implementation, operational procedures, and the job descriptions of those responsible for them.  Other technologies such as backup systems, archive, and supporting technologies for legal compliance also changed (as did the laws themselves).  Saying exactly what was and wasn’t possible for such simple actions as deleting an email have completely different answers over time, and also based on the technology that was implemented at any given time.  With so many moving targets, it is impossible to draw any conclusions to a 100 percent certainty.
This article is written to cover the basics of how email systems and their supporting infrastructure work, and how they have evolved over time.  With that as a common background, we can then discuss everything from the simple questions regarding who could delete what  (and when), how the emails might have been obtained, and possibly most interesting of all, raise some serious questions about the manner in which the FOIA requests were handled at the CRU.

EMAIL 101
There are many, different email systems, and many different ways for end users to access them.  The basics are common to all of them however.  Each user has a “client” that allows them to access their email.  It could be an internet browser based client such as the ones used by Hotmail and Gmail, or it could be an email client that runs on your desk top computer like Outlook or Eudora.  For the purposes of this discussion I am going to discuss how things work from the perspective of an email client running on a desk top computer.
The email client connects an email server (or servers in a very large implementation).  To send an email to someone on a different email server, the two servers must “talk” to each other.  In most cases they do so over the internet.   How the clients interact with the servers however, is part of understanding why deleting an email that you sent (or received) is not straight forward.  The reason is that an email is never actually “sent” anywhere.  Once you write an email it exists on the disk drive of the computer the client software is installed on.  Press “send” and it goes….nowhere.  It is still there, exactly as it was before you “sent” it.
A copy however, has now been sent to the email server you are connected to.  That email server makes yet another copy and sends it to the email server the recipient is connected to.  That email server then makes still one more copy and sends it to the email client on the recipient’s computer, which in turn writes it to the local hard drive.  There are now a minimum of four copies of that one email.

But wait, there may be more copies.  When researchers first started exchanging information via email, they were commonly years ahead of the rest of the world.  Most large organizations had central IT shops, but they ran financial applications for the most part, email was a curiosity at best.  Many researchers were left to run their own email systems, and it wasn’t that hard to do.  Solaris was the UNIX operating system in vogue in those days, and Solaris came with a pretty good email system built in called Sendmail.  There were many other options too.  The bottom line was that early email systems were frequently run by researchers on their own computers.
As time went on, email became more common, and it became more important.  The volume of data, performance matters, and security were all becoming beyond the skill set of anyone but someone whose full time job it was to run IT (Information Technology) systems.  Researchers began giving up ownership of their own email system and central IT shops took over.  Email was becoming mission critical, and a lot of data was being stored in email systems along with records of contract negotiations and other important “paper” trails.  Losing email was becoming a painful matter if important information disappeared as a result.  As a consequence, the systems that protected the data on email systems also began to mature and be run professionally by IT departments.
The early email systems were just a single server with local hard drives.  As they grew in capacity and overall usage, plain old hard drives could no longer keep up.  Storage arrays emerged which used many hard drives working together to increase both capacity and performance.  Storage arrays also came with  interesting features that could be leveraged to protect email systems from data loss.  Two important ones were “snapshots” and “replication”.
Snapshots were simply point in time copies of the data.  By taking a snapshot every hour or so on the storage array, the email administrator could recover from a crash by rolling back to the last available snapshot and restarting the system.  Some storage arrays could handle keeping a few snapshots, others could maintain hundreds.  But each snapshot was actually a full copy of the data!  Not only could a storage array store many copies of the data, consider the question of deletion.  If an email was received and then deleted after a snapshot, even by the central IT department itself, the email would still exist in the last snapshot of the data, not matter what procedure was used to delete it from the email system itself.
What if the storage array itself crashed?  Since the storage arrays could replicate their data to other storage arrays, it wasn’t uncommon to have two arrays and two email servers in a computer room so that no matter what failed, the email system could keep on running.  What if the whole computer room burned down?  Replication to another storage array at a completely different location is also very common, and should the main data centre burn down, the remote data centre would take over.  Keep in mind as you think this through that the ability of the storage arrays to replicate data in this fashion is completely and totally independent of the email system itself.
Early email systems were, as mentioned before, most often a single server with internal hard drives.  A modern “enterprise class” email system would be comprised of many servers and storage arrays more like this:

If you recall that just sending an email makes, at minimum, four copies, consider what “one” copy on a large email system actually translates to.  In the figure above, there are two copies on the storage arrays in the data centre.  If snapshots are being used, there may be considerably more.  Plus, there is at least one more copy being replicated to a remote data center, which also may have regular snapshots of data.  That’s a LOT of copies of just one email!  And we haven’t even started talking about backup and archive systems yet.
Let’s return to the question of deleting email.  It should be plain to see that in terms of current email technology, deleting an email just from the email system itself is not a simple task if your intention is to erase every single copy that ever existed.
As an end user, Phil Jones is simply running an email client connected to an email server run by somebody else.  He has no control over what happens on the server.  When he deletes an email, it is deleted from his email client (and hence the hard drive on his computer), and from his view of his emails on the email server.  Technically it is possible to set up the email server to also delete the email on the server at the same time, but that is almost never done, and we’ll see why when we start discussing backup, archive, and compliance.
On the other hand, are we talking about what was most likely to happen when Phil Jones deleted an email in 2009?  Or what was most likely to happen when Phil Jones deleted an e-mail in 1996?  The answers would most likely be entirely different.  In terms of how email systems have been run in the last ten years or so however, while it is technically possible that Phil Jones hit delete and erased all possible copies of the email that he received, this would have done nothing to all the copies on the sender’s desk top and on the sender’s email server… and backup systems.  Let’s jump now into an explanation of additional systems that coexist along with the email system, and make the possibility of simply deleting an email even more remote.
Backup Systems
Just as we started with email and how it worked at first and then evolved, let’s trace how backup systems worked and evolved.  There are many different approaches to backup systems, but I’ll focus here on the most common, which is to make a copy of data to a tape cartridge.
At first, backup was for “operational” purposes only.  The most common method of making a backup copy of data for a server (or servers) was to copy it to tape.  The idea was that if a disk drive failed, or someone deleted something  inadvertently, you could restore the data from the copy on tape.  This had some inherent problems.  Suppose you had a program that tracked your bank account balance.  But for some reason you want to know what the bank account balance was a week ago, not what it is today.  If the application didn’t retain that information, just updated the “current” balance as it went, you would have only one choice, which would be to restore the data as it existed on that specific day.  To do that, you’d need one tape for each day (or perhaps one set of tapes for each day in a larger environment).  That starts to be a lot of tape fast.  Worse, as data started to grow, it was taking longer to back it up (and the applications had to be shut down during that period) and the amount of time at night where people didn’t need their applications running kept shrinking as companies became more global.
Several approaches emerged, and I will be covering only one.  The most common  by far is an approach called “weekly full, daily incremental”.  The name pretty much describes it.  Every weekend (when the backup window is longest), a full copy of the data is made to tape.  During the week, only what changed that day is copied to tape.  Since changes represent a tiny fraction of the total data, they could be run in a fraction of the time a full copy could.  To restore to any given day, you would first restore the last “full copy” and then add each daily “incremental” on top until you got to the day you wanted.
This worked fine for many organizations, and larger ones bought “tape libraries” which were exactly what they sound like.  They would have slots for dozens, sometimes hundreds, of tape cartridges, several tape drives, and a robot arm that could change tapes for both backup processes and for restore processes.  The problem was that the tape library had to be as close as possible to the servers so that data could be copied as fast as possible (performance degrades sharply with distance).   The following depicts the email system we’ve already looked at, plus a tape backup system:

By making regular copies of data to tape, which was a fraction of the cost of disk storage, the IT department could have copies of the data, exactly as it existed on any given day, and going as far back as the capacity of the tape library (or libraries) would allow.  Now try deleting an email from say a year ago.  In addition to all the copies on disk, there are at least 52 copies in the tape library.  Since we have a tape library however, it is easy to make still more copies, automatically, and most organizations do.
Disaster Recovery
What if there was a major flood, or perhaps an earthquake that destroyed both our local and remote data centers?  In order to protect themselves from disaster scenarios, most IT shops adopted an “off site” policy.  Once the backup was complete, they would use the copy of the data on tape to make… another copy on tape.  The second set of tapes would then be sent to an “off site” facility, preferably one as far away as practical from the data centers themselves.

Consider now how many copies of a given email now exist at any given time.  Unlike that financial application whose “current account balance” is constantly changing, email, once received, should never change.  (But it might which is a security discussion just as lengthy as this one!).  Provided the email doesn’t change, there are many copies in many places, and no end user would have the security permissions to delete all of them.  In fact, in a large IT shop, it would take several people in close cooperation to delete all the copies of a single email.  Don’t organizations ever delete their old data?
Data Retention
The answer to that question can only be answered by knowing what the data retention policy of the organization is.  Many organizations just kept everything until the cost of constantly expanding their storage systems, tape libraries and the cost of housing off site tapes started to become significant.  Many organizations decided to retain only enough history on tape to cover themselves from a tax law perspective.  If the retention policy was implemented correctly, any tapes older than a certain period of time would be removed from the tape library and discarded (or possibly re-used and overwritten).  The copies in the offsite storage facility would also be retrieved to be either destroyed or re-used so that the offsite data and he onsite data matched.
Archive
As email systems grew, the backup practices described above became problematic.  How long people wanted to keep their email for was often in conflict with the retention periods for financial purposes.  They were designed for general purpose applications with ever changing data.  As the amount of data in an email system started to grow exponentially due to ever larger attachments, graphics, and volume, the expense and pressure on even an “incremental” backup window became enormous.  That’s where archive started to emerge as a strategy.  The storage arrays that supported large email systems were very expensive because they had to be ultra reliable as well as ultra high performance.  But 99% of all emails were being read on the day they were sent… and never again.  Only if something made an older email important… evidence of who said what and when from a year ago for example, would an email be accessed again after it was a few days old.  So why house it on the most expensive storage the organization  owned?  And why back it up and make a copy of it every week for years?
Many organizations moved to an “archive” which was simply a way of storing email on the cheapest storage available.  If someone needed an email from a year ago, they would have to wait minutes or perhaps hours to get it back.  Not a big issue provided it didn’t need to be done very often.  Some organizations used low performance low cost disk, some even went so far as to write the archive to tape.  So, for example, the email you sent and received in the last 90 days might open and close in seconds, but something from two years ago might take an hour.  Not only did this reduce the cost of storing email data, but it had the added benefit of removing almost all the email from the email system and moving it to the archive.  Since the archive typically wasn’t backed up at all, the only data the backup system had to deal with in its weekly full daily incremental rotation was the last 90 days.  This left an email system, with the integrated backup and archive systems, looking something like this:

For most IT shops, if you ask them how many copies of a given email they have if it was sent a year ago, they can’t even answer the question.  Lots.
What does that mean in terms of FOIA requests?  Plenty.
Compliance
The world was rolling along quite nicely using these general techniques to protect data, and then the law got involved.  Enron resulted in Sarbanes Oxley in the United States and similar laws in other countries  FOIA came in existence in most western countries.  Privacy laws cropped up.  Suddenly IT had a new problem, and a big one.  The board of directors was suddenly asking questions about data retention.  The IT department went from not being able to get a meeting with the board of directors to having the board shining a spot light on them.  Why?
Because they (the board of directors) could suddenly go to jail (and some did) because of what was in their email systems.  Worse, they could even go to jail for something that was NOT in their email system.  The laws in most jurisdictions took what you could delete, and what you could not delete, to a whole new level.  Worse (if you were a member of the board of directors) you could be held responsible for something an employee deleted and shouldn’t have…. or didn’t delete and should have.  Bingo.  The board of directors is suddenly no longer interested in letting employees decide what they can and cannot delete, and when.  The same applied in most cases to senior management of public institutions.
Back to the original question.  Could Phil Jones have deleted his emails?  When?  In the early days when his emails were all in a server run by someone in his department?  Probably.  When the email system moved to central IT and they started backing it up regularly?  No.  He would only be able to permanently delete any given email provided that he had access to all the snapshot copies on all the storage arrays plus the archive plus all the backup tapes (offsite and onsite).  Fat chance without the express cooperation of a lot of people in IT, and the job of those people, based on laws such as FOIA, SOX and others was to expressly prevent an end user such as Phil Jones from ever doing anything of the sort, because management had little interest in going to jail over something someone else deleted and shouldn’t have.
So…did CRU have a backup system?  Did they send tapes off site?  Did they have a data retention policy and what was it?  Did they have an archive?  If they had these things, when did they have them?
With all that in mind, now we can look at two other interesting issues:

What are the possible ways the emails could have been obtained?
Were the proper mechanisms to search those emails against FOIA requests followed?

Short answer: No.
In terms of how the emails could have been obtained, we’ve seen various comments from the investigation into ClimateGate 1 that they were most likely obtained from accessing an email archive.  This suggests that there at least was an email archive.  Without someone laying out a complete architecture drawing of the email systems, archive system, backup system, data retention policies and operational procedures, we can only guess at how the system was implemented, what options were available, and what options not.  What we can conclude however is that at some point in time, an archive was implemented.  Did it work like the description above about archives?  Probably.  But there are many different archive products on the market, and some IT shops refer to their backup tapes as an archive just to confuse matters more.
In addition, without knowing how the investigators came to the conclusion that the emails were obtained from the archive, we don’t have any way to assess the quality of their conclusions.  I’m not accusing them of malfeasance, but the fact is without the data, we can’t determine if the conclusions are correct.  Computer forensics is an “upside down” investigation in which the “evidence” invariably points to an innocent party.  For example, if someone figured out what Phil Jones username and password was, and used them to download the entire archive, the “evidence” in the server logs would show that Phil Jones did the deed.  It takes a skilled investigator to sort out what Phil Jones did (or didn’t do) from what someone using Phil Jones credentials did (or didn’t do).  So let’s put aside what the investigators say they think happened and just take a look at some of the possibilities:
Email Administrator – anyone who had administration rights to the email system itself could have made copies of the entire email database going back as far as the oldest backup tapes retained with little effort.  So…who had administration rights on the email system itself?  There’s reason to believe that it was not any of the researchers, because it is clear from many of the emails themselves that they had no idea that things like archives and backup tapes existed.
Storage Administrator – In large IT shops, managing the large storage arrays that the application servers are attached to is often a job completely separate from application administration jobs such as running the email system.  Since the storage administrator has direct access to the data on the storage arrays, copying the data from places such as the email system and the archive would be a matter of a few mouse clicks.
Backup Administrator – This again is often a separate job description in a large organization, but it might be rolled in with storage administration.  The point being however, that whoever had backup administration rights had everything available to copy with a few mouse clicks.  Even in a scenario where no archive existed, and copying the data required restoring it from backup tapes that went back 20 years, this would have been a snap for the backup administrator.  Provided that the tapes were retained for that length of time of course, the backup administrator could simply have used the backup system itself, and the robotics in the tape library, to pull every tape there was with email data on it and copy the emails to a single tape.  This is a technique called a “synthetic full” and could easily run late at night when it would just look like regular backup activity to the casual observer.  The backup administrator could also “restore” data to any hard drive s/he had access too… like their personal computer on their desk.
Truck Driver – yes, you read that right, the truck driver.  Google keywords like “backup tapes stolen truck” and see what you get.  The results are eye popping.  The companies that specialize in storing tapes off site for customers send a truck around on a regular basis to pick up the weekly backup tapes.  There have been incidents where entire trucks (and the tapes they were carrying) were stolen.  Did anyone steal CRU’s tapes that way?  Probably not.  The point is however that once the tapes leave your site and are entrusted to another organization for storage, they could be copied by anyone from the truck driver to the janitor at the storage site.  Assembling 20 years of email from backup tapes could be a real hassle of course.  On the other hand, an offsite storage facility frequently has as part of the service it provides to clients…great big tape libraries for automating copying of tapes.   Encryption of backup tapes was a direct response to incidents in which tapes with valuable (and/or embarrassing information) wound up in the wrong hands.
But encryption has only been common for a few years.  That raised an interesting theoretical question.  The last email release ends in 2009, and the rest of the release is, in fact, encrypted.  One can only wonder, does the CRU encrypt their backup tapes, and if so, when did they start doing that?
Administrative Foul Up – One of the biggest “cyber crimes” in history occurred when a company doing seismic processing for oil companies cycled the tapes back to their customers for the next round of data, and sent old tapes to different customers.  One of their customers figured it out, and started checking out the data they were being sent which was from their competitors.  It wasn’t the first time it happened, and it wasn’t the last time.
Janitor – Let’s be clear, I’m not accusing anyone, just making a point.  There’s an old saying about computer security.  If you have physical access, then you have access.  Anyone with physical access to the computer room itself, and the right technical skills, could have copied anything from anywhere.
The FOIA Requests
There are dozens of emails that provide glimpses into both how the email systems at CRU were run, and how FOIA requests were handled.  Some of them raise some very interesting questions.  To understand just how complex compliance law can be, here’s a brief real world story.  Keep in mind as you read this that we’re talking about American law, and the CRU is subject to British law which isn’t quite the same.
In the early days of compliance law, a large financial services firm was sued by one of their clients.  His claim was that he’d sent instructions via email to make changes to his investment portfolio.  The changes hadn’t been made and he’d suffered large losses as a result.  His problem was that he didn’t have copies of the emails he’d sent (years previous) so his legal case was predicated upon the financial firm having copies of them.  To his chagrin, the financial firm had a data retention policy that required all email older than a certain date to be deleted.  The financial firm figured they were scot free.  Here’s where compliance law starts to get nasty.
A whistle blower revealed that the financial firm had been storing backup tapes in a closet, and had essentially forgotten about them.  A quick inspection revealed that a number of the backup tapes were from the time in question.  The financial services firm asked the judge for time to restore the data from the tapes, and see what was on them that might be relevant.  The judge said no.
The judge entered a default judgment against the financial services firm awarding the complainant  $1.3 Billion in damages.  The ruling of the court was that the financial services firm was guilty by virtue of the fact that they had told the court the data had been deleted from that time period, but it hadn’t been.  They had violated their own data retention policies by not deleting the data, and were guilty on that basis alone.  Wake up call for the financial industry…and everyone else subject to compliance law, which includes FOIA requests.
Suddenly deleting information when you said you hadn’t was a crime.  Not deleting information when you said you had, was a crime.  Keeping information could wind up being used against you.  Not keeping information that it turns out you were required to keep (by the tax department for example) could be used against you.  No one serious about compliance could possibly take the risk of allowing end users to simply delete or keep whatever they wanted.  From their own personal accounts certainly, but not from the company email server.  Ever.
In that context, let’s consider just a few words from one email in which Phil Jones, discussing with David Palmer whether or not he’d supplied all the email in regard to a specific FOIA request, says “Eudora tells me…”
These few words raise some serious questions.  Eudora is an email client, similar to the more familiar Outlook.  So, let us ask ourselves:
Why was David Palmer relying on Phil Jones to report back all the emails he had?  Compliance law in most countries would have required that David Palmer have the appropriate search be done by the IT department.  This would have captured any emails deleted by Phil Jones that were still retained by the CRU based on their data retention policy.
Was David Palmer aware of the proper procedure (to get the search done by IT)?  If not, was he improperly trained and who was responsible for properly training him in terms of responding to FOIA requests?  If he was aware… well then why was he talking to Phil Jones about it at all?
Phil Jones specifically says that “Eudora tells me” in his response to Palmer.  Since Phil Jones evidently did the search from his own desk top, the only emails he could search for were ones that he had not deleted.  But, that doesn’t mean he found all the emails subject to the FOIA request, because email that he did delete was more than likely retained on the CRU email server according to their data retention policies.  As in the case of the financial company, the CRU may well have said they didn’t have something that they did.  In fact, we can surmise this to be highly likely.  There are multiple emails showing up in which, for example, Phil Jones says he is going to delete the message right after sending it.  But we now have a copy of that specific message.  Did he send it and then forget to delete it?  Probably not.  The more likely answer is that he did delete it, not realizing that the CRU data retention policy resulted in a copy being left on the server.  If the CRU responded to an FOIA request and didn’t include an email that met the FOIA parameters because they failed to search all their email instead of just the email that Phil Jones retained in his personal folder… well, in the US, there would be some prosecutors very interested in advancing their careers…
“Eudora tells me” is even more curious from another perspective.  Why “Eudora”?  Why didn’t he say that he’d searched all his email?  Why specify that he’d used the search capabilities in Eudora?  Personally, I have three email systems that I connect to, and a different email client for each one.  Searching all my email and searching all my email in just one email client are two completely different things.  Most interesting!
While I am comfortable discussing with IT shops how to architect email systems to protect data and properly service legal requirements such as FOIA requests, I have to admit that I wouldn’t know where to start in terms of submitting one.  If I did, I just might ask for all the emails they have pertaining to FOIA requests, and I’d be specific about wanting all the email, regardless of it being in the main email system, the archives, or on backup media, and all the email that ever existed, regardless of having been deleted by end users.  Then for the capper, I’d ask for their data retention policy and see if they managed to meet it in their response.
Just sayin’

Few express opinions different from what they are paid to say, and such is equally true for those who work for government. On an almost daily basis, the world is treated to presidential spokespeople denying what most people understand to be true.



Last week, Jason Furman, President Obama’s chief economic adviser, who used to have a reputation as a competent economist, embarrassed himself by trying to deny — in response to a Congressional Budget Office report — that the president’s proposal to increase the minimum wage would cost jobs. Many on the left, including some economists, pretend that the law of supply and demand does not fully apply when it comes to wages. All will admit, however, a $100 an hour minimum wage would be a huge job killer. So what they are really saying, without admitting it, is the political advantages of supporting a smaller increase in the minimum wage outweigh the economic cost, which will primarily be borne by young people and the least skilled (who tend not vote in the same numbers as those who might benefit).



Many of those advocating a higher minimum wage are the same folks who correctly claim that higher taxes on tobacco will reduce smoking over time and argue that higher taxes on carbon will tend to reduce such emissions over time. If higher prices for smokers and carbon emitters change behavior and result in less tobacco and coal being produced, why would not higher labor costs result in fewer workers being hired?



All too many professionals are willing to ignore empirical evidence when it conflicts with their beliefs or those of their employers. Perhaps in no place do we see greater evidence of this than in the field of climate science. Most climate scientists are hired directly or indirectly (i.e., through grants to the institutions that employ them) by governments. A climate scientist whose research showed that climate change is normal and proceeding at a rate that poses no danger to mankind would most likely be excluded from future funding. The political class tends to only spend taxpayer monies on things that directly benefit them or expand their power. During the past three decades, global temperatures have changed more slowly than predicted by 95 percent of the models. There was an 18‐​year period of global warming, but there has been a standstill in global temperature rises for the last 17 years.



If the climate scientists who produced all of these grossly defective, predictive models had been employed by private companies that depended on the accuracy of their predictions, they would have been fired, or at least sent back to start over again. Trying to track all of the things that can affect climate — or the economy — in a model is an extraordinarily difficult, if not impossible, task. Private economic forecasters who are consistently wrong tend to lose their credibility and at least some of their income.



There is one group of economic forecasters, though, who suffer very little loss of prestige or income, even though they may often be wrong. They are those who work for the Federal Reserve and other government agencies. The press, out of ignorance or laziness, gives far more coverage and prestige to the “official” forecasts of government agencies than to nongovernment forecasters, many of whom have far better forecast records.



Last week, the Federal Reserve released 1,865 pages of transcripts of its private policy meetings from 2008, the year of the financial crisis. Among the things these documents reveal is that members of the Fed did not understand what was going on with the economy as well as many private analysts and, as usual, were late to react. The members of the Fed also had strong disagreements with each other about the state of the economy and what actions they should take. None of this is particularly surprising, but it should serve as another warning about giving government too much power.



When people take positions in government, they neither become smarter or wiser, but people with power often develop a “fatal conceit” (in the words of F.A. Hayek) that they “know” things they do not know.



The British “Met Office” is responsible for weather forecasts in Britain and has been a promoter of the global warming thesis. In November, the Met Office predicted much drier than normal winters for Britain because of global warming. Instead, Britain has just suffered the wettest winter since records have been kept, resulting in widespread flooding and several deaths. Fatal conceit?

 “Tim, Chris, I hope you’re not right about the lack of warming lasting till about 2020”
Question: If warming really threatens to destroy human civilization, why was Jones hoping for warming?

And if the world was still warming in 2009, why did Jones refer to “lack of warming”?
Email 4195
Tim, Chris, I hope you’re not right about the lack of warming lasting till about 2020.
…
I seem to be getting an email a week from skeptics saying where’s the warming gone. I know the warming is on the decadal scale, but it would be nice to wear their smug grins away.
Maybe he needs a backup plan: 
MacCracken suggests that Phil Jones start working on a “backup” in case Jones’ prediction of warming is wrong

ClimateGate FOIA grepper! – if the sulfate hypothesis is right, then your prediction of warming might end up being wrong
In any case, if the sulfate hypothesis is right, then your prediction of warming might end up being wrong. I think we have been too readily explaining the slow changes over past decade as a result of variability–that explanation is wearing thin. I would just suggest, as a backup to your prediction, that you also do some checking on the sulfate issue, just so you might have a quantified explanation in case the prediction is wrong. Otherwise, the Skeptics will be all over us–the world is really cooling, the models are no good, etc. And all this just as the US is about ready to get serious on the issue.
We all, and you all in particular, need to be prepared.
Best, Mike MacCracken [Note that Obama’s chief science advisor, John Holdren, is copied on this email]
Thanks to Tom Nelson for spotting these

"**The US could see ""surge upon surge"" of coronavirus cases as people return home from the Thanksgiving holiday, a top US disease expert has warned.**
Speaking on Sunday, Dr Anthony Fauci said it was ""not too late"" for those yet to travel to help curb the virus by wearing masks and socially distancing.
Thanksgiving typically heralds the busiest week for travel in the US.
The US has recorded more than 13 million coronavirus cases and more than 266,000 people have died.
As of Sunday, the number of Covid-19 cases recorded in November has surpassed four million, double the figure recorded in October.
Last year, an estimated 26 million people passed through US airports in the week surrounding the holiday.
Health experts had called for people to spend Thanksgiving at home, but this week US airports marked their busiest period since mid-March.
Anywhere from 800,000 to more than one million travellers passed through US airport checkpoints on any day during the past week, according to Transport Security Administration statistics.
""There is almost certainly going to be an uptick because of what has happened with the travel,"" Dr Fauci told CNN's State of the Union.
In another television appearance, he recommended Thanksgiving travellers to quarantine for a period of time ""if it's possible"".
Dr Deborah Birx, White House coronavirus response coordinator, echoed Dr Fauci's concerns, telling CBS News that people who had travelled for the holiday should avoid seeing relatives over the age of 65.
""Now we're entering this post-Thanksgiving surge with three, four and 10 times as much disease across the country,"" she said. ""We are deeply worried"".
Meanwhile, in **New York City** Mayor Bill de Blasio says schools can reopen in December, weeks after they were shut for a second time. Parents had complained that bars and restaurants were able to operate, but not schools.
And in **California** , Los Angeles county is imposing a new three-week lockdown from Monday, which will ban most public gatherings and limit the number of people allowed in shops at any one time.
This coming week, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention is set to discuss the rollout of the vaccine with the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.
Dr Fauci said the vaccine offered a ""light at the end of the tunnel""."

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited Washington in style, with a state dinner and speech to Congress. He brought with him plans for a more expansive international role for his country, but the military burden of defending Japan will continue to fall disproportionately on America.



World War II still hangs over Japan and its relations with neighboring states. As occupying power, the U.S. imposed the “peace constitution” on Tokyo, with Article Nine banning possession of a military. As the Cold War developed, however, Washington recognized that a rearmed Japan could play an important security role.



Japanese officials equaled American politicians in creatively interpreting their nation’s fundamental law—Tokyo established “Self‐​Defense Forces” as opposed to armed forces. However, Japan’s governments hid between the amendment to cap military outlays and limit the SDF’s role, ensuring American protection.



That approach also suited Tokyo’s neighbors, including other U.S. allies, most of which had suffered under Imperial Japan’s brutal occupation. Although not everyone was hostile to Tokyo, Australia, the Philippines, and South Korea especially preferred Japan disarmed and Washington as military guardian. Marine Corps Gen. Henry Stackpole famously referred to U.S. troops in Japan as a “cap in the bottle” to remilitarization.



As America’s economic edge ebbed and the international security challenges grew, Washington urged Tokyo to do more, though under U.S. direction. Movement was glacial, however. Although some members of the ruling LDP, such as Abe, who previously served as prime minister, shared a more nationalist perspective, policy change was limited by the pacifist‐​minded population. In recent years, however, Japanese sentiment has shifted toward a more vigorous military role in the face of an unpredictable North Korea developing both missiles and nuclear weapons and a powerful China growing more confrontational.



This changing environment generated the new “Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation,” formally released on Tuesday. Yet the much‐​heralded document—the first revision in 18 years—might deliver less than promised. The guidelines are only aspirational and state that they create no obligations for either government.



More important, the presentation is about Japanese, not American security. In essence, the new standards affirm what should have been obvious all along—Japan will help America defend Japan. For instance, the guidelines discuss responding to “emerging threats to Japan’s peace and security” and “an armed attack against Japan.” Washington commits to “continue to forward deploy combat‐​ready forces in the Asia‐​Pacific region and maintain the ability to reinforce those forces rapidly.” In contrast, there is nothing about Tokyo supporting U.S. defense or security. American interests simply are subsumed in a short section at the end about “cooperation for regional and global peace and security.”



This approach was evident in the Prime Minister Abe’s speech to Congress, when he spoke of maintaining “the peace and security of the Asia‐​Pacific region.” He emphasized “the central pillar that is the U.S.-Japan alliance.” Tokyo’s responsibility, he said, is to “fortify the U.S.-Japan alliance.” He explained that his government is seeking “to enhance the legislative foundations of our security” in order to “make the cooperation between the U.S. military and Japan’s Self‐​Defense Forces even stronger, and the alliance still more solid.” He lauded the new provisions under which Japan would “take yet more responsibility for the peace and stability in the world,” but as examples mostly cited humanitarian and peace‐​keeping operations.





The military burden of defending Japan will continue to fall disproportionately on America.



Even these modest changes won’t come easily. Abe enjoys a large legislative majority, but his coalition partner, necessary to reach two‐​thirds, opposes amending Article Nine. The public also is skeptical: last year demonstrations erupted against Abe’s defense proposals and one protestor set himself on fire, forcing the government to adjust its plans. A recent Pew Research poll found that only 29 percent of Japanese supported new legislation to implement the guidelines. Just 23 percent wanted their government to be more active militarily.



Nor is there any guarantee that Tokyo will aggressively implement the new standards if passed. A Foreign Ministry spokesman treated as a great advance the fact that the new rules would allow a Japanese ship on patrol with an American vessel to render aid if the latter was attacked—something which most Americans would see as inherent to any genuine “alliance.” However, Tokyo professor Narushige Michishita argued that “technically” the new rules would not allow Japan to defend a U.S. ship if Japan’s security was not directly threatened. Moreover, Tokyo almost certainly would do its best to avoid situations where combat might be involved. Opined Japanese scholar Jun Okumura, “We will wait a long time before a destroyer is conveniently nearby when the Chinese [navy] attacks the U.S. 7th Fleet.”



Worse, Japan’s military outlays were essentially flat over the last decade while Washington, and more ominously for Japan, the People’s Republic of China, dramatically increased military expenditures. Tokyo’s annual spending of some $50 billion annually is about one‐​third to one‐​fourth as much as the PRC (estimates of China’s real spending vary). Focusing SDF resources on non‐​military duties, as suggested by Abe in his speech, actually would inflate the PRC’s military edge, with the U.S. left to fill the widening gap.



Obviously Abe expects the two nations’ basic roles to remain the same. Tokyo’s job is non‐​combat. Abe touted his nation’s “proactive contribution to peace based on the principle of international cooperation.” That is, Japan will do some relatively costless and riskless social work which will enhance Tokyo’s international reputation. For instance, Japan is prepared to help deal with “terrorism, infectious diseases, natural disasters and climate change.” Even Tokyo’s potential new “security” duties appear designed to avoid combat—cyber warfare, reconnaissance, mine‐​sweeping, logistics. None of these require a military alliance.



Washington’s job is to do anything bloody or messy. That is, deter and fight wars with other militaries, a task which the prime minister ignored. Some observers talk about the guidelines creating a more equal relationship based on mutual defense, but that isn’t what the new rules say. The U.S. has been responsible for defending Japan. The U.S. continues to be responsible for defending Japan. Indeed, it must do more to defend Japan. Explained President Barack Obama: “I want to reiterate that our treaty commitment to Japan’s security is absolute, and that Article 5 covers all territories under Japan’s administration, including Senkakus Islands.” The Joint Statement of the Security Consultative Committee reported that both nations’ ministers “confirmed the strategic importance of deploying the most modern an advanced U.S. capabilities to Japan”; “welcomed the deployment” of various American aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, and ships; and “stressed the importance of sustained cooperation in enhancing Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) capabilities” through deployment of additional U.S. weapons. (Many of these likely will go to Okinawa, which already bears a disproportionate burden of America’s “forward presence.”)



Since the PRC is a nuclear power, in practice the U.S. must continue to risk Los Angeles to protect Tokyo. Of course, no one imagines a conflict, let alone one that would go nuclear. However, wars often are not expected and rarely turn out as predicted. Beijing has far more at stake in any East Asian conflict and would be willing to risk much more than would Washington. Confronting China over Japan would not the same as disposing of Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, or Serbia.



While America has an obvious interest in Japan’s continued independence, no one imagines a Chinese attempt to conquer Tokyo. Rather, the most likely trigger for conflict today is the Senkaku Islands, a half dozen valueless pieces of rock which have taken on increased importance because of the potential resources around them. Beijing’s claim to what the Chinese call the Diaoyus is as good if not better than that of Japan. That doesn’t justify the PRC using force, but Abe so far has preferred confrontational to compromise—a stance reinforced by Washington’s explicit guarantee.



One provision of the new guidelines directly though anonymously deals with the Senkakus: “If the need arises, the Self‐​Defense Forces will conduct operations to retake an island.” In such an effort the SDF would expect to work with U.S. units, especially those currently stationed in Japan. Moreover, the two governments are discussing mounting joint patrols elsewhere in the South China Sea, which also would draw the U.S. into any Japanese confrontation with China, including over claims of other nations which might be cooperating with Tokyo, such as the Philippines and Vietnam.



Abe’s historical revisionism further inflames regional tensions. It is difficult to assess what proportions are belief, tradition, and politics. Abe and other senior officials backed away from prior acceptance of Tokyo’s responsibility for starting the Pacific war and coercing women into military brothels. High profile visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, which memorializes several Class A convicted war criminals, inflame passions. Revised textbooks downplayed Japan’s World War II role and emphasized Japan’s current territorial claims.



None of this suggests that Tokyo is about to embark upon a new round of imperial conquests. But such incidents create suspicion and antagonize other nations, including South Korea, which should work closely with Japan to promote regional peace and stability. Abe addressed the historical controversy in his speech to Congress when he spoke of his “deep repentance in my heart” for American lives lost fighting in the Pacific in World War II and reaffirmed the apologies of prior Japanese premiers for their nation’s conduct. However, he should use the same tone in addressing his neighbors and his government should avoid new incidents.



There actually was much to celebrate in Prime Minister Abe’s visit. But a largely one‐​way military alliance is not one of them. Abe intended to highlight the changing bilateral alliance. Unfortunately, Washington and Tokyo only have reinforced the status quo. President Obama admitted: “it’s important to recognize we do not expect some instant and major transformation in terms of how Japan projects military power.” Worse, he obviously doesn’t expect Tokyo to take over more responsibility for defending its own interests. Alas, American policy almost guarantees that Japan will never devote lives and resources to its own defense commensurate with its interest in its own defense.



Indeed, U.S. officials appear to have forgotten the purpose of alliances—to help the country making the alliance. Abe was eloquent in stating why Japan enjoyed being allied with America. It isn’t evident what the U.S. receives in return. The problem is not just the administration. Representatives J. Randy Forbes and K. Michael Conaway, members of the Armed Services Committee, pushed an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act “reiterating the United States’ commitment to Japan.” Why? No doubt, Washington defending Japan is good for Tokyo. But how does doing so benefit Americans who do the paying today and may do the dying tomorrow?



After World War II the U.S. sensibly shielded allied states from totalitarian assault as they recovered. That policy succeeded decades ago. Now Washington should cede responsibility for defending its populous and prosperous friends and allies. These nations still should cooperate, including on the “human security” issues emphasized by Abe. Moreover, America should remain a watchful and wary friend, prepared to act from afar against potentially hostile hegemonic threats. Beijing might eventually become one, but it is not close to being one today. In the meantime Washington should let other states manage day‐​to‐​day disputes and controversies in the region.



The U.S. should not tell Tokyo what to do. Japan’s defense and foreign policies belong to the Japanese. Nor should American officials attempt to micro‐​manage Tokyo’s responses to Chinese challenges in the Senkakus or elsewhere. Rather, Washington should explain what it will not do. No promise of war on Japan’s behalf, no forward military deployment, no guarantee for Japanese commerce at sea, no Pentagon backing for contested territorial claims.



This would force the Japanese people to debate their security needs, set priorities, and pay the cost. A great nation with global interests situated next to a potentially hostile revanchist state probably should spend more than one percent of GDP on the military. Moreover, Tokyo would have added incentive to improve its relationships with neighboring states. East Asia will more secure if weaker nations work together to constrain the PRC, and Japan already is forging useful ties with India, the Philippines, and Vietnam. Relations with South Korea require concerted effort to improve, something more likely if neither country can rely on America to backstop its security. In this way military necessity might be the most powerful impetus for Japan to downplay historical revisionism.



After 70 years the U.S. should stop playing globocop, especially in regions where powerful, democratic friends such as Japan can do so much more to defend themselves and their neighborhoods. This would be the best way to enhance security and stability not only of the Asia‐​Pacific, of which the prime minister spoke, but also of America, which is Washington’s highest responsibility.

"A new study has found that the government’s $4bn Murray-Darling irrigation efficiency program, designed to make farms more efficient while returning some of the saved water to the environment has actually led to irrigators who received subsidies extracting more water than those who did not. The study by academics from University of Adelaide, University of NSW, the Australian National University and the Environmental Defenders office found up to 28% more water was extracted by those who received subsidies. It also found that the subsidies went mainly to corporate farming and that 51% of irrigators themselves were sceptical about whether the programs were working. Their findings, published in the international journal, Resources, Conservation and Recycling, analysed almost 2,500 on-farm Murray-Darling Basin irrigation surveys and identified a “rebound effect” of increased water extractions, coinciding with the Australian government’s investment in irrigation infrastructure upgrades. Efficiency programs – such as installing drip irrigation or lining dams – are funded under the Murray Darling Basin plan as a way of reclaiming water for the environment. The water savings achieved by the upgrades are meant to be shared between the farmer and the environment, as a win-win. But this study argues that the schemes often amount to “robbing Peter to pay Paul” because they reduce flows into the environment that were occurring in the past through groundwater systems and are leading to greater water extractions by those who get the subsidies. The efficiency programs under the Murray Darling Basin plan have long been controversial because they cost roughly three times as much as buying back water directly from from farmers. But direct buybacks are highly contentious in rural communities because of their economic impact. Prof Quentin Grafton, from the Crawford School at ANU told a senate committee last year that the difference is approximately $5,400 per megalitre for water infrastructure subsidies versus just over $2,000 per megalitre for the purchase of water entitlements from willing sellers. Now this report casts doubt about whether they are actually retrieving water at all. “Combined with documented concerns around measurement of water and compliance, this raises serious doubts about the true extent to which environmental flows are increasing at a catchment and basin level, as a consequence of the subsidised upgrades,” the authors said. Lead author and resource economist Prof Sarah Wheeler from the University of Adelaide said: “Our analysis over the past decade found that irrigators who received infrastructure grants actually increased their water extraction volumes by 21 to 28%, compared to irrigators who received no subsidies.” The subsidies aim to help irrigators upgrade their infrastructure technology to save water and return some savings to the environment, in a bid to increase stream flows and ultimately reinstate a sustainable level of extraction in the Murray Darling Basin. Prof Richard Kingsford, director of the Centre for Ecosystem Science at UNSW Sydney, said the implementation of some government programs seemed to have the opposite effect of what they had intended. “The ‘buyback’ of irrigation water has put water back into the rivers, but our research found the subsidised infrastructure program could be ‘robbing Peter to pay Paul’ by enabling more water extractions than water recovered through the efficiency program,” Kingsford said. The study also found that half of all irrigators surveyed agreed that the taxpayer-funded program for the irrigation infrastructure was ‘wasteful and inefficient’. The study found that the program favoured corporate agriculture, in terms of subsidy amount per entity more than family farms. The increase water extraction occurred because of changes in crop types, increases in irrigated areas and greater use of surface water entitlements [water that is captured on farm rather than being allowed to flow into the river system],” Grafton said. Environmental Defenders Office special counsel Emma Carmody said: “There are a range of regulatory and governance issues which could result in the increased taking of water from some rivers and aquifers in the MDB, beyond specified limits.” These include illegal extractions, increased floodplain harvesting, groundwater substitution and problems with ‘sustainable diversion limit’ compliance tools in some catchments. Kingsford warned that if water consumption is not being controlled as required by the basin plan, the health of rivers and groundwater systems in the Murray-Darling Basin will continue to degrade, without even accounting for the current and future threat of climate change."
"**Employers are cutting hundreds of thousands of jobs as Covid-19 continues to hit the economy.**
While many parts of the country went into lockdown to combat the spread of the virus, unemployment numbers have been rising sharply. How high could the unemployment rate go?
The most widely used measure is the unemployment rate. It counts how many people are able to work and want a job, but can't find one.
The most recent unemployment rate - for July to September - was 4.8%, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
That is an increase of 0.7% over the previous three months, and meant that 1.62 million people were unemployed.
However, this number is always based on surveys taken in previous months and is not right up to date. Some of the data was gathered in July and August, when infection rates were falling, and large parts of the economy were reopening.
So this figure is likely to carry on rising in coming months.
Most economists expect unemployment to continue rising for the rest of the year.
UK unemployment is likely to reach 2.6 million in the middle of 2021, according to the government's economic watchdog, or 7.5% of the working age population. It's currently about 1.6 million.
This is echoed by the Bank of England, which forecasts that unemployment will most likely peak at about 7.7% in April to June of next year.
There was a high degree of uncertainty around that forecast, with a small chance that it could rise as high as 10%.
However, those forecasts don't take into account the government's decision to extend the furlough scheme to the end of March.
The government has been trying to protect jobs through a number of measures. The largest is the furlough scheme, where it pays most of the wages for workers when their employers cannot. That has prevented many of those people becoming unemployed.
However, the furlough scheme was being wound down in September and October, ahead of its planned closure on 31 October.
Many companies cut jobs in preparation for the end of the scheme, and July to September saw a record rise in the number of redundancies of 181,000.
The government has now announced an extension to the scheme for another five months, which it hopes will protect more jobs.
The easing of lockdown restrictions across the summer also boosted the numbers of people counted as unemployed.
People who weren't looking for a job during the first lockdown were considered ""economically inactive"", and weren't included in the figures. But as the rules changed, they began to look for work and were therefore classed as unemployed.
The figures for July to September saw a record number of people move from inactive to unemployed - 215,000.
One of the hardest-hit groups has been young people. The figures show that 174,000 fewer 16- to 24-year-olds were employed in July to September, compared to the previous three months.
The ONS says that this is because young people are more likely to be working in areas such as hotels, restaurants and tourism. Jobs like these have been particularly hard-hit by lockdown, and quarantine restrictions have reduced the number of tourists.
The latest official statistics capture the state of the country before a lockdown across all of England was announced, and the extension of the furlough scheme.
They do show a picture of many things improving, although that may not last.
The total number of hours people worked in July to September increased as parts of the economy reopened and people returned to work.
The average amount people earn had been falling sharply during the crisis, but it rose 1.9% in the latest figures (excluding bonuses).
The number of job vacancies available also continued to increase, but there are still 35% less than a year ago.
The start of the pandemic saw a big increase in the number of people claiming out-of-work benefits, which was much bigger than the rise in the number of people counted as unemployed.
In October 2020 the number of people claiming either Jobseeker's Allowance or universal credit because they were ""searching for work"" was 2.6 million, 1.4 million higher than March, before the pandemic had begun to take effect.
However, some of these people are working, but with low earnings either because they are on low wages or short hours.
The ONS says it cannot tell how many of those people are out of work, or whether they are now able to get universal credit because the rules for claiming it have changed."
"In 2015, flooding exposed the frozen bodies of two cave lion cubs in the Yakutia region of Russia. Members of a species that vanished at the end of the last Ice Age, the pair were buried approximately 12,000 years ago when the roof of their den collapsed and trapped them in the frozen ground. In photos, their faces are so well-preserved one might almost believe they are only sleeping. Yet despite their unusually perfect condition, the cubs are not the only such relics to have appeared in recent years. Throughout the Arctic and subarctic, animals and artefacts buried for thousands of years are reappearing, liberated from their frozen graves by the rapid warming in the region. In the Alps and elsewhere, bodies of people lost for decades in the mountains are emerging from the ice as glaciers melt. In Australia, towns submerged for generations are resurfacing as dam levels fall due to drought and heat.   As British author Robert Macfarlane has observed, these uncanny emergences or “Anthropocene unburials” are part of a larger process of unsettlement and unhinging. As human time and geological time collapse into one another, the deep past is erupting into the present all around us with terrifying and uncanny consequences. What was fixed is now in flux, what was settled is being swept away faster than we can save it. Nor is it just the past that has become unstable. The climate emergency is unsettling our future as well, erasing what we thought was certain, what we thought we knew. For many people this process became suddenly tangible last summer when fires devastated south-eastern Australia. Over weeks and months we watched helplessly as the conflagration consumed lives, livelihoods, even entire ecosystems, while images that seemed wrenched from a dystopian future flickered across our screens. In the months since, those images have been superseded by the spreading catastrophe of coronavirus, a moment of discontinuity that has only reinforced the vulnerability of our society, the speed with which natural forces can overwhelm the structures that sustain and shape our world. Part of the job of any art is what the cultural theorist Donna Haraway calls staying with the trouble. Art exists to record how it feels to be alive here, now, to capture the confusing, conflicting, sometimes terrifying, sometimes joyous messiness of the moment. It exists to bear witness. But art also needs to do more than just capture the here and now. We need it to help us see beyond the immediate, to understand how our stories connect to those of other people, in other times, to help us recognise we are part of a larger story. A desire to give shape to some of these connections drove my 2015 novel, Clade, which traced the experiences of three generations of a family as their world was transformed by climate catastrophe. When I was writing Clade it still seemed possible we might avoid the worst effects of global heating. But in the years since finishing it that hope has become harder and harder to sustain. Every day brings new stories of loss and extinction, every day our world seems to grow more violent, more deranged. Every day the spectre of collapse seems closer at hand. Faced with this reality I began to ask a series of slightly different questions, questions about inevitability and the new reality we inhabit. At what point, I wondered, does what we are losing become unbearable? At what point does hope become just another form of denial? How are we to live in such a world? My new novel, Ghost Species, seeks to explore these questions by asking what it would mean if the deep past were to come to life in a literal sense, through a scheme to recreate a Neanderthal child from remnant DNA. Although this idea might seem pure science fiction, it isn’t, or isn’t quite. Many scientists believe cloning may offer a way to de-extinct species wiped out by human activity. Here in Australia researchers have already laid many of the building blocks to resurrect the thylacine, while in Russia scientists in Siberia are working on a scheme to hold back the collapse of the permafrost by recreating the ecology that existed in the region 12,000 years ago, complete with woolly mammoths. It seemed to me this technology and its possibilities offered a way of thinking through not just the idea that the world might have become unhinged, that time might be out of joint, but also the processes of grief and mourning so many of us are grappling with. What is it we are losing when a species or an ecosystem vanishes from the world? What it is we think we are bringing back if we recreate them? What would it be like to be such a being? As the story and characters took shape, I found myself asking other questions. Questions about the super-rich and their planning for the end of the world. Questions about love and loss and the bond between the child and her adoptive mother. Questions about the boundary between human and the non-human. Along the way I began to write differently as well. Environmental crisis and climate catastrophe collapse distance and time, bringing the deep past rushing into the present and the distant to our doorstep. Approaching them in fiction brought the boundary between fiction and real life crashing down as well, until finally it seemed I was processing my own fears and feelings directly into fiction, resulting in a book that was often frighteningly personal. Yet most of all, I found myself having to confront a series of questions about the fragility of the structures that shape our world, the onrushing cost of climate catastrophe, and how we are to live in a world in which our most basic assumptions are collapsing. I began writing Ghost Species just after my father’s death. It will be published a few weeks after my mother’s. It was edited while bushfires raged up and down Australia’s east coast, in a city thick with smoke and grief, and will be published in a world paralysed by a pandemic. Perhaps unsurprisingly therefore, it is a book that is, in many ways, defined and suffused by the sense of loss so many of us feel at the moment. But it is also a book that seeks to remind us that even out of the most seismic loss and grief, new configurations are always possible. • Ghost Species by James Bradley is out on 28 April 2020 through Hamish Hamilton"
"Red wolves were one of the first carnivores Europeans encountered in North America. Unfortunately, this meant red wolves were also one of the first to be exterminated. Fuelled by fear and superstition, government supported eradication campaigns reduced red wolves to only about 100 individuals by mid-20th century.  In the 1970s, the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) removed the last remaining red wolves from eastern Texas and western Louisiana to try to save them in captivity. Declared extinct in the wild in 1980, the USFWS has since focused conservation efforts on creating a captive population from which to restore red wolves to their historic range in the future.  Now, despite reestablishing a wild population, the USFWS Red Wolf Recovery Program is under review and could face closure. Removing red wolves from the wild was unprecedented and marked the first time a species was purposely removed from its natural environment to save it from extinction. The long-term objective to return them to the wild started with a small captive population and the Red Wolf Species Survival Plan that laid out a strategy for managing red wolf populations, establishing techniques for proper capture and restraint, coordinating research, and ultimately reintroducing captive-born red wolves to the wild. One problem was the red wolf’s close relation to the coyote: as red wolf populations tumbled, coyotes from western and central states moved into the wolf’s historic range, eventually colonising it entirely. The two species’ ranges did not historically overlap, but once in contact they can interbreed, meaning dwindling red wolf numbers were further reduced and assimilated into the coyote population via hybridisation. Starting with only 14 red wolves as founders, the captive population rose to about 60 after five years, during which time USFWS used several islands as preserves where some red wolves could be kept in semi-wild conditions and provide training opportunity for USFWS biologists. In 1987, the USFWS released four pairs of captive-born red wolves on Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge in North Carolina. Since then the USFWS has established a wild population currently of about 80 individuals – the first successful reintroduction of its kind. Conservation and management of endangered carnivores is difficult, but restoring wolves to the eastern US is unprecedented as the effort requires addressing impacts by humans, hybridisation with coyotes, and inbreeding common to small endangered populations. The high number of wolves killed by humans exacerbates problems of inbreeding, which lowers the wolves’ fitness by decreasing reproductive rates and increasing susceptibility to environmental change and disease. Hybridisation increases when shrinking numbers allow coyotes to colonise territories of wolves killed by humans, and when a red wolf cannot locate a red wolf mate it will accept a coyote and produce hybrids. They may even do so to avoid inbreeding. To address hybridisation, USFWS developed a catch-and-release programme where coyotes are sterilised. These sterile coyotes then act as territorial placeholders; fitted with radio collars and monitored by USFWS biologists, they defend their territory against fertile coyotes until red wolves can move in and occupy those areas. This technique lowers coyote densities by suppressing reproduction, while also preventing hybrids in the event the sterile coyote finds a red wolf mate. Fortunately red wolves will readily adopt pups and raise them as their own, so captive-born red wolf pups are fostered into wild litters in order to increase the genetic diversity of the wild population. Not only does this technique decrease the relatedness of neighbouring wolves and augment the wild population, but it increases the survival of captive-born animals by allowing them be raised by wild red wolf packs. While the species’ recovery has benefited greatly from these techniques, the best solution to these problems is to simply increase the population size. Currently, about 80 red wolves in 15 packs hold territories across 6,500 km2 of public and private land. It’s essential to reduce the number of human-caused deaths and to boost red wolf population numbers. Despite great strides to restore red wolves to their former range, much work needs to be done, and an end to the USFWS Red Wolf Recovery Program could see the end of the red wolf."

George Avery is an assistant professor of public health at Purdue University. In today’s _Daily Caller_ , Avery rebuts claims that the Obama health plan would improve public health: 



The idea that health care contributes significantly to population health is both intuitively appealing and untrue.…   
  
  
In fact, federal “reform” often hurts the public health system. Both public health and health care experts have criticized Medicare and Medicaid, enacted by Congress in 1965, for changing the focus of health care practitioners from prevention to treatment.…   
  
  
Requiring all Americans purchase health insurance, which the current bills hope to do, would not address the underlying socio‐​economic issues at the root of most public health problems.…   
  
  
Indeed, access to health care can help individual patients, but can also aggravate some public health problems.… High rates of surgical intervention increase the risk and spread of drug resistant infections like MRSA.

"This year is on course to be the world’s hottest since measurements began, according to meteorologists, who estimate there is a 50% to 75% chance that 2020 will break the record set four years ago. Although the coronavirus lockdown has temporarily cleared the skies, it has done nothing to cool the climate, which needs deeper, longer-term measures, the scientists say.  Heat records have been broken from the Antarctic to Greenland since January, which has surprised many scientists because this is not an El Niño year, the phenomenon usually associated with high temperatures. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration calculates there is a 75% chance that 2020 will be the hottest year since measurements began. The US agency said trends were closely tracking the current record of 2016, when temperatures soared early in the year due to an unusually intense El Niño and then came down. The US agency said there was a 99.9% likelihood that 2020 will be one of the top five years for temperatures on record. A separate calculation by Gavin Schmidt, the director of the Nasa Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, found a 60% chance this year will set a record. The Met Office is more cautious, estimating a 50% likelihood that 2020 will set a new record, though the UK institution says this year will extend the run of warm years since 2015, which is the hottest period on record. Abnormal weather is increasingly the norm as temperature records fall year after year, and month after month. This January was the hottest on record, leaving many Arctic nations without snow in their capital cities. In February, a research base in the Antarctic registered a temperature of more than 20C (68F) for the first time on the southern continent. At the other end of the world Qaanaaq, in Greenland, set an April record of 6C on Sunday. In the first quarter, the heating was most pronounced in eastern Europe and Asia, where temperatures were 3C above average. In recent weeks, large parts of the US have sweltered. Last Friday, downtown Los Angeles hit an April high of 34C, according to the National Weather Service. Western Australia has also experienced record heat. In the UK, the trend is less pronounced. The daily maximum UK temperature for April so far is 3.1C above average, with records set in Cornwall, Dyfed and Gwynedd. Karsten Haustein, a climate scientist at the University of Oxford, said global warming was nudging closer to 1.2C above pre-industrial levels. He said his online tracker showed a relatively conservative level of 1.14C of warming due to gaps in the data, but that this could rise to 1.17C or higher once the latest figures were incorporated. Although the pandemic has at least temporarily reduced the amount of new emissions, he said the build-up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere remains a huge concern. “The climate crisis continues unabated,” Haustein said. “The emissions will go down this year, but the concentrations keep on rising. We are very unlikely to be able to notice any slowdown in the built-up of atmospheric GHG levels. But we have the unique chance now to reconsider our choices and use the corona crisis as a catalyst for more sustainable means of transport and energy production (via incentives, taxes, carbon prices etc).” This was echoed by Grahame Madge, a climate spokesman for the Met Office: “A reliance and trust in science to inform action from governments and society to solve a global emergency are exactly the measures needed to seed in plans to solve the next crisis facing mankind: climate change.”"
"**Coronavirus infections in England have fallen by about a third over lockdown, according to a major study.**
Some of the worst-hit areas saw the biggest improvements - but, despite this progress, cases remained relatively high across England.
Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the data showed the country could not ""take our foot off the pedal just yet"".
The findings by Imperial College London were based on swabbing more than 100,000 people between 13-24 November.
The React-1 study is highly respected and gives us the most up-to-date picture of Covid-19 in the country.
Its researchers estimated the virus's reproduction (R) rate had fallen to 0.88. That means on average every infection translated to less than one other new infection, so the epidemic is shrinking.
Run alongside pollster Ipsos MORI, the Imperial study involved testing a random sample of people for coronavirus, whether or not they had symptoms.
The results of these tests suggested a 30% fall in infections between the last study and the period of 13-24 November.
Before that, cases were accelerating - doubling every nine days when the study last reported at the end of October.
Now cases are coming down, but more slowly than they shot up - halving roughly every 37 days.
In the North West and North East, though - regions with some of the highest numbers of cases - infections fell by more than half.
The findings suggest cases are now highest in the East Midlands and West Midlands.
Lockdown came into force across England on 5 November but national data, based on people with symptoms, suggests there was a spike in cases in the week after.
This was put down to pre-lockdown socialising, since it takes five days on average after catching the infection for it to be detectable by a test.
Despite clear improvements, overall cases remain high.
An estimated one in 100 people have coronavirus - double the rate in September when infections began to rise.
The study also found certain groups had a higher chance of testing positive over this period:
It estimated that:
Prof Paul Elliott, who leads the study, said the data offered ""encouraging signs"" for England's epidemic.
""These trends suggest that the tiered approach helped to curb infections in [the worst-affected areas] and that lockdown has added to this effect.
But he said: ""As we approach a challenging time of year, it's even more vital that through our actions and behaviours we all play our part in helping to keep the virus at bay.""
He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was important to continue to pay attention to public-health messaging, as cases remained high.
""It's really important in the run-up to Christmas that we keep the virus under control,"" he added.
Prof Kevin McConway, a statistics professor at the Open University, urged caution over the figures.
He said: ""Things have started moving in the right direction again, but we're by no means in the position we were at the end of the summer, or even the start of the summer. We can't stop taking great care yet by any means.""
The government suggested England's new tier system, coming into force on Wednesday, would be ""crucial"" to keeping infections falling.
The three-tier system is tougher than the similar one in place before 5 November, under which cases continued to rise.
It will see regions placed in one of three tiers: medium, high and very high.
In total, 99% of England will enter the highest two tiers, with tight restrictions on bars and restaurants and a ban on households mixing indoors. Only Cornwall, the Isle of Wight and Isles of Scilly will be in the lowest tier.
Elsewhere in the UK, Northern Ireland has begun a two-week circuit-breaker lockdown, while in Scotland each area has been placed in one of five tiers.
In Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford said pubs, restaurants and bars will be subject to stricter restrictions - which are not yet finalised - in the run-up to Christmas. They will come into force from Friday, 4 December.
These findings of the React-1 study are interim, meaning they still need to be reviewed.

By Jim Goodridge  – former California State Climatologist
Photosynthesis simply stated is 6CO2 + 6H2O + photons = C6H12O6+6O2.
It is suggested by the relative abundances of atmospheric CO2 and O2,
That CO2 is a quite active material and it is always in short supply.
Plant growth is basically the chemical reaction of storing solar energy.
Chemical reactions generally double with an increase of 10°F.
Rising temperatures cause CO2 to boil out of ocean water.

Rising temperature and CO2 concentration both stimulate plant growth.
Our atmosphere originally contained about 30 percent CO2.
The era of chlorophyll dominance is referred to as the Great Oxidation.
This happened 2.5 billion years ago. The ocean’s dissolved iron.
Rusted out, producing our planets iron ore deposits and releasing oxygen.
Chlorophyll is still the mechanism controlling the CO2 and O2 abundance.
All life forms basically originated by a photosynthesis process.
Chemically our hemoglobin and chlorophyll are quite similar.
Suggesting a common origin, that is supported by common DNA code.
Where as animals do not photosynthesize, their plant foods do.
Beef, chicken or fish feed off photosynthetic products.
It is mainly trace minerals that supplement photo-source.
CO2 is literally the gas of life for all macro life forms we encounter.
The existence of extremophiles suggests very early non-solar energy sources.
Demonizing CO2 started with the plan for peaceful use of atomic bombs.
The big dream in 1946 that was that atomic energy would be so cheap,
That electricity would never again need to be metered.
The attribution of increased CO2 to fossil fuel burning was born here.
Atomic energy advocates wanted to save Earth from runaway GH heating like Venus.
A conservation ethic developed to conserve the finite petroleum for the future and
Anti-pollution and anti-growth advocates added voices to the anti- CO2 theme.
All earthly macro life forms are photosynthically derived from CO2,
Either directly or indirectly by chlorophyll that absorbs solar photons.
We are not here not at the whim of a deity but by evolution of CO2 derivatives.
================================================================
Note: Jim’s line, The attribution of increased CO2 to fossil fuel burning was born here. 
There’s a tremendous backstory to this which I have been chasing for awhile. See this post from the earlier days of WUWT in 2008. If anyone can help find it, I’d be appreciative.

UPDATE: The paper itself is available below.
There is a new  paper published yesterday in the journal Geophysical Research Letters from NASA GISS/Columbia University and Brown University titled  Hydroclimate of the northeastern United States is highly sensitive to solar forcing
Key Points

Holocene northeast US hydrological change is consistent with solar forcing
Small changes in solar forcing are amplified in our region by Arctic Oscillation
Leaf-wax abundances in peatlands provide high-resolution climate information

This paper looks at hydrogen isotope proxy records over the past 6800 years and finds that the hydroclimate of the Northeastern U.S. is “highly sensitive” to solar activity.

The abstract of the paper says:
“The Sun may be entering a weak phase, analogous to the Maunder minimum, which could lead to more frequent flooding in the northeastern US at this multidecadal timescale.”
It is interesting to see this solar-hydro relationship defined in the USA. Previous similar works include defining a solar-hyrdo relationship to Nile River flow in Africa.
Here’s the paper and abstract: 
GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 39, L04707, 5 PP., 2012

Hydroclimate of the northeastern United States is highly sensitive to solar forcing

Dramatic hydrological fluctuations strongly impact human society, but the driving mechanisms for these changes are unclear. One suggested driver is solar variability, but supporting paleoclimate evidence is lacking. Therefore, long, continuous, high-resolution records from strategic locations are crucial for resolving the scientific debate regarding sensitivity of climate to solar forcing. We present a 6800–year, decadally-resolved biomarker and multidecadally-resolved hydrogen isotope record of hydroclimate from a coastal Maine peatland, The Great Heath (TGH). Regional moisture balance responds strongly and consistently to solar forcing at centennial to millennial timescales, with solar minima concurrent with wet conditions. We propose that the Arctic/North Atlantic Oscillation (AO/NAO) can amplify small solar fluctuations, producing the reconstructed hydrological variations. The Sun may be entering a weak phase, analogous to the Maunder minimum, which could lead to more frequent flooding in the northeastern US at this multidecadal timescale.

Nicolas Garcia Belmonte has visualized wind motion in the USA, which I think is quite neat. On his weblog he writes:
I’ve been working on a WebGL data visualization of wind motion patterns for a 72 hour period in the United States.

Gathering the data from the National Weather Service was pretty interesting, I didn’t know USA had so many weather stations! 
The visualization shows wind direction encoded in line angles, wind speed encoded in line lengths and disk radius, and temperature encoded in hue. All this for about 1200 weather stations across the country.
You can switch between different visual markers from the top menu, also play the wind motion for the 72 hours or select a specific time from the timeline below the graphic.

" We’re already being swamped with ideas about “reforms” needed to recover from the pandemic crisis. But the word reform is like gift wrap – a handy cover for any offering, thought-through or otherwise. Perhaps we should ditch the word entirely, and with it the forest of feelpinions about what governments “must” do to advance an author’s previously-held ideological positioning in the post-corona world.  Imagine if we took just two lessons from the way Australian governments responded to the coronavirus: that good decisions are made when they consider the evidence and the best available expert advice; and that policy-making can accommodate reasonable differences of opinion, without becoming a “war”. Think, as Laura Tingle did in a piece for the ABC’s 7.30 this week, of the difference it would make if interviewers and commentators allowed room for discussion of complex and competing ideas, before demanding that politicians rule them “in” or “out”, or before finding a backbencher who will say they might cross the floor on a policy that conflicts with their ideological prejudice – even if that policy hasn’t yet been outlined. Now consider if those principles were applied to climate policy in Australia. I concede that’s quite a leap given the past decade of mind-numbing debate, during which experts have struggled to get a look in. But in the background, some have been giving it a shot. For six years now leading business, environmental, investor, union, farming and social welfare groups have been trying, largely in vain, to create a space for a sensible discussion about global heating, and to give Australian politicians a way to retreat from the self-defeating culture war that has scuppered all attempts at policy. They wouldn’t put it this way, but in effect the environmentalists, desperate for Australia to make some meaningful move towards reducing emissions, and the business groups, desperate for some kind of investment certainty, have been trying to save Australia’s politicians from themselves. The starting point for the Australian Climate Roundtable’s deliberations is that Australia needs to reach net zero emissions, and that delaying action just increases the cost of reaching that goal. Unremarkable propositions in any fact-based forum, but in some Coalition circles, still close to heresy. Now the roundtable, including its business members, argues that this post-corona reconstruction is a chance to speed up decarbonising the economy. The Business Council of Australia chief executive, Jennifer Westacott, argued in an opinion piece that the post-corona discussion should divest itself of “ideological constraints”. “In resuscitating our economy, we can tackle some of our most vexed problems. Every dollar we invest in energy should be a dollar towards a lower carbon economy and lower energy bills,” she wrote. And expert evidence about what might be possible has been flooding in by the day. The Australian Energy Market Operator this week released its long awaited “renewable integration study”, which found Australia could accommodate levels of up to 75% “instant” penetration of wind and solar in its main grid by 2025 – that we have the know-how, but need to update market and regulatory settings. Think about that next time someone starts burbling on about the impossibility of a renewable-dependent grid coping “when the wind don’t blow and the sun don’t shine”. Less than a year after an election in which Bill Shorten’s target of 45% renewables by 2030 was attacked for being “unachievable” and “economy wrecking”, the expert market operator says 75% is technically achievable – and in just five years time. And then there was the advice from the International Energy Agency this week that renewable electricity will be the only energy source resilient to the biggest global energy shock in 70 years, triggered by the pandemic. The Morrison government is supposed to be working on a “roadmap” towards some kind of long-term emissions reduction policy, understandably delayed while it deals with the pandemic. It could draw on the work of a bunch of expert groups who have already had a go – the latest Climateworks report released earlier this month found that net zero emissions by 2035 is possible in Australia, using technologies that are mostly already mature and available. The CSIRO’s roadmap released last year found there was no trade-off between  economic growth and transitioning to zero emissions, and in fact strong action could lead to GDP growth, an increase in real wages and net zero emissions by 2050. But then, apparently pre-empting his own policy, and contradicting his own government’s claim to be “technology neutral”, the energy minister, Angus Taylor, has spent the week calling for a “gas-fired recovery”, variously advocating more gas-peaking plants, more long-term gas supply for manufacturers and more onshore gas production. The details of what he’s advocating remain opaque, but as the Grattan Institute’s energy expert Tony Wood points out, renewed suggestions of government intervention are only likely to deter investment, presumably the opposite of what Taylor is seeking. If there’s a coherent policy in there somewhere, it really is time for the government to unwrap it. The experts have been waiting for years, and it turns out that listening to them is a good idea."
"Bovine tuberculosis is a major problem in the UK: in 2013 around 8m cattle were tested and 32,000 slaughtered at a cost of an estimated £100m, including compensation – a huge economic burden that makes controlling the disease essential. However, far from controlling bovine TB (bTB), over the past 20 years or so there has been a 10% increase in cases each year. This rise, and the role of TB-infected badgers, is fiercely debated. Badgers were first associated with bTB in the 1970s, but despite the lengthy and expensive Randomised Badger Culling Trial in the late 1990s there is still limited scientific consensus. One of the main difficulties in trying to untangle the routes through which bTB is transmitted is the fact that it spreads unseen. In general, infected animals are only identified through a skin test, which in itself we estimate to be only 72% sensitive – so 28% of infectious animals are undetected by a single test. With more than a quarter of infected animals going undetected, controlling the disease’s spread is difficult, and identifying how it spreads harder still. Published in Nature, we have developed a mechanistic model of the spread of bTB within and between around 134,000 cattle farms in Great Britain, between 1996 and 2011. This model accounts for multiple routes of transmission: direct infections between cattle, indirectly through the environment, and through the movement of infected animals between farms. Because the model is mechanistic it allows us to test the effects of different methods of control on how the disease spreads. Due to the lack of detailed data, our model does not explicitly include badgers (cattle are ear-tagged, their movements recorded, and are frequently tested for bTB; the same can’t be done for wildlife). Instead we model the combined environmental reservoir of infection – this includes infection from pasture and wildlife species, although it is impossible to separate these two elements.  We don’t feel that this detracts from our findings, as the model is able to accurately capture the trends of infection over time and the geographic spread. We haven’t found any evidence that our model underestimates the rate of infection in regions where badgers are common, which would occur if the model underestimated their importance. Our modelling approach was able to shed light on the relative strengths of different transmission routes. Unlike the real world where infections can only be seen by testing (and then with limited accuracy) within our simulation model we can track infection perfectly. This allows us to tease apart the causes of infection.  We find that newly infected farms are most frequently due to movement of infected animals, rather than spread through the environmental reservoir, but most importantly the majority of infection originates from the minority of farms. More than 90% of infected farms clear the infection before they cause any secondary cases, while about 2% of farms infect 10 or more other farms.  Our model shows just how complex and multifaceted bTB transmission is, with cattle-to-cattle transmission, failure to detect infectious cases, the movement of infected animals to other farms, and the effects of TB in the environment all playing a role. It is this complexity that continues to deny those seeking to eradicate the disease any easy solutions. We tested a range of control measures in our model simulation to see what effects they might have. We assumed that these measures began in 2005 and were continued for six years, after which we evaluated their impact. Of ten we simulated, only three measures were found to stop the annual increase in cases. By far the most dramatic is whole-herd culling of all cattle on infected farms. This would rapidly bring the epidemic under control, as it removes the danger of infected but as yet undetected animals. But it would entail a 20-fold increase of cattle slaughter in the first year, and the political, social, and economic consequences that would bring. However, with the cost of bTB at £100m a year and rising, some form of highly targeting culling could be economically viable. Vaccinating cattle, which slows the disease’s progression in animals, is also predicted sufficient to prevent the increase in cases, although only just. Such a vaccine would not have the effectiveness we associate with mass vaccination programmes in humans. In any case, the vaccine is currently unlicensed and runs into problems with EU legislation. More widespread and regular testing and slaughter of infected animals in the initial years would identify more cases (we only find bTB when we look for it, after all) and lead to more slaughter, but over time the benefits of a more stringent regime are felt and cases fall in later years. A similar effect can be achieved if we developed a better test for bTB. What the model also predicted was the relatively limited effect of focusing on environmental factors would be. Even with a 50% fall in the between-farm transmission of infection due to the environment (simulating a substantial badger cull, for example), the rise in cattle infections over six years continues, although at a slower rate. All three of these measures (culling, increased testing and cattle vaccination) have associated economic costs and benefits, which the government, the livestock industry and the general public must assess to decide the correct course of action. What our simulation provides, based on the latest data, is a way to predict and put numbers to a range of potential policy options. Clearly there is a need to reverse this costly and damaging bTB epidemic, and we hope our findings will help inform decisions in the future."

From the warmest July on record, according to some, we are suddenly plunged into a freezing cold August. Snow, hail storms and negative or single-digit temperatures find us huddling under our duvets waiting for Spring.



A climate scientist says last month was New Zealand’s warmest July on the books, going by a measure that took in more than the official number of stations.  
Niwa is shortly due to release the official statistics for July, which its meteorologist Ben Noll last week said was on track to finish somewhere in the top five.  
New Zealand’s warmest July ever recorded, at 1.8C above average, came in 1998 – just as that year’s devastating El Nino climate system was dissipating.  
Toward the end of last month, the official July temperature record was tracking at about 1.5C above average. 



  
Either the snow gods are playing tricks or we got global warming wrong or the weather is not an indicator of climate change – which is what the man-made climate change subscribers tell us. Ignore extreme weather patterns, they say, because it indicates global warming. Huh? 



But if we think we got badly frozen, spare a thought for the US which fared no better. Their 2018/2019 winter saw the coldest temperatures ever recorded in all 50 US states. 



“One of the most interesting facts is that every state in the continental U.S. has seen [temperatures drop below zero](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/scec/records).



Even Florida dropped to 2 degrees below zero on Feb. 13, 1899, in Tallahassee. This occurred during an Arctic outbreak during which numerous all-time record low temperatures were set, including Washington D.C. (15 degrees below zero); Atlanta, (9 degrees below zero); and Dallas (8 degrees below zero). Flurries were even reported from Tampa to New Orleans during that massive outbreak.



The only state that has not seen a subzero temperature is Hawai’i. The coldest temperature recorded in Hawai’i is 12 degrees at the Mauna Kea Observatory, which is at an elevation of 13,796 feet, on May 17, 1979.



Of course, as expected, the coldest temperature in the U.S. was set in Alaska. The mercury plummeted to 80 degrees below zero on Jan. 23, 1971 in Prospect Creek in central Alaska, north of Fairbanks.



The coldest temperature recorded in the contiguous U.S. is 70 degrees below zero, measured at Rogers Pass, Montana, on Jan. 20, 1954.



The oldest record was set on Jan. 22, 1885 on Mount Washington, New Hampshire, the highest peak in the Northeast, when the thermometer dropped to 50 degrees below zero.



The most recent record on the list was set on Feb. 10, 2011 in Nowata, Oklahoma, when the temperature reached 31 degrees below zero.”



  
To compensate for the freezing cold weather here and in the US – Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK reached the hottest recording-breaking levels during the last week of July. We are experiencing worldwide extreme weather patterns.



If you are confused about global warming, spare a thought for the climate scientists who are divided on the subject of man-made global warming. The scientists who go on record in the Mainstream Media say climate change is responsible for the worldwide extremes in weather patterns. But it seems to me that climate data can be manipulated to say whatever it is that they want it to say to fulfil their particular political or financial agendas.

As we’ve mentioned before on the Cato blog, over the past few weeks some members of Congress have been sending letters of intimidation to researchers whose scientific findings were politically inconvenient to the members' policy proposals. First, seven scientists working at public universities were harassed by Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-AZ). This was followed by letters to 100 organizations, ranging from private companies to think tanks, attempting to create a whisper campaign of allegations of impropriety. My boss, Cato CEO John Allison, received one of these letters.   
  
Mr. Allison’s response to the letter he received from Sens. Ed Markey (D-MA), Barbara Boxer (D-CA), and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) is reproduced below the jump.   
  
We at the Center for the Study of Science, as with the rest of the Cato Institute, are very proud not only of the quality of the work we produce but also of our values—and those morals compel us to not bow to those using their authority as a weapon to silence legitimate scientific inquiry.   
  
The actions of these members of Congress are exactly why Cato’s Center for the Study of Science was founded: the government wishes to use science as a weapon to increase its political power, then use that political power to create a more convenient political climate. We wish to change this climate of fear into one of truth—and we would like to extend an invitation to Sens. Markey, Boxer, and Whitehouse to join us.

Germany began the month of April with winter-like conditions, but the weather managed to warm up by mid month and ended up being just about normal, temperature-wise, according to the German Weather Service.
No sign of global warming.
For precipitation, it was drier than normal in Germany – for the 5th April in a row. The amount of sunshine was also slightly below average, according to the DWD. The results are based on measurements taken from 2000 surface stations across the country.
The DWD reports that the mean temperature for April was 8.2° Celsius, which is 0.8°C warmer than the relatively cool international reference period of 1961 – 1990, but 0.1°C cooler than the 1981 to 2010 period. And because March was far below normal, the 2013 MAM spring period so far is much cooler than normal.
The DWD writes that the temperature sank to -14°C in Stiege in the Harz region, where “vegetation was 3 weeks behind”. The warmest day was April 18, when a maximum temperature of 28.1°C was measured in Dresden-Strehlen.

As many people have remarked, whatever you think of her politics, Hanson has guts and persistence. In the lead-up to the last election, Pauline Hanson and her One Nation party endured an astonishing barrage of hatchet-jobs and gotchas. The legacy media often seemed to be working hand-in-glove with underhanded political operators, especially with the series of secret video recordings made by a Qatari-linked fake lobbying organisation.



A recurrent tactic by the political left is to try and shove One Nation right out of the Overton Window, shrieking that their policies are beyond the pale of allowable (by the left) public discourse. Then, any political party that even **looks** like cutting a preference deal with One Nation is smeared by association. This is a gambit by the left to firstly, try and starve One Nation out of parliament, and to secondly nobble the Coalition by denying them One Nation preferences.



Yet, as post-election analysis shows, the scaremongering by Labor and the Greens is just another election campaign lie.



None of the Coalition’s Queensland MPs needed more than 50 per cent of One Nation preferences to win their seat at the May 18 election.



In fact, it was Labor who relied on the Greens.



In contrast, Greens preferences helped secure victories at the May election for 13 Labor MPs who were in losing ­positions before the final allocation of preferences.



The only real effect of One Nation in Queensland, where Labor was all but wiped out, was simply to boost the Coalition’s winning margin.



Analysis by The Australian of newly released Australian Electoral Commission data shows that in 12 Queensland seats ultimately won by the Coalition and where Pauline Hanson’s party finished third, the government had secured 50 per cent of the vote or was leading Labor before One Nation preferences were distributed. Although One Nation preferences did not cost any Labor candidate victory in Queensland, preference flows from Senator Hanson’s party to the Coalition of up to 73 per cent did help to boost the LNP candidates’ winning margins.



During the election campaign, Labor campaigned strongly on One Nation preferences, warning votes for the party would deliver the Coalition victory.



So, about as truthful as any of their other scare campaigns, like the notorious “Mediscare” campaign of 2016. The truth is that Labor is being led by the nose by the Greens whose preferences they desperately need. Meanwhile, traditional Labor voters are turning to One Nation, who increasingly stand for the blue-collar values Labor have abandoned. Hanson’s campaign slogan was particularly enticing to formerly rusted-on Labor voters: **We’ve got the guts to say what you’re thinking**. Labor’s obsession with right-on “progressive” nostrums like climate change, asylum seekers and the nuttiest fringes of rainbow activism might play well in the inner suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne, but the party needs to remember that there is a whole other nation outside the quinoa-proof fence.



Liberal National senator James McGrath said the analysis showed the difficulty Mr Albanese would have in shifting Labor’s agenda to the centre. “This shows Labor cannot win without Greens preferences, which is why Labor keep tacking to the left policy-wise,” Senator McGrath said. “The lesson from 2019 was to listen to the quiet Australians. This shows for Labor to win they have to listen to the Greens.”



The Green tail wagging the Labor dog: a familiar story.

"As notorious weather predictions go, the “barbecue summer” of 2009 is up there with Michael Fish’s dismissal of the incoming 1987 hurricane. The summer turned out to be wet and windy, and questions were subsequently raised as to whether reliable seasonal forecasts were worthwhile, or even possible. Seasonal forecasts are constructed by integrating many complex numerical climate models, which encode the laws of physics as they apply to the climate system. Forecasts provide estimates of seasonal averages of weather conditions, typically up to three months ahead, and so provide an idea of how likely a forthcoming season will be wetter, drier, warmer, or colder than normal. These forecasts have to be considered probabilistic, rather than deterministic. The chaotic nature of the climate system, with its strong sensitivity to initial conditions (also known as the “butterfly effect”) makes accurate long-term deterministic forecasts impossible. And inevitably, the approximate nature of all weather and climate models introduces a degree of inaccuracy. For example, the microphysical processes that occur in the formation of clouds at micrometre scales cannot be directly described by our climate models, which are typically constructed of millions of grid boxes, or nodes, of approximately 100km length. Seasonal forecasts are increasingly used for forward planning purposes, such as by the government, emergency agencies, the water industry, and agriculture. Information about seasonal average rainfall and temperature for the growing season can inform a farmer’s decision about which type of crop to plant ahead of time, for example. But this information is only useful if it is reliable, and it is impossible to generate an idea of reliability from a single probabilistic forecast. So the Met Office’s forecast of a barbecue summer for 2009 cannot really be said to have been “right” or “wrong” by itself. And after all, the Met’s Chief Metereologist Ewen McCallum did predict a 20% chance of a washout alongside a 50% chance of above-average temperatures – hence “odds on” for sun.  However, the reliability of a series of probabilistic forecasts can be quantified in a meaningful way. For example, examining a set of predictions over 30 years or so, if the forecasting system is reliable then the predictions will broadly match the facts. Predictions of a warm season with an 80% forecast probability of high temperatures will have been correct 80% of the time (and wrong 20% of the time). If a forecasting system is unreliable in this sense, then people can be misled – perhaps into making unfortunate barbecue-related decisions. In our paper published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface we developed objective criteria for classifying weather forecast reliability, from perfect reliability (5) and useful reliability (4), through a marginally useful category (3), to those defined as not useful (2) or even dangerously useless (1).  We used seasonal forecasts from one of the world leading centres in weather and seasonal forecasts, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) based in Reading, to estimate the degree of reliability of temperature and precipitation forecasts during summer and winter for all land regions around the world. Our proposed classification is based on the reliability curve in a so-called reliability diagram. The reliability curve describes the statistical relationship between the forecast probabilities and the statistical frequency with which these events actually happened.  If the curve (within some margin of error) indicates a perfect relationship between the forecasts and observations, we classify these forecasts as 5. In contrast, a flat reliability curve, demonstrating little correlation between forecast probabilities and observations, means that the forecasts are irrelevant for the seasonal climate conditions and we classify these cases as 2. So how good are seasonal forecasts these days? There is no simple answer – they fall into a wide range of reliability rankings, depending on the region, the season, and whether we look at temperature or rainfall forecasts. Many fall into the perfect reliability category 5 for temperature, for example mild winters in Australia and Southern South America, warm summers over parts of North America, while summer forecasts of rainfall over Northern Europe including in Britain perform extremely badly. In fact, for this region we found that the more likely a dry summer appears in the forecasts, the less likely it is to come to pass in the real world.  The fact is we still have some way to go before we can provide reliable seasonal weather forecasts. The key to improving reliability in the future will be our ability to understand and represent physical processes more accurately. One way to improve the forecasts is to run the models at finer resolution, thus allowing the most important cloud systems to be represented explicitly in the models. But this will require much more powerful supercomputers than are currently available.  Another approach is to represent the uncertainties inherent within the model within the model’s equations themselves. This can be done by incorporating random processes within the model equations. While it may seem paradoxical that adding random noise to a climate model can actually lead to more accurate and reliable forecasts, increasingly this is what our research is telling us."

UPDATE: January 1st, 2012 – still here, no reports of mass deaths at the last minute. – Anthony
Global warming may go on a last minute rampage. Maybe best to just stay at home and lock your doors, bar your windows, and turn your air conditioner on. If you live near the coast, head for high ground. Deaths due to drinking and  driving will be nothing compared to this.
This story appeared in The Canadian January 8th, 2007, it’s been a countdown example of stupidity ever since. Unbelievably, it is still on their website. Note today’s date.


Over at the Daily Bayonet, where they’ve been following for this for years, they have encouraging news:
Assuming there is no last minute surprise attack by pesky methane clathrates, the Daily Bayonet wishes you a safe and happy 2012.
If it happens, it will be the gaia fart heard round the world.

Share this...FacebookTwitterFeeding-In Wind Energy In April: An Expensive Game
By the European Institute for Climate and Energy (Germany)
(Translated, edited and supplemented by P Gosselin)
April is almost over and the ever more expensive German EEG Energy Feed-In Act is celebrated day after day by politicians, most of the media, and the many benefactors of receiving subsidies from the consumer.

Figure 1: Wind energy feed-in in Germany from April 1 – 25, 2013. Total installed rated capacity is 32,000 MW. Peak output reached 18,000 MW briefly on April 18. On April 25, the wind turbines practically stood still. Overall output for April reached only about a measly 15% of rated capacity. Source: EIKE reader Ralf Schuster.
These billions represent transfers from the poor to the rich. In Germany the EEG feed-in act was once viewed as a man-on-the-moon project, and was compared to the reunification of Germany – as German Environment Minister Peter Altmaier has stated time and again [1]. The installation of wind and solar power plants continues unabated, even as resistance to landscapes littered by wind turbines continues to grow and the brakes against rapidly increasing electricity prices have failed [2].
Now is a good time to ask just how much energy have wind turbines contributed in Germany in April? It’s time to take a closer look.
So far up to today, 32,000 megawatts of wind turbine capacity have been installed in Germany. This amount of wind capacity is about equivalent to about 30 nuclear reactors, which environmentalists often like to mention. The fact that this is not true is known only by very few people. For this reason we would like to briefly illustrate the reality of wind energy in Germany. The true reality looks completely different.
Figure 1 [3] above is a chart showing wind energy feed-in from all German windparks and their turbines for April so far. Recall that a total of 32 gigawatts of capacity have been installed. A peak of 17 gigawatts of power was briefly fed in on April 18, yet this was stillm a far cry from full capacity.
The total electrical energy consumption by Germany during the first 25 days was approximately 33 terawatt-hrs. That translates to an average of 55 gigawatts of power every hour. If the wind turbines had operated at 100% capacity for the entire time, they still would have only supplied 60% of Germany’s needed power. However, wind turbines rarely run near 100% rated capacity. Very often they produce only a small fraction of their rated capacity because the wind is highly variable and often does not blow very hard. On April 18 wind turbines in Germany produced their peak for the month: 17 gigawatts, but only for about 2 hours, before rapidly dropping off again to 8 GW at around midnight. On that day, all wind turbines together briefly reached 53% of their rated capacity. And that was their best day.
On most other days the performance of the wind turbines in Germany is far worse. On five days the power output reached only 4 GW, with a minimum of just over zero on April 25. During these relatively windless 5 days, the turbines operated at only 12% of their rated capacity of 32 gigawatts, which is only 7.3 % of Germany’s 55 gigawatts average hourly consumption.

Figure 2: Shows the electricity feed-in for 25 April, 2013. At about 10 a.m. wind power from turbines dropped to only 184 megawatts. Source: EEX-Leipzig.
Figure 2 clearly illustrates the completely miserable performance. Before noon, when demand for electricty reaches its peak, the feed-in by wind turbines was only at 184 megawatts, which is a puny 0.3 % of the power that is needed in Germany. Power feed-in by wind turbines on April 25 reached their maximum of only 4.8 gigawatts at midnight – power that nobody needs and perhaps it can be “sold” to a foreign market at a negative price (something that actually does occur nowadays).
This expensive, wildly fluctuating feed-in behavior of course has to be balanced out by coal, nuclear, and the ever increasingly more important gas-fired power plants. However, such power plants often find themselves running at a fraction of their capacity, i.e. at a range that is completely inefficient. When the wind blows and the sun shines, they slow right down to idle, and thus lose lots of money.
The most modern gas-fired power plant is the GUD power plant in Irrsching, which went online a year ago. It has an efficiency of about 60% when it runs near full capacity, which should be every hour of the year. But it doesn’t. To make a profit, it would need to run at least 4000 hours annually. But because renewable energy like wind and sun have priority when it comes to being feed-in into the power grid, the GUD gas plant operates only about 1600 hours per year. Therefore it is a money-loser, one that ought to be shut down. But it can’t because it always has to be on standby, ready to jump in should the wind and sun fail to deliver.
Lo and behold, poliitcians have found a solution. German Free Democrat Party (FDP) Minister Martin Zeil knows how to rescue the plant, as the daily Augsburger Allgemeinen writes:
The plant operators have announced that the plant will be shut down at least 2 years. About 100 million euros are needed to keep the power plant running said company chairman Teyssen…
…Bavaria Economics Minsister Martin Zeil declared a few days ago that Irsching V has to stay online. Otherwise grid stability and thus the electricity supply would be jeopardized. Because of this the grid operator can instruct to keep a power plant on standby, the Minister reminds. Moreover, Zeil said the state government is planning the construction of 4 new gas-fired power plants, but is unable to find an investor. Irsching V can produce almost as much electricity as a small nuclear reactor…Bavaria’s showcase power plant risks going out of business.
…continue reading at the Augsburger-Allgemeine. Keeping unprofitable plants on standby is a massive expense that will be paid by the poor consumer.
This is what Germany’s Energiewende (energy transformation to renewables) looks like to the rest of the world.

At the Iowa State Fair “Uncle” Joe Biden proved he is simply not fit to run for the office of the American President when he told the crowd “we choose truth over facts”. He has a problem with either his brain or his mouth or both, but his slip of the tongue may in fact be the truth.



Obviously, our Green party would totally support Uncle Joe because they also believe truth trumps facts when it comes to climate change, marijuana, farming and conservation. They know some truths are indisputable regardless of the facts.



Would you buy what this man is selling? And can you imagine what he might mistakenly say to Kim Jong-un or Vladimir Putin?



Far be it from me, a person of the wrong country, sex, age and race to talk about the suitability of candidates for the American president, but Biden has serious competition for the title of the “ ~~most senile~~ worst candidate ever”. 



His competition is Bernie Sanders – also at the Iowa State Fair, which was obviously the best place to be last weekend for political candidate entertainment.



Staffers for the presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) reportedly roughed up members of the press during his visit to the Iowa State Fair on Sunday.



A campaign staffer for Bernie Sanders was screamed at by a local photojournalist who was repeatedly shoved following the Vermont senator’s remarks at the Iowa State Fair.



The confrontation erupted after members of the campaign relentlessly pushed the local journalists to make room for Sanders as he made his way to various attractions at the fair on Sunday.



 **The press pool erupted in chaos as Sanders left** the campaign event, which was hosted by the _Des Moines Register_.



“Do not put your hands on me. You keep pushing me,” the female photographer yelled at the staffer.



Simonson added: “One staffer for the Des Moines Register pushed a gate into a reporter for the Washington Examiner after telling him that ‘ **not all press’ would be allowed to follow Sanders around.”**



The leadup to the US elections is going to be just as interesting as our own.

"A Japanese jeans maker has found a new way of capitalising on zoo animals. Zoo Jeans are producing jeans “designed by dangerous animals”. Denim is wrapped around tyres, which are then thrown to the lions who enjoy ripping and biting at the material. This produces that all-important designer, distressed look. Rather than simply being a marketing gimic, there is actually value in this from an animal welfare perspective. Involving lions and the zoo’s other large carnivores in the activity is part of what’s called environmental enrichment. This is the provision of stimuli to help improve well-being. It’s a win-win activity for many zoos, who can make alternative profits from their animals, which tend to be used to provide extra facilities for them. Wrapping denim around a tyre to make enrichment devices for toothy carnivores is just one way that zoos have profited from their animals’ hobbies over the years. Since their inception, zoos have looked for different ways to fund their activities. London Zoo when it first opened would let in penniless visitors for a cat or dog to be fed to the carnivores. Visitors with money were offered other things to keep themselves amused as they looked at the animals. One popular activity at zoos has been elephant rides, which expanded out to other animals. The Artis Zoo in Amsterdam used to offer paying visitors ostrich rides until one day when the ostrich took off with a hapless visitor on its back. The ride only ended some 10 miles from the zoo when the ostrich collapsed from exhaustion. These days, animal welfare and human safety regulations have rightly put an end to such animal rides in many countries. Zoo Jeans’ use of zoo animals in its design process is not the first creative role that animals have played. Chimpanzees and elephants have been given paint brushes and blank canvases to create their own artwork. Perhaps the most famous example is Congo the chimpanzee, an artist admired by Pablo Picasso. He was introduced to art by zoologist Desmond Morris and, since his death, London Zoo has sold pieces by him for more than US$25,000. There has even been a chimpanzee art competition. I for one support this activity as the stimulus involved is enriching for the animals involved and the money made is fed back into their welfare.  Many zoos around the world have found a lucrative market in collecting the faeces of large carnivores for gardeners or foresters. Funnily enough, this isn’t a kind of luxury fertiliser. In fact, it’s to repel the small carnivores that roam our streets. Domestic cats and foxes communicate their presence in a territory by marking it with faeces and they recognise when this has been done by another member of their species or another carnivore. The system is like traffic lights, if the faecal matter of another individual or large carnivore is new then small predators read this as a red light but if it is old then it is green for go.  Thus, gardeners can spread lion or leopard dung around the borders of their garden to keep out unwanted small carnivores such as the neighbour’s moggy. Foresters can use this dung in a similar manner to protect trees from deer damage. But obviously the process needs to be frequently repeated; happily most zoos have a constant supply of said material. A number of zoos have now gone into attracting corporate business clients and one of the things that always sells is team-building activities. Companies are given the task of building environmental enrichment devices for the zoo animal of their choice. The team has to choose an animal, observe it and then build it the object of its dreams. Once built, the newly made enrichment device is safety checked by a zookeeper, before being sent down the animal enclosure’s chimney.   Playing the role of Father Christmas for a giant anteater is more fun and challenging than you can imagine. Having spent much of my career working on environmental enrichment, I can tell you it is one of the most rewarding activities you can undertake with captive animals. It can also play an important role in helping revive zoos that are in decline.  Zoo Jeans are auctioning off their creations, with all profits going toward preserving the environment at their local zoo and the WWF."

Share this...FacebookTwitterNASA has released its latest sea ice report. These are tough times for climate alarmists. The truth is: There’s a lot more sea ice out there this year than they ever imagined.

NASA makes some interesting comments.
First they tell us that Arctic sea ice is over 1.5 million sq. km above last year, and is thus at one of the highest late summer extents in the last 10 years. Surprise.
Secondly Walt Meier of NASA tells us the real reason for last year’s record minimum: storms. Walt Meier (my emphasis):

Last year’s storm went across an area of open water and mixed the smaller pieces of ice with the relatively warm water, so it melted very rapidly. This year, the storms hit in an area of more consolidated ice. The storms this year were more typical summer storms; last year’s was the unusual one.”
Thirdly, NASA seems stumped by the near record extent of Antarctic sea ice (my emphasis):
Antarctic sea ice, which is in the midst of its yearly growing cycle, is heading toward the largest extent on record, having reached 7.45 million square miles (19.3 million square kilometers) on Aug. 21.  […] The phenomenon, which appears counter-intuitive but reflects the differences in environment and climate between the Arctic and Antarctica, is currently the subject of many research studies.”
One can’t help notice in NASA’s language that ice melt to them means warming, but ice forming is because of weather, a phenomena, or something. God forbid it may be a sign of cooling.
Finally, NASA likes to convey to readers and pretend that the sea ice decrease in the Arctic over the last 35 years is linear, and likely will continue so. But the fact is that Arctic sea ice extent is cyclic, and that it has flattened in the last 6 years, and the reversals of the PDO and AMO likely have something to do with it.

A good default proposition regarding the government’s role in the economy would state that the government should not loan money to an enterprise if the enterprise in question cannot find one single market actor anywhere in the universe to loan said enterprise a single red cent. It might suggest – I don’t know – that the investment is rather … dubious.   
  
Alas, like all good propositions regarding the government’s role in the economy, this one is being left by the roadside by the Obama administration. Unfortunately, the only complaint being made by a not insubstantial segment of the political Right – frequently, the political crowd that is busy decrying “Bailout Nation” – is that the loan guarantees are not fat enough.   
  
I write, of course, about the $8.3 billion federal loan guarantee announced by President Obama this week for Southern Company to build two new nuclear power plants. The money will be used to guarantee the loans being made by the federal government (via the Federal Financing Bank) to partially cover the cost of Southern’s projected $14 billion nuclear construction project at their Vogtle plant near Waynesboro, Georgia. The loan guarantees were authorized by Congress in the 2005 Energy Policy Act and, we are told, are the first installment on a total package of $54 billion that the President would like to hand out to facilitate the construction of 7-10 new nuclear power plants (Congress, however, has only authorized $18.5 billion to this point).   
  
The claim being made by some – that the loan guarantees are necessary to jump-start investor interest in new nuclear power plant construction – is not quite correct. Even _these_ lavish loan guarantees aren’t enough to do _that_. In a letter to the U.S. Department of Energy dated July 2, 2007, six of Wall Street’s s then-largest investment banks – Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, and Morgan Stanley – informed the administration that, contrary to the government’s expectations, anything short of a 100 percent unconditional guarantee would be insufficient to induce private lending.   
  
Why is it risky to build nuclear power plants? Because new nuclear projects tie up more capital for longer periods of time than its main competitor, natural-gas fired generation. Nuclear power makes economic sense only if natural gas prices are very high. Then, over time, the high initial costs of nuclear power would be offset by nuclear power’s lower fuel costs. Moreover, as noted by Moody’s in an analysis published in July of last year, there is uncertainty associated with construction costs, regulatory oversight, technological developments that might reduce the cost of rival facilities, and the ability of utilities to recover costs and make a profit over the lifetime of the plant – a risk tied up in the economic prospects of the region being served by the plant. And those risks have been increasing, not decreasing, as time has gone on.   




In short, even during the go-go days prior to the September 2008 crash – a time when Wall Street was allegedly throwing around money left and right to all sorts of dubious borrowers – the banks that stand accused of recklessly endangering their shareholders on other fronts were telling utility companies that they would not loan them anything for new nuclear power plant construction unless the feds unconditionally guaranteed every last penny of those loans. That’s how risky market actors think it is to build nuclear power plants.   
  
And it’s not as if the federal government disagrees completely. The Congressional Budget Office pegs the chance of default (program-wide) at 50 percent or better and the Government Accountability Office likewise thinks that default risks are quite high. Energy Secretary Stephen Chu says that he thinks the chance of default is much lower. We can only speculate about who’s right given that no one has tried to build a nuclear power plant in the United States for over 30 years.   
  
Regardless of what the risk actually is, the loan guarantees do not reduce that risk. They simply transfer the risk from the bank to taxpayer. In this particular case, however, the loan guarantee transfers risk from one arm of the state to the other, so it doesn’t really count. But if such loan guarantees _ever_ were to induce actual private lending for plant construction, that’s how it would work.   
  
Plenty of arguments have been offered to justify these loan guarantees. Most of them are flimsy on their face.   
  
For instance, we’re often told that we “need” new power plants. But with electricity demand declining over the past couple of years, it is unclear when that need might arise.   
  
Regardless, when the market “needs” more electricity, that need will be manifested in price signals that will carry with them profit opportunities. Profit-hungry investors will be willing and able to meet that need without the help of government. Of course, if market conditions don’t radically change, those needs will be met with gas-fired power plants, but hey, if that bothers you, take it up with someone else.   
  
Others argue that we need the jobs that will be produced by new nuclear power plants. Well, building big new reactors will certainly employ a lot of (largely unionized) construction workers. But that’s one reason why building a nuclear power plant is not very economic compared to building gas-fired generators. If creating jobs is the idea whether the project makes any economic sense or not, then let’s just ban food imports and farm equipment and put everyone to work with hand plows and scythes.   
  
Two somewhat more serious arguments have been offered to justify these loan guarantees. Neither of them stands up to much scrutiny either.   
  
The first argument – the argument most often heard from the nuclear power industry and some segments of the political Left – is that we need nuclear power to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Of course, the best (that is, most efficient) way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is to internalize the cost of greenhouse gas emissions in the retail price of electricity and then allow market actors to adjust their production and consumption decisions accordingly. That price internalization exercise, however (whether directly through a carbon tax or indirectly through a cap-and-trade program), does not appear to be in the cards in the foreseeable future. Hence, the loan guarantees are advanced as a “second-best” solution, one that will get us the technology and economic efficiency that would be delivered by a properly crafted carbon tax or cap-and-trade program without the retail price increases associated with either.   
  
One of several problems with this argument is that it would take one hell of a carbon tax – or one hell of an onerous cap-and-trade program – to get anyone interested in building nuclear power plants. If natural gas prices remained roughly where they are at present (that is, if they were to remain at historical norms) then it would take a $90 per ton carbon tax or a cap-and-trade program that delivered carbon emission credits at $90 per ton on the open market to induce investment in nuclear power plants. Few economists who study climate policy believe that a carbon tax of that size is defensible given what we know about climate change.   
  
And that’s if construction costs are as low as advertised. Were they to double (as they did from 2003 to 2009) – either because of endogenous increases in the cost of capital, labor, or construction-related resources or because of cost overruns – then it would take at least a $150 per ton carbon tax (or a cap-and-trade program that delivered $150 carbon credits to the market) to induce investment.   
  
You might ask yourself what the historical relationship is between final (inflation-adjusted) nuclear power plant construction costs in the United States and construction costs as projected at the onset of the project. Happily, the CBO has done your homework for you. They found that final construction costs averaged 207 percent of projected costs. Hence, a doubling of construction costs is probably more likely than not once a project is underway … if past is prologue.   
  
The upshot is that there are many more efficient ways to respond to greenhouse gas emission constraints than to go on a nuclear power bender. This observation is heresy on the Right, but almost every credible analysis of the matter backs up that observation.   
  
The second argument one hears to justify federal loan guarantees is that they are necessary to counter-balance the excessive regulatory costs associated with new plant construction. Now, put aside the fact that the Nuclear Energy Institute – the trade association of the nuclear power industry – has often expressed near-total satisfaction with the current federal regulatory regime. If the regulatory regime is truly “bad” and, accordingly, is imposing steep and unnecessary costs on the industry, then the correct remedy is to improve said regulatory regime, not to subsidize the industry.   
  
The counter-complaint that positive regulatory reforms are impossible is difficult to swallow. After all, if there is sufficient political will to bestow tens of billions of dollars worth of tax money on this industry, then surely there is enough political will to reform the bad and unnecessarily costly regulations allegedly bedeviling the object of those very same legislative affections.   
  
I will confess to being skeptical about the argument that high construction costs are largely the fault of regulators. Building a light water breeder reactor is a technologically challenging and costly undertaking whether regulators are on the scene or not. Moreover, it is not obvious to me that the regulations that _are_ in place are _a priori_ objectionable from a libertarian perspective.   
  
One rarely, if ever, hears of particulars in this bill of complaint offered about nuclear regulation. But if a persuasive bill of complaints is ever presented, then the appropriate response is regulatory reform and then to leave the decision to build or not to build to markets.   
  
In the course of announcing these loan guarantees, President Obama said this week that “The fact is, changing the ways we produce and use energy requires us to think anew. It requires us to act anew.” Well, there’s nothing new about throwing subsidies at nuclear power. Economist Douglas Koplow calculates that federal nuclear subsidies have totaled $178 billion from 1947-1999. The promise of a nuclear economy with rates too cheap to meter has been made for over half a century. What would be new would be a policy of “just saying no” to industries with their hands out in Washington.

"It may be the fastest animal on earth, but the cheetah is struggling to outrun the threats to its extinction. With only 50 to 70 animals estimated to remain in Iran, the Asiatic cheetah is on the verge of extinction in the wild. While the more familiar African cheetah is more numerous, with around 12,000 individuals across the whole continent, it’s also at risk. So long as humans and wildlife compete for the use of the same land and resources, there will always be a struggle. This comes down to rights, and which species have more. Animals, including humans, are resource-driven, so removing food sources and fragmenting habitats will have the most serious impact on a species. But when humans go beyond this by actively removing “problem animals”, perhaps due to a perceived threat to crops or livestock, this puts an even greater pressure on their survival. However, there are means to try to boost cheetah numbers in the wild. Fenced, predator-proof refuge areas, such as private reserves like Cheetah Plains Private Game Reserve and Timbavati Nature Reserve, can be appropriately stocked and managed to ensure cheetah survival. Populations can also be relocated to regions where cheetahs historically ranged but where the cause of their extermination has been addressed. This was demonstrated by the Cheetah Conservation Fund in Namibia and the Endangered Wildlife Trust in South Africa.  Alternatively, cheetahs can be bred in captivity, trained, and released into controlled wild areas. Where species or sub-species are critically endangered, the release of captive-bred animals into the wild can be used as way of supplementing existing populations or forming new founder populations. In South Africa, the most promising strategy has been when cheetahs, prior to release, have been “trained to be wild”. This includes changing their diet to the wild game they will encounter on release so they become accustomed to tearing skin and even chewing around bones. And they must develop the strength to be able to bring down prey. It’s also important that these cheetahs become accustomed to starvation periods when prey is scarce or other conditions hinder a successful hunt. These are simple things that a wild cheetah would learn through nurture, but captive breeding does not afford the luxury of learning from mother. Removing any conditioning or familiarity to human presence that can develop during captivity is also important as this could pose a threat to the cheetahs – and to people. If cheetahs gravitate to human settlements which carry familiar associations with food they are likely to be harmed, and in a volatile situation a cheetah is perfectly capable of causing harm with its teeth and claws. Once the animal has been released, there are even more decisions to be made about how to monitor and manage the programme. There is debate as to what is deemed a successful re-introduction – for example, if and when breeding can take place, and how independent of human interference the animals really are. Such re-introductions have been tried but have not always been successful, mainly because of human influences like poisoning, hunting, and road accidents. Other deaths have been due to natural problems of starvation, disease, or often due to insufficient conditioning of the animal prior to release. The forerunner of these style of re-introduction projects is the Ann Van Dyke Cheetah Centre (formerly the De Wildt Cheetah and Wildlife Centre), which produced 785 cubs between 1975-2005. As part of a re-introduction project, the centre released six captive bred cheetahs into the wild between 2007-2010 – two single females and two pairs of male coalitions (as social animals, cheetah males often form a group known as a coalition). After extensive training, only one female and two males survived and recovered their wild habits. Since then, there have been no more attempts to re-introduce captive bred cheetah into the wild in South Africa. Until human populations see evident economic or cultural value in wildlife then protecting endangered species such as the cheetah will continue to be a struggle. And until these values can be assured then any efforts to increase wild cheetah populations will be futile. It’s essential – particularly when dealing with endangered species and predators – that the issues that drove them to become endangered in the first place are tackled. Unfortunately this usually takes time and effort, and so it’s important to continue working on programmes of captive-born reintroductions. While these have not always been successful, the ground has been laid for future work, and re-introduction remains an important means to win time in the fight against species extinction. "
"**There have been more than 1.6 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and about 60,000 people have died, government figures show.**
However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus and other measures suggest the number of deaths is higher.
**Find out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:**
If you can't see the look-up click here.
After the first peak in April, cases started rising again in July, with the rate of growth increasing sharply in September and October, before falling again in the past two weeks.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 16,170 confirmed cases.
It is thought the infection rate was much higher during the first peak in spring, but testing capacity at the time was too limited to detect the true number of daily cases.
The data for cases can also be broken down by region and comparing the change in those figures by week gives a sense of where there has been a recent increase in newly-reported infections.
Coronavirus infections in England have fallen by about a third during lockdown, according to a major study carried out by Imperial College London.
While some of the worst-hit areas saw the biggest improvements, cases have remained relatively high across England, according to the React-1 study, which is based on tests of more than 100,000 people between 13-24 November.
The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), suggest about one in 185 (16,400 people) in Wales had the virus in the week ending 21 November.
In Northern Ireland rates are thought to be decreasing at around one in 145 people (about 12,700 people), while in Scotland, the figure was one in 115 (about 45,700 people).
The average number of daily deaths began to rise again in September, following the first peak in April.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 648 deaths.
Of these, 555 deaths were in England, 51 in Wales, 38 in Scotland, and four in Northern Ireland.
Rules were amended over the summer to include deaths in the coronavirus total only if they occurred within 28 days of a positive test. Previously in England, all deaths after a positive test were included.
England has seen the majority of UK deaths from Covid-19. Using the 28-day cut-off, there have been more than 52,000.
Although hospital admissions for Covid-19 remain below the levels seen in the spring, there are big regional disparities.
The North West, North East and Yorkshire, and Midlands have seen the highest number of admissions but the situation in all three now appears to be improving.
Cases have risen across large parts of England, with other spikes in areas of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The red areas on the map below are those currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people.
Restrictions have been tightened across the UK in an effort to tackle the number of rising cases.
In England, each local authority has been placed in one of the new three tiers following the end of the recent national lockdown.
Wales has announced a range of further measures, including a ban on pubs, restaurants and cafes serving alcohol, from Friday 4 December.
In Northern Ireland, a further two-week ""circuit-break"" lockdown began on 27 November.
Scotland has a five-tier system of alert levels with different measures in place in different parts of the country.
UK leaders have agreed to allow up to three households to meet indoors during a five-day Christmas period of 23-27 December.
When looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways.
Government figures count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus.
But there are two other measures.
The first includes all deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, even if the person had not been tested for the virus. The most recent figures suggest there had been almost 70,000 deaths by 20 November.
The second measure counts all deaths over and above the usual number at the time of year - that figure was more than 75,000 by 20 November.
The most recent figures available from the ONS are for the third week of November, which show there were 14,276 deaths registered in the UK.
Some 3,038 of these deaths involved Covid-19 - 199 more than the week before.
Deaths normally do rise at this time of the year, but the data from the ONS and its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland show the second wave of the virus has pushed the death rate above the average seen over the past five years by about 21%.
Overall, the figures are still well below the peak of 9,495 deaths recorded in a week, reached on 17 April.
The ""R number"" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to.
If R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow.
The government's current estimate for the R number across the whole of the UK is 0.9 to 1.
The estimate for England is 0.9 to 1, while for Scotland it is 0.8 to 1. The estimate for Wales is 0.8 to 1 and in Northern Ireland it is 0.9 to 1.1.
The government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions."
"Do Not Resuscitate. This tag should be attached to the oil, airline and car industries. Governments should provide financial support to company workers while refashioning the economy to provide new jobs in different sectors. They should prop up only those sectors that will help secure the survival of humanity and the rest of the living world. They should either buy up the dirty industries and turn them towards clean technologies, or do what they often call for but never really want: let the market decide. In other words, allow these companies to fail. This is our second great chance to do things differently. It could be our last. The first, in 2008, was spectacularly squandered. Vast amounts of public money were spent reassembling the filthy old economy, while ensuring that wealth remained in the hands of the rich. Today, many governments appear determined to repeat that catastrophic mistake. The “free market” has always been a product of government policy. If antitrust laws are weak, a few behemoths survive while everyone else goes down. If dirty industries are tightly regulated, clean ones flourish. If not, the corner-cutters win. But the dependency of enterprises on public policy has seldom been greater in capitalist nations than it is today. Many major industries are now entirely beholden to the state for their survival. Governments have the oil industry over a barrel – hundreds of millions of unsaleable barrels, to be more precise – just as they had the banks over a barrel in 2008. Then, they failed to use their power to eradicate the sector’s socially destructive practices and rebuild it around human needs. They are making the same mistake today. The Bank of England has decided to buy debt from oil companies such as BP, Shell and Total. The government has given easyJet a £600m loan even though, just a few weeks ago, the company frittered away £171m in dividends: profit is privatised, risk is socialised. In the US, the first bailout includes $25bn (£20.1bn) for airlines. Overall, the bailout involves sucking as much oil as possible into strategic petroleum reserves and sweeping away pollution laws, while freezing out renewable energy. Several European countries are seeking to rescue their airlines and car manufacturers. Don’t believe them when they tell you they do this on our behalf. A recent survey by Ipsos of 14 countries suggests that, on average, 65% of people want climate change to be prioritised in the economic recovery. Everywhere, electorates must struggle to persuade governments to act in the interests of the people, rather than the corporations and billionaires who fund and lobby them. The perennial democratic challenge is to break the bonds between politicians and the economic sectors they should be regulating, or, in this case, closing down. Even when legislators seek to represent these concerns, their efforts are often feeble and naive. The recent letter to the government from a cross-party group of MPs calling for airlines to receive a bailout only if they “do more to tackle the climate crisis” could have been written in 1990. Air travel is inherently polluting. There are no realistic measures that could, even in the medium term, make a significant difference. We now know that the carbon offsetting schemes the MPs call for is useless: every economic sector needs to maximise cuts in greenhouse gases, so shifting the responsibility from one sector to another solves nothing. The only meaningful reform is fewer flights. Anything that impedes the contraction of the aviation industry impedes the reduction of its impacts. The current crisis gives us a glimpse of how much we need to do to pull out of our disastrous trajectory. Despite the vast changes we have made in our lives, global carbon dioxide emissions are likely to reduce by only about 5.5% this year. A UN report shows that to stand a reasonable chance of avoiding 1.5C or more of global heating, we need to cut emissions by 7.6% per year for the next decade. In other words, the lockdown exposes the limits of individual action. Travelling less helps, but not enough. To make the necessary cuts we need structural change. This means an entirely new industrial policy, created and guided by government. Governments like the UK’s should drop their road-building plans. Instead of expanding airports, they should publish plans for reducing landing slots. They should commit to an explicit policy of leaving fossil fuels in the ground. During the pandemic, many of us have begun to discover how much of our travel is unnecessary. Governments can build on this to create plans for reducing the need to move, while investing in walking, cycling and – when physical distancing is less necessary – public transport. This means wider pavements, better cycle lanes, buses run for service not profit. They should invest heavily in green energy, and even more heavily in reducing energy demand – through, for example, home insulation and better heating and lighting. The pandemic exposes the need for better neighbourhood design, with less public space given to cars and more to people. It also shows how badly we need the kind of security that a lightly taxed, deregulated economy cannot deliver. In other words, let’s have what many people were calling for long before this disaster hit: a green new deal. But please let’s stop describing it as a stimulus package. We have stimulated consumption too much over the past century, which is why we face environmental disaster. Let us call it a survival package, whose purpose is to provide incomes, distribute wealth and avoid catastrophe, without stoking perpetual economic growth. Bail out the people, not the corporations. Bail out the living world, not its destroyers. Let’s not waste our second chance.  George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist This article has been changed to reflect the most up-to-date figures on the US airline bailout."
"The shocking news that Satao, the much-loved African Elephant who lived in Kenya’s Tsavo East National Park, has been killed and butchered for his tusks highlights once again the terrible and unsustainable toll of poaching elephants for their ivory.  Increasingly authorities are using forensic methods to track and trace the origins of seized ivory, providing the means to tackle enforcement problems in the country where the animal was killed, rather than just the point where the attempt was made to smuggle it out of the continent. Satao’s death is just one among the many thousands of elephants killed each year. The Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants programme, part of the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna (CITES) set up as part of the worldwide ban in 1989, reported that 22,000 African elephants were illegally killed by poachers in 2012, based on data from 27 countries across Africa. The figures for 2013 reported this month show a toll of over 20,000 African elephants, the vast majority of seizures by customs or border officials being made in Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda. The CITES report reveals that while the numbers of elephants poached appears to have stabilised, among large seizures of more than 500kg the number of tusks found in each seizure is rising. This suggests two things: that there are fewer elephants to poach, and that the trade is well-organised and not the work of individual poachers or small groups. This level of slaughter far exceeds the reproductive potential of the remaining elephants and will, by any account, lead to the extinction of the African elephant in many parts of the continent. The international community is only now responding to this crisis for the African elephant with action. Knowing which populations the poachers are targeting can play an important part. Work pioneered by Professor Sam Wasser at the University of Washington uses DNA profiling from seized ivory to trace it back to the geographical location within Africa from which the ivory was taken once roamed.  There are two species of elephant in Africa, the savanna elephant (Loxodonta africana) and the forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis). Within these two species are many sub-populations, such as extended family groups, where there is a greater sharing of DNA types due to inheritance from common ancestors. So some DNA types become much more common than others in defined geographical ranges, which means that using similar DNA profiling techniques to those used in human forensic science, the DNA from ivory provides a map leading back to the geographic area where those sub-populations with similar DNA profiles are found. Under CITES there is a total ban on the trade in elephant ivory, although not from all other species that have ivory, nor from tusks removed from mammoths – being extinct, they cannot be provided any legal protection. The cost of mammoth ivory is approximately US$350 per kilogramme – significantly cheaper than elephant ivory – but often looks very similar. Again, DNA typing can distinguish between African and Asian elephants and mammoths. This aspect of wildlife forensic science is supported by the United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime, and has already proved highly successful in tracking seizures and locating their source. For example, when a 6.5 tonne shipment was seized in Singapore, DNA testing revealed it had come from elephant populations in Zambia. With that knowledge, pressure applied saw Zambia’s director of wildlife replaced and its courts start to impose harsher sentences for ivory smugglers in order to tackle the problem at source. Unfortunately such tests do not come cheap and are rarely conducted for free. The illegal trade in wildlife is highly profitable and well-organised. If nations wish to save the African elephant, then action to provide – and fund – the tools necessary is required. A CITES meeting last year agreed that all authorities making seizures over 500kg would submit samples for DNA analysis to boost the details mapping seizures to populations. The reason there is a trade at all is to provide ivory for markets in China and the Far East. Based on intelligence from seized shipments, ivory is exported from Africa to countries such as Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam where the ivory is processed before being sold on. 
It’s difficult to devise a cost per kilogramme of ivory (a tusker such as Satao would carry around 45kg of ivory) but the latest estimates are that a carved ornament of 10kg will sell ultimately for US$60,000. With booming economies in many countries of Southeast Asia, and China in particular, the amount of disposable income has rapidly increased alongside a desire for ivory as a status symbol. And as ivory becomes rare due to the alarming decrease in elephant numbers, the concurrent increase in value will put ever more pressure on the dwindling elephant populations."

Chimney sweeps are making a comeback in Great Britain. “According to the National Association of Chimney Sweeps,” the _Telegraph_ reports, “Britain is experiencing the largest boom in chimney sweeping since Victorian times. ‘It’s been remarkable,’ said president Martin Glynn. ‘When we started NACS in 1982, there were just 30 members. Today we have 540 members nationally.’” The reason? Gas and electricity prices have risen so high that people prefer to burn wood in their previously unused or underused fireplaces.    
  
  
Why are the energy prices so high? The British government’s pathological obsession with renewable sources of energy. Converting renewable energy ( _e.g._ , wind and solar) is much more expensive than conventional sources of energy ( _e.g._ , coal and gas). Since the government mandates that a certain percentage of energy consumption has to consist of renewable sources, energy prices are rising – fast.   
  
  
That leads to this amazing paradox: Progressivism started in Victorian England – a time and place of tremendous and unprecedented material and social progress that, nonetheless, also had a darker side. The stories of workers living in freezing and damp dwellings, children chimney sweeps suffocating while on the job, and environmental degradation, were both horrific and true.The evolution of progressivism has come full circle and progressives have turned reactionary: To combat the (highly uncertain) effects of climate change, modern‐​day progressives have embraced policies that lead to more burning of wood, freezing homes for the poor and vulnerable, and chimney sweeps back at work.

In 1969, the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland, Ohio, ignited. Historically, this fire was unremarkable — rivers elsewhere in the United States had caught fire throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, and the Cuyahoga had blazed at least 13 times since 1868. But the 1969 event attracted enormous attention and outrage, and the fire is often listed as one reason behind the passage of U.S. environmental laws in the early 1970s.



The Cuyahoga has not burned since 1969 and is now home to 40 species of fish. But water pollution issues are not just a part of history. Today, more than half of U.S. rivers and lakes violate environmental standards, and 4–28 percent of Americans in a typical year receive drinking water from systems that violate health‐​based standards. Flint, Michigan, recently exposed 100,000 residents to dangerous levels of lead in drinking water. Contaminated drinking water leads an estimated 16 million Americans to suffer from gastrointestinal illnesses annually.



Polls also suggest that water pollution has been Americans’ top environmental concern for at least 30 years. Sixty percent of Americans today list drinking‐​water pollution and also river and lake pollution as great concerns. In every survey since 1989, the share concerned about these issues has substantially exceeded the share expressing concern about air pollution, climate change, or other environmental problems.



The federal government sought to address these concerns by creating the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1970, the Clean Water Act in 1972, and the Safe Drinking Water Act in 1974. The Clean Water Act regulates “surface waters” — rivers, lakes, and some ocean areas. Whether the Clean Water Act regulates groundwater, which includes subsurface aquifers, is legally disputed. The Safe Drinking Water Act regulates drinking water, which includes groundwater or surface water that is purified by a drinking‐​water treatment plant and then transported by pipe to households and businesses.



A half century later, these laws still manage U.S. surface and drinking water. Since 1970, the United States has spent approximately $4.8 trillion (in 2017 dollars) to clean up surface‐​water pollution and provide clean drinking water, or more than $400 annually for every American. In the average year, this accounts for 0.8 percent of the gross domestic product, making clean water arguably the most expensive environmental investment in U.S. history. By comparison, the average American spends $60 annually on bottled water.



We ask four main questions: What forces led to these laws? How do they regulate pollution? How effective and efficient have they been? Why has recent economic research focused relatively little on water pollution, and what can remedy this lack of research? We illustrate that water pollution provides an excellent setting to learn about externalities, cost‐​benefit analysis, local public goods, fiscal federalism, regulatory design, nonmarket valuation, and other classic economic issues. Indeed, water pollution is a textbook example of an externality — introductory texts have long used the example of a plant dumping waste into a river and causing people downstream to suffer to illustrate the concept of externalities.



We emphasize several main conclusions. Many measures of drinking‐ and surface‐​water pollution have fallen since the EPA’s founding, due at least in part to the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act. The progress, however, is incomplete. William Ruckelshaus, first head of the EPA, noted, “Even if all of our waters are not swimmable or fishable, at least they are not flammable.”



But while these large investments in drinking water do appear to create substantial health benefits, existing evidence suggests that estimated costs of most investments in cleaning up rivers, lakes, and oceans exceed their measured benefits. A summary of cost‐​benefit analyses of 240 regulations implemented by the federal government between 1992 and 2017 finds that out of five categories of regulations (surface water, drinking water, air pollution, greenhouse gases, and all other regulations, including nonenvironmental ones), surface‐​water regulations are the only category where total estimated costs exceed total estimated benefits. Estimated total benefits are only 80 percent of estimated total costs, and the mean regulation has benefits that are only 57 percent of its costs. Sixty‐​seven percent of surface‐​water regulations fail a cost‐​benefit test, compared to 20 percent of drinking‐​water regulations and 8 percent of air pollution regulations.



It is noted that many of these estimates have difficulty quantifying several important channels of benefits and may be understating true benefits. But even if costs are underestimated, there are several reasons regulation of surface‐​water quality could produce smaller net benefits than other types of environmental investments. For example, surface‐​water policy does not typically use market‐​based instruments, such as cap‐​and‐​trade markets or pollution taxes, which are generally cost effective. Beyond specific policy choices, surface waters may be more substitutable than other environmental goods — changing the river where a person goes fishing or boating may be less costly than changing the air a person breathes or the water a person drinks.



Unfortunately, economic research on water pollution and its regulation has been limited. An important task for research is to assess which investments in surface‐​water pollution create net benefits and ways to make these investments more effective.

Share this...FacebookTwitterYou can always find some good politicians in the opposition parties. For example, Germany’s socialist SPD party, which is no favorite of mine, has had a few good pragmatic politicians who understood their duty of serving the people and not themselves. I liked some of them.

Democrat Senator Joe Manchin keeps his promise, takes dead aim at Obama’s energy war on America’s backbone blue collar workers. Photo credit: Youtube.
In the US, the Democrats have Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who is now speaking up strongly against Obama’s flat-earth-science-based energy policies, which in the end are nothing more than pure pandering to fringe environmentalists. It’s pure stupidity to think that the fate of the planet hinges on a few dozen US coal power plants. China is putting 50 on line each year.
In 2010, I remember doing a piece on Manchin here, where I expressed tones of skepticism. But two and half years later, I’ve seen enough. In my mind Manchin is a politician who keeps his word (at least on energy). He’s got my support. In 2010:
“I’ll take on Washington, and this administration to get the federal government off our backs and out of our pockets. I’ll cut federal spending and I’ll repeal the bad parts of Obamacare. I sued the EPA, and I’ll take dead aim at cap and trade.”

Cap and trade was shot down, and today once again Manchin is stepping up to the front and taking aim at the next job-killer, phony planet-rescue plan.
Manchin will be a key player in the coming defeat of Obama’s announced energy plan. Though many of us were riled up by Obama’s provocative declaration of war on American energy from earlier this week, it is the battle we’ve all been waiting for. Obama’s energy plan was written by a group of fringe environmentalists who refuse to take all societal interests and factors into account. Once the case gets laid out in the coming public discussion, Obama’s energy-inflation plan will be resoundingly rejected. Democrats simply cannot afford to alienate powerhouse states of America’s industrial heartland.
That is not to say that some old coal plants should not be shuttered – they should be. These need to be replaced by new modern plants, or by cleaner-burning, reliable natural gas plants fired with gas gained from fracking. Whatever energy mix arises, it’s important that energy remains cheap, clean and reliable. With today’s innovative technology coal, gas, and oil fit the bill on every front.
Wind and solar energy, on the other hand, are energies that were used back in the Dark Ages, the year 1200.

But a recent doctoral dissertation shows that flooding in Southern Germany is very strongly related to solar activity. No correlation is found with CO2.

Flooding catastrophes at the Bavarian Lake Ammer occur predominantly during phases of weak solar activity
By Fritz Vahrenholt and Sebastian Lüning
(Translated, edited by P Gosselin)
How has flooding developed over the past? What factors have an impact on the development?
The simplistic assertion that “more CO2 means more flooding” simply does not hold water with respect to the complexity of the subject. Modeling studies should first start by reproducing the history of flooding in the past. There’s plenty of information available on past flooding. A series of research teams have surveyed numerous studies of calibration data.

One of these studies took place at the geo-research center (GFZ) in Potsdam, Germany where Markus Czymzik determined the flooding history of Bavaria’s third largest lake, Lake Ammer, for the last 5000 years using sediment cores as part of his doctorate dissertation. The pdf file of the dissertation (English) can be downloaded at no cost. In his dissertation Czymzik explains why Lake Ammer is especially suitable for this type of study [translated from the German]:
Lake Ammer at the foot of the Alps forms an ideal archive for reconstructing flooding. Detritus material is transported by the Ammer River to the lower basin. The varved sediments allow a reliable detection and dating of microscopic flood layers. Instrumental flooding data of the Ammer and weather datasets of the Hohenpeißenberg Meteorological Observatory enable a calibration of the sediment data.”
Already in 2010 Czymzik together with colleagues had published an article in the journal of Water Resources Research (The paper is also included in the doctorate dissertation p. 10). In it the scientists present the flooding frequency development at Lake Ammer for the past 450 years. Much to their surprise an excellent correlation with solar activity is shown. Always when solar activity was weak was there increased flooding at Lake Ammer. Also in the new paper from February 2013 appearing in the Quaternary Science Reviews the scientists were again able to show this amazing relationship.

Flooding frequency of the Lake Ammer region (bottom) and solar activity (above) (from Czymizik 2012, dissertation). Phases of minimal solar activity are shown with a blue shaded background. Whenever the sun was weak (high C14 values, peak) flooding was more frequent.

It had to happen. In the midst of the record snowfall in the East, some mainstream media outlet had to try to link this season’s unusual weather events to global warming.



_Time_ was the first news organization to take the plunge. It published such an article on February 10 — and that very day, Washington, D.C., broke its 1899 seasonal snow record of 54.5 inches with its third official blizzard of the winter. Today, the _New York Times_ joined the party.



Like 2010, winter 1899 was characterized by multiple heavy snowstorms, especially in February. Sometimes the jet stream locks into a position where it is capable of creating such a string. As has been painfully obvious, this is one of those years. 



Before 1942, D.C.‘s official snow totals were taken downtown. The record since the measurement started being recorded at Reagan National Airport, set in 1996, has been eclipsed by ten inches this year.



The big January 1996 storm put down 17.1 inches at Reagan. The January 22, 1996, _Newsweek_ cover featured a man disappearing in a whiteout with the headline “Blizzards, Floods, and Hurricanes: Blame Global Warming.” The cover story, written by the voluble science populist Sharon Begley, claimed that global warming allows more moisture into the air so that snowstorms can become bigger. Her go‐​to scientist was NASA’s James Hansen — who more recently became famous for calling coal drags to your local power plant “death trains” and advocating war‐​crime trials for the executives who daily force you to put gasoline in your car. (So clearly we should expect no hyperbole from _that_ camp.) 



This winter, D.C. has placed _two_ storms in the top ten: The 18.0 inches that fell on February 5–6 ranks number four, and the 16.4 on December 18–19 is number eight. _Time_ ’s Bryan Walsh, who has a difficult time with the concept that improbable events are not impossible, thought this sufficiently bizarre to root online for any source that could be used to blame it on dreaded greenhouse gases. (Walsh found it in a semi‐​obscure 2003 study in the _Journal of Climate_ , though he did not actually link to it in his article.)



And so the argument was trotted out again that mid‐​Atlantic storms can hold more moisture in a warmer world, and therefore can produce more snow. Anyone who would claim this surely does not understand the climatology of snow in Washington, D.C. 



There are plenty of storms, usually up to 20 per winter, that are moist enough to produce snow but instead drop rain, or the unaesthetic combination of sleet and freezing rain that I call “sleeze.” Why no snow? Because there is simply not enough cold air available. Why so many near‐​snow events, like sleeze storms? Because there’s often _almost_ enough cold air for snow.



To simplify things somewhat, snow requires that the temperature at 5,000 feet be at freezing or below. When a low‐​pressure system moves up the Atlantic seaboard, warm winds ride on top of it, raising the temperature to the point that it cannot support snow. In order to counter this, there usually has to be a replenishing supply of cold air from New England, which comes in the form of the high‐​pressure systems that often form ahead of the storm.



Scientists have known for a long time that the modest greenhouse effect we have experienced will have a disproportionate effect on these cold‐​air masses. So, thanks to climate change, the cold air that’s needed for Washington snow is increasingly hard to come by. Moisture is not the problem: Snowflakes fear warm air.



The fact of the matter is that global warming simply hasn’t done a darned thing to Washington’s snow. The planet was nearly a degree (Celsius) cooler in 1899, when the previous record was set. If you plot out year‐​to‐​year snow around here, you’ll see no trend whatsoever through the entire history.



But of course, there are those who _insist_ that it snowed more when they were little. That’s partially a matter of physical perspective, as 20 inches of snow on the ground looks a lot bigger to a three‐​foot child than to a six‐​foot adult. It’s also a matter of lack of historical perspective. The three winters from 1977 through 1979 are the coldest in the entire U.S. record, and 1979 included the third‐​ranking snowstorm, the so‐​called President’s Day Mess.



Did I mention that the popular press back then, including _Time_ and _Newsweek_ , did not hesitate to blame the winters on the climatic bogeyman of that era — global cooling?

Share this...FacebookTwitterDirkH asked in a comment if I’m keeping any records on the performance of the 12-kW PV system my family installed on our home last year. He thinks the German Weather Service statistics concerning the amount of sunshine in Germany for June seem a little high. First, the sun statistics from the German Weather Service DWD seem to be spot on, and agree with the production of our PV system.
The first half of June was really good – plenty of sunshine. Our system produced over 1000 kwh in the first 18 days alone, with many days producing over 60 kwh. But things got bad starting June 19. The last 10 days have been really terrible. Yesterday was the worst summer day for solar energy I’ve seen so far (only 16 kwh). This month we’ve produced 1325 kwh up to now, which is okay.
Our PV system has a data-logger, but I haven’t taken the time to get it all set up on my PC notebook etc. and so I can’t present you with all these neat graphics. I just write down the result every evening and calculate output each month.
Monthly outputs so far:
Jul 2012: 957 kwh (July 10 – 31)
Aug: 1442
Sep: 1005
Oct: 682
Nov: 300
Dec: 173
Jan 2013: 114

I’ve spoken to other system operators who have had them a few years, and they tell me this year overall is the worst. It’s been cloudier than usual. Overall our PV system hasn’t performed as well as I hoped. The panels only work at about 75% when it’s too warm, they rarely operate at their rated capacity, even when the sun shines directly on them.
They tell us that the system pays for itself within 9 years or so. But if the power converter breaks down and you have to replace it, then you can add another 2 years. Then there are some maintenance costs, insurance, etc. So if we’re making money after 12 years, I’ll be surprised. Then there’s also the disposal costs. I seriously doubt I’ll be able to just throw everything out along with the household rubbish.
I bought the system only because 1) the person who sold it to us is a customer of ours, and 2) I didn’t want to be forced to pay high feed-in rates to subsidize other PV operators. Unfortunately it’s a screw, or be-screwed situation. Believing that we’re doing something good for the planet is totally idiotic. The feed-in act benefits (if at all) property owners with good southern exposure. The rest get the shaft.
After almost one year of operation my assessment is: I’m a little disappointed, and expected more from it. On a scale of 1 to 7, 1 = extremely satisfied / 7 = extremely disappointed, I’d have to award a score of 4.
By the way, on the other side of town where I live there’s a field covered with solar panels. Yesterday I rode my bike past it and the weeds growing underneath the panels are now starting to come through the gaps between the panels. So it’s possible that in about a week I’ll have another one of those infamous weed-covered PV system photos, like the one I wrote about here. I’ll be going back in a few days with a camera to see if I can get some shots before the owner mows the weeds down.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNew York Times environment reporter and believer of potentially catastrophic AGW Andrew Revkin is stunned at Twitter by the behavior of the White House.
Apparently blogger Steve Goddard had left a very factual tweet at the WhiteHouse Twitter page:
Source: stevengoddard.wordpress./
Obviously Goddard’s inconvenient fact was too much for the White House – so they deleted Goddard’s tweet. Andy Revkin, much to his credit, found that type of raw censorship “disturbing”. Here’s what Revkin just tweeted:

It looks like under Obama, society is not open at all. Some may even argue that it has become Stasi-like, especially when one considers the massive scale of the government’s Internet snooping and intrusion. The vibrations that Andy is picking up are not imaginary. He’s right in calling this disturbing.
Sorrowfully, America appears to have departed from what we know is an open society based on democratic principles. All this makes Richard Nixon look like an angel. I’m stunned.
Steve Goddard was also chilled by the WH totalitarian behavior: http://stevengoddard.wordpress.com/2013/06/24/censored-by-the-white-house/.

Fakegate: Open Letter to Directors of the Pacific Institute
FEBRUARY 29, 2012 – Today, The Heartland Institute sent the letter below to the following members of the Board of Directors of the Pacific Institute:
Peter Boyer, Trustee, The Ayrshire Foundation
Gigi Coe, Trust for Conservative Innovation
Joan Diamond, Chairperson, The Nautilus Institute
Anne Ehrlich, Senior Research Associate, Stanford University
Eric Gimon, Department of Physics, University of California – Berkeley
Corey Goodman, Managing Director, venBio LLC
Margaret Gordon, Second Vice-President, Port of Oakland
Malo Andre Hutson, Affiliated Faculty, University of California
Olivier Marie, Business Strategist, Haas School of Business
Richard Morrison, California Advisory Board, The Trust for Public Land
Robert Stephens, President, MSWG, Inc.
Michael Watts, Geography Department, University of California, Berkeley
We will post at www.fakegate.org any replies we receive. Previous press releases from The Heartland Institute plus links to dozens of news reports and commentary on Gleick’s transgressions can be reviewed at Fakegate.org. The Heartland Institute is a 28-year-old national nonprofit organization with offices in Chicago, Illinois and Washington, DC. Its mission is to discover, develop, and promote free-market solutions to social and economic problems. For more information, visit our Web site or call 312/377-4000. 



February 29, 2012
Dear _________:
On February 27, the Pacific Institute made the following announcement:
The Board of Directors of the Pacific Institute is deeply concerned regarding recent events involving its president, Dr. Peter Gleick, and has hired an independent firm to review the allegations. The Board has agreed to Dr. Gleick’s request for a temporary leave of absence …
The Heartland Institute’s staff, directors, donors, and other victims of Mr. Gleick’s crime look forward to reviewing the outcome of your investigation. Please confirm that you intend to make public the results of your investigation.
I hope that you and the firm you have hired will pay special attention to the documents I have enclosed:

The emails Gleick exchanged with Heartland prior to committing his crime, in which he was respectfully invited to debate Heartland Senior Fellow James M. Taylor on the issue of climate change at Heartland’s anniversary benefit event in August. In these emails, Gleick is informed of Heartland’s policies regarding the confidentiality of its donors and why we adopted that policy. Gleick declined the invitation to debate.


The emails Gleick used to steal documents intended to be read only by members of Heartland’s board of directors. Gleick falsely assumed the identity of a member of Heartland’s board on the same day (January 27) that he declined the invitation to debate climate change with Taylor.


The forged memo Gleick included with the stolen documents and falsely represented, in his message accompanying the documents to 15 allies and journalists, to have come from The Heartland Institute. I have highlighted the forger’s own words, as opposed to text that was copied and pasted from the stolen documents, and included my own analysis of this fraudulent document.


Gleick’s partial confession, in which he admits to having stolen the documents but claims that the memo, which he previously said came from The Heartland Institute, came “in the mail” from an anonymous source. He claims he stole documents because “a rational public debate is desperately needed,” a debate he had just declined to participate in. He offers his “personal apologies to all those affected,” presumably including people he knew his actions had put in harm’s way. He does not say or offer to do anything that would limit or undo the harm he caused.

I hope you will tell me, as you review these documents, if you recognize the author of the highlighted text of the forged memo, and if you believe Gleick received it from an anonymous source, and if you believe Gleick has shown any personal remorse for what he has done.
Finally, please pass along the following questions to the “independent” firm you hired to investigate Gleick:

Did Gleick use Pacific Institute computers to establish the Gmail email account under the name of a Heartland board member?


Did Gleick use Pacific Institute computers to establish the Gmail email account under the name of “heartlandinsider@gmail.com,” which he used to send the fake memo and the stolen documents to 15 media outlets?


Does the investigative firm intend to examine whether Gleick is the author of the fake memo?


Does the outside firm have access to all of the personal computers Gleick may have used to write and send the emails or to write the forged memo?


Is the fake memo or any trace of it on Gleick’s personal computer(s)?


Is the fake memo or any trace of it on the Pacific Institute’s computer system?


Is there evidence (as a blogger says) that the fake memo was scanned into a PDF document on a scanner at the Pacific Institute?


Does the Pacific Institute have possession of the hard copy of the fake memo or the envelope in which it was supposedly sent?


What steps does the Pacific Institute plan to take to preserve these and other documents relevant to the investigation?

Sincerely,
Joseph L. Bast
President
The Heartland Institute

Share this...FacebookTwitterMeteorologist Klaus-Eckart Puls of the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) recently was interviewed by German trade journal Welt der Fertigung (World of Production) on the subject of climate change.
Since global temperatures have not increased in 15 years, doubts about anthropogenic global warming are now seeping into the fields of engineering and industry, which for years have been major proponents of renewable energy technologies.

Meteorologist Puls, who has over 40 years experience in the field of meteorology and climate, provides us with some interesting insights. What follows are some excerpts.
On the subject of climate being used as an instrument for enacting new taxes and fees, Puls comments…
The anthropogenic emission of greenhouse gases is not completely without impact on the climate. The impact however, is relatively small because of physical laws, and is about 0.5°C for a CO2 doubling with respect to today. Early on – around the mid 1980s – politics empowered a pseudo-science called ‘climate protection’. The political motivations were on one hand “world rescue philosophies“, and, on the other hand, fiscal interests via ecological taxes.”
Puls on the mixing of politics and science…
Many of the scientific findings are merely results of a certain “procured science’: ‘whose bread one eats, whose words one speaks,’ is the old saying. And the IPCC itself is a politically founded organization, just as the name says: Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.”
On a global climate treaty, Puls is adamant:
There isn’t going to be any international climate treaty.”
On the subject of CO2’s assumed high sensitivity, Puls says that even the IPCC itself concedes…
…that a doubling of CO2 alone can produce only 1°C of warming. Beyond that feedback effects get calculated in. The IPCC reports speak about ‘assumed values’. This is nothing but hypotheses!”
On global temperatures having stagnated for 15 years, Puls says:
The 15-year stop in global warming is now outside the range of climate ‘noise’ and climate models. It is statistically significant. […] from a science point a view, it is sheer absurdity to want to maintain ‘a nice, comfortable, stable climate’ through a few turns of some sort of CO2 control-knob.”

//-->




If anthropogenic global warming is not really happening, then how could the whole world have been blindly led to this unbelievable error? Puls answers
I cannot answer that question – but currently psychologists and sociologists are dealing with that: scientific debates about the climate catastrophe, explains Prof. Dr. Norbert Bolz, are nothing more than a ‘civil religion’ coming from the faith of the religions of the mass society. In it prevails priestly fraud.”
On sea level rise:
If the trend continues – and because of numerous factors nobody can really know – then in 100 years we will see a rise of about 25 cm, which won’t be any problem at all.”
Puls also explains that Arctic sea ice has naturally fluctuated in the past and that today’s conditions are nothing unusual. He reminds readers that according to the Alfred Wegener Institute, Antarctica now has “the largest sea ice extent in 40 years!”
On the plausibility of global warming causing cold winters in Europe:
Meteorologically this is sheer absurdity. For more than 100 years we have known that the atmospheric circulation is subject to unpredictable cyclic fluctuations. Simply said: the atmospheric pressure gradient between the Azores and Iceland changes chaotically over the years, which in Europe leads to a series of warmer or colder winters. It has nothing to do with polar ice melt, climate change, and absolutely nothing to do with CO2. […] Why do climate catastrophists, who claim they can foresee the climate 100 years in advance, always come up with such explanations after the fact?”
Puls comments on whether CO2 is really good for plant growth:
CO2 via photosynthesis is truly life elixir: without CO2 there are no crops,  no plants, no animals and also no people because photosynthesis also produces the oxygen in the air that we breath.  The demonizing of CO2 as a pollutant, as a climate-killer, is outright nonsense – scientifically absurd!”
On the sun being a factor on climate change…
Yes, there’s a lot indicating just that. Over the last few years, solar scientists have been gaining more and more the upper hand in the climate debate, and they are crowding out the single cause of CO2. The new literature on this is very comprehensive. ‘Die Kalte Sonne’ [The Neglected Sun] for example led to hysterical allergic reactions among the CO2 climate alarmists. The increasing plausibility of the climate being controlled by solar variation has shaken the established climate institutes that are fixated on CO2.”
On the question of whether climate protection has anything to do with environmental protection, Puls says, “absolutely not!” He then quotes physicist Prof. Horst Malberg:
Clean air to breathe, clean water to drink, clean lakes, rivers, oceans and soil and an intact ecosystem belong to the fundamental human rights. As climate history shows us, a stable climate is not one of those rights.”

"**Police have issued 45 Covid-19 notices and 10 community resolution notices (CRNs) after three house parties overnight in Belfast.**
Officers responded to reports of two ""loud parties"" around midnight on Sunday at University Avenue and Sandymount Street in south Belfast.
They also found ""large numbers"" of people at a party at Castle Street in the city centre on Saturday evening.
PSNI Ch Insp Sayers said officers took ""appropriate action"".
He added that ""the current health restrictions are not a game"".
""Across Northern Ireland, people are making sacrifices, not visiting family members or friends and businesses have temporarily closed.
""People congregating or travelling to parties really need to consider their actions for their own health and that of the wider community."""
"**There have been more than 1.6 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and about 60,000 people have died, government figures show.**
However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus and other measures suggest the number of deaths is higher.
**Find out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:**
If you can't see the look-up click here.
After the first peak in April, cases started rising again in July, with the rate of growth increasing sharply in September and October, before falling again in the past two weeks.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 16,170 confirmed cases.
It is thought the infection rate was much higher during the first peak in spring, but testing capacity at the time was too limited to detect the true number of daily cases.
The data for cases can also be broken down by region and comparing the change in those figures by week gives a sense of where there has been a recent increase in newly-reported infections.
Coronavirus infections in England have fallen by about a third during lockdown, according to a major study carried out by Imperial College London.
While some of the worst-hit areas saw the biggest improvements, cases have remained relatively high across England, according to the React-1 study, which is based on tests of more than 100,000 people between 13-24 November.
The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), suggest about one in 185 (16,400 people) in Wales had the virus in the week ending 21 November.
In Northern Ireland rates are thought to be decreasing at around one in 145 people (about 12,700 people), while in Scotland, the figure was one in 115 (about 45,700 people).
The average number of daily deaths began to rise again in September, following the first peak in April.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 648 deaths.
Of these, 555 deaths were in England, 51 in Wales, 38 in Scotland, and four in Northern Ireland.
Rules were amended over the summer to include deaths in the coronavirus total only if they occurred within 28 days of a positive test. Previously in England, all deaths after a positive test were included.
England has seen the majority of UK deaths from Covid-19. Using the 28-day cut-off, there have been more than 52,000.
Although hospital admissions for Covid-19 remain below the levels seen in the spring, there are big regional disparities.
The North West, North East and Yorkshire, and Midlands have seen the highest number of admissions but the situation in all three now appears to be improving.
Cases have risen across large parts of England, with other spikes in areas of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The red areas on the map below are those currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people.
Restrictions have been tightened across the UK in an effort to tackle the number of rising cases.
In England, each local authority has been placed in one of the new three tiers following the end of the recent national lockdown.
Wales has announced a range of further measures, including a ban on pubs, restaurants and cafes serving alcohol, from Friday 4 December.
In Northern Ireland, a further two-week ""circuit-break"" lockdown began on 27 November.
Scotland has a five-tier system of alert levels with different measures in place in different parts of the country.
UK leaders have agreed to allow up to three households to meet indoors during a five-day Christmas period of 23-27 December.
When looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways.
Government figures count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus.
But there are two other measures.
The first includes all deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, even if the person had not been tested for the virus. The most recent figures suggest there had been almost 70,000 deaths by 20 November.
The second measure counts all deaths over and above the usual number at the time of year - that figure was more than 75,000 by 20 November.
The most recent figures available from the ONS are for the third week of November, which show there were 14,276 deaths registered in the UK.
Some 3,038 of these deaths involved Covid-19 - 199 more than the week before.
Deaths normally do rise at this time of the year, but the data from the ONS and its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland show the second wave of the virus has pushed the death rate above the average seen over the past five years by about 21%.
Overall, the figures are still well below the peak of 9,495 deaths recorded in a week, reached on 17 April.
The ""R number"" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to.
If R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow.
The government's current estimate for the R number across the whole of the UK is 0.9 to 1.
The estimate for England is 0.9 to 1, while for Scotland it is 0.8 to 1. The estimate for Wales is 0.8 to 1 and in Northern Ireland it is 0.9 to 1.1.
The government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions."

From CSIRO  – Warming in the Tasman Sea a global warming hot spot 
Oceanographers have identified a series of ocean hotspots around the world generated by strengthening wind systems that have driven oceanic currents, including the East Australian Current, polewards beyond their known boundaries.
The hotspots have formed alongside ocean currents that wash the east coast of the major continents and their warming proceeds at a rate far exceeding the average rate of ocean surface warming, according to an international science team whose work is published in the journal Nature Climate Change today.

Paper co-author, CSIRO’s Dr Wenju Cai, said that while the finding has local ecological implications in the region surrounding the hotspots, the major influence is upon the ocean’s ability to take up heat and carbon from the atmosphere.

In Australia’s case, scientists report intensifying east-west winds at high latitudes (45º-55ºS) pushing southward and speeding up the gyre or swirl of currents circulating in the South Pacific, extending from South America to the Australian coast.  The resulting changes in ocean circulation patterns have pushed the East Australian Current around 350 kilometres further south, with temperatures east of Tasmania as much as two degrees warmer than they were 60 years ago.
“We would expect natural change in the oceans over decades or centuries but change with such elevated sea surface temperatures in a growing number of locations and in a synchronised manner was definitely not expected,” said CSIRO’s Dr Wenju Cai.
“Detecting these changes has been hindered by limited observations but with a combination of multi-national ocean watch systems and computer simulations we have been able to reconstruct an ocean history in which warming over the past century is 2-3 times faster than the global average ocean warming rate,” says Dr Cai, a climate scientist at CSIRO’s Wealth from Oceans Research Flagship.
The changes are characterised by a combination of currents pushing nearer to the polar regions and intensify with systematic changes of wind over both hemispheres, attributed to increasing greenhouse gases.
Dr Cai said the increase of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has been the major driver of the surface warming of the Earth over the 20th century. This is projected to continue.
He said the research points to the need for a long-term monitoring network of the western boundary currents. In March next year, Australian scientists plan to deploy a series of moored ocean sensors across the East Australian Current to observe change season-to-season and year-to-year.
Lead author of the paper was Dr Lixin Wu, of the Ocean University of China, with contributing authors from five countries, many of whom are members of the Pacific Ocean Panel working under the auspices of the World Meteorological Organisation.
The research was partly funded by a grant from the Australian Climate Change Science Program supported by the Australian Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency.

"**The number of positive cases in a coronavirus outbreak at an ""extra care"" housing development in the Borders has risen to 28.**
Council-run care provider SB Cares said it had ""robust"" plans in place to deal with the situation at Dovecot Court in Peebles.
Sixteen tenants and 12 members of staff have tested positive.
Visiting was suspended at the site earlier this month when the outbreak was first reported.
SB Cares, which provides services at the 37-flat development tailored for elderly people, said it had measures in place in order to ""safely support"" all tenants.
Jen Holland, chief operating officer, said there was no impact on any of its other services in the area.
Eildon Housing, which owns the development, said it was working ""extremely closely"" with its partners in response to the outbreak and was providing tenants with any support needed at a ""challenging time"".
The region's director of public health said that while the level of infections in the Borders remained low compared with other areas it was essential for people to remain ""vigilant"" and follow health advice.
The outbreak was raised at the Scottish government's national daily coronavirus briefing by a reporter who pointed out that a previous outbreak in Jedburgh was linked to SB Cares home services.
National clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch, said he was aware of the outbreak and ""layers of support"" were in place.
""We continue to look after that home and those in it,"" he added.
""We have no reason to believe that this virus, remember, is anybody's fault so trying to find a provider to blame is not really helpful.
""What we want to do is support those providers, using our best public health expertise that we possibly can, to get that home Covid-free just as quickly as we can."""

No country has been a stronger magnet for foreign direct investment than the United States. Valued at $3.5 trillion, the U.S. stock of inward foreign direct investment accounted for 17 percent of the world total in 2011, more than triple the share of the next largest destination.



Foreign direct investment is ultimately a judgment by the world’s value creators about a country’s institutions, policies, human capital, and prospects. As the world’s largest economy, the United States has been able to attract the investment needed to produce the innovative ideas, revolutionary technologies, and new products and industries that have continued to undergird its position atop the global economic value chain.



But the past is not necessarily prologue. Indeed, while the U.S. claim to 17 percent of the world’s stock of foreign direct investment is impressive, the share stood at 39 percent as recently as 1999. It has been 12 years since the annual value of U.S. inward FDI set a record high of $314 billion, and since then, annual flows have failed to establish an upward trend. The most recent figures show a decline of 35 percent, from $227 billion in 2011 to $147 billion in 2012.



To a large extent, these trends reflect the emergence of new, viable destinations for investment resulting from inevitable demographic, economic, and political changes. However, some of the decline is attributable to a deteriorating U.S. investment climate, as reflected on a variety of renowned business surveys and investment indices measuring policy and perceptions of policy.



The current U.S. business environment conspires to deter inward investment and to encourage companies to offshore operations that could otherwise be performed competitively in the United States. A proper accounting of these policies, followed by implementation of reforms to remedy shortcomings, will be necessary if the United States is going to compete effectively for the investment required to fuel economic growth and higher living standards.

"What to do, when two of Britain’s most loved animals run up against each other? In a study recently published in the journal PLOS One, we found that the numbers of hedgehogs living in suburban areas in rural England doubled following the reduction in badger numbers through culling. This research points to the badger, widely popular in certain quarters but of major concern in others, having a significant impact on the hedgehog, Britain’s best loved mammal.  The Defra-funded research was part of a wider project to evaluate the ecological consequences of the Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT) conducted between 1998 and 2006. This long-running operation met with stiff resistance from many conservation and animal welfare groups. But it did offer an unrivalled opportunity to study the impact that an important predator has on prey and competitor species.  This type of research is particularly important as it provides information upon which to base conservation and environmental management decisions. This is particularly the case in areas that are extensively managed or affected by human activity, which leaves them missing many parts of their original food webs. For example, where large predators are missing (wolves, for example), medium-sized predators left unchallenged can have other knock-on ecological impacts.  One such predator, the badger, has long been known to prey on hedgehogs. This isn’t necessarily a cause for concern, as predator-prey relationships are natural and essential parts of functioning ecosystems. Hedgehogs and badgers have co-existed for millennia in Britain – well before the arrival of humans, and in the thousands of years since. However studies during the 1990s showed that where badger density was high they may have a profound effect on hedgehog numbers and their ability to move around the landscape. Animal rescue and rehabilitation organisations discovered that badgers were causing high rates of mortality among hedgehogs released back into the wild in some areas. Evidence from two citizen science surveys, run by the People’s Trust for Endangered Species over the past decade, point to a substantial national decline in hedgehog numbers. There are many suspects behind this decline – habitat loss and fragmentation as towns and villages expand, the loss of hedgerows which provide them cover and nesting sites, warmer winters and drier springs that disrupt their hibernation and invertebrate prey species, pesticides, roadkill, and a thriving badger population. But without a robust long-term national hedgehog monitoring scheme, it’s very difficult to determine the precise timing and cause. In the early-2000s, a team of us investigated patterns in hedgehog and badger populations across hundreds of square kilometres of rural southwest England and the midlands. One important finding was that hedgehogs appeared to be absent from large swathes of pastoral grasslands where they are thought to have once been commonplace. Instead we found that hedgehogs had moved almost exclusively into the villages and towns within these landscapes. It was also apparent that the likelihood of finding hedgehogs in parks and gardens declined as the density of badger setts nearby increased. But is this correlation, or is it causation? To address this question, we surveyed hedgehogs in a number of areas which were geographically and ecologically similar, but with different levels of badger culling. Hedgehog numbers in suburban areas doubled during the five years of badger culling, and remained static in areas without culling. This demonstrated for the first time that badger predation is a strong limiting factor for hedgehog populations in these particular habitats. But badgers and hedgehogs have always co-existed in Britain, why might there be an issue now? Until the mid to late 20th century, heavy persecution of badgers kept them at low numbers. The Badgers Act of 1973 introduced protections, enhanced by the 1992 Protection of Badgers Act. Consequently surveys published in January revealed that in the 25 years since the first survey in 1985-88, the number of badger social groups in England has doubled to around 71,600. In pasture-dominated and mixed agricultural landscapes, and in some suburban habitats, badgers thrive with have plentiful denning opportunities and abundant food resources. The largest increases in the density of badger social groups have occurred in the landscapes that dominate southern, western and eastern England. These are also the areas where hedgehog declines are likely to be most severe. So while there is evidence that increasing badger populations play a significant role in the hedgehog’s decline, the relative weight of the impact of badgers against the other many factors likely affecting hedgehogs is far from clear. Even with evidence of this link, it does not necessarily follow that badger culling would, or should, play any role in tackling the decline of the hedgehog. Given a multitude of ecological, social, practical, financial and legal reasons, it is impossible to see how it could ever be part of any conservation strategy.  Rather, we need to understand how to manage our countryside in a more ecologically informed and progressive manner, acknowledging that there are bound to be many trade-offs along the way. This could include creating habitats such as very large areas of woodland that could favour hedgehogs over badgers, besides offering significant environmental and social value for us.  We should also consider more radical solutions, such as restoring the ecologically important elements of our ecosystems that we are missing – such as larger predators, including brown bears and lynx – as is happening in mainland Europe. That two of Britain’s most recognisable species should appear to be pitted against each other in this way may just be what’s needed to prompt a debate on how we can encourage greater diversity, in form, content and function, in our rural landscapes for the future."

 **Things that we will never witness:** _An important message to my country from the Honourable Mr Underpants Bridges._



Just yesterday the Leader of the Communist Party of Aotearoa called me names, saying I was a ‘Denier’ and that I represent a threat to climate policy; and he’s right. I am!



I am a threat to the wealth-stealing, private property confiscation cabal that is the Reds and Greens of this fine land. I don’t need to remind you that Green is the colour that something Red turns when it’s utterly rotten, and they are putrid; they stink.



They stink because they pretend to be responsible and ethical yet truth is a complete stranger to them. Because if they wanted to tell the truth in the midst of this Oh-so-important climate ’emergency’, they would tell you wouldn’t they, what they fully intend it should cost you to remove a **one-twenty-fifth of one percent** , yes, that’s a 0.04% amount of a trace element, a plant food in fact, from the skies above New Zealand?



Why would they withhold this extremely important information from you? They’ve had it in their dirty, grubby, Green, stealing, sticky, stinking fingers for several weeks.



Because James Shaw is so mendacious and so gutless, he’s fully afraid to tell the public what he and his cohort of economic vandals have in mind for degrading your way of life. So the mantle has fallen to me. So here it is, from Treasury. Read it, and weep…New Zealand:



Look at those numbers; a hit to our economy of $215,900,000,000 by 2050 to remove carbon dioxide or, worse, to remove all ‘greenhouse’ gases. That is **247.5 Billion Dollars** over just 4 decades. This is madness, it’s almost economic treason. How many new hospitals, schools, cancer-medications, public transport initiatives, clean-water plants, noxious pest-removal programmes, does this bill leech off, sucking the very life from? How many jobs does it destroy?”



If the number is too big to comprehend (the big lie is easier to sell than the small lie, some propagandist once said), just look one column left of the big numbers to see what the narcissist-in-thief intends you should contribute, every single household in the country, every year, year-on-year, to 2050 and beyond. The “GNDI” (that’s **your Disposable Income** folks) under either scenario it’s very close to $18,000 every year, an extra **$370 per week** taken, milked, from every home in the country in levies, taxes, fees, increased costs and ‘climate contributions’; for what?



To assert the execrable, unethical and dishonest James Shaw’s moral superiority, to fulfil **his huge vanity project.** To make him look good to his mirror, and his comrades. How on earth are worse-off families going to cope, or those on fixed incomes? The man makes me utterly sick, green to the gills in fact.

"When scientists from Imperial College released a simulation of a tsunami, triggered by a vast undersea landslide at Storrega off the coast of Norway around 6000 BC, it probably came as a surprise to many in north-west Europe that their reassuringly safe part of the world had been subject to such a cataclysmic event. The researchers suggest that this succession of destructive waves up to 14 metres high may have depopulated an area that is now in the middle of the North Sea, known as Doggerland. However, melting ice at the end of the last ice age around 18,000 years ago led to rising sea levels that inundated vast areas of continental shelves around the world. These landscapes, which had been home to populations of hunter gatherers for thousands of years were gradually overwhelmed by millions of tonnes of meltwater swelling the ocean. Doggerland, essentially an entire prehistoric European country, disappeared beneath the North Sea, its physical remains preserved beneath the marine silts but lost to memory. Although effectively untouched and largely untouchable, the existence of these landscapes had been appreciated since the 19th century. Their potential significance was such that the archaeologist Graham Clark, father of British Mesolithic studies, wrote in 1936 that: “It would be possible to take comfort from the fact that such cultures might not have existed, were it not eminently probable that they not only existed, but flourished, under conditions more favourable than those inland.” For more than 60 years after this the unreachable nature of Doggerland ensured that archaeologists knew very little about the settlement or even the people of these drowned lands. So little in fact, that it is probably correct to say that the only inhabited lands on Earth that remain to be significantly explored are those lost to the oceans. Indeed, Professor Geoff Bailey, at the University of York, recently suggested that across the world they represent one of “the last frontiers of geographical and archaeological exploration”. In the past decade, however, a phenomenal amount of work has begun to shed light on this inundated landscape. The increasing appreciation of the length of human occupation of north-west Europe, currently thought to stretch back around 900,000 years and understanding that for much of this time Britain was not an island, but a peninsular of Europe, has stimulated research.  A number of dramatic new archaeological finds have given us clues to the extent to which these drowned landscapes are preserved beneath the sea. These include a Neanderthal skull fragment from the Zeeland Ridges off the coast of the Netherlands and a collection of 75 Neanderthal stone tools and animal remains from off the coast of East Anglia, both dating to the Middle Palaeolithic – some 50,000 to 300,000 years ago. Another development relates to work by researchers at the University of Birmingham that uses seismic reflection data gathered by the offshore oil and gas industry at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars. Using this information, archaeologists have been able to map the surviving prehistoric landscapes beneath the North Sea silts. Hills, rivers, streams, estuaries, lakes and marshes can now be identified.  Recent projects supported by English Heritage, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and seismic survey company PGS have mapped a previously unseen Mesolithic country of more than 45,000km2, about the size of the Netherlands. Returning to the Storrega Tsunami, no doubt this was a truly catastrophic event and certainly a major event that played out toward the end of Doggerland’s history. But the truth was that Doggerland had been slowly submerging for thousands of years. The heartland of north-west Europe would have been constantly shrinking, in a way that would have been obvious to its inhabitants. Sometimes slowly and on occasions terrifyingly quickly, the sea inevitably reclaimed ancestral hunting grounds, campsites and landmarks.  Consequently, the final force driving research interest in Doggerland must be the inexorable effects of climate change. The loss of Doggerland was the last time modern humans experienced climate change at the scale currently projected by climate scientists. It can be appreciated that the prehistoric sea-level rise that resulted in the loss of these vast areas of land was caused by natural rather than anthropogenic factors. And also, that the extensive loss of such  land, while devastating to those that lived there, was never likely to amount to an extinction-level event.  The Mesolithic communities of the great plains of north-western Europe were flexible and mobile in the face of such change. Suffering there must have been, but they moved and adapted. Modern populations, however, do not necessarily have such a luxury in a world with far more people to share its finite resources and where the majority of the urban centres lie on coastlines. And because of that, the history of Doggerland, and other drowned lands, should rise above the status of historical curiosity to that of a record of a critical period in human history that we would be well advised to study."
"**There have been more than 1.6 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and about 60,000 people have died, government figures show.**
However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus and other measures suggest the number of deaths is higher.
**Find out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:**
If you can't see the look-up click here.
After the first peak in April, cases started rising again in July, with the rate of growth increasing sharply in September and October, before falling again in the past two weeks.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 16,170 confirmed cases.
It is thought the infection rate was much higher during the first peak in spring, but testing capacity at the time was too limited to detect the true number of daily cases.
The data for cases can also be broken down by region and comparing the change in those figures by week gives a sense of where there has been a recent increase in newly-reported infections.
Coronavirus infections in England have fallen by about a third during lockdown, according to a major study carried out by Imperial College London.
While some of the worst-hit areas saw the biggest improvements, cases have remained relatively high across England, according to the React-1 study, which is based on tests of more than 100,000 people between 13-24 November.
The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), suggest about one in 185 (16,400 people) in Wales had the virus in the week ending 21 November.
In Northern Ireland rates are thought to be decreasing at around one in 145 people (about 12,700 people), while in Scotland, the figure was one in 115 (about 45,700 people).
The average number of daily deaths began to rise again in September, following the first peak in April.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 648 deaths.
Of these, 555 deaths were in England, 51 in Wales, 38 in Scotland, and four in Northern Ireland.
Rules were amended over the summer to include deaths in the coronavirus total only if they occurred within 28 days of a positive test. Previously in England, all deaths after a positive test were included.
England has seen the majority of UK deaths from Covid-19. Using the 28-day cut-off, there have been more than 52,000.
Although hospital admissions for Covid-19 remain below the levels seen in the spring, there are big regional disparities.
The North West, North East and Yorkshire, and Midlands have seen the highest number of admissions but the situation in all three now appears to be improving.
Cases have risen across large parts of England, with other spikes in areas of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The red areas on the map below are those currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people.
Restrictions have been tightened across the UK in an effort to tackle the number of rising cases.
In England, each local authority has been placed in one of the new three tiers following the end of the recent national lockdown.
Wales has announced a range of further measures, including a ban on pubs, restaurants and cafes serving alcohol, from Friday 4 December.
In Northern Ireland, a further two-week ""circuit-break"" lockdown began on 27 November.
Scotland has a five-tier system of alert levels with different measures in place in different parts of the country.
UK leaders have agreed to allow up to three households to meet indoors during a five-day Christmas period of 23-27 December.
When looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways.
Government figures count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus.
But there are two other measures.
The first includes all deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, even if the person had not been tested for the virus. The most recent figures suggest there had been almost 70,000 deaths by 20 November.
The second measure counts all deaths over and above the usual number at the time of year - that figure was more than 75,000 by 20 November.
The most recent figures available from the ONS are for the third week of November, which show there were 14,276 deaths registered in the UK.
Some 3,038 of these deaths involved Covid-19 - 199 more than the week before.
Deaths normally do rise at this time of the year, but the data from the ONS and its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland show the second wave of the virus has pushed the death rate above the average seen over the past five years by about 21%.
Overall, the figures are still well below the peak of 9,495 deaths recorded in a week, reached on 17 April.
The ""R number"" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to.
If R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow.
The government's current estimate for the R number across the whole of the UK is 0.9 to 1.
The estimate for England is 0.9 to 1, while for Scotland it is 0.8 to 1. The estimate for Wales is 0.8 to 1 and in Northern Ireland it is 0.9 to 1.1.
The government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions."
"Greta Thunberg and a group of other children have pushed forward their legal complaint at the UN against countries they accuse of endangering children’s wellbeing through the climate crisis, despite attempts to have it thrown out. The 16 children, including the Swedish environmental activist, lodged a legal case with the UN committee on the rights of the child against Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany and Turkey last September. They alleged that the countries – which are legally obliged to protect children under the UN convention on the rights of the child – breached those obligations by failing to protect them from the “direct, imminent and foreseeable risk to their health and wellbeing” posed by the climate crisis. Three countries – Brazil, France and Germany – have replied to the petition, saying it should not be admissible by the committee. But on Tuesday the children hit back, arguing that the countries should be judged by their behaviour on the climate crisis. They said the three countries were all failing to cut their emissions in line with the Paris agreement. In response to the objections raised by Brazil, France and Germany, the children said they had been “directly and foreseeably injured” by the greenhouse gas emissions that those governments had allowed to change the climate. They have submitted new scientific research on how the countries are failing in their obligations, and said it would be “futile” to argue their case in separate domestic lawsuits in each country, as that “would not provide the type of far-reaching international relief needed to reverse climate change”. Although 140 countries, excluding the US, have ratified the UN convention on the rights of the child, only 46 governments have adopted a protocol that allows for this kind of legal action. Of those, the five biggest greenhouse gas emitters – Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany and Turkey – are targeted in the lawsuit, which has been brought by the children with the backing of the green campaigning group Earthjustice and the international law firm Hausfeld. There has been no decision yet from the UN committee on whether to hear the legal complaint. The lawsuit joins a growing number of attempts to bring climate cases to court, alleging that government or businesses have flouted the law or failed in their international obligations. One of the most successful has been in the Netherlands, in the Urgenda case, in which judges found the government must change its policies to tackle emissions and the climate crisis. In the UK, campaigners brought a successful legal challenge that found the government was wrong to allow the expansion of Heathrow airport without taking into account its obligations under the Paris agreement. The ruling will have implications for other government plans likely to raise emissions, such as road-building schemes. More than 1,300 legal actions have been brought around the world to try to force governments to confront the climate crisis. More than 1,000 are in the US; the highest profile case there, the Juliana case, was dismissed by judges earlier this year. There are similar cases ongoing in 28 countries including Ireland, Australia, Spain and New Zealand."

 _The Current Wisdom_ is a series of monthly articles in which Senior Fellow Patrick J. Michaels reviews interesting items on global warming in the scientific literature that may not have received the media attention that they deserved, or have been misinterpreted in the popular press.  
  
Traditionally _The Current Wisdom_ only comments on science appearing in the refereed, peer‐​reviewed literature, or that has been peer‐​screened prior to presentation at a scientific congress. This is an exception, in response to a massive pre‐​peer‐​review public relations campaign currently in progress from the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature (BEST) science team.  
  
Prior to April, 2011, issues of this _Wisdom_ , which began in 2010, are available at our blog Cato@Liberty (www​.cato​-at​-lib​er​ty​.org/).





On October 21, the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature (BEST) research team sent four manuscripts on surface temperature histories to the peer‐​reviewed journal _Journal of Geophysical Research_ (JGR). The same day, they issued a press release detailing the research findings contained in those manuscripts.



The most prestigious journals, such as _Science_ and _Nature_ , automatically reject any submission if the results are made public prior to their publication. Other journals can be (but aren’t necessarily) a bit more lax. But the sheer scope of the BEST pre‐​peer‐​review PR campaign has been very impressive.



The original BEST press release confidently stated that their findings would be incorporated the next comprehensive report of the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which presumes that they will be accepted for publication largely in their current form.



For several reasons, I think this is highly presumptuous.



Consider their paper on urban heat islands (UHI), the well‐​known warming of towns and cities compared to the surrounding countryside. UHIs can be very impressive. Washington DC and Tokyo’s are both in excess of 2°C (3.6°F) for average temperature, but the effect can be much greater — as much as 12°C (21.6°F) on clear, calm nights in the winter.



They are also ubiquitous, having been found systematically at locations in the U.S. with populations of only 1200. And they are _positive_ , meaning that they are in the warm direction. (There are negative UHIs in China, probably a result of extreme urban air pollution that significantly reduces incident sunlight, compared to the countryside.)



At any rate, BEST found a global urban _cooling_ effect, counter to virtually every other study in science history.



Now, this may turn out to be correct and every prior study may have been wrong. But that’s doubtful. It is a given that bricks and pavement heat up much more than vegetated ground during the day, and that the roughness of the city impedes the flow of ventilating winds, resulting in warmer nights.



I suspect that the official peer‐​reviewers are going to relentlessly home in on this result, and I doubt that anyone would recommend publication of the paper without extensive documentation and without the statements, contained in the submitted manuscript, about “urban cooling” and “rural warming”. Consequently, the flat‐​out statement that their manuscripts will be accepted seems a bit overconfident.



 **Where’s the “Pause”?**



In their extensive and well‐​orchestrated press offensive, BEST’s director Richard Muller made it quite clear on the BBC that they had not found the “pause” in global warming that begins in the late 1990s in other analyses. Is that really true?







In response to Muller’s statement, David Whitehouse, from the Global Warming Policy Foundation in the United Kingdom, excerpted the BEST team’s monthly temperature departures from average for the last ten years. The result certainly looks like the familiar “pause.” However, there is an obviously bad data point in early 2010 (which is noted on the BEST website).



The response of the green blogs (and the _Washington Post_ ) to Whitehouse was that indeed there was a warming — of 0.14°C, if one removed the last two points.



In reality, while that is true, because of the inherent noise in BEST’s land‐​only data, that “trend” does not come close to statistical significance, which means that _it cannot be distinguished from zero_ , or no trend.



(This is a common problem in climate rhetoric, and even the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate change and the U.S. National Climatic Data Center often make the egregious error of stating “trends” that in fact are no different than zero.)







Note that Whitehouse’s analysis begins in January 2001. In reality, the divergence between the BEST and the rest largely occurs in the late 1990s.



1998 saw one of the largest El Niño events ever measured. These are periodic warmings of the tropical Pacific Ocean that occur when, for reasons currently unknown, easterly trade winds slow or even reverse. When this happens, a normal upwelling of cold water off of South America is suppressed, and the global average temperature suddenly jumps.



When the trades return, the suppressed cold water comes to the surface with a vengeance, and global temperatures drop for a year or so far below where they peaked from the El Niño. This “reverse phase” is called La Niña — something we will visit again later in this _Wisdom_.



The key words here are _Pacific Ocean_. The BEST analysis is for land temperatures only (which also does not include islands). Consequently the extreme warmth of 1998 (and the following cold La Niña) does not appear as it does in the global (land and ocean) records. This is why there’s no spike in the 1998 data in the chart shown above. On the other hand, it is quite obvious in the land‐​ocean record:







When fishing for global climate fish, use global data.



Which of the three _global_ records is most reliable during the “pause?” That can be determined by comparison to the completely independent record of temperatures measured by satellites. It turns out that the East Anglia record most accurately captures the 1998 El Niño, and therefore it is the one that should be examined in depth for recent behavior.



 **How Long Have We Gone Without Warming?**



The correspondence between the East Anglia thermometer record and the satellite record, which measures microwave radiation from the lower atmosphere, is reassuring. It is noteworthy that there are two versions of the satellite data, one from the University of Alabama‐​Huntsville, where it was first developed, and another from Remote Sensing Systems, a California consultancy that processes the data in a slightly different fashion.



Monthly versions of the three records (the East Anglia history and the two versions of the satellite) are pretty close together in how long they say the current lack of warming has gone on. This can be determined by passing trends through records of increasing length and finding when a statistically significant warming emerges. Using this method, there is no significant warming in the last 15.0 years in the CRU thermometer record, 13.9 years in the Alabama version of the satellite data, and 15.6 years in the California analysis.



 **How Long Will We Go Without Warming?**



Obviously, no one really knows. But let’s start with the observation that the current era of steady temperatures, according to the figures above, began around 1996.



We are currently experiencing another — for now — moderate La Niña, or the cold phase of El Niño. Satellite temperatures, as of this writing, have dropped below where they were in the previous La Niña of 2008, so 2011 isn’t going to be particularly warm compared to the average of the last 15 years.



In addition, the latest forecast from the Department of Commerce’s Climate Prediction Center is for the current La Niña to become stronger and persist through at least the first half of 2012:







Consequently, 2012, like 2011, is not likely to be particularly warm when compared to the last 15 years.



Assume that, beginning in 2013, surface temperatures rise at the rate they did from the mid‐​1970s through the late 1990s. How much time would have to elapse before a statistically significant warming trend was established, post‐​1995?



Significance would finally be achieved in 2021. That would be after a 24‐​year stretch with no significant net warming.



So, in summary, BEST really does not tell us much that is new. It, too, contains the “pause,” but the big 1998 peak is missed because the study was only for land areas, while most of the 1998 warming was at the surface of the ocean due to the massive El Niño. Satelllite data, not used in the BEST science, tells us that the East Anglia climate record is probably most reliable for global estimates during the “pause.” La Niña conditions mean that 2011 and 2012 are not likely to be particularly warm. Even if surface temperatures begin to rise in 2013 at the rate that they rose from the mid 1970s to the late 1990s, a significant warming trend since 1995 will not be established until 2021.



It seems hard to believe that there will be much political will for expensive global warming policies after two‐​and‐​a‐​half decades without a significant rise in temperature.

As WUWT readers know, Andrew Revkin of the New York Times was the first to “authenticate” the stolen Heartland documents. Only one problem, one of the documents, the one that “gave the story legs” (in journo parlance) was a fake. That fake document, combined with Revkin’s “authentication” then helped release an avalanche of coverage, most of it without even checking with the sources first.  These newshounds adopted a pack mentality and went chasing the fox.
In a pushback to this lack of journalistic integrity, the Charles Koch Foundation has issued a strongly worded denunciation on their opinion the New York Times’ reporting of the Fakegate affair.
One might expect the Times to have some chagrin about its reporting that was based on material obtained by fraud, motivated by an ulterior ideological agenda, and suspect in its authenticity.  Yet even though that source lied, cheated, and stole – and refuses to answer any further question from the Times or anyone – reporter Andrew Revkin nonetheless found room to praise him, writing, “It’s enormously creditable that Peter Gleick has owned up to his terrible error in judgment.”  Readers would be right to wonder if the Times itself is able to own up to mistakes on this story.
I used to have more respect for Andrew Revkin than many other reporters, because he was much more open and accessible. But like Gleick, he’s really damaged himself in this episode. Now he’s just any other reporter with a cause. Speaking of damage… 
I’ve been damaged as well, with all sorts of false and malicious reports. The Guardian’s early coverage for example from Goldenberg and Hickman didn’t even wait for a response from me. though Goldenberg asked for comment, she didn’t wait for a response. The news organ of the British government, BBC’s Richard Black, also didn’t seek comment. He just published his opinion. And so it went with serial regurgitators worldwide.
Locally, one such person who has been leading the libeling of me is familiar to many readers here from his hilariously inept interactions in blog comments. That’s Dr. Mark Stemen, of Chico State University. On his Facebook page he labeled me as a “Koch-whore” (I have screencaps which I’ll share later) without so much as asking me a question first. And, in an email to me he went from simple libel to malicious libel by saying “and I’ve made sure everyone knows it”.
It didn’t matter to him that Koch wasn’t even involved with climate funding to Heartland when I pointed it out, he just took another tack of denigration. The hate from this man and his students he’s telling about me on his Facebook page is palpable. Problem is, he’s been using publicly funded resources to push his political activism, something we’ve seen time and again in Climategate.
Of course Dr. Stemen is part of CSUC’s sustainability cabal committee with the City of Chico, who uses his publicly funded bully pulpit to dictate to our town what others should do in living our lives in the green meme. When you are given such godlike power (conveyed with tenure without consequences) over others, I suppose there’s no need to check facts first. Slime first, ask questions later.
The irrational hatred spewing from Dr. Mark Stemen and others over the word “Koch” in any context belies serious shortcomings in being factual and rational messengers in education, a role he was hired to do.
Here’s the Koch letter to NYT:

Charles Koch Foundation Confronts the New York Times for Misleading Readers

The following letter was sent by Tonya Mullins of the Charles Koch Foundation to Art Brisbane, Public Editor, at the New York Times on February 24, 2012:
Dear Mr. Brisbane:
In previous correspondence with Melissa Cohlmia of Koch Industries, you invited any further examples of flawed journalism on the news side. The Times’s recent piece on the Charles Koch Foundation [Leak Offers Glimpse of Campaign Against Climate Science; 2/15/12] is one of the more egregious examples to date.  Here are our specific concerns:

As soon as we read the piece, we pointed out to editors that they had been misinformed.  The article stated, “The documents say that the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation…was expected to contribute $200,000 this year [to Heartland Institute].”  That is demonstrably false and we said so in writing and on the record in an email.  But editor Nancy Kenney replied a day later to ask if we could be “more explicit” (correspondence attached below).  A public statement from the Charles Koch Foundation had been out for days at that point and the authenticity of the document the Times relied on had been disavowed by Heartland and thoroughly discredited by other news outlets.  Yet, the Times would not update or clarify the story to include these facts.
The Times never reached out to us before publication, despite quoting several other parties that were cited. Ms. Kenney claims to “regret that our reporters didn’t call you” and yet when we asked her for an explanation (twice) she ignored the question and the information we provided remains withheld from readers.
The piece tried to convey that the Charles Koch Foundation had funded Heartland’s work on climate science – based on the headline, lede, and the sentences immediately preceding and after the mention of the Foundation’s donation, all of which emphasize climate science.  That is false, and we explained to Ms. Kenney that our $25,000 donation was specifically for healthcare research.  Ms. Kenney insists that we are “misreading” the article and that it is somehow “clear from the overall context” that the donation was for “purposes other than climate advocacy.”  Her position is puzzling in light of the actual content and context, yet when we asked for explanation she gave none.

Since the piece ran, it has come to light that some of the documents the Times cited were obtained by an activist who, by his own admission, perpetrated a fraud on Heartland.  One of the documents, a purported cover memo, is now widely regarded as wholly fabricated – a view supported by what both we and Heartland have separately told the paper.
However, the paper’s subsequent reporting still omits any mention of our direct and salient statements to the Times about that apparent fabrication.  Readers are still left with the false impression about the size, duration, and intent of our donation.  Our good faith questions about why the Times failed to call us and won’t include our viewpoint remain unanswered.  Not one of the five Times reporters that have written on the topic – Leslie Kaufman, Justin Gillis, John Border, Felicity Barringer, and Andrew Revkin – even attempted to contact us for input or reaction.
One might expect the Times to have some chagrin about its reporting that was based on material obtained by fraud, motivated by an ulterior ideological agenda, and suspect in its authenticity.  Yet even though that source lied, cheated, and stole – and refuses to answer any further question from the Times or anyone – reporter Andrew Revkin nonetheless found room to praise him, writing, “It’s enormously creditable that Peter Gleick has owned up to his terrible error in judgment.”  Readers would be right to wonder if the Times itself is able to own up to mistakes on this story.
If you could look into this matter we would appreciate your feedback.
Sincerely,
Tonya Mullins
Director of Communications
Charles Koch Foundation

Simon Bridges has been the subject of a lot of attention from the government, and most of it has been particularly disrespectful. While I am of the opinion that any publicity is good for Simon’s profile, there is definitely a real nastiness to it. From the Greens’ nasty attack video mocking his accent, to the Maori Council now demanding an apology for him calling Jacinda a part-time prime minister, to the great Oscar Kightley saying he was especially disrespectful to a hard-working prime minister (haha), Simon is being attacked from all sides. Yes, there is the view that he must be gaining some traction if he is being hit by the left all the time, but unfortunately, there is probably more to it than that.



The Green Party has been quick [to apologise](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/395035/greens-apologise-for-simon-bridges-attack-ad) and delete their attack advertisement mocking National leader Simon Bridges, not only for his environmental policies, but also for his accent. But what led the party to make such an ad in the first place? The ad is an example of the global phenomenon of “sneer politics”, in which it’s fashionable for liberal elites to admonish and ridicule the ordinariness and ‘uncouth’ elements of political opponents. 



I find it particularly ironic that the Greens think that they can sneer at others when Marama’s biggest claim to fame at the moment is reclaiming the ‘C’ word. That is about as uncouth as it gets… but it is always okay if the left does it.



It’s very fashionable in metropolitan and liberal circles to sneer at political leaders considered to be déclassé. The likes of Donald Trump and Boris Johnson are ridiculed not just for their reactionary politics, but also for their rather vulgar or even “common” styles and personalities. We call them “clowns”. 



Boris Johnson, Eton and Oxford scholar (former president of the Oxford Union) and Donald Trump, billionaire, would not fall into the category of people that we would normally consider uncouth. Johnson deliberately cultivates his bumbling persona. Alexander Boris Johnson is no clown.



Everywhere, such sneering has helped to widen the gap between liberal elites and the masses who feel belittled and patronised. In Britain, where Brexit voters have been painted as reactionaries and ignorant, the polarisation has simply become further entrenched. 



New Zealand has its own version of this arrogance, and it’s often seen on the left of politics, especially in more affluent and educated circles. The Greens have come to epitomise this phenomenon as a liberal and middle-class party.  
It’s no surprise that the party thought it was very smart to produce a video mocking Simon Bridges – not only for his allegedly backward views on climate change – but for his broad accent. And it was apt that the video was made for Twitter – a platform well known for its liberal sneering political discourse.  
Of course, the video actually fell flat and even Green Party supporters thought it went too far, leading to it being deleted and Green leaders giving some half-hearted apologies. 



  
But even last weekend, in the midst of the Green Party conference, James Shaw continued the sneering, with his comment stating “I would never empower someone with as little personal integrity as Simon Bridges to become Prime Minister”. That is yet another particularly nasty attack on an elected member of the house, by a Green Party MP who has never been elected, but sees himself as vastly superior to Bridges because he believes in the great climate change myth.



As did the Democrats in the USA in 2016… as do Labour in the UK towards those who voted for Brexit.



It isn’t just the Greens though. The attack on Simon Bridges might be the worst example so far, but don’t forget the sneering mantra “Nine years of neglect” to a government that had to deal with the GFC, two Christchurch earthquakes and then the Kaikoura earthquake in their time in government. You could forgive them if a few things did get overlooked, but they did far better than this government so far, with their ability to only talk about doing things rather than actually do them. Don’t forget David Parker’s comment to Judith Collins about her ‘sleeping in a crypt’ either. Labour can sneer just as well as the rest of them.



The thing is that sneering doesn’t work. Seeing themselves as having the moral high ground will probably cost the Greens some of their support. After all, you only have to think of Hilary Clinton’s ‘deplorables’ comment to realise how sneering can alienate voters. Some of those ‘deplorables’ might have been considering voting for Hilary until she showed her true colours. The moral high ground can be a lonely place, as so many liberal elites are now finding out.



Let’s just hope that the Greens find that out too, next year.

"**Nicola Sturgeon has defended her government's handling of the pandemic as statistics show Scotland's Covid death rate rose higher than England's in recent weeks.**
Figures show there were 50.5 deaths per million in Scotland in the week to 15 November, compared to 40.6 in England.
The first minister said it was too soon to be comparing statistics while ""still in the teeth of a pandemic"".
She told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show the death toll was unacceptable.
""I have done everything and will continue to do everything I can to try and control the virus to try and keep it as low as possible, to take the tough decisions that have to be taken in order to achieve that and to try to take people of Scotland along in these difficult steps with me as far as I possibly can,"" she said.
""But nobody underestimates the pain, the grief, the suffering that this global pandemic has brought to us.""
While the weekly statistics show that Scotland's death rate has been above England's in the last four weeks, Scotland's overall death rate is lower than England and Wales.
UK government statistics show that Scotland's Covid death rate is 94 per 100,000, compared to England's at 101.5 and Wales at 102.4. Northern Ireland's death rate is 63.4 per 100,000.
The interview came after the SNP leader told her party's virtual conference on Saturday that she had ""never been so certain"" that Scotland would become independent.
On Sunday the conference backed a plan to pressure the UK government into holding another referendum on the issue - and to explore alternative legal routes if it refuses.
Douglas Ross, the leader of Scottish Conservatives, said the SNP's record was ""clear for all to see"" but Ms Sturgeon's priority was ""dragging Scotland through another divisive referendum"".
Scotland's death toll surpassed 5,000 earlier this month and the latest National Records of Scotland figures now show 5,380 people have died with the virus in Scotland.
The statistics agency records the number of death certificates that mention the virus.
In England, using the same measure, more than 57,000 people have died with the virus.
Challenged on the death rate in Scotland, Ms Sturgeon said that, over the course of the whole pandemic, it has been ""quite significantly lower"" than England and Wales, though it was higher than that of Northern Ireland.
""But across the whole of the UK, across much of Europe, far more people have died from this virus than any of us feel comfortable with,"" she added.
The SNP leader was also asked about care home deaths after a University of Stirling report found that 47% of Scotland's Covid deaths in the first wave were in care homes, compared to 30% in England.
""If you look at excess deaths overall in care homes across the UK, excess deaths in Scotland have actually been lower than in England but a higher proportion of these excess deaths have been attributed to Covid,"" she said.
""So in England more of the excess deaths have been attributed to other things, and certainly not to Covid. That simplistic view that the care home death toll is worse in Scotland perhaps doesn't bear that scrutiny.
""The death toll is unacceptable in Scotland, England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and across much of Europe.""
The Scottish government has introduced five levels of restrictions in a bid to suppress the spread of the virus during the second wave.
People in 11 local authorities are currently living under the strictest limits of level four, with restrictions on travel, hospitality and non-essential shopping.
Later a Scottish government spokesman said weekly statistics did not accurately portray trends across the whole pandemic and ""can be misleading if looked at in isolation"".
""Deaths from Covid-19 in Scotland have been significantly lower over the course of the pandemic than England and Wales, with over 7% few deaths per 100,000 than England.""
Reacting to the interview, the Scottish Conservatives' Douglas Ross said the SNP's record was ""clear to see"".
""Scandalous number of care home deaths, education tumbling down the international league tables and withholding vital advice from the Salmond inquiry. Nicola Sturgeon's priority? Dragging Scotland through another divisive referendum,"" he said on Twitter.
Meanwhile Willie Rennie, leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrat, said Ms Sturgeon was ""good at presentation but has repeatedly fallen short on delivery.""
He said she ""talks a good game"" but she ""did not use the summer well to to prepare for the second wave of the virus in the autumn"".
Labour MP Ian Murray said Ms Sturgeon should be held to account for her ""failings in office"".
""Amid a child poverty crisis, care homes scandal and utter contempt for Holyrood, the first minister's record is one of broken promises to the people of Scotland,"" he added.
""Her only priority is to divide Scotland at a time when we need to bring people together for a period of healing and recovery."""

Share this...FacebookTwitterNow that global temperatures have not risen in 15 years, a number of scientists find themselves having great difficulty coming to terms with that new reality.

The Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI-M) claims that the latest prognoses confirm the model forecasts. Photo source: Max Planck Gesellschaft
The Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI-M) in Hamburg is no exception. For years the institute insisted that the man-made climate catastrophe was real and happening now. Today it finds itself scrambling for a backdoor. “Otto et al” is that back door.
The MPI-M recently issued a press release with interesting revelations about the now famous “Otto et al” paper, to which its two directors contributed.
When we read the MPI-M press release, we quickly discover that this Otto et al paper is actually just the latest in speculative crystal-ballwork – the results have little value other than to provide a desperately needed face-saving opportunity for accepting a lower CO2 climate sensitivity.
The problem that climate science is having today is that it finds itself clashing with the fundamental rule of science itself. Richard Feynman once said on how science works:
1. Guess
2. Compute consequences
3. Compare to actual observations
If it disagrees with experiment, it’s wrong. That simple statement is the key to science. It doesn’t make a difference how beautiful your guess is. It doesn’t make difference how smart you are, the person who made the guess, or what his name is. If it disagrees with experiment, then it’s wrong. That’s all there is to it.”
Today we know that warming has stopped, and so that means the computed climate consequences are in disagreement with the observations, thus showing that the MPI-M’s earlier “guess” is wrong. Do they accept that today?
No. The MPI-M refuses to admit that “the guess” is wrong. What it does instead that it redefines the scientific approach used in the Otto et al study and in its press release. For the MPI-M the new rule of science is:
1. Guess
2. Compute consequences (with computers)
3. Compare to other newly computed consequences
And you keep computing new consequences until you get agreement! This is what the 2 scientists at the Max Plank Institute together with the team of scientists led by Otto have done, and nothing more.
The MPI starts its press release by telling readers not to be fooled by the warming pause (my emphasis):



<!--
google_ad_client = ""ca-pub-3545577860068042"";
/* neu test */
google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";
google_ad_width = 200;
google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




Global warming continues to baffle climate scientists, but one thing is sure: Over the next decades the average mean temperature on Earth will increase, even if the increase in the years from 2001 – 2010 was much slower than the decade before. This is backed up by prognoses from an international team of scientists led by scientists at the University of Oxford, of which both directors Jochem Marotzke and Björn Stevens of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology were a part. Using the current climate data, the scientists have newly calculated how much the air and Earth’s surface will have warmed up as soon as the CO2 concentration in the air doubles.”
And later in the press release (my emphasis):
Jochem Marotzke is part of a team of the world’s most renowned climate scientists who have taken the most recent development of the surface temperature into account in order to forecast how the Earth will heat up from the greenhouse effect, foremost from carbon dioxide (CO2). These prognoses confirm that the climate models correctly forecast global warming trend over multiple decades, that is until the middle or the end of the 21st century. There is no wise reason for calling off the alarm.”
This is pure quackery. At the MPI, prognoses confirm forecasts?
MPI-M postpones warming, will take hundreds of years
The MPI press release also says that we are going to have to wait a lot longer than we first thought for the real warming to hit:
Because the climate has a very high thermal inertia and the oceans warm up only very slowly, it’s going to take some time before the effects of the greenhouse gases completely take hold. A warming from the greenhouse effect will be amplified by numerous feedbacks, and weakened by a few processes. Only when this complicated interaction quiets down will the climate come to a stable condition. This long-term reaction by the climate is called equilibrium climate sensitivity (ESC) and is calculated by climate scientists. It is the final temperature increase that comes from a doubling of CO2  concentration, and will probably occur first after a few hundred years.”
Remember that this press release was written by two scientists, Marotzke and Stevens, who participated directly on the Otto et al study.
So we are going to have to wait decades, maybe even centuries before the real warming hits. That’s what Otto et al says, they tell us. There aren’t any observations to check if that forecast is reliable, but the MPI-M says they have a new forecast, it agrees with the models, and so the theory is correct.
The press release adds:
Using these values, the scientists calculate with 90% certainty that the near-surface atmosphere will warm 0.9°C – 2.0°C with at doubling of CO2 content; most probable is a temperature increase of 1.3°C.”
They used the 90% certainty claim in the past, and wound up totally wrong. Now they are claiming it once again, based on computer prognoses, and not on observations. This is the SOP of charlatans, and not scientists.
There’s more in the press release, especially with respect uncertainty. Basically they are saying that the “90% certainty” is fraught with lots of uncertainty. More tomorrow.

Saint Greta of Thunberg is splashing the headlines for getting an all-expenses-paid jaunt with daddy across the Atlantic on a very flash, very fast yacht. I wouldn’t mind that experience either. But St Greta is stacking up brownie points by the dozen with this exercise in virtue signalling. It is all so “zero carbon”. 



Team Malizia, skippered by Pierre Casiraghi and Boris Herrmann have **the great honour and pleasure** to sail Greta Thunberg from the UK to New York for the UN Climate Action Summit on Malizia II. The journey will start in mid-August. Greta accepted the offer to sail with Team Malizia as **Malizia is a zero-carbon mode of transport** to reach the USA. […]



[…] The sailboat is outfitted with solar panels and underwater turbines to allow for a **zero-carbon** , trans-Atlantic voyage.



Greta is taking a sabbatical year from school, and aims to attend a number of events during her time in North America, meeting with people most impacted by the climate and ecological emergency, climate activists, and decision-makers. […]



Greta doesn’t fly because of the tremendous amount of emissions caused by air travel – emissions that are strongly amplified due to the fact that they are released high-up in the atmosphere. She will therefore choose the least carbon-intensive modes of transportation throughout her travels across the Americas.



After months of research and considering different options for her journey, Greta will sail across the Atlantic in a **zero-carbon** racing boat called Malizia II, a foiling sailboat built in 2015, which is fitted with solar panels and underwater turbines to generate electricity on board the vessel. Greta will be joined on board the boat by her father Svante Thunberg and filmmaker Nathan Grossman of **B-Reel** Films, who will document the journey.



  
 **B-Reel** films! What a laugh.



From the image above of Malizia II, you can clearly see that the yacht was hand azed from a single trunk of an ancient tree. Oops, no, trees have carbon so we can’t use wood for our zero carbon means of Atlantic transport.



No, this fine piece of nautical engineering was fabricated by [Multiplast](https://www.multiplast.eu/en/the-company.html). Their name gives a clue and their website lays it out quite clearly



Since 1981, Multiplast has been designing and manufacturing multihulls and monohulls in high tech **composite materials** with unparalleled performance (Atlantic records, the Jules Verne Trophy, Route de Rhum, the Volvo Ocean Race…)



Multiplast has rapidly forged a reputation, becoming the world leader in performance boat construction as well as in the use of **high performance composite materials,** allowing it to work with world renowned naval architects.



  
Yes, the yacht is built from carbon fibre materials. The website proudly states that Multiplast recycle raw materials (pre-preg polypropylene film, cardboard, acetone…) 



Oh dear, polypropylene comes from the petrochemical industry, cardboard is carbon based, acetone is an organic compound because carbon atoms are present in acetone’s chemical formula. It consists of three carbon atoms, six hydrogen atoms, and one oxygen atom.



Not doing so well in the zero carbon stakes are we?



All these composite materials are heated in ovens to cure, these ovens require energy. The entire production factory is air-conditioned.



Its 5,300 m2 is divided into four 50x30m air conditioned hangars, with controlled temperature and humidity levels (21°C ±3oC, humidity <65%). 



To provide that amount of precise air-conditioning requires a heap of energy.



There is not a chance that the fine vessel Malizia II could exist in a zero-carbon world.



And we haven’t even started on the sails, sheets and rigging.



A ‘zero carbon’ trip across the Atlantic my astern.

Ow, that’s gotta hurt. CA’s 2006 Global Warming law – denied.

Federal judge blocks California low-carbon fuels rule
Chico Enterprise Record
FRESNO — A federal judge moved today to block California from enforcing its first-in-the-nation mandate for cleaner, low-carbon fuels, saying the rules favor biofuels produced in the state.

The lawsuit challenging the state regulations, which were adopted as part of the state’s landmark 2006 global warming law, was filed in federal court last year by a coalition including the National Petrochemical & Refiners Association and the Consumer Energy Alliance.
Fresno-based U.S. District Court Judge Lawrence O’Neill’s written ruling Thursday said the low-carbon fuel rules violated the U.S. Constitution’s commerce clause by discriminating against crude oil and biofuels producers located outside California.
Out-of-state fuels producers hailed the decision as a win for California drivers.

According to the American Federation for Children, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Rep. Todd Rokita (R-IN) have reintroduced “the Educational Opportunities Act, which would create an individual and corporate tax credit for donations that pay for scholarships for students to attend a private school of their parents’ choice.”   
  
  
It is encouraging to see growing support for scholarship tax credit school choice programs, which have been found to simultaneously boost achievement for students who switch to private schools, do the same for students who remain in public schools, and save taxpayers millions of dollars every year–a win‐​win‐​win scenario. Nevertheless, it is ill advised to pursue such a program (or other school choice programs) at the federal level.   
  
  
Years ago I summarized those problems when President George W. Bush advocated creating a federal school voucher program. Such programs are not only beyond the mandate accorded to Congress by the Constitution, they bear the risk of suffocating private schools nationwide with a raft of new regulation, defeating their very purpose of increasing the range of educational options available to families with limited means.   
  
  
In the past few years I have visited Sweden and Chile and studied their federal school chioce programs. Both confirm my earlier worries about national programs. Chile’s entrepreneurial voucher schools grew rapidly at first, but with a recent change of government hostile to the program they have sensed the new climate and stopped expanding.The new government is trying to enact regulations to diminish the scope and freedom of private schooling in Chile.   
  
  
Meanwhile, something similar is happening in Sweden. Among other things, the government has mandated that all schools hire graduates of government‐​certified teacher training programs, despite the well known fact that those programs are currently attracting the lowest‐​achieving college students.   
  
  
National school choice programs have proven to be a prime case of “staff car legislating.” The legislators who enact them are not always the ones in the official staff cars, making the rules. New lawmakers with different preferences ultimately come to power and can wreak havok on a nation’s entire K-12 education sector.   
  
  
This problem can be minimized by leaving school choice legislation to the state level, where the Constitution rightfully leaves it. We thus have a “laboratory of federalism”–a variety of different policies across states that make it easier to determine how best to design such programs.

"If ever a crisis proved that our fates are bound together, it has been the last six weeks. The state has asked many businesses to stand idle to save lives, firms have turned to the state as their guarantor of survival and workers have risked their lives for us all. When we have faced our toughest test for decades as a nation, it has been essential to pull together. Yet we are only at the beginning of the need to recognise the mutual dependence between public and private sectors and our collective solidarity.  The effects of this pandemic are arbitrary and catastrophic and no business or worker should have to face them alone. This spirit must carry us through not just the continuing “rescue” part of the emergency but into recovery and renewal to build a different economy. The chancellor says he cannot “save every business”, but that should not hide the fact that every business that goes bust because of necessary public health measures represents not just a failure of that business but risks deepening the recession — and impeding recovery. The lesson of past crises is that at the time governments believe that the danger is doing too much, too quickly – but the bigger danger is that they do too little, too slowly. Doing everything we can to protect businesses and workers makes sense for the taxpayer because the fiscal cost of lost businesses, unemployed workers and lost tax revenue outweighs the cost of acting. That is why, for example, Labour has led the argument for reform of the government’s loan system to make it work not just for 25,000 SMEs out of nearly six million as it has so far, but for many, many more. It is good that change is now coming. We have also argued for and welcomed the furlough scheme, though there remain significant gaps for some of the self-employed. This week the government will start to provide a sense of our likely emergence from lockdown. There will be sectors that cannot reopen for months. Take the hospitality sector, with over three million jobs. Twenty-five thousand outlets, including pubs and restaurants, are missing out on the targeted grants to cover their costs.  Thousands of businesses face an existential threat, with risks to hundreds of thousands of workers. Essential public health measures must be accompanied by economic help. The government must act urgently with a second wave of support, including where necessary an extension of the furlough scheme — with greater flexibility to enable part-time working — and it must look again at the gaps in current schemes. There are also parts of our economy which warrant particular attention. One lesson from this crisis is that our domestic manufacturing base matters far more than has previously been acknowledged. This is an issue of national and economic security, and the government should be willing to step in on the right terms. Yet just as our mutual dependence means the state owes responsibilities to support the private sector, so those who get state support owe obligations to the taxpayer. If you’re registered in a tax haven and you want support, you should come onshore. If you’re a multinational and plan to pay dividends to shareholders while claiming government resources, you clearly don’t need them.  The public should look back on the support it has given business over this period with pride. That also means ensuring the gains from public support accrue to all of us, and not just the losses. The government should be willing to consider an equity stake in firms — particularly when there is a compelling economic or environmental rationale.  The need for public and private to work together with imagination will also be essential as we seek to emerge from what could be the deepest recession for 300 years. During this crisis we have seen thousands of workers redeployed from sectors that have closed. Let’s learn the lesson of what is possible. We know that the climate emergency is a challenge we can simply no longer afford to ignore. Let’s create an army of zero carbon workers, retraining and redeploying those who can’t work into different industries, from home insulation to wind turbine manufacture to tree planting. We also cannot ignore the deep lessons of this crisis about the world of work, including about the role of unions. It is the lowest-paid workers whom we have relied on. We need a new bargain tackling powerlessness and insecurity.  In these testing times and beyond, the spirit of common endeavour we have seen in the first phase of this crisis must animate what we do. Together state, business and workers must share the risks and burdens we face. Even out of this emergency, we can and must build a better tomorrow.

American liberals once worshipped at the feet of Lady Justice. During the 1960s, the heyday of the progressive Warren Court, jurists became the tip of the left‐​wing spear. If the public refused to accept the latest progressive nostrum, no worries. Judges would simply impose whatever utopian scheme was in fashion.



All in the name of everything that was good and right, of course. Liberals denied they were distorting the Constitution. They believed that if you checked the penumbras and emanations, as well as interstices and permutations, you could discover hidden meanings that had escaped decades, even centuries, of previous policymakers and judges.



And there was no hidebound commitment to antediluvian precedent. Indeed, for 60s lefties, precedent was an attractive target. Sometimes deservedly: In _Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka_ , a unanimous Supreme Court overturned the wretched _Plessy v. Ferguson_ , the 1896 decision that enshrined “separate but equal,” legitimizing segregation. Decades of practical experience had made clear that separate was anything but equal.



It goes out the window whenever conservatives start influencing the judiciary.



During that era, no one on the left talked about “super precedents” that could never, ever be reconsidered, the way progressives reverently speak of _Roe v. Wade_ today. In those days liberals believed, amazingly, that _bad decisions should be reversed_.



After all, what is the use of treating the high court as a continuing constitutional convention if judges can’t change existing law? It would take all the fun out of being a judicial activist. In fact, a serious commitment to the Constitution requires judges willing to act to enforce limits on state power. For instance, the Fourth Amendment protection against “unreasonable searches and seizures” means nothing if jurists don’t tell the police no. The true test of progressive jurisprudence, however, is torturing the Constitution to confess to what it was never meant to mean.



When conservatives responded to government by judiciary with proposals to limit judges’ jurisdiction, impeach errant jurists, pass constitutional amendments, and more, the Left was horrified. Liberals insisted that judicial independence was the foundation of American liberties. The Founders believed jurists were a bulwark against majoritarian abuses and were bound to enforce the Bill of Rights.



Indeed, progressives could even quote Alexander Hamilton in Federalist No. 78: “The independence of the judges is equally requisite to guard the Constitution and the rights of individuals.” The Left asked how right‐​leaning activists, who talked incessantly about freedom, could ignore the Constitution’s framers and plot to tear down the very legal order that undergirded American government.



But that was then; this is now.



Who would have imagined that Republicans might elect a president? And might also control the Senate? And then — shock! — appoint conservative judges? Now jurists cannot be counted on to promote the progressive revolution. Worse, the Supreme Court, and increasingly district and circuit courts, are prepared to roll back government overreaching even when Democrats enjoy a legislative majority or control of the regulatory process.



For years, Republicans had only indifferent success in reversing the courts’ leftward swing. The inexorable liberal advance benefited from some truly awful GOP appointments: William Brennan, Harry Blackmun, John Paul Stevens, and David Souter. Warren Burger and Anthony Kennedy weren’t quite as bad but did significant harm along the way. The Burger Court was less left‐​wing and activist than the Warren Court. And the Rehnquist Court was a bit less left‐​wing in turn. But the Left continued to win plenty of big decisions. The best that could be said was that jurists more often acted as guardians of past activism than promoters of future activism.



But those halcyon liberal years finally are over. President Donald Trump and the Republican Senate formed a powerful partnership and launched a concerted campaign to add jurists who backed a broadly originalist jurisprudence. Judges differed in detail, but the consistent objective was to apply the understanding of the law as it was meant to be, not the fantasy of the law as some wished it to be.



Now the Left has decided that such judges are, well, essentially part of a vast right‐​wing conspiracy. The supposed progressive political majority is prepared to roll, yet these unelected relics of a Constitution written by dead white males are refusing to assist the revolutionary wannabes. Worse, _Trump appointees_ are able to review legislation and regulations, insisting that they conform to legal and constitutional standards. Emma Janger of the People’s Parity Project complained that progressive presidential “attempts to make needed change will simply be blocked by the courts.”



Whoever imagined such a world?? Judges influence policy? _Conservative_ judges influence policy? Do good and decent Americans — excluding the deplorables and their ilk, of course — understand what this means? AlterNet’s Jake Johnson reported, “Progressive advocacy groups and legal experts have warned that these right‐​wing judges will have the power to shape U.S. law on climate, reproductive rights, and other major areas for decades to come.” Shocking! It is not as if liberal judges ever “shaped” policy in these areas. Anyway, this is the 21st century! How can today’s America be so retrograde, anachronistic, even atavistic to allow Republican appointees a say in such vital matters?



This has set off a left‐​wing campaign to eliminate judicial independence. Nothing complicated. Progressive activists just want to seize control of the judiciary by means fair or foul and turn judges into submissive accomplices in ever‐​expanding state power. As Jeffrey Lord observed in _The American Spectator_, “The Left has decided that the judicial branch is to be used as a second, unelected legislative branch to enforce its political choices of the moment.”



The moderate left‐​wing position is to concoct some scheme to ensure “balance” on the high court. Of course, that never was a concern on the left when liberal activists predominated in the judiciary. But such a proposal, if implemented honestly, might diminish political warfare over the courts. Indeed, the best idea, advanced by analysts across the political spectrum, is term limits, which would affect both sides equally.



True progressives, however, have made no pretense of desiring balance. Many advocated formally packing the high court, à la Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Then even Roosevelt’s fellow Democrats balked at destroying the judiciary’s role as a separate branch, costing the president political capital and moral authority. But the Left today hopes the new Democrats won’t let constitutional qualms get in the way of brute politics.



The idea is simple: expand the body’s size and add as many new judges as necessary to ensure a revolutionary outcome. Of course, Republicans could repay the favor if they regained control — which would spur yet another Democratic enlargement. But no problem. Heck, if the court is going to decide policy as if it was a robed legislature, then why not make it as big as a traditional legislature? Even some of the Democratic presidential contenders criticized the idea. So did Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who made the obvious point that doing so would make the judiciary look partisan.



Alas, from the Left’s standpoint, there is no guarantee that the Democrats will win the presidency and Senate. Which means truth, justice, and all that is good and right in the universe might not be done after all. And even if the progressive legal equivalent of the Second Coming occurs, what of the meantime? The right‐​wing horsemen of the judicial apocalypse will ride, committing legal mayhem.



Enter Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). Commenting on a recent abortion case, he declared: “I want to tell you, Gorsuch. I want to tell you, Kavanaugh. You have released the whirlwind, and you will pay the price. You won’t know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions.”



Schumer’s threat was presumably political rather than physical. A prosecution for obstruction of justice seems an overreach. His comments, however, certainly constituted an attack on judicial independence. Yet he was defended by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.). The latter denounced criticism by Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, who, said Whitehouse, was “the architect of an 80‐​case barrage of partisan, 5–4 decisions for big Republican donor interests.” It would be interesting to go back to the 1960s and count how many decisions the Warren Court delivered for Democratic interest groups.



Whitehouse also complained of Sen. Mitch “McConnell’s effort to pack the Court.” As in filling vacant judgeships? How many Republican jurists did presidents Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter, Lyndon Johnson, and John F. Kennedy appoint? Whitehouse is not upset at GOP court‐​packing, which has not occurred. Rather, he is angry that Republicans are making appointments, and doing so more efficiently than Democrats did in the past.



Imagine if President Richard Nixon called a press conference while the Supreme Court was deliberating over _Roe v. Wade._ Imagine if Nixon, concerned that a majority of justices appeared to have fallen under the influence of the body’s far‐​left flank, declared, “I want to warn you, Blackmun. I want to warn you, Brennan. You are sowing the wind, you risk reaping the whirlwind. You will pay the price. You won’t know what hit you if you go forward with this awful decision.”



He would have been immediately denounced not only by Democrats but also by Republicans. And rightly so.



Even though the threat against the constitutional order then was real, _Roe_ was not constitutional law. Indeed, it was written as a legislative enactment, creating a trimester system for abortions that had not the slightest connection to constitutional or legal principles. As such, the opinion was the epitome of a legislative compromise. And it was widely recognized as such. In the fall of 1976, less than four years after the decision, my liberal constitutional law professor explained that while he would have voted for such an outcome, he could not justify the justices’ legal reasoning.



Nevertheless, jurists are granted lifetime appointments to ensure their independence, freeing them to rule against legislators and presidents. That is frustrating, irritating, even maddening when one ends up on the losing side of a case. But such insulation is essential to the constitutional system of limited government and individual liberty.



After _Roe_ , conservatives complained about lack of judicial accountability, often in terms similar to those used by the Left today. But none, at least that I remember, ominously threatened that errant jurists would “pay the price” and not “know what hit” them. The question was how to overturn the decision, not how to cow the justices.



Progressives appear to feel no such limitation. After all, the Left is not interested in sharing the judiciary. Imagine a legal Brezhnev Doctrine: what’s mine is mine and what’s yours is negotiable. Most judges usually were Democrats, though an occasional appointment might be allowed Republicans. Just never enough to make a meaningful difference.



Having found that it now has to share not just the judiciary but also control of the judiciary, the Left wants to change the rules. Brian Fallon of Demand Justice said, “Democrats cannot sit back and accept the status quo of a partisan Republican five‐​seat majority for the next 30 years.” After all, Democrats enjoyed at least loose control for 30 years. Yet progressives now act as if they only just noticed that unelected judges interfere with democratic decisions. Who knew?! So jurists must be pushed aside, marginalized, and placed under legislative control.



Schumer has inadvertently provided what could be called a “teachable moment.” Republicans should note how Democrats once defended judicial independence and how the Founders realized that the judicial branch should balance the executive and legislative branches. No political party or partisan movement is entitled to make the judiciary its own. Yet Democrats now are acting in ways that would never be accepted for Republicans. Schumer and his colleagues should be called to account.



Indeed, the GOP should seize the opportunity to encourage bipartisan reform. If neither side likes absolute, life‐​time independence, there are alternatives. One possibility would be easing requirements for amending the Constitution. Getting a two‐​thirds vote of Congress and three‐​quarters vote of state legislators or calling a constitutional convention is difficult, perhaps too difficult. This encourages frustrated activists to turn to judges to make changes. Simplifying the procedure might help move constitutional amendments back to normal politics.Another measure would be set limited terms for federal judges. The details don’t matter too much. Terms could be medium or long. Jurists might be eligible for reappointment. The essential point would be to end lifetime immunity while preserving legal independence. Terms also would provide for rotation, spreading out appointments. Nominations for a set term rather than for a lifetime would reduce the two parties’ stakes, lessening pressure to turn confirmation battles into political Armageddon.



Equally important, neither measure would bias judicial outcomes while addressing legitimate issues. In essence, such an approach would ensure that the judiciary is shared equitably rather than turned into a weapon for one side or the other.



Ultimately, politicians should stop asking judges to make policy decisions. Cases should be about law rather than politics. Otherwise depoliticizing the judges’ role is merely second best. Whatever is done, however, should leave the judiciary as an independent branch, free — indeed, duty‐​bound — to check the executive and legislature. Protecting Americans’ liberties requires no less.

Overseas, Jacinda is still seen as some kind of Madonna… one who bore a child, donned a hijab and hugged a few people… but no one seems to understand that this is all pretty basic stuff. Anyone can do that. Jacinda is naturally empathetic, but that does not make her a great leader, any more than Greta Thunberg’s belief that she can see carbon dioxide makes her a climate change expert. Darling Greta needs to go back to school, and darling Jacinda needs to focus on the job we all pay her very handsomely for.



Mike Hosking is onto it.



The rumours are rife that our Prime Minister is actually in the country this week and looking to attend to domestic matters – and she’s got a bit on her plate.



And because Jacinda Ardern’s plate is getting more and more full, what you are seeing increasingly is the sad reality that a reputation has been formed, and is starting to cement in place. That is of a leader that isn’t exactly hands-on, across the brief, decisive, or omnipresent.



This is a Government that’s drifting.



What did anyone expect from a prime minister who openly stated that she didn’t want the job, and who is clearly totally out of her depth now that she is in it?



The “part-time Prime Minister”, who loves nothing more than to talk, consult, yak, discuss, whiteboard, or blue sky anything but actually make a decision is now facing a real issue with the public. Her personal popularity is significantly down, the gloss is wearing thin, if not off.



Some things she might like to actually address:



The Ihum&amacrtao land occupation she’s insisted on involving herself in, despite her saying over and over it’s got nothing to do with government. 



• The public housing crisis. Numbers last week setting another record.  
• DHB debt, as of last week it has [blown out to hundreds of millions](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12255017).  
• Oranga Tamariki [baby snatching allegations](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12254170) and her department under siege.  
• Last week’s confidence surveys numbers. Still falling, [business at decade-long lows](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12246059).  
• The JobSeeker benefit numbers two weeks back. Once again at record numbers.  
• Where is the KiwiBuild reset?  
• Where is the [National Cancer Agency they promised](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12255527) and yet were beaten to by National last week? 



Yep. All fair comment. Today, with her proposed Abortion Bill, she is more interested in killing Kiwis than saving their lives.



Two years in, why is so little actually being done? And given that, isn’t three out of four weeks overseas **(having told me she is well aware people don’t like her being out of the country hence she**[ **didn’t do a thing about D-Day**](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12238853) **)** isn’t it just about time a few things get ticked off? 



I wish I could answer that, Mike, but I think having a completely incompetent government would probably cover it, coupled with a completely incompetent prime minister who is clearly totally out of her depth. Oops… am I being ‘disrespectful’ here?



Reputations are hard won, but easily damaged. She’s damaging hers, she only has so much goodwill. She only has so much fairy dust.



And with a year to a general election, increasing numbers of voters will start to tune in, pay attention, and expect results. Results get votes, so she might want to actually look at a few things in the in-tray.



Well Mike, I think the hashtag _#parttimePM_ has gained some traction. You referred to it, and now it is becoming mainstream. No prime minister in recent decades has been accused of anything like it.



Jacinda might be a superhero overseas, but back home, we are starting to see through the facade. But then again, as we all know… fairy dust has a very limited shelf life, and Jacinda has nothing else to offer and I think she knows it. That is why she tries very hard to never be here.

By S. Fred Singer
Gallia omnia est divisa in partes tres.  This phrase from Julius Gaius Caesar about the division of Gaul nicely illustrates the universe of climate scientists — also divided into three parts.  On the one side are the “warmistas,” with fixed views about apocalyptic man-made global warming; at the other extreme are the “deniers.”  Somewhere in the middle are climate skeptics.
In principle, every true scientist must be a skeptic.  That’s how we’re trained; we question experiments, and we question theories.  We try to repeat or independently derive what we read in publications — just to make sure that no mistakes have been made.
In my view, warmistas and deniers are very similar in some respects — at least their extremists are.  
They have fixed ideas about climate, its change, and its cause.  They both ignore “inconvenient truths” and select data and facts that support their preconceived views.  Many of them are also quite intolerant and unwilling to discuss or debate these views — and quite willing to think the worst of their opponents.
Of course, these three categories do not have sharp boundaries; there are gradations.  For example, many skeptics go along with the general conclusion of the warmistas but simply claim that the human contribution is not as large as indicated by climate models.  But at the same time, they join with deniers in opposing drastic efforts to mitigate greenhouse (GH) gas emissions.
I am going to resist the temptation to name names.  But everyone working in the field knows who is a warmista, skeptic, or denier.  The warmistas, generally speaking, populate the U.N.’s IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) and subscribe to its conclusion that most of the temperature increase of the last century is due to carbon-dioxide emissions produced by the use of fossil fuels.  At any rate, this is the conclusion of the most recent IPCC report, the fourth in a series, published in 2007.  Since I am an Expert Reviewer of IPCC, I’ve had an opportunity to review part of the 5th Assessment Report, due in 2013.  Without revealing deep secrets, I can say that the AR5 uses essentially the same argument and evidence as AR4 — so let me discuss this “evidence” in some detail.

"**Shops in England will be allowed to stay open for 24 hours a day in the run-up to Christmas and in January, the housing secretary has said.**
Local authorities will be able to temporarily waive the rules restricting retail opening hours.
Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Robert Jenrick said the relaxation of the rules would allow shopping to be ""more pleasant and safer"".
Shopkeepers and councils would decide how long stores stay open, he added.
Primark has become one of the first to say that it will take advantage of the new rules.
The clothing retailer plans to open 11 of its stores for 24 hours when they are allowed to begin trading again once England's lockdown is lifted on Wednesday.
Months of restrictions to curb the spread of coronavirus have hit the High Street hard, and the hope is the relaxation of opening hours will boost business.
The new rules would run from Monday to Saturday.
""None of us, I suspect, enjoys navigating the crowds, and none would relish that when social distancing is so important to controlling the virus,"" Mr Jenrick wrote.
""These changes mean your local shops can open longer, ensuring more pleasant and safer shopping, with less pressure on public transport.""
Mr Jenrick urged local councils to offer retailers ""the greatest possible flexibility"" when determining trading hours. Shops and supermarkets would also be given more leeway over stock delivery times he said, to keep the roads clearer during the day.
The British Retail Consortium (BRC) welcomed the move. ""With just over three weeks until Christmas, shoppers will welcome the additional opportunities to shop that the government's statement supports,"" BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said.
She encouraged Christmas shoppers not to leave it until the last minute and to avoid peak times.
But Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of UK Hospitality, described the relaxing of rules for retail as ""arbitrary and unfair"".
""You are reopening broad swathes of the economy with next to no restrictions in the middle of what is still set out by the government to be a really significant pandemic,"" she told the BBC.
""The government has chosen hospitality as the primary tool for controlling transmission with very limited evidence."" She is calling for more support for hospitality venues after a study showed that nine out of 10 businesses in the sector were unviable under current restrictions.
But the government hopes the new rules will provide a much-needed boost for bricks-and-mortar retail, after many shops were forced to close during lockdown. That pushed shoppers online, exacerbating a trend which was already putting pressure on some High Street chains.
Sir Philip Green's retail empire Arcadia, which includes Topshop, Burton and Dorothy Perkins, is likely to enter administration within the next 24 hours, putting 13,000 jobs at risk.
Arcadia is far from the only recent casualty in the retail sector - although it could be the biggest.
Earlier this month, fashion chains Peacocks and Jaeger were placed into administration after owner Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group failed to find a buyer.
Thousands of retailing jobs have also been lost at other businesses. Sainsbury's announced recently that it was cutting 3,500 jobs with the closure of 420 Argos outlets and all meat, fish and deli counters.
In August, M&S announced it was set to cut 7,000 jobs over three months."

One positive outcome of the recession, as the states struggle to find revenue to spend, is that state subsidies to businesses are facing increased scrutiny.   
  
This week the _New York Times_ reported that states are looking at reducing or ending programs that hand out taxpayer money to television and movie producers. In Pennsylvania, some last-minute handouts from outgoing governor Ed Rendell are under fire, including a $10 million state grant to rehabilitate a former Sony plant for new tenants. According to the Commonwealth Foundation’s Nate Benefield, this is the _fourth_ time Pennsylvania taxpayers have subsidized the site: 



Sony moved out in 2007, despite getting more than $40 million in corporate welfare under Gov. Robert P. Casey to come to Pennsylvania, then another $1 million grant under Rendell to stay in the state—a mere two years before shutting down its plant.   
  
Before Sony, the site was occupied by Volkswagen, which got $70 million in state aid in the 1970s under Gov. Milton Shapp. This was touted as a great success -- until Volkswagen moved out in 1987, after 10 years of operation.   
  
Pennsylvania is merely renting jobs with this “economic development” spending, burdening other businesses with higher taxes. Hopefully, Gov. Tom Corbett can learn from the failed policies of the past and work on improving the state's economic climate rather than trying to pick winners.



New Pennsylvania governor Tom Corbett could learn a lesson from the Indiana Economic Development Corporation, which received another black eye this week. I’ve written previously on problems with the IEDC, which is the state’s corporate welfare arm. As a former budget official with the State of Indiana, I can attest that the IEDC’s string of embarrassments is as unsurprising as it is appalling.   
  
On Tuesday, investigative report Bob Segall of WTHR-TV in Indianapolis released the latest in a series of reports on the IEDC’s exaggerated job creation claims. (Intrepid journalists take note: Bob and his team just received a prestigious Alfred I. duPont–Columbia University Award for their investigatory work on the IEDC.)   
  
Bob took the findings of a recent audit and ascertained that Indiana governor Mitch Daniels and the IEDC haven’t been giving Hoosiers the full story.   
  
From the report: 



The “Summary of Incentive Program Review” prepared by audit firm Crowe Horwath examined 597 job-creation projects outlined in IEDC annual reports from 2005 to 2009. The projects were listed as ""Indiana Economic Successes"" that would bring new jobs to Indiana.   
  
According to the report, those projects were expected to create 44,208 jobs by late 2010 and, based on the most recent information available to auditors, have so far resulted in 37,640 actual jobs — a realization rate of 85%.   
  
But the state's job realization rate is actually much lower than 85%, according to additional data reviewed by WTHR.   
  
The numbers cited above are based solely on data for ""reporting companies,"" and they do not include job data for 200 other projects also listed as ""Indiana Economic Successes"" in IEDC annual reports. Including those projects, as well, the number of newly-created jobs the agency had anticipated to materialize by the end of 2010 is 57,088 (not 44,208), according to the report. Using that figure, IEDC's job realization rate is 66%.   
  
And nowhere does the audit report mention the 98,683 total new job commitments announced by IEDC from 2005 to 2009. Using that number — which IEDC and the governor have repeatedly promoted in their press releases, speeches and annual reports – the audit data suggests, so far, only 38% of jobs announced by IEDC have resulted in actual jobs. While that percentage is expected to increase in coming years (some of the companies are not expected to fulfill all of their job commitments for several more years), the overall numbers show IEDC's real job realization statistics are much lower than the agency portrays to the public by citing far more limited data.



Two words in this selection from the report stand out: “press releases.” My observations of the IEDC from within the Daniels administration led me to coin the phrase “press release economics” to describe what Indiana government officials were really practicing.   
  
Programs that hand out taxpayer money to businesses to lure or retain jobs are popular with state politicians, and Governor Daniels is no different. Better policies, like cutting business taxes across the board, require a willingness to expend substantial political capital without an immediate payoff. (I recently read that Daniels would sign a cut in the state’s high corporate tax rate if a proposal in the state legislature makes it to his desk. Daniels had turned down the idea of cutting the corporate rate while I was there, so the change of heart is curious but nonetheless welcome.)   
  
Targeted business subsidies, on the other hand, are cheaper and generate immediate, favorable press. Unfortunately, this form of central planning is unsound as it merely transfers economic resources from taxpayers – including businesses – to businesses favored by government officials. And because government officials are inherently inferior to the market when it comes to directing economic activity, the results are far from ideal – and often downright counterproductive.

"Before the pandemic struck, Sara Blazey made the same three-hour commute to work, three days a week, for the better part of 12 years. The 63-year-old family lawyer from the Blue Mountains works for a domestic violence legal advice hotline in Parramatta and it used to be that she would wake at 7am, drive seven minutes to Hazelbrook station and from there catch the 7.17am train to Parramatta before making the same one-and-a-half hour trip home in the evening. With the pandemic, all that would change. Domestic violence support services such as the one Blazey worked for were declared “essential” services, meaning they could keep operating despite restrictions. To ensure they could do so safely, the organisation did what some commentators long thought impossible and began to transition its employees into working from home.  “There were a couple of us older ones in the office who said it all sounds too hard, really,” Blazey says. “And then we were reluctant to work from home. My home is my home. I don’t particularly want to do my work from there.” As the country went through a collective tech upgrade, millions of workers like Blazey retreated from office blocks and entire cities emptied out. It was a pattern that would be replicated worldwide. Streets devoid of cars and pavements free of people were so haunting that photographs of cities including New York, Paris and Sydney were shared across social media. Within Australia, the scale of this change was captured in data obtained by the Grattan Institute. Anonymised geolocation data gathered from people’s mobile phones showed how crowds in central business districts along the east coast had thinned by half even before the Australian government announced stage-one restrictions on social movement. By mid-April they would be nearly deserted. Crowding in the Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane CBDs had fallen to a fifth or less, while crowding around suburban train stations had fallen to a 10th. Those like Blazey might have regained an extra three hours in their day but, as society begins to reopen, the question now is whether the embrace of working from home sticks. Should it become permanent, it may drive a radical change in the way governments think about how we drive, fly, commute and ride in the post-pandemic world. Already transport is taking centre stage. In mid-April Labor’s transport spokeswoman, Catherine King, called for the construction of a high-speed rail line to be built between Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne as a brace against a looming recession. King billed the idea – which has been around since the 1980s – as a “game changer” for regions along its route. “High-speed rail has the potential to revolutionise interstate travel, allowing travel between capital cities in as little as three hours,” King said. As an idea, the thought was as much about the past as it was the future. A century ago, when economies were transport-driven, everything depended on the ability to move people around. Ever since, planes, trains and cars have played an outsized role in the imagination, especially for policymakers looking for “shovel-ready” projects. Marion Terrill of the Grattan Institute says this romance may prove costly today. Having studied proposals for high-speed rail, she says that if the country were to lock itself into such a project, it would be 22 years before the first leg was complete and it would be 39 years – if not longer – before the country saw any reduction in carbon emissions. “The thing about fast rail is it plays to our dreams,” Terrill says. “We love fast rail. It’s something people respond to emotionally. It’s all things to all people: it’s going to create jobs, take the pressure off cities, help regions, or serve as stimulus.” “When we looked at it, most of the benefits go to business travellers going between Sydney, Melbourne or Brisbane.” Terrill says this applies not only to future projects, but extends to existing ones which should now come under review. With no vaccine expected for at least 18 months – if ever – it is possible social distancing regulations may remain even as restrictions on social movement are lifted. With lower capacities and lower populations expected, it may no longer be possible to justify many existing projects, including the $18.6bn WestConnex underground roadway and a second airport for Sydney. These decisions may raise questions about the future of mass transit itself, especially among austerity-minded governments concerned about their debt burdens. Faced with renewed mistrust of public spaces and social distancing requirements, public transport systems must now be retrofitted to reduce touchable surfaces and capacity. Doing so carries a cost beyond the financial. The risk, says Prof Kim Dovey, the chair of architecture and urban design at Melbourne University, is that the lowering capacity will make public transport unviable when what’s needed is a massive expansion. “The virus is really an attack on cities, in many ways,” Dovey says. “One of its biggest effects is it stops cities from functioning effectively. It stops people from coming together and interacting. This, in my view, is what makes cities work. “If people want to stay two metres apart from each other into the future, that will kill cities.” Thought of in this way, Covid-19 is the sociological equivalent of a distributed denial of service attack – where a swarm of computers repeatedly attempt to access the same system all at once, eventually overloading it with demand. If at the start of the pandemic the main concern was the ability of health systems to cope, now the worry is that secondary systems like transport will buckle. The consequences are profound. If density and walkability combine to make cities vibrant places to live, public transport is the sinew that makes it possible. Cars may have dominated cities over the last century but in the last decade patronage of public transport has slowly grown once more. Should this trend be broken, Dovey says, the result would be “tragic”. “Reducing public transport to 30% will kill cities,” he says. “We really need to go the other way.” These concerns go beyond trains, trams and buses to the “microspatiality” of cities and efforts to green them. The more room provided for cars, the less there is for footpaths. Lifts in high-rises built to handle eight to 10 people become unworkable when they are limited to one or two. “Right now a lot of people will avoid public transport for a while, which means they’ll get in their cars,” Dovey says. “And that will produce demand for more roads, as it always does. “People still believe building roads can ease congestion but that is not true. All it does is stimulate demand for cars. This is going to set back major moves for cities that have been going on for a long time, particularly in trying to claw back space for usage from cars.” In January 2019 the Australian car fleet numbered 19.5m, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. With millions now out of work or working from home, many of these vehicles have remained off the road. What comes next depends on what happens when restrictions are eased and those people go back to work – particularly as global oil prices remain low. The cause was simple enough. As whole national economies were put on ice at the start of the pandemic, the world’s oil producers kept pumping even as demand fell off a cliff. When they ran out of storage the mismatch between supply and demand grew so chronic oil producers in Russia found it easier to burn their excess, marking a disaster for efforts to combat climate change. “Oil fields are not like wine bottles, where you can put in a cork and return to it later,” Jeff Colgan says. “Shutting an oil field down can damage it, which reduces or even eliminates the field’s future production.” Colgan is the Richard Holbrooke associate professor of political science at Brown University and expert on the global oil industry, who says low fuel prices will last for some time. “Nothing lasts forever in the oil business but low oil prices are probably here to stay for at least the rest of the year and perhaps much longer,” he says. “Even when consumer demand increases after lockdowns end, there is an awful lot of inventory build-up that will keep prices from rising too quickly.” Against this global backdrop, Australia – which boasts the highest sulphur content fuel in the OECD and rising road transport emissions – finds itself caught between two competing futures. On the one hand, persistent low oil prices will make petrol cars cheaper to run, frustrating any attempt to encourage the uptake of electric vehicles as part of a transition to a zero-carbon economy. The alternative scenario is exemplified by China. When Australia’s largest trading partner lifted restrictions and moved to reopen its factories early this month, its people stayed home. Should this pattern be repeated the world over, the cumulative fall in demand would destabilise oil-producing economies, while making it harder to decarbonise transport at home. Some like John Quiggin lean more to this second scenario. While he acknowledges incentives created in the post-pandemic world may lead to less public transport and more cars on the road, the University of Queensland economist says “most forces are going the other way”. If historically the opposition to working from home by business was a meta-conversation about their ability to trust their workforce, the focus could shift to basic costs as social distancing regulations remain and the capacity of a working office falls. “Offices are going to be under pressure to keep a lot of space and the very low-cost way of doing that is to give people a choice about whether they come in or not,” Quiggin says. “Meanwhile, electric vehicles are improving all the time. Their take-up comes with anything that pauses the growth of the car fleet which gives EVs a chance.” What is true for the average employee will also be true for the boardroom. Even if Australia has avoided the worst of the virus, other countries have not. Many will remain in a state of lockdown for some time, forcing individual countries or regions to become more self-reliant. Freight may continue to move across borders into the future but people will not. Anyone looking to travel for business faces the prospect of a mandatory five- to 14-day quarantine each time a border is crossed. In the end, it will be easier – and cheaper – to do deals by video conference. The same could also be said for Australia’s tourism, education and aviation sectors. Education-related travel services and personal travel services respectively ranked as Australia’s fourth and fifth largest exports in 2018-19. After the pandemic, tour operators, universities and airlines will no longer be able to rely on a steady stream of international travellers and students – a reality that is already forcing a restructure. Since Quiggin became among the first to publicly call time on the airlines in late March, Virgin Australia has fallen into administration. Early on the government described Qantas and Virgin as “too essential to fail”, but it has so for allowed the weaker of the two companies to collapse. What happens next, Quiggin says, should be watched carefully. “What happens to the airlines will be a signal for what it plans for the rest of the country,” Quiggin says. “There are three possibilities. One is [Virgin] will bounce back in the way the government hopes. One is it won’t bounce back and they’ll let it fall in a heap. The third is they’ll have to intervene or maybe they’ll be forced to do things they currently do not want to do.” It is this that underlines the significance of the moment. In deciding the minutiae of how Australians get around, the country’s political leadership finds itself with enormous power to reshape society. Should they reach into the past to direct the future, the result could be a missed opportunity at best, or a grim new reality. Some projects, after all, lend themselves to the moment. Fixing the national broadband network – a $36bn international embarrassment – may eliminate the daily commute for millions while providing stimulus. The most radical may be even more simple. “One of the advantages is that right now the streets are empty of cars and we’re going to need more pedestrian space if we’re going to continue social distancing,” Dovey says. “We should be out there turning streets into walkways. “All you need is a bit of authority and paint on the road. We could do a lot of good for cities if we had the nerve and the ideas.”"

State and federal governments face a daunting fiscal outlook. The national debt stands at 60 percent of GDP, its highest level since World War II. Under current projections this ratio will rise to more than 75 percent of GDP by 2020 and continue increasing thereafter. States are also facing severe budget shortfalls.



Politicians and the public express concern about the debt, but standard proposals for expenditure cuts or tax increases garner little support. Understandably, therefore, some politicians, commentators, interest groups, and citizens have embraced unconventional approaches to closing fiscal gaps, such as legalizing drugs.



Legalization would reduce state and federal deficits by eliminating expenditure on prohibition enforcement — arrests, prosecutions, and incarceration — and by allowing governments to collect tax revenue on legalized sales.



This potential fiscal windfall is of particular interest because California, which is facing a budget shortfall of $19.9 billion for fiscal 2011, will vote Nov. 2 on a ballot initiative that would legalize marijuana under California law. Advocates of the measure have suggested the state could raise billions in annual tax revenue, in addition to saving criminal‐​justice expenditure or reallocating this expenditure to more important priorities. Should the California measure pass and generate the forecasted budgetary savings, other states would likely follow suit.





[T]he budgetary implications of legalization are neither trivial nor overwhelming.



In our recent study, just released by the Cato Institute, we estimate the impact of legalization on federal, state, and local budgets. The report concludes that drug legalization would reduce government expenditure about $41.3 billion annually. Roughly $25.7 billion of this savings would accrue to state and local governments, and roughly $15.6 billion to the federal government. About $8.7 billion of the savings would result from legalization of marijuana, $20 billion from legalization of cocaine and heroin, and $12.6 billion from legalization of all other drugs.



Legalization would also generate tax revenue of roughly $46.7 billion annually if drugs were taxed at rates comparable to those on alcohol and tobacco. About $8.7 billion of this revenue would result from legalization of marijuana, $32.6 billion from legalization of cocaine and heroin, and $5.5 billion from legalization of all other drugs.



These estimates should be taken with several large grains of salt. The markets for illegal drugs are opaque, and different approaches to estimating either the size of this market or the effect of legalization can therefore vary substantially. Further complicating matters, different approaches make different implicit or explicit assumptions about exactly what policy change is under consideration, such as whether legalization applies nationwide, under both federal and state law (the scenario we consider), or in just one state, just for marijuana, and just under state law (the California experiment). Our estimates are in the middle of available numbers.



The fact that legalization would generate a fiscal dividend does not, by itself, make it a better policy than prohibition. Legalization would have many effects, and opinions differ on whether these are desirable on net. Both sides in this debate, however, should want to know the order of magnitude of the fiscal benefit that might arise from legalization.



Our results imply that the budgetary implications of legalization are neither trivial nor overwhelming. Legalization will not solve America’s fiscal woes; the budget effects are small in comparison with current deficits. Yet the budgetary benefits are more than mere rounding error; for those with mixed feelings about prohibition vs. legalization, these benefits might be a deciding factor.



Several specific aspects of our estimates bear comment.



Roughly half the budgetary savings comes from reduced criminal‐​justice expenditure on drug prohibition. For this component of the effect to show up in government budgets, policymakers would have to lay off police, prosecutors, prison guards, and the like. Such a move would be politically painful, so it might not occur. Reduced expenditure on enforcing prohibition can still be beneficial if those criminal‐​justice resources are redeployed to better uses, but that outcome is not easy to achieve.



Only about $17.4 billion in budgetary improvement can be expected to come from legalizing marijuana in isolation. Yet the current political climate gives no indication that legalization of other drugs is likely in the short term. So the budgetary impact from the politically possible component of legalization — marijuana — seems modest.



None of these considerations weakens the broader case against drug prohibition, which has always rested on the crime, corruption, and curtailment of freedom and civil liberties that are the side effects of attempting to fight drug use with police officers and prisons. What our estimates do provide are two additional reasons to end drug prohibition: reduced expenditure on law enforcement, and an increase in tax revenue from legalized sales.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe last few days German meteorologists and media have been falling all over themselves in forecasting a possible ALL-TIME record high to hit Germany today. The current all-time high is 40.2°C set in 2003.
Well, it’s now 3 pm and so let’s look how close we are getting to setting that new, all-time record high…if we haven’t already!
Where I live, the temperature is 24°C. Doesn’t look like the all-time record high is going to be set here today.
So let’s look further east, where the blowtorch heat is really supposed to hit.
In Hannover it’s 27°C.
In Berlin it’s 33°C.

In Regensburg it’s 34°C.
Hmmm…what’s going on? So far nothing that is even remotely close to the 40.2°C all-time record high. Maybe this website here will help us find that new all-time record high we supposed to see today.
Here we see that the top temperature right now in Germany is 34.9°C in Konstanz. That’s more than 5°C below the all-time high we were supposed to reach today! Maybe I just need to be patient and wait an hour or so. Maybe the thermometer in Konstanz will jump a whole 5.3°C.
Clearly what we have just witnessed here is Germany’s forecasting debacle of the year, if not the decade. How come the forecasts, which were as recent as yesterday, were so far off? We’re not talking about being off by 1 or 2°C, but 5°C!
I’m going to write a longer commentary on this tomorrow. What we’ve had is an all-time record hyped temperature. Hysteria sweeps across Germany’s institutions again.

McKitrick & Michaels Were Right: More Evidence of Spurious Warming in the IPCC Surface Temperature Dataset
Guest post by Roy W. Spencer, Ph. D.
The supposed gold standard in surface temperature data is that produced by Univ. of East Anglia, the so-called CRUTem3 dataset. There has always been a lingering suspicion among skeptics that some portion of this IPCC official temperature record contains some level of residual spurious warming due to the urban heat island effect. Several published papers over the years have supported that suspicion.
The Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect is familiar to most people: towns and cities are typically warmer than surrounding rural areas due to the replacement of natural vegetation with manmade structures. If that effect increases over time at thermometer sites, there will be a spurious warming component to regional or global temperature trends computed from the data.
Here I will show based upon unadjusted International Surface Hourly (ISH) data archived at NCDC that the warming trend over the Northern Hemisphere, where virtually all of the thermometer data exist, is a function of population density at the thermometer site.

Depending upon how low in population density one extends the results, the level of spurious warming in the CRUTem3 dataset ranges from 14% to 30% when 3 population density classes are considered, and even 60% with 5 population classes.
DATA & METHOD
Analysis of the raw station data is not for the faint of heart. For the period 1973 through 2011, there are hundreds of thousands of data files in the NCDC ISH archive, each file representing one station of data from one year. The data volume is many gigabytes.
From these files I computed daily average temperatures at each station which had records extending back at least to 1973, the year of a large increase in the number of global stations included in the ISH database. The daily average temperature was computed from the 4 standard synoptic times (00, 06, 12, 18 UTC) which are the most commonly reported times from stations around the world.
At least 20 days of complete data were required for a monthly average temperature to be computed, and the 1973-2011 period of record had to be at least 80% complete for a station to be included in the analysis.
I then stratified the stations based upon the 2000 census population density at each station; the population dataset I used has a spatial resolution of 1 km.
I then accepted all 5×5 deg lat/lon grid boxes (the same ones that Phil Jones uses in constructing the CRUTem3 dataset) which had all of the following present: a CRUTem3 temperature, and at least 1 station from each of 3 population classes, with class boundaries at 0, 15, 500, and 30,000 persons per sq. km.
By requiring all three population classes to be present for grids to be used in the analysis, we get the best ‘apples-to-apples’ comparison between stations of different population densities. The downside is that there is less geographic coverage than that provided in the Jones dataset, since relatively few grids meet such a requirement.
But the intent here is not to get a best estimate of temperature trends for the 1973-2011 period; it is instead to get an estimate of the level of spurious warming in the CRUTem3 dataset. The resulting number of 5×5 deg grids with stations from all three population classes averaged around 100 per month during 1973 through 2011.
RESULTS
The results are shown in the following figure, which indicates that the lower the population density surrounding a temperature station, the lower the average linear warming trend for the 1973-2011 period. Note that the CRUTem3 trend is a little higher than simply averaging all of the accepted ISH stations together, but not as high as when only the highest population stations were used.

The CRUTem3 and lowest population density temperature anomaly time series which go into computing these trends are shown in the next plot, along with polynomial fits to the data:

Again, the above plot is not meant to necessarily be estimates for the entire Northern Hemispheric land area, but only those 5×5 deg grids where there are temperature reporting stations representing all three population classes.
The difference between these two temperature traces is shown next:

From this last plot, we see in recent years there appears to be a growing bias in the CRUTem3 temperatures versus the temperatures from the lowest population class.
The CRUTem3 temperature linear trend is about 15% warmer than the lowest population class temperature trend. But if we extrapolate the results in the first plot above to near-zero population density (0.1 persons per sq. km), we get a 30% overestimate of temperature trends from CRUTem3.
If I increase the number of population classes from 3 to 5, the CRUTem3 trend is overestimated by 60% at 0.1 persons per sq. km, but the number of grids which have stations representing all 5 population classes averages only 10 to 15 per month, instead of 100 per month. So, I suspect those results are less reliable.
I find the above results to be quite compelling evidence for what Anthony Watts, Pat Michaels, Ross McKitrick, et al., have been emphasizing for years: that poor thermometer siting has likely led to spurious warming trends, which has then inflated the official IPCC estimates of warming. These results are roughly consistent with the McKitrick and Michaels (2007) study which suggested as much as 50% of the reported surface warming since 1980 could be spurious.
I would love to write this work up and submit it for publication, but I am growing weary of the IPCC gatekeepers killing my papers; the more damaging any conclusions are to the IPCC narrative, the less likely they are to be published. That’s the world we live in.
UPDATE: I’ve appended the results for the U.S. only, which shows evidence that CRUTem3 has overstated U.S. warming trends during 1973-2011 by at least 50%.
I’ve computed results for just the United States, and these are a little more specific. The ISH stations were once again stratified by local population density. Temperature trends were computed for each station individually, and the upper and lower 5% trend ‘outliers’ in each of the 3 population classes were excluded from the analysis. For each population class, I also computed the ‘official’ CRUTem3 trends, and averaged those just like I averaged the ISH station data.
The results in the following plot show that for the 87 stations in the lowest population class, the average CRUTem3 temperature trend was 57% warmer than the trend computed from the ISH station data.

These are apples-to-apples comparisons…for each station trend included in the averaging for each population class, a corresponding, nearest-neighbor CRUTem3 trend was also included in the averaging for that population class.
How can one explain such results, other than to conclude that there is spurious warming in the CRUTem3 dataset? I already see in the comments, below, that there are a few attempts to divert attention from this central issue. I would like to hear an alternative explanation for such results.

"After months of deliberation and consultations, the UK government’s long-awaited announcement about a plastic bag charge arrives, only for Defra to shoot it full of holes by opting to exempt retailers with fewer than 250 employees from the 5p charge.  This decision, which would mean tens of thousands of shops will continue to give out single-use plastic bags when the levy comes into effect in 2015, flies in the face of any logic. It has earned the government widespread condemnation, from those in parliament, from environmentalists, and even those stakeholders who would nominally gain from the move, such as the 33,000 members of the Association of Convenience Stores. Research has substantially demonstrated that plastic bags are harmful to the environment. Lightweight bags are carried by winds to litter roadsides, trees, and streets throughout urban and rural landscapes. The thin plastic breaks down in the environment into tiny pieces that lead to the deaths of birds and marine life.  And it has also been shown without doubt that the billions of single-use plastic bags used each year – eight billion in 2012 in England alone – are produced at great cost. It is estimated that the amount of energy needed to make 12 single-use bags could power a car for a mile. Plastics and chemicals related to their manufacture have been linked to human health concerns too.  In our research published in the Journal of Business Ethics, we found that a joined up effort from the government, supermarkets and individuals was the way to bridge the behaviour-attitude gap that seems to persist in the world of consumers. Consumers like to think they are ethical but when pressed as to whether they owned or used a “bag for life” when out shopping, a significant number of them said they owned them, but would forgot to bring them with them.  A decision to levy a universal charge on for all bags in all shops would bring a swift end to such forgetfulness. This is not conjecture – it is exactly what has happened in Wales, Northern Ireland, and in the Irish Republic where there has been a very significant fall in the use of single-use bags. The levy in Ireland saw a drop of 85% within weeks after introduction in 2002, Wales saw a 76% decrease within a year of introduction of a levy in 2011, and in Northern Ireland a decrease of 80% within the first four months.  The environment minister for Northern Ireland Mark Durkan has commended the people of the province and encouraged them to keep up the momentum.  Momentum – that is exactly the reason why we need all shops to be included in this levy. If there is confusion as to which shops will charge and which won’t, if there are loopholes excusing certain shops and not others, then this effort towards curbing pollution, energy use, and saving the environment will be severely curtailed. Already Defra says  the reduction of use may be as low as 60%. That is not good enough. Not when even the Americans are getting on board, with levies or bans proposed or enacted in 132 US cities, from Los Angeles to Chicago to Washington DC. We can do better, and we should."

"**There has been confusion after police asked beach-goers at Helen's Bay to leave the area on Sunday, citing Covid-19 regulations.**
Swimmers were using the popular County Down spot when officers arrived and asked them to disperse.
One man had been finishing a ""mile a day"" swimming challenge raising money for charity.
No fines were issued by police officers but they said they would ""not shy away from enforcement when it is necessary"".
Police said that they believed a large number of people had gathered to watch the charity swimming event.
However, a local businessman who was swimming at the beach said he was ""absolutely baffled"" by the police's approach.
Gareth Murphy told BBC News NI: ""I felt a huge level of frustration that we could have been in Ikea or Tesco but we were on the beach taking part in the sport which we love and we had to deal with that afterwards.
""More or less everyone left the beach. I just find it incredibly sad that the public resources of the police are being used to close down beaches for no reason.""
Mr Murphy said after he came out of the sea and was getting changed he was approached by six police officers.
He said he had seen them from the water walking ""systematically, approaching groups and threatening them with Â£200 fines"".
""I pointed out we could be at Ikea or Tesco. They said: 'This is an organised event'. We pointed out this is not, this is people taking part in something healthy.""
Cathy Martin, who lives in Helen's Bay, said she took a walk down to the beach with her children and dog. She told the Stephen Nolan Show it was busy, but that a lot of people there were residents.
She said she was then told by police officers that she would have to leave the beach as well.
""They basically came with the attitude that everyone was there for an organised event,"" she said.
""They're under a lot of pressure, they're under-resourced and they have a lot to cover, and I do respect that they have to respond to every complaint and I do respect that there probably was a complaint from residents about a lot of cars there or a lot of people there.
""But Helen's Bay is a big enough beach to hold 200 people, it doesn't justify them coming to break it up.""
In a statement the PSNI said: ""Our approach has been that we will engage, explain and encourage members of the community to comply with the Health Protection Regulations.
""The vast majority of our community are complying with the restrictions, which we all recognise, are asking people to restrict their personal and professional lives in a way none of us would ever have thought possible.
""While enforcement is our last resort, we have not, and will not, shy away from enforcement when it is necessary."""

Jim River, AK closed in on the all time record coldest temperature of -80°F set in 1971, which is not only the Alaska all-time record, but the record for the entire United States. Unfortunately, it seems the battery died in the weather station just at the critical moment.
Image from hamweather.com
While the continental USA has a mild winter and has set a number of high temperature records in the last week and pundits ponder whether they will be blaming the dreaded “global warming” for those temperatures, Alaska and Canada have been suffering through some of the coldest temperatures on record during the last week.
For example in  Circle Hot Springs, AK on Sunday, 29 Jan 2012 the HIGH temperature was a blistering -49°F, breaking the  -44°F record which has stood since 1917. It gets better. 
That same day in Circle Hot Springs the low temperature was  -58°F   breaking the old record of  -52°F set  in 1941 by six degrees.
Here’s a list of temperature records in Alaska from the past week:


Brrr!
While all that was happening, the weather station in Jim River, AK closed in on the all time record coldest temperature of -80°F set in 1971. That’s not only the Alaska all-time record, but the record for the entire United States. Unfortunately, the weather station stopped reporting at -79°F.

Note at 18:49 on 1/28/12 it stopped reporting all data except barometric pressure.
Some background on the equipment tells us the likely cause.
The station is the venerable Vantage Pro2 by Davis Instruments, arguably one of the best weather stations available to consumers. I have deployed several myself and put them online, for example here and here. They are hardy, accurate, and well constructed, being manufactured in the USA in Hayward, CA instead of some Chinese gadget mill. They also have NIST traceability on sensors.

The Integrated Sensor Suite (ISS) communicates wirelessly with the console below, and the console has an optional PC and/or standalone Internet interface (for DSL/Cable modems) attached.

This station at weather station in Jim River, AK was recording temperatures in conditions way out of its design spec, it only goes to –40 F
From:  http://davisnet.com/product_documents/weather/manuals/07395-249_IM_06152.pdf

While they operate on solar power during the day, these units have an internal lithium battery for operation at night and through extended cloudy periods.
I suspect the internal CR123A Lithium 3 volt battery in the outside ISS died.  Note that on 2012-01-28 18:49:00 the data for barometric pressure is still reporting after temperature and other values die. At that temperature, the battery likely could not sustain enough voltage to keep the transmitter running.
The barometric pressure sensor is in the internal LCD console, inside the house/office where the unit is connected to the Internet. All other sensors are outside in the ISS.
The CR123A Lithium 3 volt battery specifications are:
3V 1400mAh Lithium BatteryWide operating temperature range: -40°C to 85°C

So it was operating way out of spec as well.
Some people have emailed me wondering about why the readings at  Jim River, AK stopped just shy of a new all time record. I don’t see any nefarious motive here, just simple equipment failure under extraordinary extreme conditions combined with Murphy’s Law.
Let’s hope the observer there has a backup thermometer, but who’d want to go outside in cold like that to read it?
h/t to Dr. Ryan Maue and Joe D’Aleo
BTW, if you want one of these splendid weather stations, you can get them here. Details here.
UPDATE: The NWS in Fairbanks moves quickly to disavow the temperature report. I suppose the Drudge link has the phones ringing off the hook. But here’s the interesting thing, the nearest other “official” station, PAPR at Prospect Creek Airport, AK only 0.9 miles away, is also offline.
Data Status
Over the last 28 days, no data was seen on the following dates: 2012-01-04 to 2012-01-16, 2012-01-18 to 2012-01-20, 2012-01-22 to 2012-01-29.
It would be interesting to see how they defend an official airport station failure.

RT/JL JAN 12
UPDATE2 1/31/2012 9:30AM PST
According to Gladstone and NCDC MMS, PAPR (Prospect Creek, just 0.9 mile from Jim River DOT station, and holder of the low temperature record from 1971) is an AWOS station, part of the “B” COOP network.
https://mi3.ncdc.noaa.gov/mi3qry/identityGrid.cfm?setCookie=1&fid=22862
Details on AWOS:
http://www.allweatherinc.com/aviation/awos_dom.html
and as I understand it, it is not rated to –80F, the specs for the thermistor say:
Ambient Temperature Sensor.
The sensor shall be thermally isolated in a
motor aspirated radiation shield to accurately measure air temperature.
A. Range. From –40C to +60C (-40 oF t o +140 oF)
B. Accuracy. ±0.3C.
C. Resolution. 1 oF.
Source: http://www.allweatherinc.com/pdf/awos_level_iii.pdf
So, given the official equipment there at Prospect Creek, it seems NOAA has either purposely or unintentionally created an impossibility of the Prospect Creek record of ever having been broken there again.

At WUWT, one thing we pride ourselves in is helping visitors learn about the issues and the science, even if those visitors should already know what these things mean. Take for example, Michael Tobis proprietor of “Only In it for the Gold” and “Planet3.0”, both heavily pro-warming sites. Readers may remember Mr. Tobis from his famous F-word Fusillade.
Mike came to WUWT to ask a simple question, and of course, we are always happy to help him out. 

Original comment asking to define “CAGW” here.
Honestly, I thought most everyone (especially the bloggers) in this debate knew this term, but apparently not. So, this post will make sure everyone does now.
CAGW is an abbreviation for Catastrophic Anthropogenic Global Warming
For more abbreviations, see our WUWT Glossary Page

"With no live sport to watch or play, exercise has never been more precious. Those minutes of freedom, an uncurling away from bad posture on the sofa, lifting the spirits and boosting the heart rate. But, as you slurp your morning lungfuls of air, have your noticed a change? Think the sky has looked a more perfect cornflower, noticed the stars shining a little brighter? You would be right on all three, the falling levels of air pollution a tiny silver lining to our dreadful predicament. Yet air pollution also has a more sinister role in the coronavirus story. Some preliminary studies in the US seem to suggest a link between a high death rate and high levels of pollution (a similar link was found during the Sars outbreak in 2003), with Covid-19 able to attach itself to particulate pollution. So improving air quality might be one of the ways out of this crisis, as well as helping the 4.2 million people who die annually from your bog‑standard air pollution. But where does sport fit in? We know athletes are particularly at risk from poor air quality because of their higher respiratory rates during exercise – children in particular. And around the world athletes have started to complain: Novak Djokovic, who criticised pollution levels in China; the New South Wales spinner Steve O’Keefe, who described the air quality during a Sheffield Shield game as fires burned outside Sydney as like “smoking 80 cigarettes a day”; the tennis player Dalila Jakupovic, who pulled out of her Australian Open game because she couldn’t breathe. Not only that, but pollution also seems to impede performance. A fascinating essay by Matthew Campelli in the Sustainability Report this week examines just that, revealing that early trials seem to show air pollution reducing the productivity rates of German footballers and impeding decision-making in chess players and baseball umpires. This dovetails alarmingly with the Hit for Six report published last September, which described the effects of extreme heat not only on cricketers’ ability to function physically but also their capacity, and umpires’ capacity, to make decisions. Throw in the bushfires in Australia last year which threatened the cricket season, the cancellation of matches in the path of a super typhoon during the Rugby World Cup in Japan, cricketers vomiting on the pitch because of air pollution in Delhi, cricket stadiums being destroyed by hurricanes in the West Indies, the ski season literally melting away and rising sea levels threatening coastal infrastructure, and the picture of sport in a climate emergency starts to look less than rosy. Add our current crisis, with normal sporting relations unlikely to restart any time soon, and sport is looking at an extremely complicated situation. Maybe the Premier League can restart in a couple of months, but what about European football? Players may get special passports which mean they avoid quarantine at airports, but what about away supporters? In Japan, meanwhile, nervous voices are already expressing doubt over the Tokyo Olympics mark two, pencilled in for the summer of 2021. An existential problem then, and one that coincides with an enforced period of contemplation. Much like the rest of the world, sport has the opportunity to hit the reset button. It is going to have to work within a smaller framework, with a much emptier purse, in a world where air travel is expensive, and perceived as dangerous to human health as well as the planet, as the earth grows ever warmer – with 2020 already set to be the hottest year yet. Some might argue that with no gate receipts, no bar takings and a fixture list with more holes than games, sport is in no place to be gazing at its environmental soul. But if not now, when? On Wednesday the sports sector held its own version of the Petersberg climate dialogue, a Zoom meeting organised by Basis (the British Association for Sustainable Sport) with the idea of bringing the sector together. The idea is to hold a similar meeting weekly for the foreseeable future, to try to hammer out a way for sport to move forward. Russell Seymour, chief executive of Basis, says: “This is not how we want to live our lives, locked down, insular. But this is the moment, the opportunity for sport to reflect and decide to rebuild its operations in a more environmentally sustainable way. After the economic crash in 2008 people said: ‘We clearly have to make a change, the current way we are living our lives isn’t working.’ Then global emissions jumped by 6% the following year. The current crisis has shown us that making changes can have a big impact and very quickly.” This is sport’s chance to evaluate properly its current plight – as some have already started to do. To embrace localism. Accept that less is more. Ask itself why. Why do the England cricket teams have to tour three countries in a winter? Why is the ICC planning to host T20 World Cups in consecutive years? Why on earth hold football’s European Championship across 12 host cities? Why must the Olympic Games move to a different city every four years? Why squeeze every drop out of athletes for maximum profit until they cannot cope and break down, both mentally or physically? Why not demand lower levels of pollution around sports grounds for the good of athletes and fans? Reset. Breathe. Who has time for sustainability now? Sport does. It has to."
"The escalating situation in Ukraine has focused the minds of Europe’s leaders on their countries’ energy needs and how to meet them. Energy security has quickly become a strategic priority for the EU, faced with the possibility of gas price rises. Political unease across Europe is understandable. Relations between Russia and Ukraine over gas supply have not been harmonious, with state-owned Russian energy firm Gazprom repeatedly threatening to cut off gas supplies to Ukraine because of unpaid debt.  President Putin has already warned Europe of gas shortages over Ukrainian debts. Cutting off Ukraine, and in doing so interrupting the supply to Western Europe, remains a powerful political tool should events escalate any further. Europe remains strongly import-dependent for energy, and Russia is hands down the largest exporter to EU member states, supplying 19.2% of coal, 24.5% of petroleum and 29.4% of natural gas. The promise of “additional and far-reaching” action from the US and Europe if Putin sends in troops to eastern Ukraine or further destabilises the region puts EU nations in danger of Russian economic retaliation. Gas supply would threaten economic recovery across Europe, and in colder regions could cost lives. Although little can be done in the short term to fix Europe’s import dependency, current events are certain to provoke a policy rethink. This is driven by three needs: to lower CO2 emissions, to keep energy costs competitive, and to maintain the security of energy supply. Together, they form a challenging triangle. Energy security itself requires a diverse supply to lessen the effects of price shocks or supply interruptions, reduced dependency on imports, and above all to keep the lights on, homes warm, and businesses running. Over-reliance on a single type of fuel, especially one sourced from volatile parts of the world, has already driven nations to try to reduce their dependency on imports. But the danger at present is that urgent steps to reduce dependency on Russian gas will be to the detriment of other energy policy priorities. An example knee-jerk reaction would be subsidising investment in new coal-fired power stations to reduce reliance on gas; such action would be a major blow against cost and carbon-reduction targets.  Even if carbon capture and storage emerges as a renewed priority for new coal plants, this solves the carbon issue at the expense of an even greater cost burden for consumers. And where would the coal come from, when Russian imports account for such a large percentage? Flexible gas power plants are viewed as the natural interim partner to the variable nature of energy generated from solar and wind – gas plants are low carbon (relative to coal), and open cycle machines can be started within minutes to meet demand when energy supply from solar and wind is insufficient (by comparison coal and nuclear cold starts can take days). For this reason EU energy policy has gravitated towards flexible gas in support of renewables, but the Ukraine situation highlights why this vision may be revisited.  Looked at another way, reducing Europe’s reliance on imported Russian gas could be viewed as a good thing for cost and decarbonisation in the long run. Doing so could reduce nations’ exposure to wholesale gas price volatility and provide strong leadership on developing domestic renewable energy. If we are to continue with the partnership of renewables backed by gas power stations then new suppliers will be needed. This points to an urgent need to quickly develop Europe’s domestic shale gas supplies, and its renewable energy resources. Power from wind, marine, solar, geothermal and biomass offer significant diversity of supply and geographic location.  Taken together they provide a supply of energy generation that is more stable and constant  than any single one alone. Ideally, they would be linked together with smartgrids, so that the windy north and sunny south of Europe can share each others’ natural resources in an interconnected EU power grid. In order to avoid going backwards and undoing the considerable progress in rolling out renewable energy generation across the continent, the EU will need to redouble its efforts to manage the problem of electricity supply variability from wind and solar – with energy storage and demand side response (altering demand to meet supply), as well as taking important steps to reduce energy demand through energy efficiency. The flashpoint of Ukraine presents a timely reminder of how much of our energy is geopolitically risky. Now is the opportunity for politicians to reassess priorities and fine-tune policies to balance cost, decarbonisation and energy security, in a world of political footballs where gas suppliers are hard to find, and even harder to keep."

Today I’m going off topic to write about an explosive issue – the NSA. Spiegel has uncovered and reported explosive material that for now is only being superficially reported back in the States. Obama, and the free world, have a mega-crisis on their hands.

Image source: US Government, NSA website.
In Europe, especially Germany, the NSA scandal is taking on ever increasingly huge dimensions with each passing day. While the American media are pretty much low-key or even silent on the NSA scandal, in Europe it is taking on alarming dimensions and threatening to become a foreign policy catastrophe.
News magazine Spiegel has received documents revealing that NSA activity also included bugging European offices, including the Chancellor of Germany. The AP writes:
A top German official accused the United States on Sunday of using “Cold War” methods against its allies, after a German magazine cited secret intelligence documents to claim that U.S. spies bugged European Union offices. Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger was responding to a report by German news weekly Der Spiegel, which claimed that the U.S. National Security Agency eavesdropped on EU offices in Washington, New York and Brussels.”
At its English language site, Spiegel reports that the full story will be released tomorrow.
Die Welt today writes:
What is illegal for authorities and intelligence services in Germany to do, is apparently done by the US intelligence: It allegedly has spied on the communication of millions of Germans.”
Spiegel writes at its German site that:
The US intelligence services, with approval by the White House, targetedly monitored the German Government, including the Chancellor.”
Die Welt also writes that the spying is clearly shown by “a paper from the NSA from September 2010…referencing secret documents that former US intelligence agency employee Edward Snowden took with him“.

Bild daily  writes:
The statistics that Spiegel had seen shows that on normal days up to 20 million telephone connections and up to 10 million internet data sets had been monitored. On Christmas Eve 2012 the Americans checked over and saved 13 million telephone connections and half as much data from internet connections.
On peak days, such as 7 January 2013, the intelligence agencies spied on about 60 million telephone connections. As a comparision, for France the Americans in the same time period recorded about two million connections.”
The Spiegel revelations are developing into a major and highly embarrassing scandal for Washington. While the news is spreading like a firestorm in a tinderbox in Germany, reports from US media have had their volume turned down to almost mute levels.
Spiegel, which broke the story yesterday, reports today that the German Justice Department has filed charges against “unknown perpetrators“. The German news magazine writes:
The espionage affair surrounding the American intelligence agency NSA has now reached the German Prosecutor’s Office. The authority based in Karlsruhe is responsible for investigating criminal acts against internal security and, according to SPIEGEL information, is checking to see whether violations of privacy laws have been committed during the systematic surveillance of German citizens. … The NSA scandal has now become a matter for the German Justice Department.”
Washington’s and London’s relationship with mainland Europe is now so damaged that they are being compared to the Cold War. This is not a foreign policy scandal, rather it is a foreign policy debacle of historical proportions.
In today’s report, Spiegel writes:
According to an internal statistic of the NSA, approximately 500 million communication connections are monitored. The NSA has ranked Germany as a target of attack.”
According to Spiegel, all this is based on “material whistleblower Edward Snowden collected“.
One can only speculate what information Spiegel has received. But so far everything points to the acquisition of huge trove of intelligence information. I suspect this is only the tip of the ice berg and we are going to be seeing a lot more from Spiegel in the days and weeks ahead. “Foreign policy debacle of historical proportions” may be an understatement.

"**A-levels and GCSEs in England are due to go ahead next summer, with the exam season starting three weeks later than usual.**
Plans for how to manage them in a pandemic are expected to be published later this week.
So what are the options for making exams fair when many teenagers have missed out on schooling due to the Covid-19 pandemic?
Socially distanced exams have already had a trial run with GCSE resits in further education colleges in England in November.
It was a big task, with colleges emptying out their buildings so they had enough space to set out for the exams.
While tens of thousands of students were resitting maths and English exams, the summer exams are taken by hundreds of thousands.
But the autumn retakes have shown that exams can happen in difficult circumstances, albeit on a much smaller scale.
By early summer it's also possible that rapid testing, of the kind being used at universities, could be targeted at any remaining areas of high transmission.
This is expected to happen.
In summer 2020, grades based largely on teacher assessment jumped up - 78.8% of GCSEs were grade 4 or above compared to 69.9% in 2019.
Top grades in A-levels went up too.
So will it be back down with a bump this year with exams? That would cause an outcry, because all students have missed out to different degrees.
The exams regulator Ofqual has already said the ""baleful"" impact of the pandemic on some students means it doesn't want to drive grades back down to pre-pandemic levels.
Giving schools some advance warning of which topics are coming up is already in place for some subjects - and that could increase.
Advance warning could be given of the main topics for exams, so schools can use the time between now and the exams to best prepare students.
There are different ways this could be done, from identifying texts to slightly narrowing down the content.
The scope of the exams has already been reduced in GCSE English literature, history and ancient history.
For example, a pupil would have to answer on a Shakespeare play and then two out of three optional areas in English literature papers.
The difficulty of extending this is it risks further increasing the advantage for teenagers who have faced little disruption due to Covid-19 since September.
But it would help schools focus their efforts over the next few months.
This is one of the suggestions backed by the Labour Party and has gained interest from some head teachers.
But it's an idea that's been sliding down the popularity scale.
It would mean putting more choice of questions on exam papers, so students could answer on what their school had managed to cover.
It's a form of optionality.
However, research has suggested that it can make exam papers more confusing to navigate, which ends up favouring the academically stronger pupils.
This is the biggest headache - hard to fix fairly and potentially politically tricky too.
Secondary school attendance has fallen dramatically to below 70% of pupils in some areas.
Parts of North West England have been badly affected, and some schools in Kent are feeling the impact now.
The Labour Party has called for regional adjustment of exam results.
That wouldn't take account of highly localised differences, with some schools - even within the same areas - being differently affected, and for that reason it is unlikely.
But there will be pressure to find a way of recognising the lost learning.
This is unlikely to be done officially, which could risk leaving students carrying a qualification into their future that marks them out as different.
Schools are likely to help students plead special circumstances so they can progress to college, apprenticeships or university.
Already two universities have said they will accept one grade lower in recognition of the disruption this year.
There could be more than one solution to the issue of students missing exams.
Every year some students miss exams because of illness, accidents or a family tragedy.
There is a process to deal with these ""special considerations"" which could be used for individual students.
It can involve using data from another paper in the same subject and teacher assessment.
But what if a bigger group of teenagers miss out on crucial exams?
A contingency series of exams at a slightly later date is likely, so that anyone who needs to go on to the next stage isn't held up waiting for autumn.
A-levels and GCSE exams in Wales have already been cancelled.
Nationals in Scotland have also been cancelled, but Highers and Advanced Highers will be taken, two weeks later than usual.
In Northern Ireland, GCSEs and A-levels will go ahead, but will start a week later than usual."

Jacinda Ardern got off on the wrong foot at Tuvalu, the theme this year is _“Securing our Future in the Pacific”_ which, as you will have guessed, is primarily about climate change and how much money will change hands to address it.



Ardern did not hold back from raising her colours at Tuvalu and insulting Scott Morrison to boot. 



**Prime Minister Scott Morrison is facing hard-hitting questions from New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern** as the leaders meet at the Pacific Islands Forum in Tuvalu. 



Ms Ardern has challenged the Prime Minister to explain Australia’s position on climate change with the subject taking centre stage at the regional conference, and **accusations Australia is not doing enough.** ”



  
Sky News reporters in Australia were quick to point to Ardern’s trolling of Scott Morrison, asking who she thought she was to throw her weight around when both countries have similar Kyoto targets.



They said the idea that **“Australia is somehow a climate sinner while NZ is a bunch of climate saints” does not stack up** ; and it is **“not helpful for Ardern to be splitting the Pacific nations when we should be working together to counter Chinese influence in our region** ”.



Aaah, yes, the Chinese. Sky News recollected Ardern walking away from media recently instead of answering the hard question about the Chinese in Hong Kong. 



“ **Jacinda Ardern always gets this sort of halo around her but then when you start to look more deeply at it, it doesn’t hold up.**



And just on the China thing, there has been a lot of concern around Chinese influence in NZ and in fact **Jacinda Ardern even walked out of one of her own press conferences some weeks ago when she was trying to be drawn on the Hong Kong demonstrators** and giving any support to their mission in Hong Kong.”



  
Ardern’s halo has slipped in Australia but she also came up short on climate change at Tuvalu.



“Ms Ardern said it’s very fitting to have a nation like Tuvalu hosting this year’s forum.



At the last Pacific Islands Forum climate change was a significant topic, in fact, **it was identified by the forum as the biggest threat facing the Pacific.**



So, to now hold a forum on an island where **climate change is not a theoretical proposition but is very much a reality** **and a visual reality I think will be quite pointed** ,” she said.”



  
Ardern is still pushing her political narrative but she is well out of date because scientists have moved on. **While sea levels at Tuvalu are rising the land area of Tuvalu has increased**. 



The tiny Pacific island nation of Tuvalu, thought to be under threat from sea level rise, **has actually expanded in land area over the past 40 years and is likely to continue to be habitable a century from now, scientists say.**



 **New research from the University of Auckland** published in Nature Communications mapped shoreline change of each of Tuvalu’s 101 islands across its nine atolls over a 40-year period. 



  
But why aren’t scientists concerned about Tuvalu’s rising sea levels?



“The **sea level at the Funafuti** tide gauge has risen at 3.9 mm per year, which is **approximately twice the global average**. 



Tuvalu **could** be one of the first nations to experience the effects of [sea level rise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level_rise). “



  
Tuvalu is not unique in that **all tides in the western Pacific are rising at double the expected rate** but the science is by no means settled on the reasons why.



“Measuring ongoing sea global level rise, which results from the global warming-induced melting of land ice and thermal expansion, **is a complicated business.**



This **comparatively small long-term rise** is often obscured because sea level can undergo large up-and-down fluctuations over seasonal, annual, and even decade-long time scales. 



**This is especially true in the case of the islands of the western Pacific where the ENSO cycles**[ **El Niño**](http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/tao/elnino/el-nino-story.html) **and**[ **La Niña**](http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/tao/elnino/la-nina-story.html) **result in** **sea level fluctuations up to 20-30 cms** , which is around 40-60 times larger than the long-term annual increase (5.1mm) found at Tuvalu. Quite obviously these fluctuations have to be accounted for in order to see the underlying long-term trend. 



The tide gauge and satellite altimatry data both have their own shortcomings, for example the tide gauges have long records, but some are plagued by data gaps, and monitoring equipment that has been updated over time. 



Also, tide gauges are fixed to the seafloor, which can either be sinking or rising dependent on the location (hence the use of co-located GPS equipment at some sites), so that has to be factored in to observations too.” 



  
Tuvalu disappearing underwater in the next decade does not line up with the latest science, but there are political mileage and good money to had from climate change so Ardern keeps the spin going – but not, I suspect, for the benefit of Tuvalu.

"Looking at the countryside now in the middle of summer, it is hard to believe that trees are under threat from an array of diseases and pests. Warm and wet conditions with plenty of sunshine have led to an verdant explosion of plant growth. After news of the spread of ash dieback across the UK many people may be surprised to see ash trees in Britain coming into leaf at all, but tree diseases are not necessarily as quick as media hyperbole might suggest. It can take years for a mature tree to succumb to disease, but once the pathogenic fungus, bacteria or virus takes hold then while the end may be slow, it’s also virtually inevitable. At the recent Cheltenham Science Festival, I was joined by three leading UK experts in tree disease: Professor Steve Woodward from the University of Aberdeen, Dr Ruth Mitchell from the James Hutton Institute and Dr Richard Buggs from Queen Mary University of London. Ash dieback was at the forefront of the audience’s concerns, with many reporting seemingly healthy ash trees in their back gardens.  Ash dieback is a suite of disease symptoms caused by a fungus, and trying to piece together the life cycle, history and ecology of this fungus has not been easy. As Steve Woodward explained: “What we now know is that the fungus causing ash dieback jumped species to infect European ash. It occurs naturally in a species of ash native to Asia where, like a similar fungus in European ash, it causes no problems. The global trade in trees and greater planting of ornamental and commercial species (ash counts as both) with little regard for quarantine probably helped bring these species together, allowing the fungus to infect European ash.” As is common in cases where species move to new hosts, the new host had no defences against the fungus. It spread rapidly across Europe to the UK, killing most of the ash trees it infected. The situation is so bad in Northern Europe that trees with some natural tolerance to the fungus – a great example of natural selection in action – are rare enough to become known as individuals, for example Tree 35 in Denmark.  But is this a big problem for the UK: are ash trees an important component of our biodiversity? I put the question to Ruth Mitchell, who was clear on the wider implications of ash dieback. “Losing ash trees will really matter. It is one of our most common trees and there are at least 45 species such as moths, beetles and butterflies that only use ash, another 62 species that predominately use them, and a total of nearly 1,000 species that can be found using ash. That is a lot of species directly affected, and many more will be indirectly affected through various complex interactions.”  Worryingly, it’s only since ash dieback hit Britain that this research has got underway, and the species associated with other trees are only poorly known. Ash dieback may be the current pin-up of the tree disease world, but there are plenty of other diseases threatening our trees. Acute oak decline, chestnut blight and various Phytophthora fungi responsible for brown rot are among the microorganisms causing disease. There are also Asian longhorn beetles, horse chestnut leaf miner and oak processionary moth to contend with in terms of insects causing problems. Ash doesn’t escape insect pests either, with the Emerald Ash Borer spreading west from Russia. With so many threats either already here or on the horizon, is there anything we can do? As Richard Buggs explained: “It is probably already too late for ash in the UK but we can use genetic research to develop a strong genetically-diverse base of tolerant trees to re-plant Britain in the future.” The answers to tree disease aren’t just in the science. “There is a huge movement of plants across the world, and when plants move you also move diseases, pests and goodness knows what else living in the soil they’re transported in. We need better biosecurity controls over this movement,” says Steve Woodward.  The overwhelming conclusion of the panel was one that will be familiar to ecologists everywhere: the situation is complicated and we don’t know anywhere near enough about the diseases or their implications. One thing is clear though. We shouldn’t let the relatively slow pace of tree diseases (which take years rather than weeks to take hold) dictate our research efforts to combat them."
"**Qantas will outsource more than 2,000 ground staff roles in an effort to limit its financial losses.**
The job cuts are on top of 6,000 roles already announced by Australiaâs flag carrier earlier this year.
Qantas announced a $2bn (Â£1bn) loss in August due to Covid-19 and associated border restrictions.
âUnfortunately, Covid has turned aviation upside down,"" said Andrew David, the airlineâs domestic and international chief executive.
""Airlines around the world are having to make dramatic decisions in order to survive and the damage will take years to repair,â he added.
Qantas hopes to save about $74m annually, based on pre-Covid levels of flying, by switching to third-party providers instead of handling its own ground services.
It also expects to save $59m over five years by avoiding new spending on ground handling equipment such as aircraft tugs and baggage loaders.
Affected employees will be entitled to a redundancy package and given support to transition to new jobs, the airline said.
There has been some good news for the airlineâs recovery, with domestic routes starting to recover as state governments lift interstate travel restrictions.
But Qantas is still predicting bleak times ahead, with more losses next year due to a drop in revenue of $7.4bn.
It does not expect to fly internationally until late in 2021 - with the exception of a potential travel bubble with New Zealand.
The airline has also taken on an additional $1.1bn debt in order to keep operating.
Itâs not alone. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) predicts airlines globally are on course to lose $157bn this year and next.
Passenger numbers are expected to drop to 1.8bn this year from 4.5bn in 2019.
IATA says those numbers will recover only partially to 2.8bn next year."
"**Six people have been fined by police in Oban for travelling into the region from a level four area for a house party.**
The fixed penalty notices for breaking Covid-19 restrictions were issued over the weekend.
Officers also handed out four fines to the occupants of a vehicle that came from a level four area.
Oban is in Argyll and Bute which is at level two under the Scottish government's coronavirus restrictions.
Scotland moved to a five-level system of localised restrictions earlier this month, with the aim of suppressing the virus in high-prevalence areas but allowing more freedom in places with fewer cases.
A group of 11 council areas in the west of the central belt are set to remain in level four - the top tier of curbs - until 11 December.
Insp Mark Stephen, from Oban Police, said officers would continue to use enforcement ""as a last resort where there is a clear breach of the legislation"".
He said: ""The chief constable has said publicly on numerous occasions that we will not be routinely stopping vehicles or setting up road blocks, and that will not change as a result of travel restrictions now being in law.
""However, officers may in the course of their duties come across people who are travelling from one local authority area to another.
""In areas where travel restrictions apply, officers will continue to use the common sense, discretion and excellent judgement that they have applied since the crisis began."""

Manuel Ayau, one of the people I most respected and admired, died today. Muso, as his friends called him, was a major figure in the international movement to promote liberty. He was a president of the Mont Pelerin Society and served on the board of directors of Liberty Fund and as a trustee of the Foundation for Economic Education. He will be most remembered, however, as the founder and president emeritus of the influential Francisco Marroquin University in his native Guatemala. He leaves an enormous legacy because he successfully combined clear thinking, entrepreneurship, intellectual curiosity, and a belief in the potential of free individuals to create what has become the center of classical liberal thinking in Latin America.   
  
  
Well before he founded Francisco Marroquin University in 1971, Muso Ayau started a think tank (Centro de Estudios Economicos‐​Sociales) with a small group of Guatemalan friends in 1959. Thus began a lifelong project to discover and disseminate those ideas that best explain and provide solutions to underdevelopment. The process led him to the writings of the great market liberals—some of whom he invited to Guatemala for lectures or established friendships with, such as Ludwig von Mises or Milton Friedman—and culminated in the founding of FMU. Muso was not an academic (he had a degree in engineering), but he understood how the power of ideas can influence society, so he set about the long‐​term task of running an institution that would teach generations of Guatemalans about “the ethical, legal and economic principles of a society of free and responsible persons,” no matter what degree students pursued.   
  
  
In his inaugural address in 1972, Muso stated: 



We firmly believe in the capacity of imperfect human beings to be better able to realize their destiny when free and not when compelled by the collective entity personified by the state.



It took courage to found the University. When it began, the intellectual and political climate was not only hostile to libertarian ideas, it was violently opposed. Guatemala was in the midst of a civil war and neither side—with the military and business establishment on one side and leftist guerrillas on the other—particularly welcomed the message of limited government, free markets, and private property rights. In the early days, Muso gave graduation speeches wearing a bullet proof vest under his toga. In the 1980s, he would sometimes wear disguises when traveling in public and took extra security measures at home.   
  
  
After the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of Guatemala’s civil war in the 1990s, public opinion was of course much more open to market liberal ideas, but Guatemala’s mercantilist society still ensured that the battle against entrenched interests—business groups, unions, government bureaucracies—remained tough. By then, though, the prestige of Muso Ayau and of the university faculty and its well‐​trained graduates had grown as had the presence of their ideas. Anyone who has visited Guatemala during the past 20 years, as I have, can attest to the fact that market liberal ideas can be found every day in the op‐​ed pages and articles of the country’s leading newspapers and the electronic media as well. In some cases, this has translated into radical policy change—as in the case of Guatemala’s successful telecom reform or its law legalizing competing currencies.   




Muso was proud of the progress classical liberal ideas had made despite the fact that statism still prevails in much of Guatemala. He was at once an optimist with an ambitious vision and a realist with a modest view of himself. He was not surprised that much of the left and right resented his call for an end to all government‐​established privileges. Though Muso could have been fabulously successful going along with the established framework of Guatemalan society, he chose not to. In this, he was a rare Latin American specimen, a champion of truly progressive ideas that peacefully challenged formidable political forces.   
  
  
Yet not everybody cared to understand this. Lawrence Harrison famously and inexplicably described Muso as “an archtypical, far‐​right, Latin oligarch” who is also a libertarian. Harrison’s incoherent description came in the summer of 2001 when it was discovered that the U.S. embassy in Guatemala was secretly distributing a document to other embassies describing Muso and the university as enemies of democracy and progress. The whole sorry episode, described by Mary O’Grady in the _Wall Street Journal,_ hardly shocked Muso and his colleagues, who had long been denouncing Washington’s heavy‐​handedness in Guatemala and the region. (Muso later drew up business cards with his name, followed by “Archtypical far‐​right, Latin libertarian oligarch.” Even in the face of ridicule, Muso kept his famous, good sense of humor.)   
  
  
The ideas that Muso Ayau began promoting in Spanish in Guatemala in the 1950s, soon drew in brilliant thinkers from other parts of Latin America and influenced the classical liberal movement throughout the region. FMU continues to draw the world’s leading thinkers in a range of disciplines including business, philosophy, law, economics, and literature to its state‐​of‐​the art campus and it has served as the model for other such universities in countries as diverse as Chile, Montenegro and Georgia. That so many students and professionals in Mexico, Central and South America and beyond understand and support the free society today is in no small part due to his efforts, whether they know it or not.   
  
  
Muso always admired the Cato Institute and he was delighted, as were we, that Cato and FMU began a yearly, week‐​long seminar for Latin American students in classical liberal thought in Guatemala. I will never forget how, during the first such event in January 2009, Muso took a quick, round‐​trip flight from Houston, where he was receiving treatment for the cancer that he ultimately succumbed to, just to give his scheduled lecture to the students. His enthusiasm, wit and warm personality filled the lecture room.   
  
  
Muso was a living embodiment of the classical liberal spirit. He was also a friend. He will be missed, but his spirit will continue to infuse the work of Francisco Marroquin University and many, many advocates of liberty around the world who knew him or were somehow influenced by him.

If sanctimony and hypocrisy were renewable energy sources, the Pacific Islands Forum could fuel the globe for the foreseeable future. Rarely has such a tiny pond crammed with such oversized bottom-feeders belched out more insincerity and fraudulent greed.



Australian Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack’s remark that Fiji will continue to survive on Australian foreign aid and fruit-picking jobs might have been injudicious, but it’s not like he was completely wrong. Australians’ cultural proclivity for blunt talk may often veer into insensitivity, and Frank Bainimarama’s chagrin at McCormack’s sledge is certainly understandable. At the same time, though, it might be pertinent to consider that while Beijing’s smooth-talking might pander to Pacific nations’ chipped shoulders, China will still have its pound of flesh in the end.



Then there’s this piece of breathtaking hypocrisy from Kiribati.



Australia should be sanctioned or suspended from the Pacific Islands Forum over the Morrison government’s pro-coal stance, Kiribati’s former president, Anote Tong, says.



Fine – and we’ll take our foreign aid with us. **Which will blow a 40% hole in Kiribati’s entire gdp.** But the duplicity doesn’t end there:



The Sydney Morning Herald reported Mr Tong saying if a country causes harm to others, such as by fuelling climate change, “there should be sanctions”.



  
Does that include countries whose tourist trade – fuelled by jet-fuel-guzzling international flights – contributes megatonnes of CO2 to climate change every year? Kiribati might need a gentle reminder that it recently signed a deal for four shiny, new jet airliners for its national carrier. 



Meanwhile, the PIF’s rota of the gullible and greedy are lapping up the snake-oil from Beijing.



Beijing has condemned Australia and accused it of acting like a condescending master towards Pacific countries, insulting climate-vulnerable nations and “spreading the China threat fallacy”.



China’s foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, said Pacific island leaders did not share Australia’s fear of Chinese influence in the region.



Meanwhile, there’s a little place called Hong Kong. Ask **them** how they feel about coming under Beijing’s thumb.



This is an old, old ploy from the Chinese communists. During the Cold War, Beijing pandered to preening third-world popinjays by parroting their anti-colonialist rhetoric (even as Beijing was invading Tibet and Vietnam, and trying to monster Taiwan into submission). Now, awash with cash following Deng’s economic reforms, the communists are buying friends and hangers-on like a drunken tourist in Patpong.



Speaking in Beijing, Geng said […] China had been providing assistance to island countries “with no political strings attached” and without insults.



  
And that’s just how mendicant despots across the developing world like it. Western nations, like Australia and the U.S., actually expect **reform** for their money. Beijing just doles out the cash.



But if the PIFs think there’ll be no strings attached as Beijing turns the Pacific into a Chinese lake, they’re bigger buffoons than they look in those silly shirts.

A stint as an Indiana budget official gave me a firsthand view of how policymakers use taxpayer money to serve their political self‐​interests.



So when an Indianapolis news channel discovered that the state’s economic development agency was taking undeserved credit for job creation, I was probably the least surprised person in the state.



If there is one issue that resonates with voters today, it is jobs. As government at all levels grows in size and scope, voters become conditioned to look to policymakers as the source of economic development.





If there is one issue that resonates with voters today, it is jobs.



And because simply cutting taxes means less money for politicians to spend on vote‐​buying programs, targeted subsidies to businesses have become popular. They buy favorable press at a cheaper price.



Indiana is no exception. The Indiana Economic Development Corp. (IEDC) uses subsidies in an attempt to lure businesses and jobs to the state, or to keep them here. The IEDC might not admit it, but most businesses already know where they plan to locate before they contact the agency. Businesses consider a myriad of factors including demographics, transportation logistics and workforce capabilities when choosing where to set up shop. Although the tax and regulatory climate is an important consideration, IEDC handouts are just that — handouts.



Because a governor will get credit for creating jobs, businesses know they can extract taxpayer money from the state for these subsidies. After a company reaches an agreement with the IEDC, the administration issues a news release. For the high‐​profile deals, it arranges a choreographed ribbon‐​cutting ceremony at the company’s facilities. The company helps fulfill its end of the bargain by telling the media that the administration’s support sealed the deal.



Witnessing this charade from inside the administration of Gov. Mitch Daniels led me to coin the phrase “press‐​release economics.”



Not everyone in the administration, however, bought into the IEDC scheme. My former agency, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), was tasked with monitoring the performance of state agencies, including the IEDC. And as we knew to be the case with many of the state programs, the IEDC’s claims were known to be inflated. It is implausible that the rest of the administration, including the IEDC itself, didn’t know about the fuzzy math.



The administration’s political chicanery, however, has now come back to bite it. A recent WTHR Eyewitness News investigation into IEDC shined a light on the job‐​creation claims. When reporters tried to visit some of the companies celebrated in IEDC news releases, they found empty fields, vacant lots and deserted factories. According to the investigation, “as many as 40 percent of statewide jobs listed as so‐​called economic successes have not happened — and most of them never will.”



The governor told reporters that the IEDC’s numbers were audited. Independently? That would be news to me. When I was a deputy director at OMB, the governor’s chief advisers ignored internal suggestions that the state pursue the creation of an independent auditing agency along the lines of the U.S. Government Accountability Office. The position of the IEDC director is that no taxpayer money is being lost because his agency audits the companies to make sure they fulfill the terms of their agreement with the state. The director, however, has so far refused to release any details to the public that would support this contention.



In summary, Indiana doesn’t need a politicized economic‐​development bureaucracy to create a welcoming environment for businesses. One alternative would be to eliminate the state’s corporate income tax, which has a relatively high 8.5 percent rate. The revenue loss could be offset at least in part by shuttering the IEDC and eliminating targeted tax breaks.



The governor, of course, might have to forgo some news releases. The long‐​term benefits to the state, though, should be worth the political sacrifice.

The natural CO2 flux to and from oceans and land plants amounts to approximately 210 gigatons of carbon annually. (Note that this is carbon. Multiply the numbers by 3.7 for the total weight of CO2 including the two oxygen atoms.) Man currently causes about 9 gigatons of carbon to be injected into the atmosphere, about 4% of the natural annual flux. There are estimates that about half of man’s emissions are taken up by nature, or 2%. Why only half?

Figure 1 from NOAA and the IPCC, 2001 numbers, here.
The chart above updated to current numbers, implies that 3 gigatons of man’s emissions are absorbed by the oceans and 1.5 gigatons by the rest of the biosphere. If the vegetation on land absorbs 120 gigatons and if rising CO2 improves biosphere production, why isn’t all the excess CO2 also absorbed? It is because the biosphere is being destroyed faster than it can adapt to rising CO2.
About 60 years ago, I read somewhere, probably National Geographic, that the Amazon rain forests were the “lungs of the earth”, the place where CO2 was recycled back to oxygen. This phrase is still widely used, just Google “lungs of the earth” with the quotes and examine the result. One article in particular drew my attention. A quote:

…as recently as 19th century, tropical rain forests in their own right covered around 20% of all the dry land area of the Earth, but this figure was only 7% by the end of the 20th century.”

The world-wide increase in CO2 is not due to fossil fuel burning, it is due to the destruction of the worlds lungs. Clearing tropical forests for Biofuels production is contributing to that destruction.
Tropical rainforest destruction world-wide runs between 0.5% and 1% by area annually. The world’s lungs are suffering from TB, timber burning. For a horrifying world view of this problem go here, and view the video. Here is a MODIS satellite image of Myanmar on just one day. The red areas are fire.

Markets will be hanging on every word in Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke’s speech Friday morning in Jackson Hole, Wyo. That is because the minutes from the July 31‐​Aug. 1 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, released on Aug. 22, were widely interpreted as signaling some kind of further easing of monetary policy.



The minutes stated in part that “many members judged that additional monetary accommodation would likely be warranted fairly soon unless incoming information pointed to a substantial and sustainable strengthening in the pace of the economic recovery.” And yet, one day after the minutes were released, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said they were “a bit stale.” This turned market sentiment around, sending equity prices down.



So will he send a signal favorable to “additional monetary accommodation”? Or will he endorse Mr. Bullard’s comments?



Looking ahead to its next meeting on Sept. 12 and 13, the FOMC could decide to initiate a new round of “quantitative easing” through purchases of Treasury bonds, mortgage‐​backed securities or other unconventional asset classes, which has been its strategy since the fall of 2008. It might also choose to extend beyond the end of 2014 the period in which it anticipates holding the federal‐​funds rate near zero. These aren’t mutually exclusive possibilities.



But whatever path Mr. Bernanke points the FOMC toward, further “monetary accommodation” of the type being discussed will be futile at best or counterproductive at worst.





Bond purchases won’t change any fundamental determinant of economic activity.



Consider the kind of policies implemented by the Fed since the crisis began. One variety consisted of credit allocation, whether by direct lending to targeted financial institutions or even nonfinancial firms such as auto makers. Fed purchases of mortgage‐​backed securities direct credit to favored firms and sectors rather than to the businesses that could make most productive use of it.



Subsidizing housing finance is especially problematic, as homebuilding clearly overexpanded in the early 2000s and needed to contract. If public policy subsidized a good into excess supply, further subsidies aren’t the cure. The Fed has merely delayed adjustment in the housing and financial sectors by continuing to direct credit to them.



The Fed has also engaged in temporary infusions of money into the economy via two previous rounds of quantitative easing, QE1 and QE2. It did so after driving short‐​term interest rates to near zero, which limited the effectiveness of traditional purchases of short‐​term government debt.



Quantitative easing is the Fed’s version of “stimulus,” the complement to fiscal stimulus. The trouble with all forms of temporary spending is that they have no permanent effects. They delay needed adjustments in the economy.



Today’s state and local governments are a case in point. Municipal and state spending was propped up by federal transfers of many billions of dollars in the president’s 2009 stimulus package. But as this federal money has dried up, public payrolls are declining, ironically enough for this administration, close to the presidential election. President Obama received bad advice when he was told that government spending would prime the pump of the economy. Instead it had the effect of temporarily transferring resources from the productive private sector to a bloated public sector.



The Fed’s version of temporary stimulus will likely involve purchasing government bonds. If past is prologue, this will act as a sugar rush to financial markets. There will be equity and bond‐​market rallies. _Wall Street_ will rejoice, but none of this will translate into “substantial and sustainable” economic growth, the FOMC’s stated goal.



Bond purchases won’t change any fundamental determinant of economic activity. And in the current economic climate, a crucial issue is that investors don’t know what the tax code will be next year. Investments are made in anticipation of after‐​tax profits. If the tax rate is unknown, investment returns are unknown. That is a great deterrent to capital formation and job growth.



This is no secret: The FOMC minutes from its July 31‐​Aug. 1 meeting refer to fiscal and regulatory uncertainties as a reason for the Fed to take action. The minutes reported that some participants thought a new bond‐​buying program “might boost business and consumer confidence.” It hasn’t done so in this recession. No amount of quantitative easing at this point will stir what John Maynard Keynes called the “animal spirits”—“a spontaneous urge to action rather than inaction”—needed for growth.



What would stir the spirits of investors and employers would be some policy certainty, reining‐​in of out‐​of‐​control government spending, stopping ill‐​advised regulations, and clearing the air of antibusiness rhetoric. No repeat of a one‐​off round of bond buying by the Fed substitutes for the fundamental and permanent changes needed.

By Dr. Sebastain Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited with permission by P. Gosselin)
The Antarctic ice shelf is made up of huge ice sheets that float on the ocean and are firmly connected to the mainland ice cap. There are two main ice shelves: the Ronne-Filchner and Ross (Figure 1). There are also a number of other smaller shelves.

Figure 1: Shelf ice in the Antarctic . Image courtesy Scambos et al. 2007; provided by the National Snow and Ice Data Center.
The ice shelves act as a block that holds back and brakes the mainland ice sheets. Just how well is this safety block functioning today? Do we have to worry that the Antarctic ice sheet will soon slide into the ocean and cause a sea level surge?
Such a horror scenario was spread to the public by climate scientist Anders Levermann of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) four years ago. In a blog article at the PIK-friendly Klimalounge-Blog, Rahmstorf’s institute fellow colleague suggested dramatic consequences for the Antarctic shelf ice should a fundamental shift in global energy supply not rapidly take place. Levermann is also very closely associated with the IPCC and is a lead author of the current climate assessment report. In a recent article titled: “Untenable ice shelf – Updated“ he upped the stakes and added:
Simulations of the Antarctic here are briefly introduced. These show that the loss of the Ross Ice shelf 3 million years ago led to the collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet and a seven-meter rise in sea level. […] to make statements with certainty on whether the retreat of the ice shelf is accelerating, the current data sets are not sufficient.”
According to theoretical simulations, the shelf ice is expected to disappear. Levermann does admit, however, that these models cannot be compared to hard measured data. Within the scope of the PIK ice shelf catastrophe publicity campaigns, a PIK Phd candidate was sent in to do an interview with the evangelical online magazine Chrismon, in which she made some surprising statements:
Climate change: The ice is sliding into the sea. In ten years… the Earth will be much warmer than today, climate scientist Maria Martin claims. She can prove this with the help of computer models.
CHRISMON: Has it gotten warmer in Antarctica?
MARTIN: We can assume this, also when the directly measured data in Antarctica do not go back very far. In 2002 a large ice shelf collapsed, it simply fell apart. We suspect this because melt water had formed there.”
Computer models as proof? That’s an adventurous claim. Even the IPCC reminds us that computer models only depict scenarios and can never be used as proof. Not a good start.
Then comes her next gaffe: Has it gotten warmer in Antarctica? Martin answers yes to this, but with a reference to supposedly limited measured temperature data, leaving a back door open. Let’s take a look at this supposedly “limited measured data” (Figure 2). According to RSS satellite data, it has gotten a bit colder, and not warmer, in Antarctica since measurements began in 1979. Obviously the PIK scientist is quite wrong with her suspicions. Her concluding reference to a past ice-shelf break is not exactly enlightening. Such calving is part of the transport conveyor that carries snow that was converted to ice in the interior of the seventh continent and on over to the coast. The ice shelf collapse she mentions has about as much informational value as a spilled sack of rice in China.

The final statement of the Potsdam ice shelf catastrophe campaign was made on 11 May 2013 at the online Neuen Potsdamer Nachrichten (PNN) [New Potsdam News]. Read it for yourself:
Chain reaction in Antarctica is feared Already in this century a gigantic ice slide threatens to occur in the Antarctic region, which up to now has played hardly a role in climate change. This is the conclusion that German scientists have reached with two simultaneous computer simulations. Unlike what was assumed, climate change also impacts the Weddell Sea, the largest shelf sea of the Southern Ocean on the Antarctic continent, scientists report in the journal ‘Nature‘. The warm water masses are having a massive impact on the Filchner-Ronne ice shelf. […] The giant ice sheet will soon begin to rapidly melt and disappear by the end of the century, the two scientists write with respect to their calculation. As a consequence, great amounts of mainland ice could slip into the ocean because shelf ice acting as a barrier would be lacking. This in turn would lead to a rise in sea level. ‘ Shelf ice is to mainland ice what a cork is to a bottle,’ explains AWI oceanographer and lead author of the study, Hartmut Hellmer. ‘They brake the flow of ice because they get snarled up everywhere in the bays and, for example, they get lodged on islands.
Also a second study published in ‘Nature Geoscience’ points to such a development. Scientists led by Martin Siegert of the British University of Edinburgh analyzed the thickness of two ice flows that feed into the Filchner-Ronne ice shelf using Georadar (Radio Echo Sounding, RES) – and the ground properties underneath. According to the analysis, there is a large steeply inclined basin with a smooth base that would hardly be able to counter a slip-away. The melt rate will increase from 5 meters per year today to up to 50 meters per year by the end of the century, so estimates AWI oceanographer Jürgen Determann. How the mainland ice would react to the mega-melting ice shelf is still open. However the scientists assume that it moves and that it will slide increasingly faster. Should the melting ice be completely offset by the subsequently flowing mainland ice, this would lead to an additional sea level rise of 4.4 millimeters per year.”
Other media outlets gratefully jumped on the story, such as the Augsburger Allgemeine and Spiegel. Yet, in the meantime, things have quieted down with regards to the Antarctic ice shelf catastrophe. For some reason the PIK and its associated institutes have lost their desire for the subject. What happened?
Hardly a month had passed since the Potsdam campaign ended before the first scientists appeared in public with very inconvenient words. A team of scientists led by Tore Hattermann of the Norwegian Polar Institute published a study showing gross errors made in the theoretical ice shelf models used. Hattermann and his colleagues set up a 12-tonne drilling rig on the surface of the Antarctic Fimbul ice shelf and bored through the more than 200 meter thick ice sheet at three locations. Underneath the ice they measured the temperature and produced a data set that was unique in its kind. Here they found surprising results: The ice shelf models had assumed a much too high temperature underneath the ice. In reality the water beneath the shelf ice was considerably colder. The mass loss postulated by the models could no longer be supported in the face of the new hard temperature calibration data. Moreover, the ice mass of the ice sheet currently appears to be hardly changing, as the team led by Hattermann was able to show in a paper in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Then just a few weeks later, things got a lot worse for the Potsdam scientists: In September 2012 a study in the journal The Cryosphere was published by a team of researchers of the University of California Irvine led by Bernd Scheuchl. Here the scientists compared radar measurements of the Antarctic Ross and Ronne ice shelves from 1997 and from 2009. Here the scientists determined the changes in ice shelf’s ice flow speed over the 12-year period. Both the large Mercer and Whillans ice flows of the Ross ice shelf had slowed by 50 m/year and 100 m/year respectively. Also most ice flows that feed into the Filchner-Ronne ice shelf show a moderate slowdown.
The results simply are not cooperating at all with the postulated Potsdam Antarctic shelf ice catastrophe.
Now just out is yet another paper that has been in print since the end of June 2013: Earth and Planetary Science Letters. An international team led by Christina Hulbe of the University of Otago in New Zealand extended the study even further back into the past. Using surface speed measurements from the 1970s and moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) from the 2000s, Christina Hulbe and colleagues were able to show that the biggest portion of the Ross ice shelf had slowed down in its movement during the last 30 years.
In Potsdam they reacted by switching the focus over to Indian monsoons. This will get them the media’s attention for a couple of months – at least until serious scientists take a closer, more serious look at the basis of their newest alarm story.
Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt are the authors of the new book: The Neglected Sun.

"Britain’s warm, wet winter brought floods and misery to many living across southern England, with large parts of Somerset lying underwater for months. When in January rainfall was double the expected average over wide areas, many people made cautious links between such extreme weather and global climate change. There were nay-sayers at the time but it now seems that there is evidence for those links. Speaking at the European Geosciences Union annual meeting here in Vienna, Myles Allen, a professor of geosystem science at the University of Oxford, presented his take on the issue. At the gathering of more than 12,000 geoscientists, Allen reported an ambitious computer experiment that his team has undertaken over the last two months to test whether the winter floods could be attributed to climate change. And it seems that they can be linked. The floods of January 2014 certainly were extreme. According to Oxford’s records of daily rainfall, they were unprecedented in 250 years. The records at the UK Met Office from the 20th century also show that this winter was, historically, uniquely bad. The IPCC report does suggest that extreme weather events should be expected as the world warms but the prediction is couched in cautious terms and the risk is assessed as “medium” confidence.  At the Environmental Change Institute in Oxford, researchers Nathalie Schaller and Friederike Otto analysed results from almost 40,000 climate model calculations to test the impact of climate change on Britain’s winter rains. Their calculations modelled the weather across the country on a 50km grid. They compared the results of 12,842 simulations based on the current global sea surface temperatures, with 25,893 results computed on the assumption that global warming had never occurred – that fossil fuel burning had not raised CO2 to today’s levels and ocean surfaces were cooler. Such a huge number of calculations was needed to tease out the statistical differences between the two scenarios. It was only possible through the participation of thousands of members of the public in the work’s biggest ever climate modelling exercise: they offered up spare processing capacity on their home computers to run the calculations via the Climate Prediction citizen science climate modelling programme. The results showed a subtle bias towards more extreme weather in today’s warming world. Events that would have been expected once in 100 years before global warming can now be anticipated to occur once in 80 years. In essence, the probability of extreme winter floods appears to have increased by 25% on pre-industrial levels. Allen pointed out that this is the first quantitative evaluation of the influence of global warming on Britain’s 2014 floods. Thomas Stocker, a professor of climate and environmental physics at the University of Bern and chairman of the IPCC working group charged with assessing the physical origins of climate change, said that the Oxford group’s results had “shown movement in one direction only – toward greater risk”. Although the results from the models cannot yet give definite measures of the probability of a flood, they do provide an insight into how those risks have changed and continue to change – information that is of great interest to insurance underwriters, among others. Otto said: “Past greenhouse gas emission and other forms of pollution have loaded the weather dice”, adding that she and others were still working on investigating the implications of the results, for river flows, flooding and ultimately the threat to property and lives. Some will, no doubt, question the result on the basis that it is “simply” a statistical test. The results from the two modelling scenarios are, at first sight, very similar. But the fact remains that they are distinct, showing that rising global ocean surface temperatures directly influence UK winter rainfall.  The results affirm the strong and growing scientific consensus developing from the understanding of the physical origins and consequences of climate change, as outlined in the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Working Group 1 report last September. Those that choose to ignore them, or contradict them, will (I predict) still be directly affected by them. And we will be hit where it hurts most – in our wallets. How likely is it that the insurance industry will ignore such results?"
"In the industrial era, economic growth has become equated with human progress, with a fundamental assumption that material growth and consumption inevitably leads to improvements in our well-being. Over the past 45 years, the world’s population has doubled to seven billion people, and the world’s economy has grown almost four-fold, from US$11.2 trillion to US$42.5 trillion. Thus, GDP per capita has almost doubled; so we should be twice better off, in terms of health, wealth and happiness, than in the 1960s. Certainly we are by some measures healthier: mean life expectancy has risen from 56 to 70 years, driven by a two-thirds drop in child mortality, from 153 to 51 per 1,000 live births. But these advances have come at a cost, borne by the natural world whose resources and vitality have been depleted. And they have been spread unevenly – despite producing a third more food than in 1961, some one billion people remain poor and hungry. Four-fold economic growth has still left more than two billion people living on less than US$2 a day.  So there are many in the world who need to consume considerably more, simply in order to meet their basic needs. But taken as a whole, the average global citizen consumes too much. If those without are to reach decent levels of sustenance, housing and health, then those currently enjoying the fat must consume less. But this is not widely accepted. Analyses conducted across 189 countries confirm that at very low per-capita GDP, life satisfaction increases sharply with any rise in income. This incline is steep, but above a surprisingly low threshold of approximately US$10,000, affluence brings diminishing returns for life satisfaction. So well-being, understood as satisfaction or happiness, is not connected intrinsically to wealth and consumption, and the relentless pursuit of GDP growth does not lead to consistent gains in well-being in affluent countries, those that have passed the threshold of easy life improvement. But again, this is neither widely accepted nor understood. Consumption of any kind is usually viewed as an unchallenged good. This decoupling of affluence and happiness has been demonstrated in longitudinal measures of life satisfaction since the mid-20th century. It can be seen by comparing relative changes in GDP in since the 1940s against changes in life satisfaction: it is the same in UK, the US, and Japan. More things do not seem to make people more happy. Professor Tim Jackson has concluded that we have been “betrayed by affluence”, and Professor Partha Dasgupta has observed “the rogue word in GDP is ‘gross’”. A priority must now be to create opportunities for alternative, divergent ways of living, as the current material culture has failed, and continues to fail, both the rich and the poor. The target is economic growth that is more green growth, defined by the UNEP as “resulting in human well-being and social equity, while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities”. Deep political commitment to this is rare, despite the evidence that acting early to counter the effects of climate change, resource depletion and ecological destruction would be cheaper than bearing the costs later. A UNEP report concluded that investing just 2% of world GDP into the green economy would be sufficient to reduce energy-related CO2 emissions sufficiently to stay within the maximum level deemed safe of 450 parts per million. Some countries, including China, Denmark, Ethiopia, South Africa and South Korea, are promoting a green agenda which could lead to a new industrial revolution. China has invested US$100 billion since 2000 in eco-compensation schemes, mostly forestry and water management. Subsidies (feed-in-tariffs) introduced in 65 countries to encourage renewable energy has led to renewables now meeting 17% of world energy consumption.  Many poor countries’ revenue is absorbed by the cost of importing fossil fuels – Kenya, Senegal and India spend 45-50% of their earnings from exports on importing energy, for example. By investing in renewable energy – Kenya has introduced feed-in-tariffs for renewables, India is pressing ahead with huge solar energy parks – these nations save money, become more self-reliant, and improve the quality of the environment at home. Yet these kinds of green economies that seek to change aspirations and consumption patterns by increasing consumption of the currently poor and reducing that of the affluent, increases well-being and protects natural capital are not likely to look much like the current economy. Large changes are now needed.  The futuristic Korean science and technology vision envisages an advanced economy driven by clean energy, low carbon use and green growth. Priority technologies include polymer electrolyte fuel cells, space solar power, integrated water and sewage management, bio-oil replacements, zero-emissions housing, seawater desalinisation, wearable robotics, vertical farms, self-diagnosing materials, automated driving systems, floating cities, smart dust technology and rotating buildings for sharing sunlight and views. Without moving economies and consumers towards an attitude of “enough, not more”, material consumption and the damage it brings the planet will continue to grow. But this requires knowing “how much is enough”, and teaching us all to recognise when we have it, and to look to other forms of non-material consumption; story-telling, creating, or engaging with nature. Cooperation will speed and improve community bonds and social capital, which reduces inequality.  At the heart of a green economy will be four tenets: resist consumerism by opting out, such as through downshifting or voluntary simplicity, retain possessions for longer before replacement, make different choices (ethical or green consumerism), and substitute material consumption with non-material alternatives. Conventional economic growth based on rising consumption is not tenable, and a shift to a green economy is inevitable; it is a question of whether it occurs before or after the planet becomes locked on a path toward severe climate change and other eventualities that will cause potentially irreparable harm to the planet. It may all turn on affection for places and possessions, observed E M Forster. Even the greatest civilisations have their day and decline, and beliefs or ways of doing held as fundamental are dropped and others taken up. “Because a thing is going strong now, it need not go on strong forever,” said Margaret in Howard’s End, “it may be followed by a civilisation [that] will rest upon the earth.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn general, the media in Germany overwhelmingly welcome Obama’s plan to tackle CO2 emissions. But for many, Obama’s plan does not go far enough, or is just a front for something more sinister, like fracking. Others are skeptical whether action will actually follow his lofty rhetoric.
What follows are some German media reactions.
The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung even ridiculed the decreed, intrusive measures planned by Obama:
The National Security Agency has also been instructed to place a trojan in every computer. Monitors, TV screens, microwave ovens, and fridge displays are to function with the following screen-saver after being switched on every morning: ‘World Leader against Climate Change’. New car registrations are to be possible only when the color-poster of the ‘Action Plan’ are factory-installed in the interior of the windshield so that they are easily visible.”
Die Welt: Connie Hedegaard says that USA must now bow to international law.
EU climate commissar Connie Hedegaard emphasized that action has to follow the good intentions. The USA must obligate itself to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions over the long-term within the scope of a binding world climate agreement.”
Spiegel: “bruising and potentially costly political battle”
President Obama laid out an ambitious campaign to address climate change Tuesday, mapping a course that would bypass Congress to cut emissions from hundreds of coal-fired electric power plants and setting the stage for a possible rejection of the controversial Keystone XL oil pipeline. The effort could shape Obama’s presidential legacy and fulfill a key promise of his 2008 campaign. It also could plunge him into a bruising and potentially costly political battle.”

Die Zeit: “hollow words…long list of bureaucratic decisions ”
US President Obama announced a new initiative for climate change. But hollow words are what’s left. Environmentalists say they are disappointed. […] Apart from his arousing rhetoric, his speech, interrupted by polite applause, was a long list of bureaucratic decisions and descriptions of measures. De facto what the plan is.
However, Obama’s latest environmental initiative is probably about political damage control. One of the most delicate issues during his presidency is the decision on the Keystone Pipeline.”
Süddeutsche Zeitung: “way too little, much too late”
Obama’s Minimal Solution to Healing the Planet […] From an international perspective, it is way too little, and much too late. If the US President wanted to set example to the world, then he would have to much more unrelentingly limit America’s notorious wasting of resources.”
Die Tageszeitung (TAZ) of Berlin: “bypassing Congress”
This time President Obama wants to assert a new climate policy by bypassing Congress. […] For ‘clean’ energy, in addition to wind and solar, he is banking on nuclear energy and – foremost – production of gas. Also with fracking.”

Fakegate Apologism — It’s How They Roll 
Guest post by Chris Horner 
This morning I read a terrific recounting of the “the fact that a whole section of the scientific establishment is defending Gleick on the grounds that it’s OK to lie to promote their cause…from the intellectual heights of the establishment and specifically from those who have proclaimed themselves to be experts on scientific ethics.” (“‘Fake But Accurate’ Science”, TIA Daily, subscription required). Following on my post Fakegate: It’s what they do, and Anthony’s continuing elaboration of the “noble cause corruption”, this recalled for me a recent experience that had nagged at the back of my mind, bothersome for what it indicates. And it all fits together. 
Last week I gave a talk at Yale Law School on the role of environmental regulation, sponsored by the Federalist Society and Young America’s Foundation. I made my way to the greatest economic boom-time opportunity we’ve ever faced — we’re told — which happens to be (surprise!) a massive regulatory boom. But before being sold — in adaptation to the downturn — as an economic boom it was sold — during flush times — as necessitating economic slowdown. Got it.

Rationales I cited and supported with sources included: make the uneconomic “profitable” (Pres. Obama, Ken Lay), redistribute the world’s wealth (UN guy), restructure the global economy, “level the playing field” (unions, greens, EU Environment Commissioner Margot Wallstrom), “slow down our economy” (Bill Clinton, Alan Greenspan), create a boom economy (Pres. Obama, Al Gore, Carol Browner, some congressmen), transform our economy (Tom Friedman), “raise billions of dollars”/finance social agenda (Pres. Obama, lawmakers), avoid having “too much energy”, too little drudgery (John Holdren and his ilk). 
President Obama said in his 2010 State of the Union speech that, even if you doubt the scientific argument, it’s “the right thing to do”, echoing movement-godfather Sen. Tim Wirth who said the very same thing in 1988. Now, with more “human redemption”! (guess who). 
Thomas Friedman, responding to such doubts, told Meet the Press that, “everything we would do to get ready for climate change, to build this new green industry, would make us more respected, more entrepreneurial, more competitive, more healthy as a country.” 
To which Jonah Goldberg responded, “Thus Plato’s Noble Lie is resuscitated in a pas de deux of flimflammery. The diagnosis might be fake, but the cure will still fix your lumbago, whiten your teeth, and give your horse a shiny coat.” 
And I walked through the raging hypocrisy and outright fabrications embodied in the sales pitch for an agenda that was rebranded as pollsters dictated. When John Kerry cancelled the scheduled (by pure coincidence) Earth Day introduction of his cap-and-trade bill, he told the press it was because “this is not an environment bill.” Amending the Clean Air Act. Granting authority to the…EPA. Riddled with hundreds of references to “environment”, “greenhouse” and “pollution”.  
Not an environment bill. And, true enough, no one says it would detectably impact the climate. It was repackaged and introduced as the Kerry-Lieberman American Power Act.  It was now a jobs bill. His pollster told him so. 
And it would bring a jobs boom the likes of which we had never seen, though it had killed jobs everywhere; it would lower the price and increase the reliability and security of our energy supply, though the opposite had been proved true; and it would lower emissions as study after study indicates the opposite results, from the inefficiencies. 
Hey, man, back off. There’s a “cause” to push here, after all. By whatever means necessary. 
During the discussion that followed one attendee, a student at the nation’s most prestigious law school clearly unnerved by my challenging the climate agenda, if not by the brazen employment of untruths to justify employing the state’s police power, complained that I was merely making fun of flaws in their communication effort. In focusing on such details I wrongly ignored the larger problem that we must act. 
So, a movement being exposed as risibly dishonest in saying whatever might wash in order to get their way, a way which as I noted is leading to terrible human consequences in the European theater of operations where they are several years ahead of us, merely harps on a communications problem? 
No. This is a movement — someone once called it a “cause” — clearly not about what it says it’s about. After all, no one or no computer model on which they premise their cause claims that anything they’ve ever proposed, all of which is typically sold as salvation, would actually do anything about that in which name it is demanded. 
These are Alinskyites, schooled that the issue isn’t the issue. When I pointed that out at a Heartland event, a leftist journalist in the audience dedicated many words of outrage in response. Outrage grounded in (faux) morality. Outrage not that I would say that — she also went on to say that of course the issue isn’t the issue. But that I would say that. 
She had heard me recount the serial admissions of this by her ideological allies, but left that part out of her otherwise deathless essay which found room for anything and everything else. Not relevant. 
As always with this crowd, it’s one’s cause, or motivations, that determine the rightness of their words or deeds. Greenpeace said the same thing about how our replicating their FOIA request to the University of Virginia was, well, different than their identical effort. Sorry, their multiple efforts. Our “objective” was different, you see. A hypocrisy shared by the Washington Post and the academic and scientific establishments. 
This movement is quite plainly one infested with unethical actors. Climategates 1 and 2 exposed this. Fakegate affirmed it. The apologies for Fakegate cast it in stone. The political and policy dogmatists only adorn the stone with flowers. R.I.P. 2012. 
This is not a communications problem any more than what we have seen from Fakegate’s fallout represents science.

Foolish politicians driven by extreme green ideology are wasting Australia’s resources.



Australia’s nuclear resources are largely wasted. We have abundant geological potential for uranium and other nuclear fuels. We know how to explore and extract them, but with bans and restrictions that change every election and approval processes that take either some years or forever, only three mines are currently operating. Also, Australia is the only G20 country to ban clean, silent, low-emission nuclear power.



Australia’s waste and sterilisation of coal and oil shale resources is also an international disgrace. Solid hydrocarbon resources are very concentrated stores of value, but cannot be used without temporarily disturbing other resources such as soils, vegetation and stored water.



Freehold land rights throughout the British Commonwealth once included mineral rights and there was no conflict between landowners and miners. But avaricious governments stole those rights and the royalties that once went to freeholders now go to governments. This separation of surface rights from underground rights is the source of continual conflict. Greens then harnessed landowner resentment into anti-mining crusades.



Expanding national parks and heritage areas has been a powerful green tool to prevent exploration and sterilise coal and oil shale resources. As have the destructive laws that give priority to coal seam gas, water or arable land resources. Farms can be generously compensated to relocate, forests can be replanted, topsoils can be set aside or re-created and water and gas can be extracted prior to mining. But solid mineral and energy resources can only be mined or sterilised. All past civilisations have recognised this resource imperative.



Australia’s oil and gas resources are largely untested. There was great excitement and headline news in the past when oil/gas was discovered in places like Moonie, Barrow Island, Bass Strait and the Timor Sea. Alas, those exciting days are gone and **oil exploration is being slowly killed by green bans** , enquiries and the application of death-by-delay to every stage of the process.



Fracking has opened up huge shale-oil and gas resources in the USA. We can be sure that China, Russia, India and Brazil will soon follow. But of course, it is banned in Australia.



The EU drives the war on hydro-carbon energy. But France, with its nuclear power, can afford to despise carbon energy. As can Scandinavia and many other countries with hydropower, and Iceland with geothermal power. Germany is a green energy poster child – but it is German coal, French nuclear, Scandinavian hydro and Russian gas that keep the lights and heaters burning in Germany. Even the green-EU gets over 70% of its electricity from nuclear and hydrocarbons and about 17% from hydro. No country on Earth can rely entirely on wind and solar power but silly resource-rich Australia is going to try – all in a futile attempt to control global temperature.



Scattered tribes of aborigines once occupied Australia without using the coal, oil, gas or uranium beneath their feet. They mined stone tools and ochres and burned a lot of hydrocarbon fuel (biomass) to clear undergrowth, promote grass, fight enemies, trap and roast wildlife and warm their gunyahs. Australia’s Mega Fauna became extinct on their watch, probably unable to cope with aboriginal spears, fires and dingos plus stressful climate changes. Aboriginal fires produced heaps of CO2 and aerial pollution but they created vast grasslands supporting kangaroos, emus, bustards, parrots and finches.



History shows that a much smaller population could indeed survive in Australia without using mineral hydrocarbons, but life with zero man-made emissions would be grim.



And as our aborigines discovered, if we do not use Australia’s resources, someone else will.

"**A Â£20 a week uplift to universal credit has helped keep 700,000 people out of poverty during the pandemic and should remain in place beyond March, says a right-leaning think tank.**
Nearly 700,000 more people have fallen into poverty but there would be twice this number without the extra Â£20, says the Legatum Institute.
People who have lost jobs and have high housing costs are worst hit, it adds.
The government confirmed the uplift will be secure until March.
Universal credit claimants were given a Â£20-a-week boost in response to the coronavirus pandemic in April, but this is due to end by next April.
Campaigners have raised concerns that the chancellor did not commit to extend the extra payment in last week's spending review.
Legatum's warning is the latest to the government on the need for continued support for families and individuals caught up in the economic fallout from the pandemic.
For single mum Simone, the outlook is ""terrifying"".
She gave up her job as a sales supervisor in a clothes shop at the end of last year, hoping for a better-paid role in customer relations.
But since the lockdown began in March, finding a job has proved impossible.
""I'm very worried because there's a lot of uncertainty, especially on benefits... some days are really, really difficult,"" she says.
""Food has been difficult. Occasionally it has picked up a little bit. I have been able to do a little bit more of a weekly shop, but it is difficult making sure the money lasts for the whole month... and there are no luxuries.""
The idea of being unable to buy clothes and other essentials for her seven-year-old daughter is a major point of stress.
The pair live with Simone's mum but, as a care worker, she herself is on a low income, so they are still stretched financially - and then there's the issue of space, with three people in a two-bedroom flat.
""You're basically living on top of each other. We manage. We're grateful to have a roof over our heads but it is difficult... especially during lockdown when you're cramped indoors.""
Legatum says before the pandemic about 14.4 million people were estimated to be in poverty in the UK, according to a measure that looks at both income and unavoidable living costs, such as housing.
But its analysis suggests that during the pandemic another 690,000 were left struggling to pay bills and put food on the table.
It says younger and older workers with high housing costs have been hardest hit, as well as people with disabilities.
However, Legatum calculates that another 700,000 people have been kept out of poverty by the extra Â£20 a week, and fears many would be unable to cope if it was stopped.
""Our analysis shows that, at a time of crisis, government action can protect many of those who are vulnerable to poverty,"" said Legatum chief executive Baroness Philippa Stroud.
She told the BBC she wants to see the uplift continue beyond March because ""it takes a while to get yourself up and out and back into work"".
Sectors like hospitality where 81% have been furloughed or made redundant, could take a while to recover, she said, arguing that the Â£20 should remain long enough ""to see people through that process and to a place where they can work themselves out of poverty the other side"".
Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, urged the government ""to see sense"" as removing the uplift would mean ""taking Â£1,000 a year from Britain's families at the peak of the unemployment crisis"".
""This crisis has highlighted how important it is that we support each other but the Conservatives expect the poorest households to shoulder the burden,"" said Mr Reynolds.
A government spokesperson said: ""We are wholly committed to supporting people on lower incomes and have paid out more than Â£100bn in welfare support this year.
""The Â£20 increase to universal credit continues to be in place until the end of March 2021."""

Share this...FacebookTwitterHans Labohm sent an e-mail with sad news: Swiss scientist Peter A Ziegler has passed away.

Professor Dr Dr Peter A. Ziegler, 1928 – 2013. Photo credit: Ziegler family archive, GNU Free Documentation License.
Prof. Ziegler made a tremendous contribution to the fields of geology, energy, climate and our understanding of how the planet evolved.
Arthur Rörsch of the Netherlands has written the following notice:
Dear all,
In memoriam Prof. (em.) Dr Dr (hc.) Peter A. Ziegler
We were very sad to learn that the eminent scientist and amiable colleague Peter Ziegler passed away at his home in Switzerland on July 19th, 2013. He was recently the guest editor of the special E&E issue on “The AGW concept; a critical review”; E&E  24 (3,4) 2013. Until his last hour he continued to work on the follow-up he hoped that this publication would receive in the scientific community. He spent almost all day during a whole year on the preparation for this volume. He criticised all manuscripts very thoroughly but never lost his patience in the discussions with the authors.
His career consists of 33 years as exploration geologist with the petroleum industry, 30 of which with Shell, and 20 years of university teaching and research. He published widely in international journals and thematic volumes on processes controlling extensional and compressional intraplate tectonics and on the evolution of the lithosphere.

In 1992 he was appointed as Honorary Lecturer at the University of Basel and in 1996 as Titular Professor for Global Geology. He was awarded Honorary Doctor Degrees by the Moscow State University (1997) and the Technical University Delft (2001).
He was a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Sciences, the Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences and the Academia Europaea
He was a life member of the Bureau of the International Lithosphere Program and an honorary member of the Geological Society of London, the European Union of Geoscientists, the Geological Society of Poland and the American Association of Petroleum Geologists.
He received medal distinctions from the Belgian Geological Society, the Royal Geological and Mining Society of the Netherlands, the Geological Society of London, the Geological Society of Glasgow, the Geosciences Union, the German Geological Society and the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences.
He will be remembered by all his colleagues as a very gifted and critical scientist, with a broad interest in the natural sciences. He was continuously helpful to others without self-interest.”
There’s absolutely no doubt that Prof. Ziegler’s lifetime work has made a extremely positive impact on human living conditions and that this will be felt by future generations for years to come.

"**At Christmas, coronavirus restrictions will be eased to allow people to mix with a slightly wider circle of family and friends.**
Across the UK, people will be able to form ""bubbles"" of three households over a five-day period. Who can be in your bubble will depend on where you are.
Between 23 and 27 December, the three households in a ""Christmas bubble"" can mix indoors and stay overnight.
Northern Ireland has a window of 22 to 28 December, to allow time to travel between the nations.
Bubbles will be allowed to meet each other:
The bubbles will be fixed, so you will not be able to mix with two households on Christmas Day and two different ones on Boxing Day. Households in your Christmas bubble can't bubble with anyone else.
There will be no limit to the number of people who can join a bubble in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, although the English guidance says it should be ""as small as possible"".
But the Scottish government has said Christmas bubbles should contain no more than eight people. Children under 12 will not count in the total.
The rules about what counts as a household also depend on where you are.
In England if you have formed a support bubble with another household, that counts as one household, so you can join with two other households in a Christmas bubble.
The Scottish government guidance says any Christmas bubble should contain no more than one ""extended household"".
People who are self-isolating should not join a Christmas bubble. If someone tests positive, or develops coronavirus symptoms up to 48 hours after the Christmas bubble last met, everyone will have to self-isolate.
You will still be able to see other people who are not in your bubble outside your home, subject to the rules of the tier where you are staying.
Travel restrictions will be lifted to allow people to visit their families anywhere in the UK.
But the government has warned that there will not be extra public transport laid on.
It has urged people to plan their travel in advance.
You will not be allowed to go with your Christmas bubble to hospitality settings, such as pubs and restaurants, or to entertainment venues.
You can meet people outside your Christmas bubble, but only outside the home and in line with the tier rules of the area in which you are staying.
Places you can meet include parks, beaches, open countryside, public gardens, allotments and playgrounds.
Some traditional Christmas activities will also be allowed in England:
Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the relaxation of restrictions will not be extended to cover New Year's Eve.
She said: ""I know New Year is special for people, perhaps slightly more so in Scotland than in other parts of the UK, but the virus is still there.""
The planned firework displays in Edinburgh and London have been cancelled.
The virus will not call a truce because it is Christmas, and will be as contagious as at any other time, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said.
Even if it is within the rules, meeting friends and family over Christmas will be a ""personal judgement"", the government says.
People should consider the risks to themselves and others, particularly those who are vulnerable.
Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon urged people to use the Christmas rules responsibly and ""only if you think it is necessary"".
Children aged under 18 whose parents live apart are allowed to be part of two separate Christmas bubbles. This means they can see both parents without being counted as part of another household.
University students may return to their parents in the early December ""travel window"" and be counted as part of their household straight away.
But if parents have three or more grown-up children who are not at university, then they cannot all form a Christmas bubble with their parents.
Individual households can split for Christmas. So, if three people are sharing a home, they can all go and form separate Christmas bubbles with their families and come back to form a single household again afterwards.
In England, care home residents have been told not to take part in Christmas bubbles, while visits out of the home should only be considered by residents who are of ""working age"". This is because of the increased risk of the resident catching coronavirus, and spreading it to other vulnerable people when they return, the government says.
People are asked to consider whether visiting at the care home would ""provide meaningful contact in a safer way"", while residents who do leave will be tested and asked to isolate when they return."
"**New Covid guidance for hospitals could see more patients receiving face-to-face visits from loved ones.**
NHS Wales has given health boards and hospices flexibility to allow visits based on local levels of Covid-19.
Until now accompanying people to medical appointments and hospital visits have not been allowed, with a few exceptions.
It also allows for pregnant women in low Covid rate areas to take their partners to maternity appointments.
The Welsh Government said the new flexibility was ""due to the changing picture of coronavirus transmission across Wales, with significant variations in community transmission across different parts of the country and differences in the rate of nosocomial transmission"".
Room sizes, the ability to social distance and infection prevention and control will all be considered when considering visits to maternity wards.
Chief nursing officer for Wales, Jean White, said for women in very low areas of transmission ""it would almost be like it was before Covid"".
Angharad Phillips from Cardiff was on a maternity ward waiting to give birth to her first child as the first lockdown in Wales was announced in March.
""I just remember lots of women breaking down and crying quite loudly and wailing,"" she said.
The mum of eight month old Eli Gwen considers herself lucky to have had partner Gareth present at the birth but said it was both emotionally and physically difficult when he had to leave 20 minutes after she came out of surgery.
""I had an epidural and so I was immobile and having to pick baby up, shuffle to the edge of the bed, pick her up for feeding and changing when I was struggling already myself,"" she said.
The 37-year-old, who discharged herself after three days on the ward, said leaving was also surreal.
""It was very much like a chemical warzone. I remember being escorted down off the ward and my partner waiting outside...we looked at each other through the glass,"" she said.
""I remember thinking this is really bizarre and emotional, I just wanted to run and hug him.""
She said she was hugely relieved to learn there will be more flexibility for other families so they can ""go through that special moment together"".
Ms White said the most noticeable changes would be to maternity services.
""So for a very high risk (area) you may say the woman would only have support during childbirth and the very limited amount of contact with partner in the various stages,"" she said.
""In a very low area you would almost be like it was before Covid, you would have partner at most appointments and they would be able to stay longer...and allow more visiting and interaction.""
In other health areas, Ms White said the biggest change was the introduction of essential support assistants.
""If you're coming into hospital for appointments or you're going to be an inpatient, you can have somebody with you, whether that's because you have difficulty understanding information if you need an interpreter, or if you actually need some psychological support for you to cope, you're able to nominate that person.
""It could be a family member.""
Health Minister Vaughan Gething said he recognised that the restrictions on visiting has a huge impact on patients, their families and loved ones.
""It is important to remember that the virus has not gone away and the health, safety and wellbeing of patients, communities and NHS staff remain an absolute priority for both the Welsh Government and health care providers,"" he added.
The director of the Welsh NHS Confederation Darren Hughes said it was ""only right that we have the flexibility based on local circumstances in terms of visitors to hospitals where it is safe to do so"".
He added: ""This change gives our members the opportunity to take sensible, evidence-based precautions where necessary and it will also be a boost to patients and families who are desperate to support their loved ones.""
Nadia Higson, from the maternity charity AIMS, said any relaxation was going to be ""very welcome"".
""We've had a lot of calls and a lot of emails from people feeling extremely stressed about the fact that they are having to attend appointments on their own,"" she said.
""And the kind of situations [they discuss] are potentially going along and hearing bad news about their baby, potentially hearing that the sonographer can't hear the baby's heartbeat.""
She added: ""The more that partners are able to be involved to be supporting the women, and be involved themselves in the pregnancy, that can only be good."""
"Pity the poor consumer who wants to make informed decisions about eating cod. Conflicting reports on the state of cod stocks range from misinterpretation of the science – such as the Telegraph’s story that there were only 100 adult cod left in the North Sea (the correct figure was around 21 million) – to misunderstanding over the state of cod stocks in different territorial waters. The North East Arctic cod stock is currently booming and provides much of the cod consumed in the UK, while the North-west Atlantic cod fishery which collapsed 20 years ago has not yet recovered, and several other cod stocks remain at historically low levels. Fisheries management is complex, and reporting filled with errors and omissions only adds to consumers’ confusion. Television programme Masterchef stirred up a fuss this week after its website pointed viewers to the Marine Conservation Society’s guidelines for sustainably harvested fish. Scottish trawlermen were reported to be angered by the MCS’s classification of cod from the Irish and North Seas and from the west of Scotland as a “fish to avoid”. While the MCS does place cod from these waters into its highest danger category, the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation chief executive, Bertie Armstrong, said: Scottish fishing has tried extremely hard to be sustainable. Our beef about the Marine Conservation Society traffic light list of guidance is that it is superficial and illogical. If anybody buys fish in the United Kingdom then it has been fished within a quota and is entirely sustainable. That’s the measure of it. In fact the SFF comments referred only to North Sea cod, and not to the Irish or west of Scotland stocks as implied in the Guardian’s reporting. So, cod or no cod? No wonder the fish-eating public is confused. European fisheries management advice is provided by the International Commission for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) which bases its assessments on data from commercial fish landings and from research surveys. These data are used to reconstruct trends in historic stock size and fishing mortality and to forecast what the stock will do over the next few years at different levels of harvest. From the huge amount of publicly available reports available from ICES, here are charts showing the trends in cod spawning biomass in the North Sea, Irish Sea and to the west of Scotland. If the weight of mature fish in a stock (the spawning stock biomass) is reduced to too low a level it will not be able to replace the number of fish removed by fishing and natural predation. However, fish stocks cannot increase indefinitely due to natural ecological limits, an ecosystem’s “carrying capacity”. There is therefore an optimal amount of mature spawning fish which generate the maximum surviving offspring. If harvest rates are adjusted so that the spawning stock biomass is at this value then the fishing is said to be at “maximum sustainable yield”, and achieving this is the aim of current fisheries policy in many countries. So is North Sea cod being “sustainably harvested” at current levels? It depends what we mean by “sustainable fishing”. However, the widely accepted definition for a stock which has recovered, and so is sustainable in the long-term, is when the level of removals allows the spawning stock biomass to be at the level which will give maximum sustainable yields. According to the ICES estimates, fishing mortality on cod in the North Sea is currently still above this level. So regardless of a legal quota of cod for fishers to land, fishing mortality is still too high and the cod stock size in the North Sea is not yet at the level which will allow a long-term maximum sustainable yield. However, the quotas being set should allow the North Sea stock to continue to rebuild over time – they are not set so high that overfishing is likely to cause a further decline in the spawning stock biomass. It is certainly true that the UK industry has worked hard for many years to try and ensure that cod stocks recover. Many of the measures adopted have involved sacrifices from the industry, including the decommissioning of vessels, introduction of fishing gear modifications to reduce the by-catch of small cod and actions to avoid areas where young cod congregate. It seems these efforts are beginning to have some effect in the North Sea, as the stock assessment shows the amount of mature adults is now rising. In contrast there has been only limited improvement in the Irish Sea, and none at all in the west of Scotland. Why these stocks are not improving, compared with the North Sea cod, is not clear. Possible reasons include interactions with other fisheries, environmental changes or increased natural predation. There is no clear scientific answer yet although there is evidence of environmental changes such as rising sea temperature and changes to plankton. It has been suggested that these changes could be affecting the survival rates of young cod in particular, but there is no definitive proof. The steady recovery of cod in the North Sea since 2009 does show that the stocks can respond positively, but does this mean the Marine Conservation Society should change its consumer advice? If one accepts the targets for a recovered stock associated with maximum sustainable yield, then there is clearly still some way to go. Perhaps we need to describe fishing for cod in the North Sea at present levels as fishing ‘responsibly’, rather than ‘sustainably’. This would both acknowledge the vital role that the industry is playing in re-building the stock but also acknowledge that this stock is not yet at the level we want to see for long-term sustainability."
"For all the huge, hulking buildings of concrete and steel that house coal, gas or nuclear power stations, or towering 100-metre-tall wind turbines, generating electricity is in fact a very precise and quite delicate business.  Just small fluctuations in an electric current can wreak serious damage. Fortunately, the means of generating electricity provides its own protection against this. Unfortunately, the renewable energy technology we will use now and for the future removes this protection – with potentially disastrous results. Electricity is created by generators – rotating electromagnets that convert mechanical energy into electrical energy. In order to power an entire nation’s electricity grid, they must all be tuned to spin at the same speed. In the UK, this speed is a frequency of 50Hz – in other words, every electricity generator in the UK spins at 50 rotations per second, or 3,000rpm.  Even a relatively small deviation from 50Hz could destroy electrical equipment, result in blackouts, or even total grid failure. National Grid, the operating company responsible for maintaining the UK electricity supply, is obliged to prevent the grid frequency from moving by any more than just 1Hz in either direction, save in exceptional circumstances. Fortunately the spinning rotors of each generator carry their own inertia – an object’s tendency, after a force has been applied to it, to continue in motion even after the force is no longer applied. Taken together, the combined inertia of all of the nation’s electricity generators is extremely useful for maintaining stability. The loss of a large power station can mean an instant imbalance between electricity generation and electricity demand, by a gigawatt or more. The common reason is a fault that automatically trips a power plant offline for safety reasons, but equally the same would apply due to terrorist attack or natural disaster. For example, in 2008 two large UK power plants tripped within minutes of each other, resulting in blackouts. So when this immediate and major loss of electricity occurs, the first line of defence against a dangerous drop in system frequency that could lead to total grid failure is the inertia of the system. The inertia of all those rotating generators keep the system going at 50Hz, providing  valuable seconds with which to respond to the imbalance (in 2008, balance was restored by choosing to temporarily shut down parts of the grid). Without an immediate response, the system would collapse and need a full reboot (known as a “black start”), which would take days to restore power. Imagine a national power cut: no electricity at home or work. No internet, street lights, or transport logistics. No heating. Huge economic losses. Astute readers may disagree with the claim that every electricity generator rotates at 3,000rpm – what about wind turbines? And rightly so – a wind turbine rotating at 3,000rpm would be a sight to behold. A more refined statement is that conventional generators (think nuclear, coal, gas and oil) provide inertia while “asynchronous” generators, where the speed of rotation is dependent on the strength of the wind or tide, do not. In fact there are sources of electricity, like solar power or electricity imported from undersea high voltage cables, with no physical rotation at all. And so it should become clear that deploying this kind of energy generation poses a challenge. The more asynchronous generation in the system, the less inertia is available to provide valuable time in the event of a fault. This is becoming a problem, particularly in places where renewables make up a considerable proportion of the energy mix. Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland together have a target of 40% renewable electricity by 2020 and are on course to achieve it. But concerns over system inertia have led to a cap of 50% of demand on asynchronous, renewable forms of energy generation. In other words, if wind and solar generate more than half the demand, that excess is dumped and wasted. This solution is untenable in the long run. It’s inefficient to hold back zero-carbon, zero-fuel-cost electricity for the sake of running expensive and carbon-intensive fossil fuel power plants. Politically, it’s embarrassing, but there are ways around this – and some countries are taking the lead. System operators need to recognise that renewables can still add to system inertia through clever use of power electronics to supply a synthetic inertia that does the same job. The inertia of rotating generators can be thought of as additional kinetic energy that is transformed into electrical energy to maintain the frequency. A wind turbine already contains a rotating mass – the blades – so if it can be made to generate more power this will have the same frequency stabilising effect. The turbine controller can adjust the pitch of the blades, usually to ensure they remain at the most efficient speed as the wind changes. So, quickly altering blade pitch to generate more power in response to a failure on the grid would provide a temporary boost to counter a dangerous frequency dip.  The problem is simply one of capital expenditure for the generating company, as the extra control systems cost money – but taking the broader view, ensuring that more renewables do not lower system inertia to dangerous levels provides protection against much greater potential losses. In Germany, the framework is already in place that requires new wind farms to provide synthetic inertia. Another option, if politicians are wary of burdening energy companies with more costs, is energy storage. A lithium-ion battery can provide immediate power within milliseconds of a trip – effectively emulating the effects of conventional inertia, without moving parts. Nor do batteries need to be synchronised with the grid – providing the equivalent service of back-up power stations but without having to inefficiently run power plants at part load.   The solutions to the emerging challenges for electricity generation already exist. The key to unlocking them is to overcome entrenched conservative attitudes in the energy industry, and reassure regulators and system operators that building synthetic inertia into the grid can provide them same level of security, without cramping the deployment of more renewable technologies in the future."
"Barack Obama’s team watched Julia Gillard’s misogyny speech whenever they were “really annoyed” with Tony Abbott, one of the president’s senior advisers has revealed. Ben Rhodes, the former deputy national security adviser, has also described how Obama “went way off the script” to blast the Abbott government for climate inaction during a visit to Brisbane for the G20 summit in 2014. For his part, Rhodes described Abbott as being “tone deaf” on the climate issue in the lead-up to the Paris agreement and recalled the former prime minister as being “upset” about the US president’s forceful intervention on protecting the Great Barrier Reef. The behind-the-scenes tension between Obama and Abbott is laid bare in the latest episode of A Rational Fear, a news and politics comedy podcast. In an interview, Rhodes said he and others at the White House had regularly watched the 2012 video of Gillard declaring she would “not be lectured about sexism and misogyny” by Abbott. “I will tell you that whenever we were really annoyed with Tony Abbott, we would watch the video of that speech by Julia Gillard,” Rhodes said. “That speech got watched a lot in the Obama White House, let me just put it that way,” he added with a smile, but did not specify whether the president was one of the viewers. Rhodes said while Obama had been able to work positively with centre-right leaders including Germany’s Angela Merkel and Britain’s David Cameron, it was no secret that Abbott was “far from his favourite leader to begin with”. “What was frustrating with Abbott, you know, is he was kind of very sure of himself without really knowing what he was talking about,” Rhodes told the podcast hosts, Dan Ilic and Lewis Hobba. Obama had been “trying to get Australia to do some minimal stuff”, such as setting a target to reduce emissions by 2030 or providing funding for developing countries. At the time, the Guardian reported that Australia was resisting including language in the official G20 communique encouraging countries to make pledges to the Green Climate Fund, instead insisting the focus should be on spurring global economic growth. Rhodes said Obama’s team had prepared a paragraph about climate change for a speech on the sidelines of the G20 but when the president got to that portion “he just went way off the text, and was just basically blasting the Abbott government in ways that he almost never did on foreign soil and pointing out the Great Barrier Reef disappearing”. Obama told an audience at the University of Queensland that global heating threatened “the incredible natural glory of the Great Barrier Reef” and Australia, like the US, had to “step up”. “Abbott was upset,” Rhodes said. “You know, this was supposed to be this big stage for him hosting the G20. “But it’s like, well, look, if you want to host a G20, you’ve got to step up and be an international leader. And we’ve got everybody else kind of rallying around this effort to get to an ambitious climate agreement the next year in Paris, and Abbott was really one of the last holdouts dragging his feet.” Abbott used his own speech to the G20 leaders’ retreat to declare that his government had fulfilled its domestic-policy promises to the Australian people, including “that I would repeal the carbon tax, and that’s gone”. The final Brisbane communique included a call for “strong and effective action” on climate change."
"**Lancashire's council leaders are to submit a bid to government to introduce ""targeted"" mass Covid-19 testing.**
The county is set to move into tier three restrictions when the second national lockdown ends on Wednesday.
However, the area's infection rates vary largely, with Pendle registering 306.1 cases per 100,000 people, while Lancaster recorded 115 per 100,000.
Public health director Dominic Harrison said there would be a sharper focus on testing in areas with high cases.
The government previously said mass rapid testing schemes, which will ask all residents with or without coronavirus symptoms to take a test, would be rolled out to 67 more areas in England.
The scheme was piloted in Liverpool, which is now set to drop down into tier two restrictions after Health Secretary Matt Hancock praised the city's ""remarkable"" fall in infection rates following its introduction.
Areas to the east of the county, including Pendle, Blackburn and Rossendale, reported infection rates of more than 280 per 100,000 in the latest government figures for 25 November, far above western areas, such as Lancaster, Wyre and West Lancashire, where rates fell below 130.
Council leaders had asked for the county to be split into two tiers, reflecting these different rates, but the idea was rejected.
Mr Harrison said the government would formally offer Lancashire ""a mass testing option"" on Wednesday, which he expected to be a reduced version of Liverpool's model.
He said he expected ""some Army support"" for any testing regime, adding the county would ""do something similar [to] but not the same as Liverpool"" and ""target some of our mass testing"" on groups ""where we know the infection rates are highest"" such as a ward within a local authority ""or a group like the homeless"".
He said any testing would ""go ahead across the whole of Lancashire, but it will be targeted on the highest risk areas"".

Small business owners aren't typically lawyers, though they are undoubtedly familiar with the thousands of inscrutable pages of new regulations published every year in the Federal Register. Instead of devoting their energies to growing their businesses, owners must expend significant time and resources ensuring compliance with these voluminous and often vague regulations, with costly fines looming as consequences for failure to comply. “The Fourth Branch & Underground Regulations,” a new report by the National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB), details the processes by which administrative agencies skirt “notice-and-comment” requirements to impose new interpretations of rules that avoid the constitutional system of checks and balances. Unfortunately, operating on this shifting field disproportionately affects small businesses, as they are most poorly equipped to lobby for favorable rules.   
  
The Administrative Procedure Act established “notice-and-comment” as a means for regulated businesses to voice concerns with or offer suggestions to improve proposed regulations. However, “non-legislative rules,” or “general statements of policy” and “interpretive rules,” are not required to undergo this process. This grants administrative agencies – the “Fourth Branch” of government – significant leeway in how “legislative rules” are interpreted and implemented, essentially giving them law making power. The recent Supreme Court ruling in _Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Association _allows agencies not only to interpret rules without undergoing “notice-and-comment,” but also the ability to change their interpretation at any point. (Cato filed an amicus brief in the case.)    
  
Without a required need for transparency, agencies are thus free to issue “underground regulations” that impose serious and sudden rules on regulated businesses. NFIB examines four ways in which these “underground rules” are established: executive orders, guidance documents, amicus filings, and enforcement actions. Recognizing the potential dangers of this “underground” system of lawmaking, NFIB argues that “the regulated public should have a right to voice concerns over any newly announced rules, policy, or administrative interpretation of law that may impose _affirmative regulatory burdens_ on individuals or businesses” and urges agencies to “allows some opportunity for notice-and-comment on all new rules imposing liabilities or other regulatory burdens – without regard to quantifiable compliance costs.”   
  
Freed from congressional oversight and the beneficiary of considerable judicial deference, administrative agencies can pursue ideological agendas without the general public even being aware regulations are being instituted. One way this is achieved is by filing an _amicus_ brief in a case between two private parties. An agency can offer the court its authoritative interpretation of a rule -- though given the ruling in _Perez_ , the agency can change that interpretation in a later brief in another case or court.



For example, NFIB’s report details the process by which the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) reclassified McDonalds as a joint-employer with it franchisees, upending the franchise model and thirty years of established rules. In a June 2014 _amicus_ brief, the NLRB announced it’s plans to reinterpret its “joint-employer” rule to “treat franchisors as joint-employers with franchisees, or other independent contracting firms, so long as they exert ‘significant control’ over the same employees.” The NLRB further announced that significant control could be shown “simply by demonstrating that a franchisor has significant control over every-day business operations, without regard to whether the franchisor has exercised any control over personnel decisions.” Under previous rules, influence over personnel decisions dictated whether franchisors were considered “joint-employers,” so given McDonalds franchisees had control over hiring and disciplinary practices, McDonalds was not considered a joint-employer.   
  
Following this amicus brief, the NLRB filed thirteen complaints – enforcement actions – against McDonalds, alleging misconduct on the part of some of it franchisees, presenting McDonalds with a choice: loosen quality control over its franchisees (and thus risk brand degradation) or radically alter its business model and become more involved in the personnel decisions of its franchisees. While McDonalds might not be the most sympathetic victim of underground rule making, the rule change also affects its franchisees, “threaten[ing] a successful collaborative business model that has enabled many entrepreneurs to launch their own business.”   
  
Readers of this blog will be familiar with ongoing litigation over the current administration’s use of executive actions to pursue its immigration policy and EPA rule-making to further its climate agenda -- let alone the ongoing dispute between the House of Representatives and the president over the implementation of the Affordable Care Act -- but NFIB’s report offers numerous examples of how “underground regulation” affects businesses of all sizes in ways that don't gain media attention.

"The European Parliament has voted in a draft law aimed at halving the use of plastic bags across the continent by 2017, and further reducing them by at least 80% by 2019. This positive move is aimed at curbing the use of very thin plastic bags of less than 50 microns (0.05mm), which most often end up as flyblown litter in trees or break apart to be eaten by wildlife. The suggested measures include levies on bags, taxes, and compulsory replacements with biodegradable alternatives. There have been some successes already, in Ireland and Denmark, for example. In research colleagues and I published in the Journal of Business Ethics, we found that individuals, government institutions, and large organisations all have a role to play in encouraging a change of behaviour towards ethical consumerism. This step forward by the European Parliament should encourage governments to act decisively and pass laws to accelerate the reduction in the use of wasteful and polluting plastic bags.  In February 2014, the UK government’s cross-party Environment Audit Committee made a call for all shops to be included in plans to introduce a 5p charge on plastic carrier bags in England. A similar scheme will be introduced in Scotland this autumn. Evidence from Ireland, where a plastic bag tax (“plastax”) in 2002 led to a 94% drop in bag use within months and raised millions of euros in levies. In Wales, a similar levy cut the use of single use bags by up to 96%. Northern Ireland reported a slightly smaller but still significant reduction of around 80%. But a sustained change in behaviour towards the use of plastic bags will require clear and concise action and a joined-up approach to tackling the problem. We found that supermarkets clearly had a key role in reducing the use of single-use carrier bags – the sort targeted by the European Parliament. The majority of respondents in our survey said they began using reusable “bags for life” in around 2008, which coincided with the introduction of the voluntary agreement between the British Retail Consortium, leading supermarkets and governments to reduce single-use carrier bags. Since the voluntary agreement ended in 2009, there has been a slow but steady increase in their use. We also found that although 80% of respondents claim to own a bag for life, almost a third still regularly use free single-use plastic bags, which demonstrate that there is still a gap between attitudes and behaviour. Even though a vast majority of people say they own a bag for life, with a significant number claiming to do so for environmental reasons, many are still left lying around at home, forgotten and unused. More needs to be done to reduce the gap between people’s intentions and their actions. For example, initiatives such as supermarkets texting their customers to remind them to bring their own bags have proved to be very successful. According to WRAP, the proportion of single-use bags as a percentage of total bags issued has remained stable since 2006, with single-use bags accounting for 95% and reuseable bags for life 5%. A unified effort from the European Parliament, together with member-state governments and major retailers could have a significant impact on the number of single-use bags being used. Their recommendations to use a combination of taxes and levies, marketing restrictions and bans to curb their use will be a positive step forward."

Guest Post by Caleb Shaw
Ice core sample from Antarctica - Image: British Antarctic SurveyPreface:  Climate Scientists and School Girls – A humorous description of a layman trying to investigate the little bubbles in ice cores,  involving both the actual science,  and a layman’s amazement over the politics.
My last layman’s paper generated a wonderful and polite peer-review from WUWT readers, teaching me a great deal, not the least of which was that I should avoid using the word “pneumatic” when I mean “hydraulic.”  It is in the hopes of receiving a similar polite response that I will venture to ask some questions about a Climate Gospel, even though it is a Climate Gospel that earns most questioners a severe pummeling.
I will attempt to be cheerfully naïve, however in some situations that is not enough.  A Texan can be cheerful and naïve all he wants, but, when he is making cheeseburgers out of a Holy Cow in a Hindu village, he is liable to find he has a riot on his hands.  There are some things Thou Shall Not Do.  Sometimes Thou Shall Not Even Question.
My questions involve those little bubbles in ice cores.  It may seem a harmless subject,  but those little bubbles are a basement upon which a great many papers have been written, and upon which a great many grants depend.  Dare you question the little bubbles,  and all sorts of hell breaks lose.

In fact if you poke around the subject of those little bubbles your don’t-go-there alarm will start to go off,  along with your I-don’t-have-time-for-this alarm, (if you have one.) However sometimes a man’s got to do what he least wants to do.
As anyone who has raised teenaged daughters understands, there are times when you have “to go there,” despite the fact your don’t-go-there alarm is blaring, and times you have to make time, even though your I-don’t-have-time-for-this alarm is howling.
Daughters teach a man that, despite all efforts to ban bullying and legislate spirituality, ostracism remains mysteriously crucial to schoolgirl adolescence, and the same daughter who was sobbing about being ostracized on Monday may be gleaming with glee over a nemesis being ostracized on Tuesday.  Fathers often have to make sense of this emotional and blatant hypocrisy, even if it means turning off the TV just before the big game.
You may be wondering what this has to do with little bubbles in ice caps.  I don’t blame you, but bear with me.
Please notice that, in the above example, it is the daughters doing the teaching. They are teaching their fathers about wild swings of emotion involved with having a non-scientific and supposedly irrational thing called “a heart.”
Scientists don’t like being compared with schoolgirls, because, in humanity’s constant battle to balance the heart and head, Science represents the purified essence of the head.  However just because Science focuses on the head does not mean Scientists have no hearts. “If you prick them, do they not bleed?”
The only thing a scientist is suppose to be passionate about is being dispassionate, however in their quieter moments most will confess there have been times they’ve failed to be totally objective, and have slapped themselves on the forehead because they were blind to some obvious truth staring them in the face.  However even this humbleness underscores an egotism they have about being more objective than most people.  Also, if anyone is going to slap their forehead, they prefer it to be themselves.  They don’t like it one bit when you compare them with schoolgirls.  They get all emotional if you accuse them of being emotional.
Nothing makes people angry faster than accusing them of being angry when they’re not.  A calm, peaceful soul can be reduced to frothing and to spitting snakes, because no one likes being falsely accused.  You can get them even madder if , after you have angered them by accusing them of being angry when they weren’t, you look smug and say, “See?  I told you that you were angry.”
Scientists are no different, and if you tweak them in the right way, then they, who are so focused on the head, will lose their heads and demonstrate they have tremendous hearts. Sometimes the revealed heart is tremendously good, but sometimes it is tremendously otherwise.
Scientists do not like being tweaked in this manner, because that is not what science is all about.  Raving is beneath the dignity of science.  However, when politics enters the hallowed halls of science, scientists get tweaked plenty,  for study is no longer funded for its intrinsic value.  A scientist may abruptly be defunded due to an election.  Men are jarred awake in their Ivory Towers, as they are confronted by a mentality befitting thirteen-year-old schoolgirls:  It matters who is “in” and who is “out.”
Therefore, despite all my shortcoming concerning Physics classes I never took, (or preferred to spend dreaming out the window during,) I do have an understanding others lack, as I approach the delicate subject of little bubbles in an icecap’s ice, because I have been the father of schoolgirls, and know the politics of ostracization and marginalization, and what such things do to the human heart and to human tempers.
One can study both the little bubbles, and also the path to marginalization, by taking a hard look at the travails of Zbigniew Jaworowski.
http://www.nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=25526754-e53a-4899-84af-5d9089a5dcb6&amp;p=3
And also looking at a paper he wrote:
http://folk.uio.no/tomvs/esef/Jaworowski%20CO2%20EIR%202007.pdf
A quick perusal of Jaworoski’s paper taught me that all sorts of complex chemistry may (or may not) being going on in those innocent little bubbles,  but most of the chemistry was over my head.  Not that I couldn’t understand, if I put my mind to it, but I actually had some simple questions, and, until I got those simple questions answered, it seemed I’d be getting ahead of myself if I tackled the complex chemistry.
Therefore I headed to Wikipedia.  Not that I trust it as a source, but it often has links to truer sources, and one hopes Wikipedia gets the most basic facts right.
However even in terms of the most basic facts I seemed to be getting a wide variety of answers.  For example,  how long does it take fluffy snow to be compacted to ice with little bubbles in it?  The answers I got ranged from sixty to five-thousand years.
Likely this variance occurred due to the fact Antarctica includes some areas of very dry desert, where snow accumulates very slowly, whereas Greenland is subject to  Atlantic gales, and snow can accumulate very quickly.  However it was unclear which data-set was being referred to, and that made things rough for a layman like myself.  I had to keep switching back and forth from source to source, and then, when I went back to find an important link at the Wikipedia source, “Greenland ice cores,” just a week ago, I found it had vanished,  and instead there was this message:
06, 12 September 2011 Timothy’s Cannes (talk | contrib.) deleted “Greenland ice cores” ‎ (Mass deletion of pages created by Marshallsumter: questionable creation by now-indeffed editor: see
http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=449961454&amp;oldid=449959111)
As a scientific researcher, my conclusion at this point was, “Oh, Drat.”
Unless you are the sort who rushes in where angels fear to tread, do not, I repeat, DO NOT go to that Wikipedia message board.  I only went because I wanted to see what ice core data “Mashallsumter” got wrong.  As far as I could tell from the morass I waded out into,  the reason “Greenland ice cores” was deleted had nothing to do with the data on that  page,  but rather had to do with some strange beliefs “Mashallsumter” was expressing, and strange research he was involved with, elsewhere in the Wiki-world.
I didn’t much want to know about the fellow’s beliefs and activities, as it seemed to have very little to do with little bubbles in ice, but I couldn’t help notice the marvelous effort that was made to throw “Mashallsumter” from the hallowed halls of Wiki. He was found guilty of both the crime of being original, and the crime of copying.  (What is the third alternative?)  In any case,  “Greenland ice cores” was history, and was history in a hurry, and was deleted history, which hardly counts as history because you can’t find it.
At this point I almost gave up my research, because it occurred to me that something about the study of little bubbles in ice cores makes people weird.  I did not want to become weird.  However my wife reassured me I had nothing to fear, because I already am weird, and that gave me the courage to forge onwards.
part two tomorrow…

"**Drinkers in tier two areas of England could order a Scotch egg with their pint to keep in line with post-lockdown rules, a cabinet minister has said.**
Under new restrictions from Wednesday, pubs in those high risk areas can only open if they function as a restaurant.
And alcohol can only be served as part of a ""substantial meal"".
Environment Secretary George Eustice told LBC Radio that Scotch eggs would constitute such a meal ""if there were table service"".
Downing Street has not ruled out tier two drinkers being able to order a Scotch egg, but would not set out the difference between a snack and a meal.
The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: ""I'm obviously not going to get into the detail of every possible meal.
""But we've been clear: bar snacks do not count as a substantial meal but it's well established practice in the hospitality industry what does.""
Pubs and restaurants are currently closed across England, apart from for takeaways.
Mr Eustice said the ""substantial meal"" provision in tier two was ""understood very much by the restaurant trade"".
He said: ""I think a Scotch egg probably would count as a substantial meal if there were table service.
""Often that might be as a starter but yes I think it would, but this is a term that's understood in licensing... you can have the concept of a table licence for alcohol that also requires you to serve a substantial meal.
""That is the model that is being followed.""
When England's current lockdown ends, the rules will change according to where you live.
In **tier one** , medium level, people can meet inside or outside in groups of up to six.
In **tier two** regions, pubs and restaurants must shut at 23:00 GMT, with last orders an hour earlier.
You can only socialise inside with people you live with, or those in your support bubble if you live alone. Groups of up to six can meet outside, but social distancing must be adhered to.
In **tier three** , very high risk areas, you cannot mix with anyone outside your household either indoors or in pub gardens or private gardens. Hospitality venues - such as bars, pubs, cafes and restaurants - must stay closed, except for delivery and takeaway services.
Most of England is in tier two or three, with only Cornwall, the Isle of Wight and Isles of Scilly in tier one.
Mr Eustice added that there had been issues with pubs ""where you had large groups of people congregating and actually not maintaining social distancing, they were just drinking"".
""They were more likely to maintain social distancing sat down and having a meal,"" he said.
On Sky News, Mr Eustice was asked whether people in tier two would have to leave the pub as soon as they had finished their meals.
The environment secretary said people could finish their drinks, but should not have a ""small meal and then sit at the table all night ordering drinks"".
It comes after Downing Street suggested drinkers visiting pubs in tier two regions would have to leave once they had finished their meal.
The government's latest guidance for hospitality in tier two states: ""Venues must close unless they operate as if they were a restaurant.
""This means serving substantial meals, like a main lunchtime or evening meal. They may only serve alcohol as part of such a meal.""
Meanwhile, pubs, restaurants and cafes in Wales will be banned from serving alcohol from Friday and will be forced to close at 18:00 GMT, under new rules to tackle a surge in coronavirus cases.
The concept of a ""substantial meal"" is not actually a new one in pubs, bars and restaurants.
It's an extension of the law that covers 16 and 17 year olds drinking alcohol in pubs with table meals.
In October, under England's previous three-tiered system, there was confusion over the definition of a ""substantial meal"".
Under those restrictions, it was only pubs and bars in tier three areas that faced extra curbs - and were forced to close unless they were serving substantial meals.
Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick responded by saying that a ""plated meal"" of a Cornish pasty with chips or a side salad would count as a ""normal meal""."

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhat follows is just a list media reports on the German Umweltbundesamt abusing its power by singling out, naming and defaming climate skeptics in a 122 page pamphlet that was funded by tax payers. It’s for your reference and hopefully it will help German readers.
Photo right: German Environment Agency defamatory pamphlet
When a large government agency like the UBA uses its massive resources to single out, villify and literally spread lies about private individuals in attempt to marginalize and injure their repuation, solely because they have a different opinion on an issue, then it has to be taken as a very troubling development. When was this last used in Germany, we have to ask.
The list is not complete, and links of course can be added. Sorry, most are in German. But the NoTricksZone articles are in English and talk about the German articles.
The latest real development occurred on May 27, with the German Journalists Association publicly demanding that the UBA recall it’s pamphlet and that Minister Peter Altmaier officialy apologize to the German journalists named in the pamphlet.

"The list of the natural world’s most extraordinary places, UNESCO’s World Heritage List, gained its 1,000th entry this week with the addition of the Okavango Delta in northern Botswana. To be chosen for the UNESCO list a site must be deemed to have  “outstanding universal value”.  It is fitting that the delta should be such a landmark choice as it is quite simply unique: a wetland located in a desert, a delta that does not flow into the sea. This may sound improbable, but actually it provides an exceptional example of how biological, hydrological, biogeochemical and climatic processes have interacted to give us an ecosystem of outstanding importance and amazing biological diversity. The Okavango Delta is unusual in many respects. In October every year, rain falling in the highlands of Angola flows down the Cubango and Cuito rivers that, at the border between Angola and Namibia, join to form the Okavango River. This pulse of water, which accounts for over 60% of water entering the delta, flows slowly downstream over the course of four to seven months, reaching the northern part of the delta between February and May.  The pulse of water enters the delta through a broad valley in northern Botswana called the panhandle. Here the water is relatively deep and fast-flowing, cutting through the Kalahari sands, before a perpendicular geological fault caused by tectonic activity causes the water to spread slowly out into a fan, reaching the southern regions of the delta by August-September. In the southern hemisphere these are winter months, and in this particular region it is also the dry season. Therefore, the maximum flood extent actually occurs at the driest point of the year. This pulse of water causes the size of the delta to fluctuate dramatically, approximately doubling its size from 6,000km2 to 12,000km2 every year during the dry season. Local rainfall during the summer months accounts for less than 40% of the delta’s river flow, but still plays an important role in influencing the extent of the area that’s flooded by the delta. Together they ensure local wildlife have water with which to thrive for much of the year, turning the delta into a huge green oasis that provides habitats on land and water for abundant plants and animals. Another remarkable feature of the delta is that, in the blazing heat of the desert, 98% of its water is lost through evaporation and transpiration (water taken up through plants and evaporating from their leaves). This is another paradox of the delta, that its waters remain fresh and not saline even with a strong sub-tropical sun. This is due to a complex set of interactions, only recently understood, which involve termites, trees and over 150,000 islands. Most islands in the delta are thought to originate from tree saplings growing on termite mounds. As the trees grow, water and solutes are drawn up from the ground into plants and released through transpiration. This causes the water table to drop over time, which draws in water from the surrounding floodplains to replace it, and so keeps the area replenished with fresh water.  Salts concentrate under the islands creating zones of hyper-saline soils in which few organisms can survive, but as the concentrations of salts under the islands increases, the salts become sufficiently dense and heavy that they sink to the bottom, effectively ensuring a layer of fresh water above.   The Okavango Delta is one of Africa’s few remaining pristine wetlands, and since 1997 it has been classified as the world’s largest Wetland of International Importance. It has seen little damage from human activity, partly due to its nutrient-poor waters that result in low fish yields, and partly from a tourism policy that generates considerable income with minimal impact.  However, these long periods of available water and the delta’s nutrient-rich grasslands and floodplains have given rise to blossoming life, one Africa’s greatest concentrations of wildlife: the world’s largest population of elephants, hippos, and many threatened species such as the wild dog, black and white rhinos, and cheetahs. A great number of the 450 species of birds recorded on the delta are also globally threatened, such as slaty egrets and wattled cranes. This diversity is no accident; it is closely linked to the exceptional diversity of habitats caused by the unique dynamics of the pulse of floodwaters during the driest season.  Natural rainfall variation and the region’s internal hydrology mean there is always variation in the size and extent of the floodwaters. For example, after a period of contraction in the late 1990s-2000s the last few years have seen the delta flood to an extent not seen since the 1960s. It is perhaps inevitable that a warmer world will affect the region, and although the effects are not well understood, preliminary results suggest that floodwaters will decline.  But another clear and present danger, and one whose effects might be felt much sooner, is the threat posed to water and wildlife by the Botswanan government’s granting of 41 mineral licenses for diamonds, base metals, and oil in the Okavango Delta earlier this year. Even on the UNESCO list, nothing can be taken for granted."

Dr Nir J. Shaviv is a well-known astrophysicist with over [100 scientific papers to his credit](http://old.phys.huji.ac.il/~shaviv/cv/cv.html#refer) and he is currently chairman of the Racah Institute of Physics at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. 



I think it’s safe to say that Dr. Shaviv knows a thing or two about science and how it is done. One of his specialties is studying [the effect that cosmic rays have on the earth’s climate](http://old.phys.huji.ac.il/~shaviv/Ice-ages/GSAToday.pdf). So just to make it clear. Dr. Nir Shaviv is a **well-respected scientist** who has published peer-reviewed research specifically about earth’s climate.[…]



[…] while I certainly don’t have to agree with the conclusions of any given expert, I do have to at least try to understand the data the expert has collected and why he or she thinks they point to a certain conclusion. If I don’t do that, I am no longer thinking scientifically. After all, the only way you can make a scientific conclusion is to **consider** _ **all of the data**_ **.** Ignoring data because I don’t agree with the source is not scientific; it is emotional.



Why am I bringing this up? Because last night, I was scrolling through a news feed and noticed a _Forbes_ article entitled, “Global Warming? An Israeli Astrophysicist Provides Alternative View That Is Not Easy To Reject.” Obviously, that title was very interesting to me, so I clicked on [the link](https://www.forbes.com/sites/doronlevin/2019/08/09/global-warming-an-israeli-astrophysicist-provides-alternative-view-that-is-not-easy-to-reject). Unfortunately, what I found was a message that said:



 _After review, this post has been removed for failing to meet our editorial standards._



 _We are providing our readers the headline, author and first paragraphs in the interest of transparency._



 _We regret any inconvenience._



This seemed rather odd to me, so I decided to do some digging. What I found did not reflect well on _Forbes_.



As Erica Albright [says](https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/effd5b2f-cb9d-4fe0-8aed-2b331dbd8afa) in _The Social Network_ :



 _The internet is not written in pencil, Mark. It’s written in ink._



Knowing this, I went searching for the article that _Forbes_ claims does not meet its editorial standards. I used my favorite tool for this purpose (mostly because of the name), [The Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20190809111919/https://www.forbes.com/sites/doronlevin/2019/08/09/global-warming-an-israeli-astrophysicist-provides-alternative-view-that-is-not-easy-to-reject/). I found the article and read it in its entirety. What I found was an excellent article that clearly explains one respected scientist’s view of the global warming hysteria that certain high-profile scientists and politicians are promoting. Since then, [it has been posted elsewhere](https://learn-about-global-warming.blogspot.com/2019/08/global-warming-israeli-astrophysicist_9.html), in a form that is probably easier for most browsers to read.



Please read the article for yourself. While reading, try to spot what caused _Forbes_ to decide that it didn’t meet their editorial standards.[…]



[…] As far as I can tell, _Forbes_ decided the article didn’t meet its “editorial standards” because it failed to support that narrative.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe outrage over a defamatory pamphlet published by Germany’s version of the EPA, the Umweltbundesamt (UBA), has been spreading. The UBA is headed by Jochen Flasbarth, a former environmental activist with strong ties to Germany’s radical green party. It is a department within the German Ministry of Environment.
 
Merkel’s Environment Minister Peter Altmaier defends pamphlet which he admits he has not even read yet. Photo credit: Rudolf Simon, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license.
The brochure singles out and defames US and German climate science skeptic scientists and journalists, claiming they are spreading false information and half truths.
Moreover, the pamphlet claims that the skeptic scientists are not real climate scientists and are thus disqualified to make assessments on climate science. Thus they are best ignored.
End of career.
But now the scandal and outrage have reached the attention of Flasbarth’s boss, Angela Merkel’s Environment Minister Peter Altmaier, so reports the online Die Welt here. Altmaier has commented on the scandal for the first time. Tomorrow Die Welt Sunday print edition will feature of full interview with Minister Altmaier on the topic.

Today the online Die Welt here offers a preview. If the preview is anything to go by, then we can assume that the German government so far thinks it’s okay for them to issue a pamphlet that defame anyone they do not like. That would be a very nasty development. Die Welt writes:
Federal Environment Minister Peter Altmaier (CDU) has defended a controversial brochure on climate change from the Federal Environment Agency (UBA). ‘What’s decisive for me is whether legal errors have been made and whether the political position of the Federal Government is correctly reflected,’ Altmaier said. “
At that point we need to recall that Altmaier is a very polished lawyer. I’m not sure what he means to say here. Does he mean to say that it is the position of the German government to defame and ruin the reputation of people, so long it’s done legally? I really do hope that defaming individuals has not become the official position of the German government.
Altmaier also tells Die Welt that he did not personally approve the pamphlet and that he relies on the competence of Flasbarth and his staff. But that is precisely the problem. The UBA has gotten so activist and ideological that you cannot rely on them doing the right and fair thing. It’s renegade and it is now time for Altmaier to get that house back in order. The pamphlet confirms that.
In the Die Welt online article it becomes clear that Minister Altmaier has not even read the pamphlet up to now, and thus is not aware of its dubious and highly confrontational content. Welt writes:
The editor in chief of the ‘Welt’ Group, Jan-Eric Peters, then asked Altmaier via Twitter: ‘Is this the new style of your press work?’ Altmaier answers, so far I’m only aware of ‘snips of text’ and requested: ‘Please send me a copy and I’ll check it over.'”
We can only speculate what is going to happen next. What should happen is: “Altmaier will read the pamphlet published by his underling Flasbarth at the UBA, be shocked, and then move to clean up the renegade UBA house. But we live in a political world, and so things will likely processed as follows instead: Altmaier will read the pamphlet published by his underling Flasbarth at the UBA, be shocked, but insist nothing wrong was done – and then promote the responsible persons to higher positions, but out of the UBA.

Guest post by Indur M. Goklany 
Over at the Wall Street Journal a group of pedigreed individuals headed by Dr. Kevin Trenberth argue: 

Do you consult your dentist about your heart condition? In science, as in any area, reputations are based on knowledge and expertise in a field and on published, peer-reviewed work. If you need surgery, you want a highly experienced expert in the field who has done a large number of the proposed operations.

Wrong answer!! 
If you need surgery you DON’T want “a highly experienced expert in the field who has done a large number of the proposed operations.” What you want is “a highly experienced expert in the field who has CONVINCING EVIDENCE THAT HIS OR HER OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL!”  
And if before I go to a dentist, I would like evidence that the dentist does not pull the wrong teeth (even on occasion).  
Unfortunately, there is no convincing evidence that climate models can successfully predict future climate — and I mean “climate” not just “temperature.” [The latter is just one aspect of the climate and for many impacts it may not even be the most relevant.] 

Climate models, which are the source of the apocalyptic vision of global warming, have not been validated using data that were not used in their development. Even the US Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) and the IPCC acknowledge as much. Specifically, the IPCC does not say that “all” features of current climate or past climate changes can be reproduced, as a reliable model of climate change ought to be able to do endogenously. In fact, it notes: 

“… models still show significant errors. Although these are generally greater at smaller scales, important large scale problems also remain. For example, deficiencies remain in the simulation of tropical precipitation, the El Niño-Southern Oscillation and the Madden-Julian Oscillation (an observed variation in tropical winds and rainfall with a time scale of 30 to 90 days).” (AR4WG1, p. 601). 

And the CCSP has this to say in its 2008 publication, Climate Models: An Assessment of Strengths and Limitations. A Report by the U.S. Climate Change Science Program and the Subcommittee on Global Change Research: 

“Climate model simulation of precipitation has improved over time but is still problematic. Correlation between models and observations is 50 to 60% for seasonal means on scales of a few hundred kilometers.” (CCSP 2008:3).  
“In summary, modern AOGCMs generally simulate continental and larger-scale mean surface temperature and precipitation with considerable accuracy, but the models often are not reliable for smaller regions, particularly for precipitation.” (CCSP 2008: 52). 

So before one pulls society’s economic teeth, validate the models or else you could end up pulling society’s economic teeth in error.  
In the medical profession this would be known as “evidence-based medicine.” Exactly the same principle should apply to climate change remedies. We should insist on nothing less.

Jacinda sees herself as a climate warrior. Let’s face it… climate change is her generation’s ‘nuclear moment’, even though she does not seem to understand that there have been no nuclear explosions (Thank God) since 1945, other than tests, and they have mostly been condemned. The North Koreans continue with tests from time to time, but they are simply trying to send a message to the world that they might be able to… not that anyone, other than the poor unfortunates who live in Seoul, are particularly worried.



The truth about Jacinda, however, is that she is all talk. This will not come as a surprise to most of you. After all, she has talked big about Kiwibuild, the homeless, mental health and cancer drugs but all of these problems just seem to get bigger and bigger under this government.



That is because all Jacinda seems to be able to do is to talk about problems, rather than provide solutions.



She’s good at it. Remember Kiwibuild. Remember mental health. Remember her speech last year about how _#metoo_ should become _#wetoo_ and she has an alleged rapist in her own office. None of the #metoo supporters has said a word because it is okay if the left does it.



All she has done at the Pacific Forum is talk. She has done nothing to make New Zealand lead the way on climate change, but boy, she has talked us up big time.



Don’t get me wrong. I think we are wrecking our economy enough with the Zero Carbon Bill, and the Greens’ proposals to take us back to the Stone Age. But Jacinda is well aware that she will lose the next election badly if she really hammers agriculture, so she has mostly left it out of our emissions reductions scheme.



Agriculture is the backbone of our economy, as Jacinda knows only too well. Coal is the backbone of Australia’s economy. But what has she done? She has called for the Australians to reduce their economic activity around coal.



Demanding Australia abandon its coal production and exports for the good of the climate in the ­Pacific is akin to asking New Zealan­d to give up its love affair with sheep.



New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is naive if she believe­s such moves would be economically feasible or in the best interests of regional stability.



But it has only been possible because less than 20 per cent of New Zealand’s electricity comes from fossil fuels and its biggest source of emissions, agriculture, has been given a free pass.  
Most New Zealand power comes from hydro, geothermal and, increasingly, wind.  
In terms of historic performance, New Zealand just scraped through the first Kyoto round of emissions cuts and failed to sign up to a legally binding target for the second. New Zealand parted company with Europe and Aust­ralia and instead joined Japan, Canada and Russia in a non-binding commitment for 2020. 



One thing I have learned from Jacinda is that she thinks it is okay to talk the talk but not to actually do anything. She knows perfectly well that agriculture is the backbone of our economy, and we are already having enough issues around that, with the fall of Fonterra in recent months. Also, we are showing some serious signs of an economic recession, and this government cannot pretend it has nothing to do with that although it will, of course.



For Jacinda to criticise Australia’s coal outputs while our biggest CO2 emissions come from agriculture is hypocrisy of the first order.



Australia’s ability to give huge swathes of money to the Pacific comes from their ability to export coal, among other things. Nobody seems to recognise that.



Neither Australia or New Zealand are exactly sinners on the global spectrum when it comes to CO2 emissions. Both countries pale into complete insignificance when it comes to China, who is also wooing the Pacific, with cheap loans and lots of cash.



This will end badly for the Pacific Islands, of course, who have dollar signs in their eyes, and cannot see that Australia is a much bigger friend to them than China will ever be.



In the meantime, the Pacific Island Forum has blamed Australia for their problems, which are mostly non-existent, and Jacinda, being a great neighbour, has put the ankle boot in at the same time.



I am truly ashamed of our pathetic _#parttimepm_.

This seems like an eco-dream come true, a car the runs on air developed in India. I’ve seen stories on this since 2008, but have yet to see the car hit market. Now the claim is in August 2012.
I don’t think you’ll see IPCC chairman Rajenda Pachauri driving one of these though, since he has been prone to booking posh 5 star hotel suites and won’t even drive the electric car he has. And like an electric car, that energy to charge the air tank with compressed air has to come from someplace, and that someplace if you are connected to the grid is likely fossil fuels, nuclear, or perhaps hydro. Though, with no fuel taxes, it might be a hit with anti-tax crusaders. With a claimed top speed of 60mph and range 185 miles, it should be enough to overcome the range anxiety of electric cars, and there’s no worry about battery fires or having to replace the expensive battery pack in 2-4 years. Whether it will ever be seen in the USA will of course depend on its crash worthiness. And when there is a crash, will it do this?

What is this? ‘Alison Italo Aus’
Will it be the next big thing?
Tata Motors of India thinks so.
What will the Oil Companies do to stop it?
It is an auto engine that runs on air.  That’s right; air not gas or diesel or electric but just the air around us.  Take a look.
Tata Motors of India has scheduled the Air Car to hit Indian streets by August 2012
The Air Car, developed by ex-Formula One engineer Guy N. For Luxembourg-based MDI, uses compressed air to push its engine’s pistons and make the car go.
The Air Car, called the “Mini CAT” could cost around 365,757 rupees in India or $8,177 US.  
The Mini CAT which is a simple, light urban car, with a tubular chassis, a body of fiberglass that is glued not welded and powered by compressed air.  A Microprocessor is used to control all electrical functions of the car.  One tiny radio transmitter sends instructions to the lights, turn signals and every other electrical device on the car.  Which are not many.
The four cyclinder compressed air engine
The temperature of the clean air expelled by the exhaust pipe is between 0-15 degrees below zero, which makes it suitable for use by the internal air conditioning system with no need for gases or loss of power.
There are no keys, just an access card which can be read by the car from your pocket.  According to the designers, it costs less than 50 rupees per 100 KM, that’s about a tenth the cost of a car running on gas.  It’s mileage is about double that of the most advanced electric car, a factor which makes it a perfect choice for city motorists.  The car has a top speed of 105 KM per hour or 60 mph and would have a range of around 300 km or 185 miles between refuels.  Refilling the car will take place at adapted gas stations with special air compressors.  A fill up will only take two to three minutes and costs approximately 100 rupees and the car will be ready to go another 300 kilometers.
This car can also be filled at home with it’s on board compressor.  It will take 3-4 hours to refill the tank, but it can be done while you sleep.
Because there is no combustion engine, changing the 1 liter of vegetable oil is only necessary every 50,000 KM or 30,000 miles.  Due to its simplicity, there is very little maintenance to be done on this car.
This Air Car almost sounds too good to be true.  We’ll see in August 2012 if it is.

By Ed Caryl
In my last article on this subject, Can We Expect Extreme Weather, we examined the tropics, the mid-latitudes including the Arctic. At the time I had not found a plot of the mid-latitudes in isolation. Thanks to a comment by Alex, the search was resumed. Once one knows that data exists, it becomes easier to actually find it.
In this article we will examine the mid-latitudes alone, the latitudes between 25° north and 60° north, where most people live, and where most of the earth’s land mass exists. Again, we are using Remote Sensing Systems satellite data. 

Figure 1: RSS lower troposphere temperature, (TLT) for the northern mid-latitudes between 25° north and 60° north, show cooling. The plot has been split between pre-1998 and post-1998.
1998 was the year of a very strong El Niño. In that year northern hemisphere temperatures took a step increase of about 0.4°C. Before that time, temperatures in the mid-latitudes were increasing from the 1970’s cooling at about 0.144°C per decade, despite the temporary cooling due to Mt. Pinatubo in 1992 and 93. After the 1998 El Niño step, the mid-latitudes began cooling again at about 0.123°C per decade. This natural recovery continues.
What are the extremes doing?

Figure 2 is a plot of the differential, point to point, of the temperature anomalies in Figure 1. These are the monthly extremes with the long term trend removed.
Note in Figure 2 that the northern mid-latitudes responded to the El Niño temperature step with several cold snaps (below zero) that continue to this day; monthly extremes that exceed the cold snaps of the 1980’s and 90’s. In contrast, the warm periods (above zero) are about the same in frequency and amplitude.

Figure 3 is a plot of the absolute value of the temperature extremes in Figure 2 with a 3rd order polynomial trend line applied.
If we look at the trend of all the extremes in the satellite era, we see a reduced trend in the 1980’s, an increase after the 1998 El Niño, particularly due to cold extremes, then a reduction in extremes in the last ten years.
Regarding the climate that most of us experience, in the northern mid-latitudes, we have cooling, a recent overall reduction in extreme weather, and no indication these conditions are radically changing.
It would be helpful if the Catastrophic Climate Clique would actually look at some data once in a while instead of hiding it and crying wolf. (How about a cartoon, Josh.)

"A leading Australian business group is calling for the two biggest economic challenges in memory – recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic and cutting greenhouse gas emissions – to be addressed together, saying it would boost growth and put the country on a firm long-term footing. Innes Willox, chief executive of the Australian Industry Group, representing more than 60,000 businesses, says economic recovery from the virus and the transition required to meet net-zero emissions by 2050 are overlapping issues that should be taken on together.  “There’s a lot that we can do to rebuild stronger and cleaner,” Willox planned to say on Tuesday, according to a speech released in advance. “The need is urgent. Covid-19 and climate are bigger than any economic challenge we’ve faced in the last century.” Willox is among a band of community leaders and industry groups urging governments to back climate solutions in the pandemic recovery rather than projects that entrench or increase emissions. They include the Investor Agenda, a global group of institutional investors and managers with members responsible for more than $55tn worth of assets. In a statement released on Monday, it said governments should avoid prioritising “risky, short-term emissions intensive projects”, and that accelerating the shift to net-zero emissions could create significant employment and economic growth while improving energy security and clean air. “The path we choose in the coming months will have significant ramifications for our global economy and generations to come,” the group, which includes Australia’s Investor Group on Climate Change, said. In Australia, visions for a “clean recovery” or “renewables stimulus” will be the focus of two online industry summits this week. Speakers include the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, and energy ministers from four states. The emphasis of the summits differs from that of the energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, who has backed gas, a fossil fuel, as key to driving the recovery after a slump in global oil and gas prices. John Grimes, chief executive of the Smart Energy Council, which is hosting a summit on Wednesday, said the country needed to tackle the current economic crisis and the climate crisis at the same time or it would “lurch from one major problem to another”. “This is Australia’s moment to modernise and grow the economy, create hundreds of thousands of new future-proof jobs and position Australia as a global renewable energy superpower,” Grimes said. Willox planned to tell a separate forum hosted by the Clean Energy Council on Tuesday that last summer’s bushfires had been a preview of what lay ahead due to climate change. His speech notes said a successful energy transition must leave no-one behind and extend beyond electricity generation to include heavy industry, transport, agriculture, buildings “and more”. “There is immense scope for reform and investment to support that transition, and getting started during the crisis will contribute to faster recovery,” he said. He said the industry group had consulted widely on “the most constructive directions for recovery and transition”. Opportunities raised included: improving energy management in homes and buildings by plugging drafts, modernising equipment and backing local electricity generation and storage; boosting electricity networks by rolling out smart meters and moving edge-of-grid customers on to mini-grids; helping shift heavy industry to run on clean electricity and hydrogen; and supporting large and small energy storage. On transport, Willox said it was an excellent time to prepare cities and major corridors for mass take up of electric vehicles by installing or preparing for charging points at service stations, in public and government car parks, and at apartment blocks. He said governments would have different preferences on whether to use regulatory reform, tax incentives, grants or other approaches. Giving the example of electricity, he said settling on a sound long-term design for market rules and climate policy could do as much to boost investment as direct public financial support. A report by the Clean Energy Council, also released on Tuesday, estimated that 50,000 construction and 4,000 ongoing jobs could be created, and $50bn worth of renewable electricity and storage projects built, if governments backed green policies and regulatory reform to “jumpstart” the economy. It said it would require help to overcome policy and grid transmission roadblocks that led to large-scale wind and solar investments falling 50% last year, changes to electricity market rules so the full benefits of energy storage were reflected and support for renewable hydrogen. On a smaller scale, it would mean governments removing barriers for renters, low-income households and community groups installing solar and supporting home batteries by either reducing costs or offering low-interest loans. Kane Thornton, the Clean Energy Council’s chief executive, said there were hundreds of large-scale wind and solar projects with planning approval that could proceed quickly, create jobs and bring down prices. “This isn’t about a handout for industry when government is directing scarce taxpayer funding to other essential services and areas,” Thornton said. “There is an enormous appetite for private investment in clean energy that can be unlocked through smart regulatory reform, sensible energy policy and investment in the grid and energy storage.” The International Energy Agency last week reported a “staggering” plunge in global demand for coal, oil and gas during the pandemic, with only renewable electricity proving resilient."
"Darwin’s finches, a group of 14 species found only in the Galapagos Islands, are perhaps most well known as one of the inspirations for Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection. A classic example of adaptive evolutionary radiation, the species are similar having formed from a common ancestor, except for their beaks, which have specialised to tackle different food.  Invasive pests and parasites are a problem in many parts of the word, and have even reached the Galapagos: a parasitic nest fly Philornis downsi has spread to most islands in the archipelago and is wreaking havoc on Darwin’s eponymous finches and other birds. The fly’s larvae live in the birds’ nests where they feed on the young birds’ blood, sometimes killing the entire brood. This parasitic fly might be the final nail in the coffin of some critically endangered species of Darwin’s finches, such as the mangrove finch and medium tree finch. So finding a way of controlling the pest is a top priority at the Galapagos National Park and Charles Darwin Research Station (CDRS), and with a novel method of putting pesticides right where it hits the pests – in the nest – we think we’ve found a solution. One afternoon while lounging in my hammock at CDRS I noticed a female finch land on my laundry line. I snapped a few photos of her as she tugged cotton fibres from a frayed knot. As she flew off with the collected fibres in her beak, I wondered if finches would incorporate cotton treated with a low concentration (1%) of a mild insecticide (permethrin) into their nests. We have used permethrin to kill the parasite in Darwin’s finch nests for years without harm to the birds, and if the finches took the cotton they would be threading their nests with the very weapon they need to kill P. downsi.  Later that day, I pinned cotton balls sprayed with permethrin to the laundry line. Within a few days, all of the cotton balls had disappeared from the rope. Inspired by these observations, my colleagues and I designed an experiment in 2013 to test whether Darwin’s finches could be encouraged to “self-fumigate” their nests with cotton balls treated with permethrin. Separately, we also directly sprayed other nests with permethrin to determine if killing the parasites would increase finch nestling survival.   Our research team built 30 cotton dispensers, a bit like suet bird feeders but with cotton balls to pluck instead of food. Some were loaded with pesticide-treated cotton and others with water-treated cotton as a control, and we placed these around our main field site, El Garrapatero on the island of Santa Cruz.  Then over several months, we battled uneven lava rock underfoot and 40°C heat in search of finch nests. During an especially difficult day, I saw for the first time a finch taking cotton from a dispenser and bringing it back to her nest – a nest which turned out to contain nearly two grams of cotton. With more than 85% of the nests we found containing cotton, the finches certainly liked it as a nesting material. But did the pesticide work? We found that nests which contained more than one gramme of permethrin-treated cotton (62% of nests) were virtually parasite-free, compared to nests with untreated cotton, which contained on average 30 parasites. Those nests that were sprayed directly with permethrin also had fewer parasites and more surviving nestlings. Given the tools to do so, finches can carry out their own pest control. Since the fly is found almost everywhere in the Galapagos, we do not believe that it will develop resistance to permethrin, especially if the dispensaries are used over a smaller area. We believe that self-fumigation can be especially useful for endangered species such as the mangrove finch – this Darwin’s finch species is down to fewer than 80 remaining individuals. We presented our findings, now published in Current Biology, to researchers at CDRS, who are now putting out untreated cotton for mangrove finches to determine if they will be interested in the nest material. Self-fumigation provides an immediate solution to the parasite problem while other long-term methods are developed. Of course there are other species of birds that are hurt by parasites, and if those birds too can be encouraged to incorporate fumigated cotton into their nests, they should be able to reap the benefits too. For example, Hawaiian honeycreepers become infested with feather lice, birds in Puerto Rico are afflicted by Philornis flies, and the endangered Florida scrub jay suffers from parasitic fleas. The same method might be used for the black-tailed prairie dog, which while removed from the endangered species list is still declining on the Great Plains and is affected by flea-bourne plague. Spraying permethrin directly into burrows has been used but is labour-intensive – it might be possible to spray the pesticide onto vegetation that the animals then drag into their burrows."

Members of a bipartisan coalition of US lawmakers are accusing the Chinese of a plot to manipulate the value of its currency in order to boost its exports and make American imports harder to sell in China.



And the lawmakers have introduced legislation that would force the US Treasury to impose stiff penalties against China and other countries that are engaged in such unfair currency manipulation.



In the House of Representatives 130 members of the House of Representatives signed a letter protesting China’s manipulation of its currency while in the Senate, a group of 14 Democrats and Republicans are pressing the Obama Administration to act against the Chinese.



The senators, led by liberal Democrat Charles Schumer from New York and conservative Republican Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, are arguing that past US administrations, worried about the rising economic power of China, had refrained from identifying Beijing as a ‘currency manipulator’ which would then have required Washington to impose duties on Chinese imports. But with unemployment rate remaining high and as the US trade deficit with China — its second largest trading partner — keeps growing, American lawmakers are responding to public anger by blaming China for using its currency to gain a trade advantage.



The senators want to ensure that the US Treasury’s semi‐​annual report on foreign exchange rate practices that is scheduled to be released next month will, indeed, label China as a ‘currency manipulator’ and force the administration to come up with ‘remedial’ legislation that would supposedly compel China to revalue its currency.



Their Bill — ‘Currency Exchange Rate Oversight Act’ — was introduced following a war of words between the US and China in recent days over the allegedly misaligned Chinese currency, the yuan, as well as other policy issues, including the meeting between President Barack Obama and the Dalai Lama at the White House, the US decision to sell arms to Taiwan as well as complaints from American companies about Chinese trade practices and Sino‐​American disagreements over climate change.



And while the American economy has just started recovering from a painful recession and is showing some growth, the World Bank this week has upped its forecast for China’s 2010 GDP growth to 9.5 per cent after it grew at 8.7 per cent last year.



American lawmakers say that some of this impressive export driven economic growth has been achieved in part through Chinese currency manipulation.



The Chinese policies amount to ‘cheating’, according to Democratic Senator Debbie Stabenow which represents Michigan, a state whose manufacturing sector, including a struggling car industry, has been devastated by the Great Recession and where the official unemployment rate is around 15 per cent (and among African‐​Americans, close to 50 per cent).



She and her colleagues are complaining that the Chinese government is essentially subsidising its exports by keeping its currency value low and want Washington to stop talking and to finally walk the walk. The Obama Administration needs to pull ‘the trigger on (currency) manipulation, explains Mr Graham, whose own state of South Carolina has been experiencing an unemployment rate of more than 13 per cent.



He told reporters that ‘we’re all living in fear of what China might do’ since ‘we borrow way too much money from them’, adding that ‘we need to break that fear and do what’s right’.



China has approximately US$2.4 trillion of accumulated foreign reserves which explains why many economists believe that the yuan is undervalued as a result of a calculated policy pursued by China’s financial authorities. They buy US dollars and sell their own yuan, a policy that helps to keep the greenback’s exchange rate fixed to their own currency. The result is a distortion of trade flows — cheap Chinese exports to the US continue while imports from the US into China remain expensive.



But since the Chinese do not allow their currency to float freely, the same economists also disagree over the degree to which the Chinese undervalue their currency. Economists also differ in estimating the extent to which the appreciation of the Chinese currency will lead to the narrowing of the US trade deficit with China. After all, reducing that deficit seems to be the main rationale for the proposed legislation on Capitol Hill.



In fact, according to the Cato Institute’s trade analyst Dan Ikenson, from 2005 to 2008, at a time when the yuan was appreciating against the US dollar, the US trade deficit with China actually increased from US$202 billion to US$268 billion. Thus, the think tank’s analyst suggests, the level of the US deficit is determined by many factors other than just the value of the Chinese currency.



For example, Mr Ikenson points out that the yuan was growing stronger between 2005 and 2008, US imports from China increased by US$94.3 billion, or 38.7 per cent. He suggests that one reason for continued US consumption of Chinese goods despite the relative price increase may have been the shortage of or even the lack of substitutes for Chinese‐​made goods in the US market.



Moreover, only somewhere one‐​third and one‐​half of the value of US imports from China is actually Chinese value‐​added, with the other half to two‐​thirds reflecting costs of material, labour and inputs from other countries.



Hence, a stronger yuan actually makes imported inputs cheaper for Chinese producers, who may respond by reducing their prices for export, which means that the currency appreciation may lead to a rise — not a reduction — of American imports from China.



Unfortunately, much of this economic common sense is probably not going to counter the political pressure from Congress on the administration to ‘do something’ that is fuelled, in turn, by America’s economic distress and the ensuing populism that makes China such an easy target.



A key Chinese official responded to this pressure from Congress by saying that his government has become a convenient scapegoat for America’s trade problems. But this official needs to recognise that that kind of behaviour is a mirror image of sort of the way that some members of the Chinese communist establishment have been exploiting anti‐​American nationalist sentiment as part of a strategy to mobilise public support for the regime in Beijing.



In a way, scapegoating the ‘other’ seemed to have become the favourite political weapon by both Americans and the Chinese.



The problem is that the back and forth sniping between Washington and Beijing over China’s currency policy is more than just a ‘normal’ economic dispute between two countries that has been exploited by politicians on both sides.



Indeed, the global financial imbalances between the US (consumption that created deficits) and China (savings that produce surpluses) helped create the conditions for the financial melt‐​down.



And unless the two sides take steps to deal with these imbalances, the global financial system could experience more disasters in the future.



From that perspective, China’s massive trade and foreign exchange surpluses — reflecting the huge surpluses of exports over imports and saving over investment — should be seen not so much as a challenge to American economic interests but as a threat to the entire global economy, and eventually to China itself.



The Americans need to cut their consumption and borrowing. But that could only take place if the US dollars in China’s government‐​controlled banks are being spent to buy American products as opposed to its debts. And if and when that happens, the appreciation of the Chinese currency would be inevitable.



In the meantime, a Chinese refusal to revalue its currency is bound to bring about retaliatory action by Washington and ignite a destructive economic war between the two nations.



And the situation is only going to be aggravated if China continues to respond in a somewhat frantic way to not‐​very‐​unusual actions by the Obama Administration (meetings with the Dalai Lama or arms sales to Taiwan).



If anything, China’s rising economic and diplomatic power require it to embrace a more nuanced, if not refined, diplomacy that one expects from a great power, especially when it is dealing with the more accommodating administration in Washington.



More important, there is no reason why China and the US should not be able to settle their differences over currency in the same amicable way that the US and Japan were able to during the 1980s.



A failure to do that would be a recipe for another economic recession and perhaps even a new cold war from which no side would be able to decouple.

Mississippi homeowners sued 34 energy companies and utilities operating in the Gulf Coast for damage sustained to their property during Hurricane Katrina. The homeowners alleged that the defendants had emitted greenhouse gases, which increased the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which contributed to global warming, which accelerated the melting of glaciers, which raised the global sea level, which increased the frequency and severity of hurricanes, which caused the destructive force of Hurricane Katrina. The district court concluded that it lacked the authority to resolve the public debate over global warming and dismissed the case. A Fifth Circuit panel reversed this dismissal, however, holding that the homeowners have standing to raise some of their claims and that those claims are appropriate for resolution by the federal courts. The Fifth Circuit granted the defendants’ petition for rehearing _en banc_. Cato filed an _amicus_ brief on the energy companies’ behalf, arguing that homeowners lack standing to bring their suit and that the case raises a nonjusticiable political question. Our brief asserts that the homeowners’ claim does not provide a clear causal connection between the harm suffered and any particular conduct by the energy companies, and that the money damages the homeowners requested would not remedy the environmental harm alleged. More importantly, we maintain that political questions such as those surrounding climate change must be resolved by Congress, not the federal courts. Put simply, the Constitution prohibits federal courts from resolving highly technical social and economic policy debates. Permitting plaintiffs to achieve “regulation by litigation” would not only contradict settled Supreme Court precedent, but would betray the separation of powers principles embodied in the Constitution.

"**Hundreds of pupils on Anglesey will have to stay home after confirmed Covid cases at a school on the island.**
Ysgol Uwchradd Caergybi in Holyhead, a 1,300-pupil secondary, and primaries Ysgol Gymraeg Morswyn in Holyhead and Ysgol y Ffridd in Gwalchmai have shut.
Adam Rhys Williams, Ysgol Uwchradd Caergybi head teacher, said the decision came after ""several positive cases within the school community"".
The council said it was supporting the schools to implement home learning.
In a letter to parents on social media, Mr Williams said closing the school was the best thing ""to protect everyone"".
He added the school would have to close until Friday, and a number of staff would have to self-isolate.
""Ysgol Uwchradd Caergybi cannot operate a full school curriculum safely with children at school for the remainder of the week,"" he said.
Mr Williams said the school was working closely with the council's environmental health team and contact tracers to monitor the situation.
Lessons will be moved online, with pupils expected to stick to their normal class timetable.
On Sunday, 15 new cases of coronavirus were reported, and the case rate in the area stands at 21.4 per 100,000 people."
"The ocean, seen from a beach or from a plane, seems vast, ancient and invulnerable. It’s hard to imagine that 90% of life on earth lives below the waves, across 1.3 billion cubic kilometres of water and across a seabed formed by mountain ranges, vast plains and trenches that reach 11,000 metres deep.  Every other breath we take is filled with oxygen that originates from photosynthesising marine life, the ocean provides billions of us with food, and in other ways provides a critical role in supporting the ecology of the planet. Yet much of this is simply not recognised, and certainly not valued.  Our relationship with the ocean has become abusive. Industrial fishing has led to a catastrophic collapse of both target species and those taken as by-catch. The number of many of the iconic ocean predators – tuna, swordfish, sharks, and even cod – have been reduced to less than 10% of their original abundance. The great whales were almost hunted to extinction by the mid-20th century, and some species still struggle to survive.  Seabirds, drowned or killed as collateral damage from fishing, die in their hundreds of thousands a year, pushing some towards extinction. Our inexorable appetite for profit from fisheries has led us to trawl deep and remote ecosystems for fish. Having evolved to survive at great depths where there is limited food, these fish can live for more than 100 years and reproduce slowly, and so are extremely vulnerable to overfishing. Even the method of fishing itself destroys habitats such as deep-sea coral reefs and sponge gardens which support an enormous diversity of life. And of course the ocean is affected not just by what we take out, but by what we put in: pollution, particularly plastic debris, ocean acidification from the effects of climate change, and deoxygenation caused by nitrate fertiliser washed into the sea from fields also cause problems for marine life. It’s easy to be overwhelmed by this tragic spiral of degradation, but it is still the greatest wilderness on Earth and in places teems with beautiful and majestic life. Many of the human activities damaging the oceans can be modified, reduced to promote recovery, or even eliminated. The latest report of the Global Ocean Commission is a “rescue package” of eight practical recommendations that can reverse this decline. It is nothing less than a Marshall Plan for the oceans, a reflection of the scale of the emergency we face.  The commission’s rescue package calls for a Sustainable Development Goal for the oceans, to emphasise the need to use the ocean’s resources sustainably, now and for the future.  It outlines steps that would make fisheries more sustainable. Some of these are incredibly simple. Requiring fishing vessels to carry a mandatory identification number, as other merchant vessels must, could make enforcing fishing regulations much easier. Better still, tracking vessels using Automated Identification Systems and other satellite tracking systems already in use would provide the means to know who is fishing where, and even what and how they are fishing.  These two simple steps would quickly make it very hard for illegal fishing vessels to go unnoticed in the vastness of the oceans. Combined with improved port state control of fisheries landings, this could eliminate illegally caught fish from  supermarkets, destroying pirate fishers’ profits. Other recommendations address more difficult political issues such as overcapacity in fishing fleets, subsidies that lead to overfishing, and flag-state responsibility for the action of their vessels at sea.   Many of the commissioners’ recommendations are such clear and obvious choices that it’s reasonable to ask why they haven’t been implemented long ago. The ocean is governed mainly through the principles of the United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea, but its implementation is spread across many sector-specific organisations that leads to a disconnection between exploiting the oceans and the need to conserve them. This has made it easy for national and commercial interests to undermine ocean governance for collective benefit.  Nowhere has this been more acute that in the high seas, beyond the territorial area that extends 200 nautical miles from the coast that is subject to international regulation. The commission’s final recommendation is that, if we cannot clean up our act and manage the high seas better, they, or at least those portions that are unregulated, should be entirely closed to fishing to allow them to recover.  Two scientists, Crow White and Christopher Costello, recently modelled such a closure and found that it would lead to increasing fish stocks, and as a result greater and more sustainable fish catches. It would also deliver a more equitable sharing of the ocean’s resources, as the investment and technology to build large, ocean-going vessels is limited to the developed nations. Given the degradation of the oceans and a burgeoning human population predicted to reach 9 billion or more by the middle of the century we cannot allow nineteenth-century-style politics to rule the waves. It is time to act collectively to rescue the oceans so that they continue to provide critical services and inspiration for our children and for generations thereafter. "

It was most disconcerting to see grown men on the west coast crying because Eugenie Sage and her minions have threatened to shut down recreational white baiting – a family tradition. With support of the Greens, Forest & Bird (F&B) are throwing their weight around far more than they did before the Greens crawled into government, and it’s got out of hand. 



F&B have carte blanche to oppose developments that don’t fit their ideology and already they have:



F&B have far too much say in[ important decisions like the Te Kuha ](https://www.doc.govt.nz/news/issues/decision-on-mining-application-at-mt-te-kuha/)mine that would have provided jobs and funded local industry. Ministers declined the mining permit because “the potential economic benefits of the mine were large enough to outweigh the irreparable damage to an area with very high, unique and nationally significant conservation values.” 



The decision should have read **“ministers declined the mining permit because** **this government opposes all mining.”**



Where is the burden of proof in spurious actions by F&B? Closing Waitakere walking tracks **might** prevent kauri die-back? Auckland stormwater **could** contain contaminants? 



**F &B lost the fight at Waiuku**, where residents have, for decades, been maintaining their shoreline, with the support of the Auckland City Council to the tune of $10,000 pa for work and chainsaw maintenance.



“An environmental group **[Forest and Bird] says it is “shocked”** to see Auckland Council promoting the work of a community group that **has cleared** **25 hectares of mangroves from an estuary as “positive** “.



“Mangroves are amazing native plants that have important roles in the environment. They protect our coastal communities from inundation from the sea by slowing down waves and absorbing flood waters, they absorb carbon from the atmosphere to help prevent climate change, and provide essential nursery habitat for fishes, and feeding grounds for native birds like at-risk banded rail.” 



**But Waiuku residents are much better informed about their own environment, particularly the mangroves and the banded rail, than F &B. **



WAIUKU RESIDENT IAN SCOBIE, WHO STARTED THE MANGROVE REMOVAL PROJECT INITIALLY TO CLEAR A PASSAGE FOR HIM TO KAYAK INTO THE ESTUARY, SAID FROM THEIR OBSERVATIONS THE REMOVAL HAD IMPROVED THE ENVIRONMENT.

F&B was forced to back away from Waiuku and are now gunning for the development of a marina at Coromandel – 10 years in the planning.

THE PROJECT WOULD INVOLVE **DIGGING OUT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF SEDIMENT AND MANGROVES** ON THE MARGINS OF COROMANDEL HARBOUR TO CONSTRUCT A MARINA BASIN AND DREDGING A CANAL TO DEEPER WATER.

DREDGING **COULD** RELEASE THESE TOXIC HEAVY METALS INTO THE MARINE ECOSYSTEM, HARMING A WIDE RANGE OF SEA LIFE, SAYS DR STIRNEMANN.” 



  
F&B is all about protecting mangroves, which encourage silt to build up, and they also argue that dredging **could** release toxic heavy metals into the marine system. F&B was wrong at Waiuku and they are quite likely wrong in the Coromandel too. 



If the TCDC has spent 10 years in planning and studying their own back yard who is F&B to wade into this?



The proposed ferry service to operate from the new Coromandel marina would get cars off the road by offering travel by sea but the Greens take no account of this advantage for the Coromandel. 



With the support of a handful of un-elected Greens, F&B will oppose anything and they are often succeeding, despite the facts not stacking up. They are nothing more than bullies who should be stopped in their tracks by withdrawing government funding.

"James Shaw, New Zealand’s climate change minister, has asked the country’s independent climate change commission to check whether its emissions targets under the Paris agreement are enough to limit global heating to 1.5C. He explains why he’s prioritising the issue during a strict national lockdown to stop the spread of Covid-19, which could send New Zealand’s unemployment rate soaring. To say that we find ourselves in an unprecedented moment is so obvious and has been so often repeated it’s almost become white noise. What is less obvious, however, is where we go from here.  In any significant crisis, let alone one as catastrophic as the Covid-19 pandemic, it is an entirely understandable human reflex to want things to “return to normal”, to “go back to the way they were before”. And, when faced with economic headwinds – in recent decades, the Asian financial crisis, the global financial crisis and, in our own case, the Christchurch earthquakes) successive governments the world over have directed their efforts to meeting public expectation and getting back to business as usual. Unfortunately, one of the features of business as usual was a highly polluting and ecologically unsustainable economy on a pathway that was locking in catastrophic climate change. Successive responses to economic crises have seen climate change and the natural environment we depend on for life on Earth as a nice-to-have, something to think about once we’ve got the economy back on track and there’s a bit more money to go round. This means that action on climate change keeps being deferred, as economic shocks occur on average about every ten years. It also means that, when we do collectively start feeling confident enough to start worrying about climate change again, we find that our economic recovery programmes have locked us back in to the same highly polluting pathway we were on before. We quite simply cannot afford to do that one more time. Global CO2 emissions need to at least halve in the next 10 years, according to a 1992 treaty, the United Nations framework convention on climate change. If we spend the next few years restoring business as usual, we will have only a few years left to transform that business as usual into something else. It simply won’t be able to be done. This time, we could do it differently. This time, we could plan our recovery to create a clean-tech, high-value economy that works for everyone. In which case, rather than willing things back to “normal” as quickly as possible, let’s imagine something different for a moment. A future where people have everything they need to lead fulfilling, meaningful and prosperous lives. Where simple everyday tasks like making the morning coffee, to travelling to and from work, to warming our homes is powered by clean, renewable energy. A future where electricity demand goes up – but only because people are plugging in their electric vehicles. Where cheap, clean power brings significant economic benefits for small businesses, and rural communities. Above all, a future that is more equitable, more prosperous, and more innovative – and all within planetary limits. We know it is in our power to change the way we do things. Over the last few months, nearly all of us have made changes to the way we live and work in order to protect people and their loved ones around the world. Our responses to Covid-19 – as parents, as friends, as neighbours – have made clear just what it is that we value more than anything else. Not only this, but we have seen the difference good governments can make to people’s lives – and that we can, when we need to, make bold decisions for the collective good. We have also been reminded in the most profound and difficult way why we must act in accordance with science. Clearly, government spending over the next few months needs to ease the economic pressures people and businesses are feeling right now. But that doesn’t mean it cannot also change the quality of economic growth and reduce its impact on the climate. Nor does it mean that governments cannot apply a climate lens to every major policy decision, as New Zealand is doing. An economic stimulus is partly about choice. In the past, governments have made these choices based on the view that investments and values are separable. But they’re not. Our investments reflect our values. Nearly every country in the world has committed to playing their part in a global effort to clean up our economies and avoid the worse effects of climate change. Here in New Zealand, our parliament has – unanimously – enshrined the Paris goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels in domestic legislation. On Wednesday, I asked our new, politically independent, climate change commission to review whether our international target is consistent with that Paris goal. If they conclude that there is more we need to do, the commission will provide recommendations on what changes we should make. This will ensure we are playing our part globally. I hope that other countries will do the same, if they aren’t already. It is a time for governments, regions, and cities around the world to mobilise and deploy resources to tackle the climate crisis at the same time as rebuilding their economies, all whilst creating high value green jobs. This is indeed an unprecedented moment. What we do with it will determine the quality of life for billions of people – not just for the next few months or years, but for the generations to come. James Shaw is New Zealand’s climate change minister and co-leader of the Green party. "

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere I am not talking about man, as in mankind, but men, i.e. males.
In the German state of Bavaria, children of the advanced secondary schools, aged 13-14, are required to take a reading comprehension test. The text used to do this is a report about climate change titled: “Ist der Klimawandel ein Mann?” (Is Climate Change A Man?)” Hat-tip German blog site info.kopp-verlag.de. 
The main message of the text is that men, with their macho lifestyles, produce far more CO2 than women and thus the planet is suffering because of it. The text cites scientific studies (from women) and presents claims made by the studies as fact.
The text begins:
Is climate change a man?
Steaks and cars, both as big as possible. That is – precisely typical male. ‘Thus climate change is a man.’ This is how provocatively Ines Weller, a professor in Bremen, formulated her arguments: On average men eat more meat and drive swankier, fuel guzzling cars, preferably fast. In the end, both increase the global emission of CO2. What’s worse, says Weller, is that men often do not want to change their behavior. Therefore the contribute more to global climate change than women. Women eat more fruit and vegetables and drive mostly small, fuel-saving cars and they drive less kilometers each year. They use, Weller says, public transportation considerably more often.”
That’s just the first introductory paragraph. Right from the start children here learn that men are worse for the environment, are more wasteful, and they are unwilling to change. It gets worse. The text continues:
Gotelind Alber, environmental expert and physicist, confirms the Bremen study almost completely. In addition one could say that women, even though they contribute less to climate change, are often hit harder by its impacts. This is especially true for women in poorer countries, where they are busy with providing for the family. And that will become increasingly more difficult as environmental conditions become more acute.”
Not only are men being made responsible for climate change, but they are also getting blamed for the hardships women in poor countries have to endure.
Men drive bigger cars
The text then asks just how much is the contribution to climate change made by men and women. This is a difficult question to answer, the text says. This is why the researchers studied single-person households. The text provides some results:
On average male single households produce more CO2 than female single households. In Sweden, for example, its a plus of 30%. Namely Swedish men almost always drive the bigger car. That was the case for more or less every European country, said Alber.”
Men eat more climate-killing meat
The German children learn from the text that men’s eating habits are also posing a big problem for the climate and environment.

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




And how does it look with nutrition? Studies conducted by an Austrian environment institute have shown that more than 20% of global CO2 emissions come from the production and transport of foodstuffs. The biggest share here is clearly from the production of meat. Studies further show that men eat far more meat than women. The ‘beef calculation’ made by climate experts yields: The production of one kilogram of steak alone causes 36.4 kilograms of CO2. Thus also in this area men appear to be the climate violators.”
The fourth paragraph of the text serves as a fig leaf in an attempt to hide the text’s obvious attack on the male gender, adding that women are producing more CO2 in their consumption of milk products, cosmetics and clothing. But in total, men are much worse.
The text ends with:
Moreover: women think differently than men; they tend to be more open to doing something for the overall public good. Women, who are more often there for the family than men, are used to thinking of others,’ says Alber. Men on the other hand are environmentally conscious when it does not cost anything.”
Clearly the text conveys that men are less desirable than women, and that they are more to blame for the world’s ills. But this is not to say that the world would be a better place without men. The real message is: “The world would be a far better place if women ran it. Men would be better serving as their slaves. 🙂  The environmental movement is not a war on humanity – it’s a war on men.
German blog sites react to the text
Gerhard Wisnewski of Kopp online here writes:
The indoctrination in German schools is already well advanced and no longer even holds back with with-hunting propaganda. […] here kids are learning that the world would be much better without men. […] this is all about pure gender fascism. […] Our state ‘educational institutes’ don’t hold back in denouncing and defaming an entire half of the population.”
Dr. habil. Heike Diefenbach and Michael Klein here:
The blatant method in which hate is being funneled to German schoolchildren age 13-14, the perfidious manner in which distrust is being generated between the genders among the youth at German schools where they are being told: You as a male person are faulty, but you have the chance to purify yourself and to become unmanly, no longer borders on indoctrination. It goes far beyond that and reminds us more of the education camps where Nicolae Ceaușescu drilled his body guards. It reminds us of the initiation rites that Heinrich Himmler conducted in his dream palace Wewelsburg. […] This has absolutely nothing to do with the educating and upbringing the youth to be independent and critical members of their societies.”
Diefenbach and Klein add that this type of indoctrination is a “primitive form of manipulation and conditioning of the youth.”
Western education system hostile to males
Years ago it seemed that Germany’s advanced secondary education (Gymnasium) was about 50/50 male-female. Today I can’t help but notice that this has shifted markedly. In my son’s and daughter’s class it was more like two thirds girls and only one third boys. I don’t know what the situation is like in other European countries. It just seems that education system is becoming increasingly hostile to males. In the USA, if I’m not mistaken, more women are completing higher education than men.
So men, get back to the books and do your homework. Otherwise you may wake up one day soon finding yourself in shackles, in the servitude of women. Heck, I know plenty of men who today are perfectly content with that! 🙂

"Last month the Dutch government announced a bold set of climate policies designed to reduce annual carbon emissions by nearly 10 megatons, comparable to the yearly output of Latvia. Several new coal power plants are to be closed or run at minimum capacity, a €3bn spending package will subsidise renewable energy projects and home refits, and there are a slew of smaller policy tweaks, for example on livestock numbers, reforestation and lowering the national speed limit.  The middle of a public health crisis may seem like a strange time to make new climate commitments, but the Dutch government had little choice. A court case brought by environmental groups in 2014 and upheld by the supreme court last year forced the government to act to reduce emissions to 25% below 1990 levels by the end of 2020 at the latest. It is climate action under extreme duress. There are more than 1,500 climate lawsuits either complete or ongoing in the world, including similar cases in Ireland and Norway, but this is by far the most successful to date. Michael Gerrard, the director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, says the Dutch case is the “strongest climate change decision ever issued by a court” and the only one that has forced government policy. It has big implications not only for climate law but also for governments, most of whose climate policies are years behind their ambitious pledges. Christiana Figueres, the former head of the UN framework convention on climate change, called it “a test case for very rapid emission reductions” that other nations should watch closely. The Dutch government has opted for a crash programme, choosing policies that should mean it hits the target in the eight months remaining in 2020. But it didn’t have to be this way. Marjan Minnesma, the head of the Urgenda Foundation, which filed the initial legal challenge, says the policies are “a great victory for the rule of law” but points out that Urgenda won its initial case in a district court in The Hague in June 2015. The 2020 target was set at that time and could have been reached gradually, but the government twice tied the case up in appeals, eventually losing in the supreme court in December last year. “It took a long time to step up – five years of not embracing the judgment,” says Matt Siennot, an MP with Democrats 66. An adviser to the Dutch government says the ruling coalition at the time of the original ruling – between the centrist People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy and the centre-left Labour party – was split on whether to take action and afraid that accepting the decision would open the way to further legal challenges. So they let it languish. “They would say they worked on it, but little was done” he said. Their fears about the courts were ultimately correct: the Netherlands is now a proving ground for environmental lawsuits. A similar case to cap nitrogen pollution was won in 2018, and one of the lawyers from the Urgenda case has partnered with Friends of the Earth to sue Shell, which is headquartered in The Hague. After the supreme court decision, Minnesma was invited to meet government ministers to present potential carbon reduction policies, and she found their reticence had melted away. “A year ago they wouldn’t have listened to any of that, but suddenly they were all writing it down,” she says. What she presented was a green wishlist sourced from more than 800 NGOs and institutions – everything from housing associations with ambitious retrofitting strategies to animal rights groups pushing a meat tax and a national meat-free day. “We are bringing these ideas from a wide range of Dutch society. We would say: if you want a broad group to accept it, these are the right things. I got the sense they were willing to listen.” Paul van der Zanden, a spokesperson for the economics and climate ministry, says: “Finding social support was important for these 2020 climate goals. Urgenda gave a great help in the search for climate measures that citizens can take themselves.” Many of the ideas would have been sidelined for years without the push provided by the court decision. Jan Willem Erisman, a professor at the Free University of Amsterdam who works on emissions in agriculture and who contributed proposals to Urgenda, says: “The lawsuits are almost needed for the work to be considered by the government. Otherwise economic concerns get in the way, targets are set, we don’t reach them, and then new targets get set.” The Dutch climate agreement presented in the summer of 2019 was the product of cooperation between industry, the energy sector, unions, environmental groups and citizen groups. The Dutch government believes public and social support are essential for a successful climate policy, and it helps citizens to take climate measures themselves. For example, it provides financial support for lowering households’ energy consumption.  Ultimately, the government settled on the easiest option for the bulk of the emissions reductions. One coal-fired power plant will be closed outright, and two others built in 2016 will run at a minimal level. This alone will save 5-7.5mt of emissions. But several more public-facing measures from the Urgenda list were selected as well. There will be €2bn for renewable energy subsidies, much of it for rooftop solar, and buybacks of inefficient household appliances. Housing associations will receive much of a €300m pot for retrofitting. “So far there really hasn’t been much of an attempt to involve people in policies to slow climate change,” says Rebecca Willis, an environmental policy researcher at Lancaster University. “Governments often prioritise policies that don’t impact directly on people’s lives, like switching to renewable energy. But the changes now needed, from switching to electric vehicles and public transport to eating less meat, will affect people’s lives, and it’s vital to work with people to involve them.” Perhaps surprisingly, none of the Dutch measures have provoked much of a pushback yet. The Netherlands is no stranger to the climate culture war. The speed limit change from 130km/h to 100km/h – a measure that has already been brought in and is expected to save half a megaton of carbon per year – was mocked as “nonsense” by the far-right MP Geert Wilders and criticised by motoring lobbyists, but the much larger and more expensive parts of the package have passed relatively quietly. The government may have the coronavirus crisis to thank for that. Compared with the spending programmes being rolled out in response to the pandemic, a climate programme that would be huge any other year now seems slight and has not attracted much notice. Remco De Boer, an energy analyst, says: “There’s so much else happening. And they’re spending money. KLM [the Dutch airline] has just been rescued [for €4bn].” He says measures such as renewables subsidies and home upgrades also fit with the desire for economic stimulus. The crisis has also provided the government with a bit of wiggle room in delivering the policies. Emissions for 2020 will be much reduced with so much economic activity suspended. Pieter Boot, the head of climate at the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency, estimates that even a short lockdown could knock more than 5mt off the yearly total. But Minnesma says that even if emissions get a one-time reprieve, the measures need to be permanent. The court verdict will be just as valid next year and every year going forward. “We still have the rule of law,” she says, “and we have shown using the law as an instrument of change is possible.” • This article was amended on 4 May 2020. An earlier version misdescribed Democrats 66 as “an opposition party”."

BFD readers no doubt belong to that vast majority of happy folk, greatly to be envied, who neither know nor care who Elizabeth Farrelly is. So I must apologise for bursting your bubbles of blissful ignorance.



If there was a pictorial calendar of watermelons, Farrelly would be its cover girl. Her simpering, head-tilted smirk is the epitome of complacent leftist ignorance. From the rarified confines of inner Sydney, architecture critic (for such is the only trade she is actually qualified for) Farrelly deigns to grace the rest of us with her views on everything from inconvenient tradesmen (she abuses at them, should they dare let their work intrude on her cycling progress) to [how to manage the nation’s farms](https://www.theage.com.au/environment/climate-change/forgiving-land-clearers-because-of-drought-is-like-comforting-a-fat-child-with-chocolate-20190808-p52f64.html).



As farmer Tom Marland (with dual degrees in environmental management and law) says:



One thing I enjoy is being lectured to by urban media on how farmers should manage their land and environment.



[Elizabeth Farrelly] is your typical modern day urban environmental weekend warrior. She was late getting her article in because she was out planting trees. She has planted 70 this year!



That’s nothing – the rumour is that she only took **one** overseas holiday this year. Take that, greenhouse gases!



The reality is that the net gain of those trees would be wiped out by one of her commutes to work and wouldn’t even cover the food miles for the imported coffee beans at her favourite coffee shop. But don’t let facts get in the way of a good hack job.



After planting a few trees, she felt qualified to stray from her specialisation as an “architecture critic” to share with us her extensive knowledge of vegetation management and the benefits of trees she found in a google search.



I hate to play one-upmanship but my family manages somewhere around 10 million trees on our freehold country plus another 10 million in our national park. We didn’t plant any of them – they just grow naturally – in the millions…I rarely get the time to “hug” my trees unless I’ve been wiped off my horse by one of them chasing cattle. But I understand that to maintain a healthy forest you have to “manage it”. Whether by fire, axe or chain it needs to be selectively cared for to ensure it’s not choked out by woody weeds, lantana and noxious weeds. You can’t just “lock it up” other wise a bushfire will eventually come along and destroy the lot.



Michael Crichton rams home the same point in his excellent _State of Fear_ : the environmentalist fantasy of nature’s “balance” is just that – a fantasy. The delusion of “environmentalists” who live as far from the natural environment as it’s possible to be. The Australian landscape has been managed for the benefit of humans for tens of thousands of years.



Like most urban environmentalists, the article starts off by painting all farmers as environmental vandals who are roaming around the bush on bulldozers chanting “Kill more trees, cut them off at the knees, kill more trees.” I’m not offended by that statement – it just demonstrates the ignorance of someone who has no idea what they are talking about…I’m not sure if she has actually read the Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016. I have and it is hardly a puff piece. NSW vegetation laws are overly officious, technically confusing and inconsistent with extensive enforcement powers and heavy penalties.



Ask the farmer from Garah who stick raked previously cultivated wheat paddocks and was fined $350,000 for “clearing” 500 hectares of “native vegetation” regrowth about how “soft” NSW vegetation laws are.



But an “environmentalist” from the concrete jungle of inner Sydney thinks she knows better.



Sydney…[doesn’t] have to worry about vegetation management laws – the remaining vegetation are in parks or in pot plants.



It’s easy to moralise about vegetation management when it is someone’s problem and livelihood.



It’s easy to point the finger when someone else is picking up the tab.



It’s easy to have an opinion when the cost of that opinion is nil. That accordingly is also its value…I wonder if the author actually had to pay a farmer for the vegetation on their land rather than just take it for free whether she would be so eager to pontificate about the virtues of vegetation.



I doubt it.

Nearly two weeks ago, I blogged about some strange procedural developments in the big global warming case coming out of the Gulf Coast, _Comer v. Murphy Oil USA_. On the eve of final briefing deadlines before the _en banc_ Fifth Circuit, an eighth judge of that court recused from the case (we don’t know the reason, but the previous seven recusals were presumably due to stock ownership) and so the court was faced with an unprecedented situation: losing an _en banc_ quorum after previously having had enough of one to vacate the panel decision and grant _en banc_ rehearing in the first place. We were all set to file our brief when the Clerk of the Fifth Circuit issued an order notifying the parties of the lost quorum and canceling the scheduled hearing — and nothing more. Out of an abundance of caution, we decided to go ahead with filing late last week.   
  
  
Again, here’s the situation: Mississippi homeowners sued 34 energy companies and utilities operating in the Gulf Coast for damage sustained to their property during Hurricane Katrina. The homeowners alleged that the defendants had emitted greenhouse gases, which increased the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which contributed to global warming, which accelerated the melting of glaciers, which raised the global sea level, which increased the frequency and severity of hurricanes, which caused the destructive force of Hurricane Katrina. The district court concluded that it lacked the authority to resolve the public debate over global warming and dismissed the case. A Fifth Circuit panel reversed this dismissal, holding that the homeowners have standing to raise some of their claims and that those claims are appropriate for resolution by the federal courts. The Fifth Circuit then granted rehearing _en banc_.   
  
  
Cato filed an _amicus_ brief on the energy companies’ behalf, arguing that homeowners lack standing to bring their suit and that the case raises a nonjusticiable political question. Our brief asserts that the homeowners’ claim does not provide a clear causal connection between the harm suffered and any particular conduct by the energy companies, and that the money damages the homeowners requested would not remedy the environmental harm alleged. More importantly, we maintain that political questions such as those surrounding climate change must be resolved by Congress, not the federal courts. Put simply, the Constitution prohibits federal courts from resolving highly technical social and economic policy debates. Permitting plaintiffs to achieve “regulation by litigation” would not only contradict settled Supreme Court precedent, but would betray the separation of powers principles embodied in the Constitution.   
  
  
The Clerk has since directed the parties to brief the procedural issues surrounding the apparent lost quorum, which letter‐​briefs came in this week (as a mere _amicus_ , we did not file on this). I’ll spare you the technical details, but there are three possible ways in which the Fifth Circuit could now rule: 1) the court actually does have a quorum and thus oral argument is resecheduled; 2) the panel decision is reinstated (with an ensuing cert petition appealing that decision to the Supreme Court); and 3) the district court is affirmed without opinion (the same result as when an appellate court vote is tied). Stay tuned — this is a truly weird denouement to a hugely important case.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Arctic, we are told, is the canary in the climate coal mine. No place on the planet is supposed to warm faster. As global warming takes hold, we are really supposed to see it at the Earth’s poles. If that’s true, then we should really be opening up our minds to the real possibility of a cooling planet because summertimes at the North Pole are cooling.

Three of the last five Arctic summers have been the coldest on record. Graphics snipped from the dmi.dk.
Arctic summers can be examined going back to 1958 using data from the Danish Meteorological Institute here. It turns out the 3 coldest Arctic summers have all occurred in the last 5 years. Not even the summers of the 1960s were colder. 2013 still has about three weeks to go, yet the forecasts show that it’s place in the record books is pretty much secured.
So why has Arctic sea ice extent reached record lows over the past 5 years, we might ask? Sea ice melt involves a lot more than just surface atmospheric temperature. Historical records show that a major force is ocean cycles. From 1980 to 2000, both the AMO and PDO saw warm phases, and so the Arctic ice melt was likely caused by the warmer surface sea water. But now that the PDO has flipped to its cool phase and the AMO is transitioning to its cool phase, we can expect the Arctic to begin its recovery over the next 2 decades – just like it did during the 1950s and 60s. There’s likely a decade or so lag between Arctic surface temperatures and sea ice coverage.
I’d bet a good bottle of Scotch that we’ll be seeing a rising Arctic sea ice trend over the next 10 years.
Finally, not only the North Pole is chilling out, but so is the South Pole, which has been setting record highs for sea ice extent. See here.

"**Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Monday morning. We'll have another update for you at 18:00 GMT.**
Coronavirus cases in England fell by almost a third in two weeks after the current lockdown was introduced. That's the conclusion of React-1, a highly-respected study by Imperial College London, which swabbed more than 100,000 people between 13 and 24 November. Some of the worst-hit areas in the North saw the biggest improvements, and the R rate fell to 0.88 - here's a reminder of why that matters so much. Overall, though, cases across the country remain high, with the East and West Midlands the current hotspots. Health Secretary Matt Hancock says we can't ""take our foot off the pedal just yet"".
Boris Johnson insists the tougher three-tier system, coming into force on Wednesday, is what's needed to keep cases falling, but dozens of his MPs remain to be convinced. To that end, he's agreed to publish the social, economic and health impact assessment of the measures, and is urging sceptics to show ""unity and resolve"". The PM hopes to limit the numbers who rebel when the measures are put to a vote tomorrow. Our political correspondent Iain Watson says it would be embarrassing for the PM to have to rely on opposition votes. Check the latest virus rules wherever you are in the UK.
The mass Covid testing of students is starting at many universities across the UK today, aimed at allowing them to go home safely for Christmas. Universities are opening temporary testing centres and students have been asked to take two tests, three days apart. If they get a negative result, many will leave in the ""travel window"" starting from 3 December. Many will continue their studies remotely - learn more about the tech allowing them to sit exams at home.
Nearly 700,000 more people have fallen into poverty due to the pandemic, according to right-leaning think tank the Legatum Institute. But it says the figure would be twice that if it wasn't for a Â£20 uplift to universal credit introduced to help those struggling to cope. It's urging the government to keep the extra payment as long as it's needed. So far ministers have confirmed the uplift will be secure until March. People who've lost their jobs are among the worst hit - see just how bad the unemployment picture could get.
It's fair to say it's been a tough year, but beavers - and their human supporters - have cause to celebrate. The rodents became extinct in the UK in the 16th Century due to hunting, but have been successfully reintroduced at a handful of sites in recent years. Today we've learned that one group has built a dam on Exmoor for the first time in more than 400 years. Read more about why 2020 has been good for beavers \- but also why not everyone is a fan.

At the beginning of 2009, the president’s economists told the public that passing an $862 billion “stimulus” package was the medicine the sick economy needed. We were told that its pas sage would keep unemployment from going above 8 percent. Instead, unemployment has remained close to 10 percent ever since.



The overall unemployment rate in Virginia has also increased but remains below the national average. However, counties that don’t border the D.C. spending epicenter have unemployment rates that often match or exceed the national average. Virginia has been awarded some $4.5 billion in stimulus funds, yet private sector employment remains flat.



Never mind all that, says the administration. The stimulus package prevented a second great depression, it says. Last month, the White House’s Council of Economic Advisors released an analysis claiming that the stimulus created or saved between 2.5 million and 3.6 million jobs.





Policymakers today have no choice but to drastically reduce spending if we are to head off the looming fiscal train wreck.



Sounds good, but how did the CEA arrive at this conclusion?



Fuzzy math.



The first analysis used economic modeling to estimate the number of jobs created or saved. The model the CEA used assumed that government spending will have a positive multiplier effect on the economy. Voilà — the stimulus created jobs!



In the second analysis, the CEA estimated the stimulus bill’s effects by comparing real changes in gross domestic product and employment against a baseline forecast. However, even the CEA admits that this approach is subject to “considerable margins of error,” and that “the comparison will reflect not just the impact of fiscal policy, but all other unusual influences on the economy following passage of the Act.”



Translation: “We don’t know.”



That the stimulus did create jobs isn’t in question. The real question is whether it created any net jobs after all the negative effects of the spending and debt are taken into account. How many private‐​sector jobs were lost or not created in the first place because of the resources diverted to the government for its job creation?



Don’t expect the administration’s economists to attempt an answer to that question any time soon.



Here’s another question that the administration would prefer to ignore: How many jobs are being lost or not created because of increased uncertainty in the business community over future tax increases and other detrimental government policies?



The economist Robert Higgs coined the phrase “regime uncertainty” to describe Franklin Roosevelt’s anti‐​business climate, which prolonged the Great Depression. Unfortunately, this president is repeating the same mistake.



Health care mandates, cap‐​and‐​trade legislation, new financial regulations, union protections, and the probability of higher taxes to pay for the administration’s debt spree have caused innumerable businesses to remain on the sidelines.



As one small business owner recently told me, “I want to hire but I’m afraid the administration’s policies are going to force me to turn around and let them go.”



The president is countering these objections by traversing the country handing out government checks to pet industries. Apparently in the president’s economic Field of Dreams, “if we subsidize it, they will come.” Too bad past administrations have already poured billions of taxpayer dollars down the drain on similar failed top‐​down planning schemes.



So what should the administration do?



Put simply, the opposite of what it has been doing. It has become gospel in some quarters that massive deficit spending is necessary to get the economy back on its feet.



History offers no support for this contention.



Most recently, the Japanese tried to spend their way out of their economic doldrums in the 1990s. The result was Japan’s “lost decade.”



Our own history offers evidence that reducing the government’s footprint on the private sector is the better way to get the economy going. Take for example, the “Not‐​So‐​Great Depression” of 1920–21. Cato Institute scholar Jim Powell notes that President Warren G. Harding inherited from his predecessor Woodrow Wilson “a post‐​World War I depression that was almost as severe, from peak to trough, as the Great Contraction from 1929 to 1933 that FDR would later inherit.”



Instead of resorting to deficit spending to “stimulate” the economy, taxes and government spending were cut. Hello Roaring Twenties.



Similarly, fears at the end of World War II that demobilization would result in double‐​digit unemployment when the troops returned home were unrealized. Instead, spending was dramatically reduced, economic controls were lifted, and the returning troops were successfully reintegrated into the economy.



Policymakers today have no choice but to drastically reduce spending if we are to head off the looming fiscal train wreck. Stimulus proponents generally recognize that our fiscal path is unsustainable, but they argue that the current debt binge is nonetheless critical to an economic recovery. Nonsense.



Not only has Washington’s profligacy left us worse off, our children now face the prospect of reduced living standards and crushing debt.

"The eastern Caribbean island of Montserrat has suffered more than its fair share of natural disaster.  In 1989, Hurricane Hugo struck the island, causing massive destruction with more than 90% of the island’s structures damaged. In 1995, just as the island started to recover, the island’s Soufrière Hills volcano burst into life, entering a cycle of eruptive activity that continues to the present day. The eruption had an enormous impact on the island, killing 19 people, leaving two-thirds of the island nation uninhabitable, and in 1997 completely burying the capital city, Plymouth, under metres of volcanic rock, ash and mud. More than half the island’s population of around 10,000 were compelled to emigrate. Today, however, Montserrat is putting this violent geological heritage to good use. Known as the “Emerald Isle” of the Caribbean due to historical ties with the Irish, Montserrat (in fact a UK dependent territory) is poised to become one of the world’s few metaphorically “green” and sustainable islands. The same geological forces unleashed by the Soufrière Hills volcano are being harnessed to power the island’s electricity grid from a geothermal source.  Geothermal energy, the productive use of the vast quantity of thermal energy within the Earth’s crust, is one of the few renewable, low-carbon emission energy sources that can consistently generate power 24-hours a day, irrespective of the season. Its primary limitation is not weather but location, as it can only be exploited in places with specific geology, where some of the Earth’s intense inner heat reaches close enough to the surface to be of use.
Montserrat’s geology is ideal for geothermal use: hot molten magma rises to shallow depths, driven by the forces of regional plate tectonics. The heat from this magma warms the surrounding rocks, providing a heat source that can be tapped if it can be brought back to the surface. Rainwater and seawater are natural aids to this process as they penetrate through cracks and pores in the rocks to several kilometres beneath the island, absorbing heat from the magma heated rocks. Once heated, the hot fluid rises buoyantly to shallower levels where it can be tapped by drilling geothermal wells. As the ascending fluid boils it produces pressurised steam which rotates turbines to generate electricity. The high cost of drilling wells (a single well can cost several million US dollars) coupled with the potential risk of drilling an unproductive well, are the principle reasons that geothermal potential has not been fully exploited. To increase the likelihood of drilling a productive well, the project to exploit geothermal power on Montserrat used an array of technologies, such as magnetotellurics and seismic tomography to more clearly understand the rocks beneath the surface. Magnetotellurics uses naturally occurring signals from lightning storms and charged particles ejected from the sun to penetrate below ground. Seismic tomography uses the responses of pressure waves created by carefully generated explosions to generate images of the rocks. Aided by researchers at the University of Auckland these techniques were used to create the subsurface maps that have successfully guided Montserrat’s geothermal drilling programme. Between March and September of 2013 the Iceland Drilling Company drilled Montserrat’s first two geothermal wells, to depths of 2,300 and 2,900 metres, striking temperatures of over 260°C. While testing is still ongoing, the initial results suggest that the fluid flowing from the wells will be able to generate more power than needed by the island’s reduced population of around 5,000 inhabitants. Once completed, the geothermal power station will free the island from its current reliance on expensive diesel-powered generators for its electricity – currently among the most expensive electricity in the world. Montserrat is not the only nation in the region with geothermal aspirations. All of the islands of the Lesser Antilles have similar geological settings and therefore geothermal potential. The French island of Guadeloupe, with 15MW of installed capacity, is the only Caribbean island that currently uses geothermal energy for electricity, but recently private investment in St Kitts and Nevis and a European Union funded project in Dominica have also resulted in several promising exploratory wells, with discussions underway on other islands keen to harness their geothermal potential.  Geoscientists have recognised the geothermal potential of the region for many decades. But it is only in the past few years that the promise of a cheap, local energy source that can free the region from volatile oil prices has caught the imagination of regional governments and agencies."

Share this...FacebookTwitterEarlier in the week news poured out from the media about a commentary appearing in Nature by Gail Whiteman, Chris Hope, and Peter Wadhams, who claim that methane released by “thawing permafrost beneath the East Siberian Sea, off northern Russia, alone comes with an average global price tag of $60 trillion in the absence of mitigating action — a figure comparable to the size of the world economy in 2012.” Absurd.

Nature devolves to a science-fantasy tabloid.
In school we were taught when solving a science problem to ask yourself if the answer you got really made sense. For example: How big would John’s bucket need to be if he wanted to fill the bath tub with it in 15 minutes? If the answer you get is something 5000 cubic meters, then you can be sure the answer is wrong. If a student is unable to recognize that, then he/she needs to go back a few grades.
This appears to be the case with the “answers” Whiteman, Hope, and Wadhams came up with. Worse, the mainstream media and Nature editors could not even recognize the absurd dimensions of their claims. This is the sad state that the media and communicators of science have devolved to. The journal Nature has degenerated to a tabloid level.
The claims made by Whiteman, Hope, and Wadhams are so far out in left field that even notoriously warmist scientists such as Gavin Schmidt are embarrassed about them, and have publicly dismissed them in no uncertain terms.

The New York Times’ Andrew Revkin titled his blog commentary: “Arctic Methane Credibility Bomb“.
Judith Curry here called the claims “impossible”.
German energy think-tanker and warmist Oliver Geden tweeted: “We’ll see more of these hypes until #COP21“.
Geden reveals what this is really all about. It is not about sloppy quality control at Nature, but rather it’s about having thrown all quality standards overboard so that even highly imaginative fantasies about the future can find their way into the pages of Nature. It’s a last desperate attempt by catastrophe-obsessed ideologues to get attention for a dying narrative.
For some media, what appears in a once prestigious journal must still be good enough to pass on as news for the public without any scrutiny, just as Christoph Seidler of Spiegel demomnstrates. The flagship German news magazine gladly disseminated the outlandish apocalyptic claims as hard scientific news, even calling the result “a dizzying figure: it corresponds to the total annual world economic output.”

"The National Trust has reported that the seasonal activities of plants and animals in the UK have been exceptionally early in 2014. Spring and summer have come early – and observations from some parts of the country even suggest that typical autumn events, such as the development of beech nuts and hawthorn berries, are already in evidence. But, to understand effects on our wildlife, a longer view is needed. It’s clear from events recorded on the Woodland Trust’s Nature’s Calendar that the 2014 spring was indeed far in advance of 2013, which was one of the coldest on record. Not all the data is yet in, but for many events, such as the first flowering of bluebells or first sighting of peacock butterflies, average dates were between two and four weeks ahead of last year. Naturally, as the weather has continued to remain warm, it may follow that subsequent activity would also be ahead of schedule. However, it is unwise to make too many assumptions based on anecdotal evidence when looking ahead. As yet Nature’s Calendar has received no data on the first autumn indicators such as ripe blackberries or rowan berries. The average date for the first sighting of ripe blackberries historically tends to be well into August.  This is a great opportunity for people to keep an eye out for these first signs and help track the arrival of autumn. However there is still plenty of opportunity for the weather to change dramatically. It’s still even possible that autumn 2014 will arrive later than average. The events of 2013 and 2014 are a small part of longer-term changes in our natural environment. Colleagues and I at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology recently led a study that gathered together more than 25,000 long-term data sets on the timing of seasonal events for more than 700 species of plants and animals. The study considered a diverse array of organisms including plankton, plants, insects, amphibians, fish, birds and mammals.  Between 1976 and 2005, we found that most seasonal events had shifted their timing so that they now occur earlier in the year than they did just a few decades ago. We know from other studies that average flowering dates for a variety of plant species in Britain have been earlier in the past 20-30 years than at any other point in the last 250 years. Although it is clear that the biological seasons have been shifting in recent decades, not all species have shown the same degree of change in their seasonal activities. The CEH study showed that changes have been most rapid for many organisms at the bottom of food chains, such as plants and the animals that feed upon them. Predators, however, showed slower overall changes in the seasonal timing of their life-cycle events. This general pattern was mirrored in a recent [study](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.12326/abstract](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.12326/abstract) comparing changes in fish spawning times and seasonal peaks in plankton food resources in England’s largest lake, Windermere. This is important because, for many animals, the seasonal timing of reproduction is often matched to the time of year when food supply increases – so that offspring receive enough food to survive. If predators cannot keep pace with changes in the seasonal pattern of prey availability then their breeding success may falter and populations may decline.  It’s important to know whether these changes pose a threat to plant and animal populations, and we are already examining the evidence for such impacts in birds. A key question to study is whether animals higher up the food chain will be able to adapt to these changes in order to ensure survival. So, while year-to-year changes are noteworthy, it is the longer-term patterns, and knock-on effects, that are key to understanding how our wildlife will ultimately respond to changes in the seasons. Indeed, 2014 has been an interesting year to date – but the jury is still out on whether we will see more, or fewer, such years in the future. This article was co-authored by Chris Hickman from The Woodland Trust."
"Energy-generating solar panels provide the opportunity to generate low-carbon electricity from the roof over your head, at a cost that has fallen dramatically and continues to slide. So many governments worldwide have promoted the technology through policies such as net metering, feed-in tariffs and subsidies which have helped the use of solar energy to blossom over the past five years. However, rooftop solar panels, or photovoltaics (PV), require a large, unshaded, south-facing roof to generate maximum returns in Britain and similar countries in the northern hemisphere. As these are all things associated with a premium quality property, some have argued that solar energy subsidies simply provide already wealthy homeowners with a means to reduce their bills and generate income by selling energy back to the grid, at the expense of poorer households in rented flats next door.  A solar photovoltaic system can cost upwards of £6,000 but can earn the homeowner around £750 per year for the next 20 years in savings on energy bills and payments from incentives. This is particularly pertinent in the UK where subsidy payments, known as the feed-in tariff which ensures a good economic return for PV installations and is responsible for driving the growth of Britain’s PV industry, are paid through a levy on all consumers’ bills. When feed-in tariffs were introduced in 2010, it was envisioned this would lead to the annual household energy bill rising by £8 (where the average household bill is around £1,300 per year). So is this a government regressive tax? Not necessarily.  Various ways of taking advantage of solar power have arisen in the years since. Those with money but without a roof of their own can invest in solar power companies to reap the benefits. Community energy co-operatives such as Brixton Energy pool people’s cash in order to install solar panels on community roofs such as schools or sports centres, or local charities, providing each with extra income. The Solar Schools project for example asks local communities to donate toward installing PVs on school roofs, in order to provide a steady income for the school for the next 20 years. Crowdfunding has been the latest trend in clean energy investment and a number of ventures have used this method of raising seed capital in the UK and abroad. Through firms such as Abundance Generation anyone can invest as little as £5 into a renewable energy project, taking advantage of the high rates of return that renewable projects currently offer. For those with a roof but no money, sourcing finance for renewable energy projects has become easier. Even Ikea has started offering PV systems and the finance packages to afford them. Alternatively, companies such as ISIS Solar offer the equipment for free, lowering the homeowners’ bills and taking the feed-in tariff payments in return.  This has tempted the likes of housing associations and local authorities, as they can greatly reduce their tenants’ bills while also hitting their carbon emission reduction targets – without any up-front investment on their part. But what about those who live in a private rented flat and have no roof to offer nor money to invest? This is where the real value of distributed energy comes in, because through community energy co-operatives the benefits from distributed electricity generation can be shared. Brixton Energy, for example, adds a fraction of the profits from their rooftop solar projects to a community fund to pay for energy efficiency measures, advice and workshops to tackle fuel poverty and boost the cash-saving possibilities for the entire community. A greater adoption of solar power brings other benefits beyond clean electricity. A study by the Buildings Research Establishment found that the solar power industry in the UK employed 14,000 people in 2013. You could call that the equivalent of 20 jobs per megawatt of installed rooftop solar power capacity.  Another study that examined the case in the US found that PV systems employ more than double the number of people per megawatt of electricity generated than any other source of renewable energy – and far more than any fossil fuel. Because these jobs are also distributed among communities, the workers’ earnings are ploughed back into several local economies rather than into a single town which might be, for example, the site of a large power plant.  The cash saved by lowering electricity bills and earned from the feed-in tariff is also more likely to be spent within the local economy. By comparison, the profits of large multinational energy companies may be taken out of town or indeed entirely overseas by foreign shareholders.  So a subsidy for solar power doesn’t have to be a subsidy for the rich. Rooftop solar can help grow local economies, provide local jobs and increase local spending. At the same time it can provide a bulwark against energy poverty through the work of community energy co-operatives and installations that provide power to social housing. Photovoltaics are nothing less than a democratising force on the energy supply system – but this requires people, communities and companies to act together to make the most of it."

Before the red blooded meat eating, beer and whiskey brigade have conniptions about my choice of website for this disclosure, let me assure you that good vegan food is very appealing and healthy despite the well-bandied-unhealthy-vegan-walking-advertisements for why you should not go there. 



And just to be clear – veganism is the new black in food – super trendy – but eating vegan just to be in vogue does not fly with me. In fact, I despise the Hollywood beautiful who condemn meat eaters for their support of “cruelty to animals”. I think they’ve been watching too many Halal killings and I suspect vegan eating is simply a healthy way to keep their weight down for the next all important movie with bonus PR for joining the politically correct climate change set.



I do not buy into forgoing meat to save the planet as PETA suggests under the heading “Fight Climate Change by Going Vegan”. 



If you’re serious about protecting the environment, the most important thing that you can do is stop eating meat, eggs, and dairy “products”.



Absolute rubbish! Climate change is by no means a proven scientific disaster. The real reason I enjoy vegan food is very simple and non-political – done well it tastes soooo good. I love staying with my vegan family and eating their vegan food because, well, the food is just so damn good, it’s varied and delicious. In fact, I’d swap it out for my humble meaty menu at home any day, but sadly I don’t have the resources, or the inclination, to go fully vegan.



And these days, the nutrition from vegan eating is, in my experience, superior to what you get from the meat and three veg. Here’s a comment from a vegan athlete about getting sufficient daily protein for his muscle repair needs.  




Make sure you include a decent protein source, even if just a little bit, in every meal or snack.



“Mainly, this just keeps you mindful and prevents you from slipping into junk-food-vegan, carbohydrate-only mode. It’s as easy as adding nuts or beans to your salad, protein powder to your smoothie, almond butter on your bagel, or beans to your pasta dish (actually not an inauthentic thing to do in italy). for snacks, eat a handful of nuts, spread some sunflower butter on your apple, make roasted chickpeas, dip a pita in some hummus…all of these add just a little bit of protein, but if you eat two or three snacks a day, it all adds up.” 



  
Vegan food done well is pretty much unbeatable in my book, in terms of attractiveness, taste and nutrition. Much of it is raw, and creativity successfully substitutes the missing meat, dairy, eggs and fish. 



But it’s not easy to produce appealing vegan food – which is why it’s got such a bad rap. That and the concept of roughly chopped raw veg artfully laid on a plate with flowers, fruit and nuts or fake meat is not where good vegan food is at all. Good vegan food has sauces and food combinations to delight the senses. Nuts are used too for vegan milks and cheeses, including Parmesan, and jackfruit and sweet potato replicates the texture of meat.



Vegan desserts are delicious and some of the richest, most decadent you will ever taste. You’d never recognise the lack of eggs and cream.



In truth, I’m a lazy cook – not clever or resourceful enough to reproduce the texture and flavour of good vegan food, so I don’t even bother to try. Plus, it’s time consuming soaking beans and all the rest, and then you’ve got to invest in a myriad of spices, sauces and condiments. 



I regard veganism as a new religion, requiring huge dedication and commitment. It’s more than just substituting fake chicken or mince, it’s using a variety of ingredients in a cunning fashion that awakens all the senses, including the palate.



To motivate yourself into the vegan mindset you could watch “Cowspiracy” or “73 Cows”, but I refuse to because, quite frankly, I like eating cows – and pigs and fish and chickens… sorry, they are not my friends – they are my food. Actually, I never met the animals before they became my food, so any moral dilemma is solved right there.



My extended family sigh when hosting the vegans, serving up their bewilderingly bland salad and boiled veg while quietly sniggering about people stupid enough to refuse the hero of their meal, which is always the meat. I don’t bother explaining that good vegan food is an art, and their tasteless offerings would never make the vegan cut in a month of Sunday roasts. There are some things best left unsaid in the interests of maintaining good family relationships.



But I cannot lie, there is nothing quite as good as sneaking out for a crisp, crunchy BLT in the middle of my vegan eating stint. In my part-time vegan world, I happily allow myself the best of both worlds – a foot in both camps. Live and let live, I say – unless you are my food, of course. Also, I’m not abandoning my commitment to our farmers, traditionally the backbone of the economy and hopefully will be for a long time to come.

"Iraq has a long and rich heritage, home for thousands of years to mighty empires – Assyria and Babylon, the Abbasid caliphate – that ruled the region once known as Mesopotamia, widely held as the cradle of western civilisation and as a major centre of classical Islam. The region is thick with history, and historical artefacts. But when in June the extremist Sunni group ISIS took over swathes of northern Iraq, within a day or two of taking Mosul the group issued edicts which included orders to destroy Shiite graves and shrines and other ancient relics – orders which appear to have been carried out, with six sites destroyed. Rumour and fears over the possible fate of the region’s even more ancient cultural heritage under this heavy-handed new regime have filled the gap since.  And there is much to lose. In the desert 100km southwest of Mosul lies Hatra, an Arab city of the Roman period rather like its more famous sisters Palmyra, Petra and Baalbeck. It is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site with fabulous stone temples and statues (the originals now mostly in the Iraq Museum). Mosul was heartland of the Assyrian Empire, which ruled the Middle East  in the first millennium BC. Huge ruin mounds of ancient cities such as Ashur, Nimrud, and Nineveh follow the course of the Tigris river from Qalaat Sherqat up to Mosul and beyond. Since the mid-19th century its palaces and temples have furnished museums worldwide with monumental stone carvings of winged bulls and lions, and scenes of military conquest. Tens of thousands of cuneiform clay tablets, the majority now in the British Museum in London or the Iraq Museum in Baghdad, provide unparallelled insight into the workings of empire nearly 3,000 years ago. The region is still dense with churches and monasteries from its time as a centre of Christian learning in the first millennium AD, which house important manuscript libraries as well as some of the last speakers of Aramaic, the language spoken by Jesus and the disciples. Although the last remaining Jewish inhabitants left the region in the 1950s, the Jewish community had first settled there as deportees from Assyria in the 8th century BC. Mosul remained important during the Islamic period too. It was a centre of resistance against the crusaders – Saladin ruled from here – and home to eminent poets, scientists and men of letters. Many medieval buildings, both secular and sacred, survive to this day. But what do we know about these developments, what can we expect, and can and should the rest of the world do about it? It is almost impossible to get verifiable news out of Mosul at the moment. The province goes for long periods without electricity or suffers communications blackouts. It is difficult to get through to colleagues by phone or by email. ISIS itself, however, is very adept at exploiting social media. The internet is filled with claims and counterclaims which makes it almost impossible to document reliably what is really happening. However,  websites such as Conflict Antiquities and Gates of Nineveh are both keeping track as best they can. The Association for the Protection of Syrian Archaeology has for three years documented the looting and destruction of cultural heritage in the occupied regions Iraq’s western neighbour, including a few isolated examples of iconoclastic smashing of ancient Assyrian statuary. It has been reported that sales of looted antiquities have helped to fund ISIS in Syria although, again, hard facts are hard to come by. The understandable concern is that similar events will unfold in northern Iraq, although there is no evidence of it yet. While the experience in Syria suggests it is very likely, the historical evidence from within Iraq during the 1990s and 2000s reveals a different picture. During that time there were isolated instances of thefts from Assyrian archaeological sites for sale on the world market. Thanks to thorough archaeological documentation, however, it was possible to identify and repatriate stolen objects. Likewise, in the current situation, documented artefacts from museums and archaeological sites could all be potentially identified and recoverable if they were looted and smuggled out of the country. But objects dug from as yet unexcavated sites are much harder to provenance. The tragedy is that however many thousands of artefacts are found attractive and durable enough for sale to make the pillaging worthwhile, many many more – and all of their archaeological context – will have been irreversibly destroyed in the process. The remoteness of desert sites in southern Iraq meant it was relatively straightforward to dig for Sumerian and Babylonian antiquities in the 1990s and 2000s. However, the Assyrian sites of northern Iraq have remained relatively untouched, so far. But 2014 is not 1991 or 2003, and ultimately it is impossible to predict what will happen. International treaties such the 1970 UNESCO convention against the illicit sale of cultural property,supported by national legislation, have drastically curtailed worldwide sales of Iraqi antiquities in the past ten years. But this has also driven the market underground, from where it is even harder to track stolen artefacts.  Why should we care about the fate of a few ancient statues and buildings? Is it not a first world indulgence to worry about preserving culture while people suffer and die? On the contrary, culture and people are inseparable: it is individuals and communities who create culture, culture that brings people together in meaningful, creative and constructive ways. Culture is the glue that holds societies together. It is a fundamental part of being human, living together.  We all have a duty to protect and celebrate Iraq’s multi-faceted cultural heritage, now and for future generations. It matters deeply to many Iraqis – and to many of the rest of us – and its fate cannot be separated from the human tragedy that is currently unfolding."
"Some years ago New Yorker magazine printed a cartoon showing a group of high society ladies enjoying an afternoon cup of tea. One lady turns to her neighbour and says, “I don’t know why I don’t care about the bottom of the ocean, but I don’t.” It’s often argued that we know more about the surface of the moon than we do about the bottom of the ocean, and the New York society ladies perfectly reflect the issue – what’s out of sight is out of mind. Does it matter that we know so little about the largest areas on our planet? Does the deep sea do anything for society? Is it important? An eclectic group of scientists, fishing representatives and government policy makers is meeting today in Edinburgh to discuss the future of Scotland’s deep seas. Here in the UK the vast majority of deep-sea territory is to the west of Scotland beneath the Atlantic waters that stretch out to Rockall. From the surface, the grey expanse of the Atlantic hides a seabed that is far from a featureless expanse of sand and mud. The edge of the continental shelf is strewn with rocks dropped from icebergs at the end of the last glaciation.  These rocks provide a perch for corals and sponges to settle and feed, growing into elaborate colonies that can live for hundreds of years. In some places these corals and sponges cover the seabed, forming deep-water coral reefs and sponge fields.  Although these deep-sea habitats have been known since the 19th century oceanographic expeditions led by Edinburgh’s Charles Wyville Thomson, it is only in the past two decades that researchers have begun to uncover their true extent and diversity. Using acoustic technologies borrowed from the military and oil industry, marine scientists can now map the seabed in glorious three-dimensional detail. These surveys are revealing not only the diversity of habitats in Scotland’s deep seas, but they also tell us that many have been damaged.  From linear scars cutting across sonar surveys to photographs of smashed coral colonies, evidence has accumulated not only from Scotland but also Ireland, Norway and beyond that deep-water trawl fishing has damaged and in some cases destroyed deep-sea habitats that have developed since the last ice age 10,000 years ago. But if the fish caught are an essential part of our food security and the populations of deep-sea fish are in good shape, perhaps this is a price worth paying.  The deep seas west of Scotland have been fished for more than 30 years. Populations of deep-water fish have declined. Some deep-sea sharks are now on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List as “endangered” (Portuguese dogfish and leafscale gulper shark) and “critically endangered” (gulper shark).  Deep-sea fish catches follow characteristic cycles of boom in the early days and bust as the populations are fished down. Why is this? The pace of life in the deep sea is slow. Food rains down from the surface waters and the animals of the deep sea are adapted with slow growth, long lifespans and low rates of reproduction.  For these reasons, the scientific consensus is that for the vast majority of deep-sea fisheries to be sustainable, the harvest rates must be very, very low. Because deep-sea fish live in mixed populations, it is also hard to target any one species of fish without catching others. Neither are deep-sea fish a significant part of food security. The combined catch of fish from the water column and seabed from the seas around Rockall, Bailey and the Faroe-Shetland channel, which are mostly relatively shallow stocks of haddock and monkfish, add up to just 8% of the value of the catch landed in Scotland.  In March 2013 the European Union’s environment committee voted in favour of a proposal to phase out deep-sea bottom trawling and gill net fishing below 200m, but this measure was subsequently rejected by the fisheries committee. In December when put to a vote, the European Parliament was split but narrowly rejected this proposal.  There are a number of reasons for the close nature of the vote. Not all the fish populations taken at 200m depth are in decline. Some are well managed and are important to vulnerable local communities in areas such as the western Highlands. There was also the question that if Europe had completely banned deep-water fishing, would some of the vessels have moved further afield to waters off west Africa, or to international waters where there is little or no regulation? In life there are no simple answers, but we can look for guiding principles and examples of good practice. Good work has been done to create marine protected areas (MPAs) in the deep waters west of Scotland. But these MPAs have been put in place without understanding how the areas are connected ecologically.  The challenges of deep-sea sampling mean that we know very little about how deep-sea animal populations are structured. Larger-scale projects integrating genetics with new models of ocean circulation are needed to fill these major gaps. But perhaps the most important issue is to celebrate the diversity of deep-sea life and share the information beyond the confines of academic journals and dry policy documents.  People don’t care about things they have never seen and know nothing about. But I expect the New York ladies would object noisily if someone suggested bulldozing the pyramids or felling the last few stands of giant redwoods.  The issues of deep-sea fishing and its sustainability are a global concern, and the debate in Europe has reached a critical point. It now remains to be seen if a scientifically credible and politically feasible agreement can be reached that will allow the European Union to show global leadership in managing its share of the largest ecosystem on Earth.  A Sustainable Future for Scotland’s Deep Seas will take place in Edinburgh at Our Dynamic Earth at 6pm on Monday April 28. To register email deepsea@mcsuk.org"
"The plan to use baited traps to catch and kill sharks off the coast of Western Australia caused considerable controversy when it was announced last year, with critics calling the shark cull ineffective, inhumane, and irresponsible.  Now the Western Australian state government has published a review of the trial cull between January and April of this year, and has recommended that it continue until 2017. While the review seeks to address concerns and to allay any misconceptions, it fundamentally supports the continual culling of sharks with no scientific justification. The report states: there is conjecture about the reasons for recent increases in shark attacks in Western Australian water [and] there is currently insufficient evidence to clearly establish a cause. Where then without scientific evidence is the justification to continue culling several shark species, including bull, tiger and great white sharks? The increased spate of shark attacks in the past ten years is cause for concern for the tourism industry. The report argues that the programme aims to enhance public safety by capturing potentially dangerous sharks that come close to popular beaches and surfing spots during summer.  The cull still fails to address the matter of shark species, in particular the great white, which is listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.  The justification for continuing the culling using drum lines – baited hooks attached to floating, anchored barrels – is questionable. The report provides information on a “comprehensive risk assessment” which concluded that the programme posed “negligible risk to the target species, non-target species of marine fauna and the broader ecosystem.”  Sharks are essential apex predators, ultimately helping to regulate and maintain the balance of marine ecosystems. While they have been mislabelled as ferocious killers, of the 172 sharks caught none were great whites. This seems to be an expensive and unscientific failure, as the report discloses that in the 20 attacks in Western Australia of the past 100 years, great whites have been responsible for 11 It was also thought that the government was aware that numbers of great whites at the time of the project were lower than at other times of the year. The report quotes evidence showing that bull sharks and tiger sharks are responsible for most shark attacks around the world and that the number of unprovoked attacks is rising. Where is the evidence directly related to the Western Australian coasts to back up these statements?  Alarmingly, the report shows consultation meetings were held without including environment groups, due to their position being “already known”. One wonders how there could ever have been a fair and balanced debate if some viewpoints were ignored. The report recommends that trapping and culling recommence in mid-November each year over the period of 2014-2017, in an attempt to capturing large great whites – even though it states that “perhaps the most prevalent criticism of the programme is that it is not based on science”.  Indeed, most of the scientific references used to support the report’s conclusions regarding catching sharks with drum lines and impact on by-catch are too outdated to support any conclusions. More quality research data is required for this, yet the trial has produced little if any. The drum lines have also resulted in casualties beyond just sharks, ensnaring seven rays and one northwest blowfish, but fortunately no turtles, dolphins or whales. The inadequacies in many areas of the report display an inability to recognise the threat we are creating for these vulnerable species at the expense of humans having a “good, shark free holiday” on the beaches of Western Australia. There was a positive note in the review that provides a comprehensive suite of shark hazard mitigation strategies for the future. These include commitments for more research into shark behaviour, shark deterrents and detection, acoustic tagging, aerial patrols, equipment for Surf Life Saving WA, a beach enclosure, beach watchtowers and community awareness initiatives.  Shark hazard mitigation is a complex issue. No clear cause has been established for the increase in attacks – seven deaths in three years between 2010 and 2013. The simplest would be to leave the sharks alone. Humans, if they don’t want to take the risk, shouldn’t go in the water."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s version of Britain’s UKIP party is the new AfD Alternative_for_Germany party. The AfD party is the result of Germany’s established parties having stopped listening to its citizens. It takes a position against the euro-currency, the hysterical transition to renewable energies, and has cast considerable doubt over climate science itself.
Now it is being violently assaulted at campaign rallies by green, leftist thugs. Hat-tip: Bernd Felsche at FB.
In the latest incident, the AfD held a campaign rally yesterday in the northern port city of Bremen in order to express ideas and to debate the issues of our time. However, in today’s environmentally radical Germany, expressing alternative ideas and dissent are not welcome. And as yesterday’s event shows, you’re putting your health and life at risk if you do so. Here’s a press release from the Bremen Police Department.
Location: Bremen, 24 August 2013, 15.30. Today, this afternoon, a campaign event by the party ‘Alternative für Deutschland’ took place at the Bremer Bürgerpark. This event was stormed hit-and-run-style by attackers. Multiple persons were injured. At 3 p.m. the campaign event started on an open air stage. During a speech by the chairperson of the ‘Alternative für Deutschland”, the event was suddenly stormed by 20 – 25 partially masked persons. Eight persons succeeded to get onto the stage. The attackers used pepper spray in the stage area. This led to 16 people being injured. When the police intervened the attackers fled the park. During the pursuit one helper of the ‘Alternative für Deutschland’ was attacked with a knife. He was lightly injured to the hand as he defended himself. All persons who were injured by the pepper spray suffered irritated eyes and respiration. Among the injured were two children aged 7 and 11 and one police officer.  All the injured were treated on site by an ambulance. The injured police officer continued his duty. Three persons (22, 25 and 27 years old) were arrested. They probably can be assigned to the left-wing spectrum. The police investigation is ongoing. The police are investigating for massive disruption of the peace. The event by the ‘Alternative für Deutschland’ resumed and ended as planned at 6:30 p.m. Further witnesses are being asked to report to the criminal authorities at (0421) 362-3888.”
Here’s a video of the AfD incident from one angle. Green activists keep writing that the AfD is a party of “racists, right-wing populists and Nazis.” All the middle-aged, honest hardworking folks you see in attendance are viewed by the greens and like-thinkers as “threats“.

Green violence on-stage for the whole world to see. Seven and 11-year old children injured in the planned attack.
So who just were these “left-wing” thug attackers? All the evidence points to one colour: Greens.
Intolerant and aggressive announcements by a number green sites against the AfD party have been mounting in the internet lately. For example, two weeks ago, the website “Gruene Jugend Goettingen” (Green Youths Göttingen) agitated its base by posting: “GRÜNE JUGEND Göttingen calling for protests against the AfD”. One of its members even called on “fighting against the right-wing populists and Nazis as a reason to protest the campaign events of the Alternative for Germany“. This is a new level of intolerance. If one disagrees with the Green movement, then you get defamed as right-wing extremists and Nazis.

Even Germany’s Green Party, which is polling at a formidable 15% in German surveys, is calling on Greens: “Don’t allow the campaign of the AfD any room!“.
Bremen was hardly the first time the AfD has been the target of physical violence by such radicals. The Green Party page continuously portrays the AfD as a “right-wing, extremist, democracy-hostile party” in a propagandist attempt to demonize the AfD, just as Al Gore does so by comparing climate skeptics and Tea Party activists to homophobes, Holocaust deniers, and alcoholics.
Green attacks nationwide
Two weeks ago at a campaign event in Gottingen, the AfD was also attacked by intolerant, violent radicals who “physically assaulted campaign helpers“.  The Hannover Zeitung here reports:
Time and again all over Germany there’s the destruction of Alternative für Deutschland campaign posters and attacks on campaign helpers. For example in Lübeck one quarter of all posters that had been put up were destroyed. […] In Berlin stones were thrown at a truck loaded with AfD posters. Similar attacks also occurred in Giessen and Nuremberg. …”
Green leader Marie Kollenrott denies that the Greens have anything to do with the violence, and blames fringe radicals: “The GREENS reject violence as a means for political debate.” Unfortunately her base doesn’t appear to be listening, and they are becoming increasingly violent and dangerous to Germany’s open society. The constant hate-filled stream of propaganda the German greens put out against the AfD and dissenters incites weak-minded activists to commit acts of violence.  It’s sad that Green leaders are too spiteful to see this.
AfD deputy spokeswoman Frauke Petry says: “The events in Gottingen remind us of the worst time of the Weimar Republic.” Deputy AfD spokesman Konrad Adam adds: “These kinds of incidents should be a concern to everyone. These attacks are on democracy itself.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterGEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel has issued a press release.
In truth it says that the strong warming of 1978 to 1998 is in large part due to Pacific ocean cycles. We can now close the books on the silly CO2 science.
Here is the press release in English (my emphasis):
August 22, 2013/Kiel. Will there be rather warm or cold winters in Germany in the coming years? We may have a long way to go before reliable forecasts of this kind can be achieved. However, marine scientists, under the auspices of the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel, recently managed to successfully hindcast climate shifts in the Pacific. These shifts also have a profound effect on the average global surface air temperature of the Earth. The most recent shift in the 1990s is one of the reasons that the Earth’s temperature has not risen further since 1998. The study, published in the online edition of Journal of Climate, shows the potential for long-term climate predictions.
What happened in the years 1976/77 and 1998/99 in the Pacific was so unusual that scientists spoke of abrupt climate changes. They referred to a sudden warming of the tropical Pacific in the mid-1970s and rapid cooling in the late 1990s. Both events turned the world’s climate topsy-turvy and are clearly reflected in the average temperature of the Earth. Today we know that the cause is the interaction between ocean and atmosphere. Is it possible to successfully predict such climate shifts? This is the question that scientists, under the auspices of the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel, pursued. Using a coupled model of the ocean and the atmosphere, they were able to successfully replicate these events.
“The ocean plays a crucial role in our climate system, especially when it comes to fluctuations over several years or decades,” explains Prof. Mojib Latif, co-author of the study. “The chances of correctly predicting such variations are much better than the weather for the next few weeks, because the climate is far less chaotic than the rapidly changing weather conditions,” said Latif. This is due to the slow changes in ocean currents which affect climate parameters such as air temperature and precipitation. “The fluctuations of the currents bring order to the weather chaos”.
The researchers used a climate model, a so-called coupled ocean-atmosphere model, which they forced with the observed wind data of the last decades. For the abrupt changes during the 1970s and 1990s they calculated predictions which began a few months prior to the beginning of the observed climate shifts. The average of all predictions for both abrupt changes shows good agreement with the observed climate development in the Pacific. “The winds change the ocean currents which in turn affect the climate. In our study, we were able to identify and realistically reproduce the key processes for the two abrupt climate shifts,” says Prof. Latif. “We have taken a major step forward in terms of short-term climate forecasting, especially with regard to the development of global warming. However, we are still miles away from any reliable answers to the question whether the coming winter in Germany will be rather warm or cold”. Prof. Latif cautions against too much optimism regarding short-term regional climate predictions: “Since the reliability of those predictions is still at about 50%, you might as well flip a coin”.

"Fringe climate science deniers who spread online disinformation are now downplaying the seriousness of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a new analysis.  DeSmog, a blog and organization that tracks the culprits behind false information about the climate crisis, identified about 70 individuals and groups questioning the deadliness of the coronavirus and pushing for an end to social distancing, along with protesters who have been encouraged by Donald Trump. From the conservative conspiracy theorist Alex Jones to the US-based Heartland Institute and UK-based James Delingpole, the review concludes that the same influencers trying to make the public question the severity of global heating are also discounting the science surrounding Covid-19. “The climate war has largely been about confusing the public and making people trust in science and government less,” said DeSmog’s executive director, Brendan DeMelle. “And here we are in a pandemic where science and global cooperation are critical, and that’s a threat to the ideology of a lot of these … organizations. “You end up with this conspiracy theory about big government taking over our lives, taking away our freedoms, subjecting us to stay-at-home orders that we have to liberate ourselves from,” DeMelle said. DeSmog also identified fossil fuel and chemical industry aligned interests touting single-use plastics in personal protective gear, food packaging and grocery bags. John Cook, who studies climate denial at the center for climate change communication at George Mason University, said he expected the overlap but was surprised by the extent of the parallels. “People who are politically conservative and who value individual rights over collective responsibility are less supporting of social distancing policies and also just have a lower understanding of the dangers of Covid-19,” Cook said, citing emerging polling data. Cook outlines five techniques of science denial that people should watch for, including the cherry-picking of data. “The latest argument that we should relax social distancing because the curve [of cases] is flattening is very much an example of cherry-picking,” Cook said. In the US, some of the same groups that have petitioned the Trump administration to debate human-caused climate disruption and to roll back climate standards are sowing distrust of epidemiological research. Jay Lehr, the former science director of the Heartland Institute who now works for the Canada-based International Climate Science Coalition, on 30 March said people have been “barraged on the 24/7 news cycle for years” about climate change and now “face a more realistic fear of the most contagious virus any of us have ever experienced” but “both, however, suffer from questionable statistics and predictions that make us wonder what is real and what is someone’s best guess”. Heartland’s communications director, Jim Lakely, in a podcast about the “Wuhan virus” on 15 March compared the virus to a bad flu season and said that while “the panic is definitely more dangerous than the flu – this has to be put in perspective. “We have to think about the economic damage this is doing to the country. This is incalculable,” Lakely said. The Heartland Institute also posted a piece by economics professor Daniel Sutter arguing that alternative strategies to social distancing – like sheltering vulnerable populations – “could have mitigated the human toll at a significantly lower economic and social cost”. The Manhattan Institute, which calls itself a free-market thinktank, ran an article from Heather MacDonald in which she wrote: “Even if my odds of dying from coronavirus should suddenly jump ten-thousand-fold, from the current rate of 0.000012 percent across the U.S. population all the way up to 0.12 percent, I’d happily take those odds over the destruction being wrought on the U.S. and global economy from this unbridled panic.” The Media Research Center in a video said: “This is exactly how they incite mass panic: through lies and deception and exploiting ignorance. It’s how they convince people that we’re all going to die because Trump doesn’t believe in science or something.” Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who founded Infowars, has called the virus a “hoax” and appeared at a “You Can’t Close America” rally in Austin on Saturday, where he shook hands with unmasked supporters. Fossil fuel supporters have also capitalized on the pandemic to warn of the costs of climate action. Alex Epstein, the founder of the Center for Industrial Progress which DeSmog cites as associated with various groups connected to the rightwing billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, called the current recession a “mild preview of the Green New Deal”, and said that “our biggest ally in the fight against coronavirus is the fossil fuel industry.” The links between climate science denial and Covid-19 downplaying reach outside the US. In the UK, Delingpole, a rightwing commentator, has reposted calls to rapidly return to regular life. In a recent podcast, he called doubters of quarantining measures “lockdown skeptics”, and referred to those who support social distancing as “hysterical bedwetters”. He accused the media of promoting panic in “hysterical tabloids”."
"**The testing of people without Covid symptoms is starting in Scotland in a bid to trace the virus more effectively.**
Residents in five coronavirus hotspots where cases are ""stubbornly high"" are being targeted as part of a trial.
Tests are now available for students planning to return home from university, and there are plans to expand testing within healthcare settings.
Testing of people without symptoms began on Thursday in **Alloa** , Clackmannanshire, after a mobile testing unit was set up in the car park of the town hall.
It will be operational until Wednesday following evidence of spread in the community and local care homes. The virus has also affected local schools.
In Glasgow, residents in **Dalmarnock** and parts of **Pollokshields** are also being encouraged to book a test if they do not have Covid symptoms.
Two sites will be operational on week days from Monday until 9 December between 09:00 and 18:00 and each will be able to test up to 800 people a day.
Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken said: ""If we could make sure that we tell people that they've got it, even when they have no symptoms then that would be another step in the fight against staying in level four.""
In East Ayrshire, people who live in **Stewarton** , **Dalmellington** and **Bellsbank** are being invited to take a test next week.
A mobile testing unit will be set up at the Rose Reilly Sports Centre in Stewarton from Monday until Friday 4 December.
It will then relocate to the Dalmellington Area Centre from Saturday until Monday 7 December.
The units, which will be operated by the Scottish Ambulance Service, aim to deliver results within 24 to 48 hours.
In South Ayrshire, tests will be available at the **Girvan** Quay Zone from Monday until Friday, from 10:00 to 16:00.
And from Saturday to 7 December appointments will also be available at the John Pollock Centre in **Ayr.**
The asymptomatic tests in all of the locations can be booked online by local residents.
Meanwhile, a drop-in testing service will be available at **Johnstone** town hall, Renfrewshire, from Wednesday for seven days.
Local residents will be offered lateral flow tests, which can be processed on site and give a result within an hour.
It will have the capacity to test up to 12,000 people a week.
Experts say mass testing could cut the chain of transmission by identifying asymptomatic cases of coronavirus, and could be expanded to more communities if it is successful.
Scotland's clinical director, Professor Jason Leitch, has previously ruled out a city-wide mass testing programme like that in Liverpool, saying he wanted to target smaller areas where communication with the public would be easier.
Health Secretary Jeane Freeman announced a significant expansion of asymptomatic testing, using rapid turnaround lateral flow tests, last week.
Lateral flow devices have allowed the introduction of mass testing but they are not as accurate as the PCR tests which are carried out at NHS test centres and identify about seven in 10 positive cases of Covid.
Testing for Covid is being extended to everyone admitted to hospital emergency departments, acute assessment centres, maternity units and emergency mental health units.
By mid-December that will be extended to all medical and surgical elective admissions.
The Scottish government wants to extend routine testing to all healthcare workers.
Over the month of December, it will phase in twice-weekly testing for everyone working in ""patient-facing"" roles in hospitals as well as in the Scottish Ambulance Service, Covid Assessment Centres and NHS workers who visit care homes
There are up to 42,000 care home residents across Scotland and they are currently allowed one designated visitor.
The aim is to give the visitor a lateral flow test on the day of the visit so that if it is positive they can isolate and avoid harming the resident.
An initial rollout will begin with 12 care homes across four local authority areas from 7 December.
The full roll out across all homes will completed take until early February.
To facilitate Christmas visiting in all care homes, PCR testing will be provided for those that do not have access to lateral flow testing by that time.
From mid-January, care home workers will be included in the testing programme, including permanent and visiting staff.
It also includes staff who are personal assistants to a person's home and covers residential settings, sheltered housing and day care.
The Scottish government said the logistics of this were not straightforward and it would start in the local authority areas with the highest virus prevalence and hope to cover the whole sector by March.
Tens of thousands of students are being encouraged to get tested before they travel back to their family homes.
They are being offered two lateral flow tests, three days apart, from Monday. St Andrews University began its mass testing on Saturday.
The Scottish government said details would be set out shortly for the staggered return of university students in the new year and how testing would be put in place again.
All school staff can currently access testing if they are concerned they have been at risk from infection.
Deputy First Minister John Swinney said he was committed to exploring how he could extend testing for teachers further.
Pilot programmes will begin in the new year."

Last week I was on John Stossel’s (most excellent) new show on Fox Business News to discuss energy policy -- in particular, popular myths that Republicans have about energy markets. One of the topics I touched upon was nuclear power. My argument was the same that I have offered in print: Nuclear power is a swell technology but, given the high construction costs associated with building nuclear reactors, it’s a technology that cannot compete in free markets without a massive amount of government support. If one believes in free markets, then one should look askance at such policies.   
  
As expected, the atomic cult has taken offense.   
  
Now, it is reasonable to argue that excessive regulatory oversight has driven up the cost of nuclear power and that a “better” regulatory regime would reduce costs. Perhaps. But I have yet to see any concrete accounting of exactly which regulations are “bad” along with associated price tags for the same. If anyone out there in Internet-land has access to a good, credible accounting like that, please, send it my way. But until I see something tangible, what we have here is assertion masquerading as fact.   
  
Most of those who consider themselves “pro-nuke” are unaware of the fact that the current federal regulatory regime was thoroughly reformed in the late 1990s to comport with the industry’s model of what a “good” federal regulatory regime would look like. As Oliver Kingsley Jr., the President of Exelon Nuclear, put it in Senate testimony back in 2001: 



The current regulatory environment has become more stable, timely, and predictable, and is an important contributor to improved performance of nuclear plants in the United States. This means that operators can focus more on achieving operational efficiencies and regulators can focus more on issues of safety significance. It is important to note that safety is being maintained and, in fact enhanced, as these benefits of regulatory reform are being realized. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission -- and this Subcommittee -- can claim a number of successes in their efforts to improve the nuclear regulatory environment. These include successful implementation of the NRC Reactor Oversight Process, the timely extension of operating licenses at Calvert Cliffs and Oconee, the establishment of a one-step licensing process for advanced reactors, the streamlining of the license transfer process, and the increased efficiency in processing licensing actions.



It’s certainly possible that the industry left some desirable reforms undone, but it seems relevant to me that the Nuclear Energy Institute -- the trade association for the nuclear energy industry and a fervent supporter of all these government assistance programs -- does not complain that they’re being unfairly hammered by costly red-tape.   
  
For the most part, however, the push-back against the arguments I offered last week has little to do with this. It has to do with bias. According to a post by Rod Adams over at “Atomic Insights Blog,” I am guilty of ignoring subsidies doled-out to nuclear’s biggest competitor -- natural gas -- and because Cato gets money from Koch Industries, it’s clear that my convenient neglect of that matter is part of a corporate-funded attack on nuclear power. Indeed, Mr. Adams claims that he has unearthed a “smoking gun” with this observation.   
  
Normally, I would ignore attacks like this. This particular post, however, offers the proverbial “teachable moment” that should not be allowed to go to waste.   




First, let’s look at the substance of the argument. Did I “give natural gas a pass” as Mr. Adams contends? Well, yes and no; the show was about the cost of nuclear power, not the cost of natural gas. I did note that natural gas-fired electricity was more attractive in this economic environment than nuclear power, something that happens to be true. Had John Stossel asked me about whether gas’ economic advantage was due to subsidy, I would have told him that I am against natural gas subsidies as well -- a position I have staked-out time and time again in other venues (while there are plenty of examples, this piece I co-authored with Daniel Becker -- then of the Sierra Club -- for _The Los Angeles Times_ represents my thinking on energy subsidies across the board. A blog post a while back about the Democratic assault on oil and gas subsidies found me arguing that the D’s should actually go further! Dozens of other similar arguments against fossil fuel subsidies can be found on my publications page). So let’s dispose of Mr. Adams’ implicit suggestion that I am some sort of tool for the oil and gas industry, arguing against subsidies _here_ but not against subsidies _there_.   
  
Second, let’s consider the implicit assertion that Mr. Adams makes -- that natural gas-fired electricity is more attractive than nuclear power primarily because of subsidy. The most recent and thorough assessment of this matter comes from Prof. Gilbert Metcalf, an economist at Tufts University. Prof. Metcalf agrees with a 2004 report from the Energy Information Administration which contended that preferences for natural gas production in the tax code do little to increase natural gas production and thus do little to make natural gas less expensive than it might otherwise be. They are wealth transfers for sure, but they do not do much to change natural gas supply or demand curves and thus do not affect consumer prices. Prof. Metcalf argues that if we had truly level regulatory playing field without any tax distortions, natural gas-fired electricity would actually go down, not up! Government intervention in energy markets does indeed distort gas-fired electricity prices. It makes those prices _higher_ than they otherwise would be!   
  
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) identified five natural gas subsidies in 2007 that were relevant to the electricity sector (table 5). Only two are of particular consequence. They are: 





Even if we put aside the fact that these subsidies don’t impact final consumer prices in any significant manner, it’s useful to keep in mind the fact that the subsidy per unit of gas-fired electricity production -- as calculated by EIA -- works out to 25 cents per megawatt hour (table 35). Subsidy per unit of nuclear-fired electricity production works out to $1.59 per megawatt hour. Hence, the argument that nuclear subsidies are relatively small in comparison with natural gas subsidies is simply incorrect.   
  
Some would argue that the Foreign Tax Credit -- a generally applicable credit available to corporations doing business overseas that allows firms to treat royalty payments to foreign governments as a tax that can be deducted from domestic corporate income taxes -- should likewise be on the subsidy list. The Environmental Law Institute calculates that this credit saves the fossil fuel industry an additional $15.3 billion. There is room for debate about the wisdom of that credit, but regardless, it doesn’t appear as if the Foreign Tax Credit affects domestic U.S. prices for gas-fired electricity.   
  
The bigger point is that without government help, few doubt that the natural gas industry would still be humming and electricity would still be produced in large quantities from gas-fired generators. But without government production subsidies, without loan guarantees, and without liability protection via the Price-Anderson Act, even the nuclear power industry concedes that they would disappear.   
  
Now, to be fair, Prof. Metcalf reports that nuclear power is cheaper than gas-fired power under both current law and under a no-subsidy, no-tax regime. His calculations, however, were made at a time when natural gas prices were at near historic highs that were thought to be the new norm in energy markets and were governed by fairly optimistic assumptions about nuclear power plant construction costs. Those assumptions have not held-up well with time. For a more recent assessment, see my review of this issue in _Reason_along with this study from MIT, which warns that if more government help isn’t forthcoming, “nuclear power will diminish as a practical and timely option for deployment at a scale that would constitute a material contribution to climate change risk mitigation.”   
  
Third, Mr. Adams argues that federal nuclear loan guarantee program is a self-evidently good deal and implies that only an anti-industry agitprop specialist (like me) could possibly refuse to see that. “That program, with its carefully designed and implemented due diligence requirements for project viability, should actually produce revenue for the government.” Funny, but when private investors perform those due diligence exercises, they come to a very different conclusion … which is why we have a federal loan guarantee program in the first place.   
  
Who do you trust to watch over your money -- investment bankers or Uncle Sam? The former don’t have the best track record in the world these days, but note that the popular indictment of that crowd is that investment banks weren’t tight fisted _enough_ when it came to lending. If even these guys were saying no to nuclear power -- and at a time when money was flowing free and easy -- what makes Mr. Adams think that a bunch of politicians are right about the glorious promise of nuclear power, particularly given the “too cheap to meter” rhetoric we’ve heard from the political world now for the better part of five decades?   
  
Anyway, for what it’s worth, the Congressional Budget Office has taken a close look at this alleged bonanza for the taxpayer and judged the risk of default on these loan guarantees to be around 50 percent. They may be wrong of course, but the risks are there, something Moody’s acknowledged last year in a published analysis warning that they were likely to downgrade the credit-worthiness of nuclear power plant construction loans.   
  
Fourth and finally, Mr. Adams cites Cato’s skepticism about “end-is-near” climate alarmism as yet more evidence that we are on the take from the fossil fuels industry. I don’t know if Mr. Adams has been following current events lately, but I would think that we’re looking pretty good right now on that front. _Der Spiegel_ \-- no hot-bed of “Big Oil” agitprop -- sums up the state of the debate rather nicely in the wake of the ongoing collapse of IPCC credibility. Matt Ridley -- another former devotee of climate alarmism -- likewise sifts through the rubble that is now the infamous Michael Mann “hockey stick” analysis (which allegedly demonstrated an unprecedented degree of warming in the 20th Century) and finds thorough and total rot at the heart of the alarmist argument. Mr. Adams is perhaps unaware that our own Pat Michaels has been making these arguments for years and Cato has no apologies to make on that score.   
  
Regardless, ad hominem is the sign of a man running out of arguments. There aren’t many here to rebut, but the form of the complaints offered by Mr. Adams speaks volumes about how little the pro-nuclear camp has to offer right now in defense of nuclear power subsidies.   
  
I have no animus towards nuclear power per se. If nuclear power could compete without government help, I would be as happy as Mr. Adams or the next MIT nuclear engineer. But I am no more “pro” nuclear power than I am “pro” any power. It is not for me to pick winners in the market place. That’s the invisible hand’s job. If there is bad regulation out there harming the industry, then by all means, let’s see a list of said bad regulations and amend them accordingly. But once those regulations are amended (if there are indeed any that need amending), nuclear power should still be subject to an unbiased market test. Unlike Mr. Adams, I don’t want to see that test rigged.

"The Church of England’s investment arm has urged shareholders in ExxonMobil to vote against re-electing the oil company’s entire board for failing to take action on the climate crisis. The Church Commissioners and New York State Common Retirement Fund have written to fellow ExxonMobil investors ahead of an annual shareholder meeting on 27 May, hoping to support for the protest votes, which include forcing ExxonMobil to disclose its lobbying activities and their cost . “Our voting intentions are, again, a measure of our profound dissatisfaction with ExxonMobil’s approach to climate change risks and the governance failures that underpin it,” the letter said. “As the world, ExxonMobil’s peers and investors confront the climate emergency, ExxonMobil is carrying on as if nothing has changed. It is crystal clear to us that ExxonMobil’s inadequate response to climate change constitutes a broad failure of corporate governance and a specific failure of independent directors to oversee management,” the letter added. A report released last year found that ExxonMobil would need to slash its oil production by 55% by 2040 to meet global climate targets and avoid driving temperatures 1.5C higher than pre-industrialised levels. The C of E holds a small stake in Exxon, worth about £7m compared with the oil company’s market value of more than $183bn (£146bn). However, the Church Commissioners have proven to be influential shareholders regardless of their size. Last year, ExxonMobil appealed to US regulators and successfully blocked a C of E-led resolution that would have forced the oil firm to disclose its emissions reduction targets. In protest, the C of E called for ExxonMobil to install an independent chairman, and it gained 40% backing. The Church Commissioners have again filed a resolution calling for the chief executive and chairman roles – held by Darren Woods – to be separated. But Exxon is again at odds with the Church Commissioners voting plans. The oil giant is recommending that investors vote in favour of re-electing all of its board members, but is recommending they reject the shareholder resolutions, including the lobbying report. A Guardian investigation last year found that Exxon had spent €37.2m (£32.4m) lobbying the EU since 2010, according to data released though the EU’s transparency register. That is more than other major oil companies including shell and BP, which spent €36.5m and €18.1m respectively on lobbying Brussels officials to shape EU climate policy. It also recently emerged that ExxonMobil met key European commission officials in an attempt to water down the European Green Deal in the weeks before it was agreed, according to a climate lobbying watchdog. ExxonMobil was not immediately available for comment, but in a document released ahead of its AGM it said that its position on key issues and lobbying were publicly available on its website and that it followed all applicable disclosure laws. The company also defended the board’s approach to the climate crisis, saying it “routinely reviews environmental stewardship and discusses issues related to the company’s business, including the risks related to climate change”. ExxonMobil has rejected calls for an independent chairman, saying that the rest of the board was already made up of independent directors and that the change would not improve oversight or be in shareholders’ best interest."
"**Advances in cancer research could be delayed by nearly 18 months due to the coronavirus pandemic, scientists fear.**
A survey of more than 200 scientists at the Institute of Cancer Research suggested research could be delayed by six months, due to factors including the first lockdown and capacity limits.
Other issues like charity funding, and research being shifted to Covid-19, mean major advances delayed by an average of 17 months, they said.
Researchers called for more funding.
They said that any long-lasting damage to cancer advances could be avoided if there is more government support or charity donations.
There have also been concerns about the effect the pandemic could have had on cancer more widely. The NHS's former cancer director Prof Sir Mike Richards has said England could see its first decrease in survival rates for decades. In England, 60% fewer patients with suspected cancer were seen in April, compared to the previous year.
The ICR surveyed 239 of its researchers to gauge the impact of its research.
Those who took part in the survey said they had lost an average of 10 weeks of research time due to the first lockdown - this was mostly due to not being able to access laboratories.
Researchers who took part in the survey on average spent 53% of their working time in a laboratory before lockdown - this decreased to 5% during lockdown, and is now at 34%.
Prof Paul Workman, chief executive of the ICR, said: ""Our researchers are passionate about making advances to benefit patients, so it has been hugely frustrating that their work has been so disrupted, although also inspiring to see how well they have adapted to the restrictions the pandemic has imposed on our lives.""
He said the results were ""sobering"" but added: ""Our survey though does provide solutions to mitigate the impact - in the form of investment in staffing, new technologies and computing power.""
ICR labs have stayed open during England's second lockdown, with measures in place to help prevent the spread of the virus.
The institute's deputy director of clinical trials and statistics, Prof Emma Hall, said ""non-Covid clinical research pretty much shut down within the NHS"" during the first lockdown, which started in March.
She said: ""Our work relies on new clinical trials starting up and existing ones continuing to happen - and Covid-19 has made that incredibly challenging. The pandemic has meant that it will take longer to answer the questions asked in our trials, and that will delay new treatments getting to patients.""
But she said the pandemic also brought about some positive changes.
Prof Hall added: ""We can capture and manage data remotely rather than relying on paper. The Covid-19 trials have also shown how research can benefit from easier access to routine medical data - hopefully this will be translated to other clinical research and mean more streamlined, simpler to run trials.
""I hope we can use this experience to benefit cancer patients in the long term, but that will only be possible with more support or future advances will be delayed."""

"Amid the misery and chaos caused by the coronavirus pandemic, there are some short-term consolations. The precipitous drop in road and air traffic has left the air cleaner and the skies clearer. For advocates of a Green New Deal (GND) – a vast, state-funded green infrastructure project, including a total transition to renewable energy and the construction of mass transit systems – there are reasons to be optimistic. As the severity of the unfolding global recession becomes clear – the IMF predicts a 3% global contraction – the GND looks like the best route to recovery.  The GND had been growing in popularity before the outbreak – including among establishment politicians, with all the leading Democratic presidential candidates expressing support for some form of it. But with 26 million Americans filing for unemployment benefits in the past five weeks alone, and given that green industries are more efficient job creators than fossil-fuel ones, there is a powerful, immediate economic rationale for some kind of “green stimulus”. That is without even taking into account the longer-term economic case for decarbonizing: a 2018 US climate report calculated that the devastating effects of unchecked global warming will shrink the US economy by as much as 10% by the end of this century. But the economic fallout of Covid-19 has cast a harsher light on another strand of the climate movement, commonly termed “degrowth”. Influential among Extinction Rebellion activists, but often regarded as unrealistic by mainstream policymakers, degrowthers, as their name suggests, argue that uncontrolled economic growth is ecologically unsustainable and that to avert climate catastrophe we need to not only shut down the fossil-fuel industries but to reduce consumption overall. Degrowthers insist that we must find ways of living and working that do not require our economies to endlessly expand. Degrowthers have been particularly susceptible to caricature in recent weeks. “The coronavirus crisis reveals the misery of degrowth,” the Spectator predictably argued. But current living conditions – sudden mass joblessness, confinement and isolation, widespread food and income insecurity – are not a meaningful foretaste of greener things to come. The nightmare we are currently enduring is not degrowth’s secret dream come true; it is at most a grotesque parody of it, and one which is now liable to be weaponized by opponents of the movement. Reading the current moment as a repudiation of degrowth is premature and unjustified. It overlooks the distinction between what we are experiencing now – an unplanned, abrupt cessation of vast swaths of economic and social activity – and what advocates of degrowth envisage: a thoughtful, democratic, managed and equitable downsizing of the economy. Most degrowth advocates do not champion economic contraction as such, but argue for the necessity of adapting to the continuing, long-term global stagnation sometimes called “secular stagnation”. The fact that we can only think of slowing down our economies in terms of recession and austerity – with the associated cuts to public spending, growth in inequality and decline in real earnings – says much more about our political landscape than the economic facts. Yet there is one important criticism of degrowth that has been decisively bolstered by the sharp reversal in global economic fortunes resulting from the coronavirus lockdowns: the consequences for jobs. GDP is a notoriously crude and partial measure of a society’s wellbeing, failing to account for a whole host of indicative factors including equality, access to energy, the quality of healthcare, education and social support systems. But when GDP falls or slows because workers cannot produce goods or offer services, unemployment surges. Coronavirus has brought that reality dramatically home. As the economist and energy adviser Robert Pollin has written: “the immediate effect of any global GDP contraction would be huge job losses and declining living standards for working people and the poor. During the Great Recession, global unemployment rose by over 30 million. I have not seen a convincing argument from a degrowth advocate as to how we could avoid a severe rise in mass unemployment if GDP were to fall by twice as much.” The twin crises besetting us – the public health emergency and the unfolding economic trauma triggered by the measures to contain it – have laid bare much about the configuration of our world that we already knew but rarely fully apprehend: its interconnectedness, its fragility, its stark inequalities. But these crises have also brought into visceral relief the fact that employment is the heart and soul of the economy. As the British economist James Meadway has argued, the economic depression now upon us threatens “the most fundamental institution of all in capitalism: the labor market itself”. Since we have so little time left in which to stabilize the climate, we must be ruthlessly pragmatic in assessing the limitations of green strategies. Degrowth is no exception. The scale and speed of investment required to completely renovate the energy and transportation sectors does not seem conceivable without growth continuing, at least for the time being. Politically, as long as a steadily rising GDP remains an electoral necessity, it is difficult to imagine a recovery that doesn’t involve desperate efforts to restore growth – and not necessarily through greener means – by politicians anxious to revive flagging ratings. Yet to fixate on the question of growth risks exaggerating the differences between the Green New Dealers and degrowthers – elevating the former as practical-minded technocratic capitalists who want a return to normal economic activity, just motored by a different energy source, and dismissing the latter as abstemious, back-to-the-land utopians who want to deprive us of most of the luxuries of modern capitalist life. This in turn could lead to our learning only some of the lessons of the current predicament, and taking only some of the opportunities it offers. What both strands of climate thinking ask us to consider – and what the current crisis poses with special, brutal force, as phrases like “key workers” and “essential services” enter common parlance – is the question of what kinds of jobs we need, and what kinds our planet needs of us. Which goods and services are indispensable, and which would we be better off without? Degrowth and the GND offer different answers to this question – from green infrastructure construction to the care economy – but they both pose it, as well as raising important broader questions about how, how much and why we work. Once it is safe to emerge from economic survival mode, I hope we will have the wisdom to follow the lead of both movements by systematically reflecting on which kinds of productive activity actually enrich our lives – and which among these our planet can sustain.

"Prince Charles is among those repeating their calls for an organised cull of grey squirrels in Britain as a way of helping the declining native red squirrel.  Despite being larger and stronger than their red cousins, living in denser numbers and out-competing red squirrels for the same food, it is predominantly the virulent squirrelpox disease that greys carry that has driven red squirrel populations from all but a few areas in northern England and Scotland. A recent paper on conservation management by Andy White at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh and colleagues uses red and grey squirrels as a case study, arguing for better control in cases of invasive species whose effects are disease-driven. Another useful study by Pia Schuchert at the University of Newcastle and colleagues examines grey squirrel control over 13 years between 1998 and 2010, and finds that typically they were effective in bringing down grey squirrel numbers, and also lowering the numbers that carried squirrelpox. With Prince Charles keen on organic food and support for local butchers growing, no doubt he’d approve of putting this squirrel bounty to some culinary use. As we did, at the sixth annual squirrel cook-off in the Six Bells pub, near Cambridge, with 23 dishes of grey squirrel snacks. The dishes reflected the very different directions of the cooks: curried Bollywood squirrel, squirrel in filo pastry, squirrel pie, squirrel eggs in a nest, and the winning dish of squirrel sausages. Using legally trapped or shot grey squirrels as food has been in vogue for a few years now, a trend picked up back in 2008 when the Guardian newspaper proposed squirrel as “the ultimate ethical meal”. Being a food science and nutrition lecturer who is involved in and teaches food culture, I am not averse to eating a whole range of different animals for food, if humanely killed. Grey squirrels have the advantage of being low in fat, low in food miles – an estimated five million in Britain and counting, available almost everywhere – and obviously entirely free range. As a culinary experiment last year a friend presented me with two squirrels which I skinned and gutted and cooked in two different ways. The first was as a red wine, juniper berry and mushroom casserole, which friends pronounced to be too strong and gamey. This was perhaps due to using the male squirrel – the female used for the favoured dish of squirrel flamed with brandy and then lightly cooked with cream and hazelnuts, was milder, like a slightly gamey chicken.  So being presented with two skinned and cleaned squirrels in a plastic bag to prepare and cook was not too daunting. To remove any taint a light brine was used and then a marinade of ginger flavoured cider, casseroling with garlic, more cider and thyme. The meat was then removed and added to a roux sauce with mushrooms, cream and hazelnuts, chilled and then used to fill 40 small croustades. It may not have won, but only three were left at the end of the judging and tasting. But are squirrels any healthier than, say, chicken? The US Department of Agriculture’s National Nutrient Database provides the nutritional content of a very wide range of foods, including various game meats. According to the records, per 100g the squirrel has more protein (31g) and less fat (5g) than roasted chicken (29g and 9g), stewed chicken (27g and 7g), or venison (26g and 8g). In fact only rabbit, at 33g and 3.5g, provides a more protein-rich and low-fat meal.  However, low-fat and high-protein comes with its own drawbacks – the syndrome known as “rabbit starvation” experienced by hunter-gatherers and subsistence dwellers of northern latitudes, and recorded by Arctic explorer Vilhjalmur Steffanson, stems from a diet with insufficient fat; rabbit meat alone is simply too lean. So with all the greys living on the estates at Prince Charles’ disposal and the professional chefs employed by his Duchy Original brand, I’m keen to see the day that royalty-approved squirrel snacks make their first appearance. Certainly, judging by the varied approaches taken by those in the Six Bells there’s plenty of options out there."

The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) has recently reached a “milestone” of 400 parts per million (ppm). In some circles, this announcement has been met with consternation and gnashing of teeth. The proper reaction is celebration.   
  
  
The growth in the atmospheric CO2 concentration over the past several centuries is primarily the result of mankind’s thirst for energy—largely in the form of fossil fuels. According to the World Bank, fossil fuel energy supplies about 80% of the world’s energy production—a value which has been pretty much constant for the past 40 years. During that time, the global population increased by 75%, and global energy use doubled. Global per capita energy use increased, while global energy use per $1000 GDP declined. We are using more energy, but we are using it more efficiently. In the developed world, life expectancy has doubled since the dawn of the fossil fuel era.   
  
  
Of course, burning fossil fuels to produce energy results in the emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, tipping the natural balance of annual CO2 flux and leading to a gradual build‐​up.   
  
  
There are two primary externalities that result from our emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere—1) an enhancement of the greenhouse effect, which results in an alteration of the energy flow in the earth’s climate and a general tendency to warm the global average surface temperature, and 2) an enhancement of the rate of photosynthesis in plants and a general tendency to result in more efficient growth and an overall healthier condition of vegetation (including crops). There’s incontrovertible evidence that the planet is both warmer and greener than it was 100 years ago.   
  
  
As we continually document (see here for our latest post), more and more science is suggesting that the rate (and thus magnitude at any point in time) of CO2‐​induced climate change is not as great as commonly portrayed. The lower the rate of change, the lower the resulting impact. If the rate is low enough, carbon dioxide emissions confer a net benefit. We’d like to remind readers that “it’s not the heat, it’s the sensitivity,” when it comes to carbon dioxide, and the sensitivity appears to have been overestimated.   
  
  
As new science erodes the foundation of climate worry, new technologies are expanding recoverable fossil fuel resources. Horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing have opened up vast expanses of fossil fuel resources—mainly natural gas—that were untouchable just a few years ago. The discovery that the world is awash in hundreds of years of recoverable fuels is a game‐​changer, given the strong correlation between energy use per capita and life expectancy.   
  
  
400ppm of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere should remind us of our continuing success at expanding the global supply of energy to meet a growing demand. That success which ultimately leads to an improvement of the global standard of living and a reduction in vulnerability to the vagaries of weather and climate.   
  
  
400pm is cause for celebration. “A world lit only by fire” is not.

"London’s Victorian sewerage system is creaking and in dire need of renewal. The proposed solution: a 25km “super-sewer”, the Thames Tideway Tunnel, running from west to east across the capital at an estimated cost of £4.2 billion.  Thames Water wants to build the tunnel, but its owner, an international consortium of investors led by the Australian bank, Macquarie Group, has encountered a slight hitch: there’s not enough money to fund the upgrade. It seems there is too little equity left in the business and too much debt – the company has been leveraged up to the hilt, to the extent that it wants someone else to pay for the tunnel.  In common with other investment consortia that own much of the water industry in England, Thames Water has been loaded up with debt since privatisation. The debt is now some £8 billion, amounting to around four-fifths of the business, a gearing of just under 80%. In itself, such high leverage is not necessarily a problem, unless,  that is, you want to borrow more money. Then you run the risk of damaging your credit rating. But the investors have a plan.  They’ve set up a separate business, a special-purpose vehicle, to deliver the tunnel, neatly sidestepping any credit rating concerns. But the cost of the tunnel renewal is to be effectively funded from household water bills, meaning an 11% increase for Thames Water’s 14m customers, up to 2020. So, because it doesn’t have the money, Thames Water wants its customers to help pay for the super-sewer.  This is odd, perhaps, when you come to think about it. The privatisation of household water was sold to us in the 1980s as part of the wider Thatcherite drive to address the inefficiency of the public-sector providers by opening utilities to private-sector finance and management. The private sector was not slow in accepting the invitation. So what happened to all the finance and management? In some ways, the water industry in England and Wales today looks much like it did at the time of privatisation in 1989. But after 25 years, only the trading names remain the same as before, with the public as a shareholder increasingly displaced by global consortia, pension and other specialist infrastructure funds.  Behind the familiar company logos, the companies that run Thames, Anglian, Southern and Yorkshire Water have led the way in engineering water bills for financial gain. The asset that interests them, however, is not actually water, but people: households with the ability to pay water bills on a regular basis for the foreseeable future.  In the hands of a Macquarie-led consortium, such a guaranteed revenue stream presents a securitisation opportunity, that is, a means to package up a debt with the prospects of future revenue. Leveraging debt through securitisation allows revenue streams from underlying assets, in this case, Thames Water’s bill-paying customers, to be packaged together, bonds issued against them, and then sold on to investors. Crucially, securitisation represents a claim against the cash that flows from household water bills in the future – a guarantee of money which customers have yet to be billed. It is a form of refinancing that leaves Thames Water’s balance sheet short of equity, but with a mound of leveraged debt. Of course, this debt could be used to lower household water bills or finance infrastructure development. But it may also be used to pay higher shareholder dividends.  Companies such as Thames Water, it turns out, have been paying out in dividends far more than they actually earn from their cash flows and using the borrowed money to fund substantial dividends for the best part of a decade – money that could have been used to finance the Thames Tideway Tunnel.  The structuring and crafting of such deals like this are a relatively new development, one which arrived after the onset of privatisation and which left the water regulator Ofwat in a position of having to adjust to the new financial reality.  Ofwat operates a regulatory ring-fence. So long as the water companies don’t allow their debt liabilities to interfere with their core water business, it’s pretty much left to them as to how much debt they take on. But the ring-fence, in the case of Thames Water, is looking as leaky as its decaying sewers. The mound of debt taken on by Thames Water now means that it can’t raise the money to renew its infrastructure. Someone else – probably its bill-paying customers – will have to take on that burden.  If the political spotlight focused a little more brightly on the new financial reality of privatised water, you might get a reaction of the kind that has taken place in Berlin or in Copenhagen. The former has seen a re-municipalisation of water utilities, the latter protests against the machinations of Goldman Sachs in the Danish energy market. We could do worse than take a look at Welsh Water’s not-for-profit model. With no shareholders, the money from household water bills goes towards financing new infrastructure development and, if there’s a surplus, towards the payment of an annual customer dividend. Thatcher, we suspect, might even have approved."

Recently I wrote an article on the subject of [reverse racism](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/08/reverse-racism-benefits-no-one/) in New Zealand. A further perusal of A Weekend Newspaper only reinforced my view.



I reached page 10 and was told by one of the greatest purveyors of left-wing drivel, **Simon Wilson** , that the clamour for change is rising and Ihumatao is Jacinda Ardern’s historic moment. Will she take it? On page 16 Lizzie Marvelly informs me Ihumatao is **a complex case of Maori oppression.**



Dealing with Simon, though it pains me to do so, he also talks about Oranga Tamariki and how both conflicts involve Maori against Pakeha and Maori against Maori. They have overtones of tradition v modernity and youth v age. Also of women v men, moderates v radicals. Simon points out in both disputes Maori on both sides have said enough to **colonial injustice.** It only took to paragraph three for that constant refrain to raise its ugly head.



Let’s, for a moment, look at those differences he points out. He has just painted a picture of everything that’s gone wrong with the politics of the Left today. Globally. Pelosi v The Squad. They are in a total and utter shambles. 



Simon asks did Ardern notice, with Ihumatao as with climate change, how the world of protest has filled up with young people. As that’s the age group she spends most of her time with the answer is probably yes. We certainly have noticed Simon and are none too impressed. We have kids wandering out of school, no doubt on the basis of scaremongering by some idiot leftie teacher who’s told them that the world is about to end. If you want to spend the rest of your life living in fear Simon, go ahead but keep the nonsense to yourself. Next minute the kids will be having lessons on how to build an ark.



Simon asks if anyone told Ardern about the 29-year-old Pania Newton and says what a courageous, determined and remarkably gifted leader she is. Isn’t it enough to make you want to curl up into a ball and weep! Donald Trump is putting up with similar, the Cortez woman for one. 



Simon says the days of deliberately taking what we can from Maori, just because we can, and hiding behind self-serving laws to defend the action, are over. Excuse my French but where the bloody hell has he been for the last forty or fifty years as we the taxpayers have, **quite rightly, shelled out billions in compensation** for land confiscations. It is disturbing to say the least that, having paid an over-inflated price for ‘A Newspaper’, (no doubt due to falling sales), we are faced with having to read this sort of claptrap. 



Simon bemoans the fact that the law has enabled the creation of private wealth for Fletchers at the expense of the cultural and historical wealth of the people of the land and of the citizens of the city. So what is Fletcher’s supposed to do on land they legally own? Build affordable homes for free? Simon, of course, fails to mention that **Fletchers has agreed to return some of the land.** Typical Left-wing reporting. Don’t let the facts get in the way of the story. 



Simon would do well to talk to iwi advocate Pita Turei who says that the land being used for urban development is **not ancient burial grounds** as SOUL would suggest but was in fact wheat fields. Pita says the big myth here is that the stone fields are under threat, they are not.



So, in essence, this week I have spent money buying ‘A Newspaper’ to read two articles, one by a mature gentleman and another by a young lady, both using a myth to further their personal crusades. Having skewered Simon, Lizzie’s next for a roasting.



As for Jacinda’s historic moment, that will be when she leaves office and that moment can’t come soon enough!



PS. Anyone game to bet that Simon’s next article will be on the lack of affordable housing for Maori?

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German print weekly FOCUS has a short article on the inside workings of climate research funding (see below, right). It appears there’s a good ol’ boys network between the German Environment Ministry and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research – one that apparently violates the laws for awarding research contracts.
The title of the FOCUS piece: Umweltbundesfilz. In English: Federal environmental sleaze.
FOCUS writes that the German Federal Environment Agency (UBA) – an arm of the Federal Environment Ministry –  awarded the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) about a dozen research contracts worth some 2 million euros since 2007. According to the law, government institutes and agencies are required to publicly call for tenders Europe-wide. This was not done.
FOCUS writes:
Explosive: The responsible department director of the UBA, Harry Lehmann, is a member of the ‘Verein der Freunde und Förderer des Potsdam-lnstituts’. And according to its charter, the association is to support the Potsdam Institute ‘foremost with the procurement of resources’.”
For non-German readers the quoted association’s name translates in English to “Society of Friends and Promoters of the Potsdam Institute“.
So it looks like we have a director in a federal institute busy funneling research contracts to an institute he is actively supporting in private, and thus skirting the legal requirements on the bidding process for public research contracts.
But this type of favoritism from the UBA should not surprise us at all, as blatant favoritism is nothing new for the activist agency. Just two months ago the UBA tried to tell the public which scientists and journalists to believe on the subject of climate science.

FOCUS adds:
Lehmann is the author of the controversial climate change brochure where scientists and journalists were disqualified for being unserious because they were critical of the Potsdam Institute. The chief editor of research and technology at FOCUS was among those who were defamed.”
That FOCUS chief editor happens to be veteran journalist Michael Miersch.
The UBA and the PIK of course deny the allegations, claiming a legal exception clause applies in the awarding of the contracts. But legal experts are most doubtful about that assertion.
The awarding practices of the UBA are ‘a massive and obviously frequent violation of the contract awarding law,’ assesses contract award law expert Heiko Höfler. The UBA defends the controversial awards and claims they fall the under the ‘award legal exemption clause’. Höfler is not convinced: ‘This is absolutely not what is intended, according to the contract conditions of the Agency. There’s a lot indicating that this is all about a lie to cover oneself.'”
In summary, the German Federal Environment Agency (UBA) is not only informing the public that the PIK is the keeper of climate science truth, but it looks like its director is illegally circumventing public contract bidding laws and funneling contracts to the PIK, to which he is member of its support society.
Nice to see journalists digging into this. Who knows what else will be uncovered in the science swamp that surrounds the PIK. With a definite pattern of inappropriate behavior becoming increasingly clear, there’s likely lots more to uncover.

"**Officers in England handed out 1,977 fines for breaches of Covid lockdown rules in the first two weeks of November, according to new police data.**
The largest number of fines were issued in north-west England which, along with Leicester, has now been under the longest period of restrictions.
Greater Manchester Police has handed out the most tickets (309) since the lockdown began on 5 November.
Merseyside Police issued 277 fines and there were another 178 in Lancashire.
The figures, published by the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) on Monday, show that officers in Leicestershire have issued 30 fines under the November lockdown laws.
Police chiefs believe the significant difference between the areas may be down to the willingness of people to comply with requests from officers to break up a gathering, along with the amount of police time that has been allocated to investigations, according to the BBC's home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani.
Overall, 24,993 fines were handed out by officers in England and Wales for breaches of coronavirus rules between 27 March and 16 November.
On face coverings, the NPCC figures showed 641 tickets were issued between 15 June and 16 November, including 169 on public transport, an average of eight per week.
The remaining 472 were handed out in relevant places such as shops. The weekly number rose sharply to 78 between 2 October and 8 October, and has ranged between 43 and 91 since then.
The NPCC said up to the 24 November, there were 416 occasions where officers found an individual in breach of quarantine rules after travel abroad. No further action was taken after the person was successfully encouraged to self-isolate.
The figures show that in 7,040 cases travel quarantine rules were being followed, while on the 586 occasions officers visited the address of someone who was supposed to be self-isolating, they found nobody with the relevant name lived there.
Another 862 investigations were abandoned after officers found nobody was home.
The figures show that up to 16 November, police in England issued 223 tickets to people failing to self-isolate after arriving from a country on the government's quarantine list.
Meanwhile, preliminary crime figures also published by the NPCC on Monday showed that police recorded crime in England and Wales was down 9% in October this year compared to 2019, including a drop of 18% in serious violent crime.
There was a 2% rise in recorded domestic abuse incidents, the NPCC added."

Despite what one hears from the media, the two German scientists describe recent tornado activity as being in “great doldrums”.
==========================
The Great Tornado Doldrums: No Relationship Between Climate Change and Tornadoes
By Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt (translated by P Gosselin)
In May 2013, there was a series of severe tornadoes that caused horrible damage. The media reported profusely on these events (see our blog article “Violent Tornado Double Strike in May 2013 in Oklahoma: The History of Tornado Alley Since 1950“). How should we perceive these storms? Has tornado activity perhaps increased over the recent years, as some commentators have assumed from their gut feeling? If yes, could climate change perhaps have something to do with it?
Rather than relying on the suspicions and interpretations from third parties, it is worthwhile to have a closer look at real data so that a scientific basis can be established for the purpose of discussion.
We therefore first take a look at the tornado frequency of the last 8 years (Fig. 1). The steepest increase in each of the curves takes place in April and May, which is the main tornado season. Surprisingly, despite the prominent storms, the year 2013 (black curve) is in last place, and is comparable only with the year 2005 (green curve), which also saw relatively few tornadoes. The years 2008 and 2011 saw the most tornadoes.

And how does this compare to the long-term? Figure 2 depicts the statistically evaluated tornado frequencies since 1954. Also here the year 2013 ranks near the bottom. More than three quarters of all years saw more tornado activity than 2013.

And how was last year? Also in 2012 tornadoes were relatively rare, as no year saw fewer tornadoes than 2012 since tornado recording began in 1954. 2012 was the absolute low-point of the officially recorded tornado development of the past 60 years. The lilac-colored curve in Figure 2 represents the year 2012, which is not that far off from the current 2013 year (black).

Next let’s take a look at a bar chart of the last 40 years (Figure 3). Also here we can observe that tornado frequency has a downward tendency rather than an upward one.

Even though the average global temperature has risen half of a degree Celsius over the last 40 years, tornadoes have not become more frequent. Rather the contrary has occurred; they have decreased somewhat. Thus it is no wonder that the NOAA takes a clear position at its information website, and excludes climate warming as the trigger for tornadoes:
Does ‘global warming’ cause tornadoes? No. […] ‘Will climate change influence tornado occurrence?’ The best answer is: We don’t know.”
Also the Extreme Weather Report of the IPCC from 2011 is unable to find a trend in tornado development over the last decades. In the meantime this knowledge has become known to the activist groups close to the IPCC and are now no longer able to escape this reality. One of these groups is the Union of Concerned Scientists, who still claim that the main reason for climate warming is man. In a blog article dated 22 May 2013 titled “Evidence to Date Does Not Show Clear Link Between Tornadoes and Climate Change” the group writes:
The short answer is that scientists don’t see a clear link between climate change and the number or intensity of tornadoes over the past several decades.”

"The agency that runs Australia’s electricity last week gave its verdict on how to deliver what would have seemed fanciful not that long ago – a power grid that within five years should at times be able to run on 75% wind and solar energy. The Australian Energy Market Operator delivered a report on integrating renewable energy into the system with an optimistic message.  As described by its chief, New Yorker Audrey Zibelman, the technical capacity was already there, but markets and regulations would have to be adjusted. There were no “insurmountable reasons” why the grid could not take even higher levels of renewables, as it will need to for Australia to meet the Paris agreement goal of zero greenhouse gas emissions. The minister in charge of both energy and cutting emissions, Angus Taylor, chose a different emphasis. In a statement issued as the study was released, Taylor said it had highlighted the challenges of increased amounts of solar and wind given the system needed continuous inertia – support from constantly running “synchronous generation” – to ensure grid stability. He suggested that inertia could come from gas-fired power. The market operator’s report does not mention gas generation, but the fossil fuel – often described as having half the emissions of coal, though recent studies have suggested it could be much more – is clearly on Taylor’s mind. A few days earlier he had given interviews to Nine newspapers to support the idea of a “gas-fired recovery” from the Covid-19 pandemic, suggesting it may be a focus of future economic stimulus measures. This is not new terrain for the government. It followed the prime minister, Scott Morrison, in January claiming there was “no credible transition plan” for Australia that did not involve greater use of gas, and requiring New South Wales to promise to try to substantially boost the amount of gas available as part of a $2bn energy deal. But with a climate transition plan yet to materialise, analysts and investors say Taylor’s push suggests the government may lock in long-term support for the fossil fuel without explaining what it will mean for emissions, and despite increasing evidence there are cleaner and cheaper alternatives. The outlook for gas has changed significantly since Morrison gave a speech on energy to the National Press Club three months ago. As Guardian Australia has reported, the price of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in Asia crashed by nearly two-thirds, prompting the industry to shelve decisions on tens of billions of dollars worth of proposed investments in export projects. Consultancy EnergyQuest has projected a 40% fall in revenue from the $50bn LNG industry, which has driven most of the increase in national emissions in recent years. While most industries have been affected by the pandemic, gas has been harder hit than renewable energy. The International Energy Agency this week reported that clean electricity was holding up through the worst global energy shock in 70 years, but demand for gas was down 5% and coal 8%. Cost plays a major part in this. Analysts at BloombergNEF found solar and wind are now the cheapest source of bulk electricity generation for at least two-thirds of the global population, Australia included. Meanwhile, Australia’s biggest oil and gas companies, Woodside Petroleum and Santos, are under siege from shareholders concerned about the financial risk of them backing long-term investments at odds with a zero emissions world. On Thursday, more than 50% of Woodside investors supported a non-binding resolution from the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility that the company should be setting targets to not only cut its own emissions, but those that result from the gas it sells to be burned in Asia. A similar motion at Santos’s annual general meeting won 43%. Both Woodside and Santos have resisted the push, and argued that gas is a “clean” fuel and part of the climate solution. Like Taylor, they claim Australian gas exports are an environmental good as they reduce coal in Asia. Neither the government nor industry have provided evidence to back this up, and officials have acknowledged the competition in Japan – still Australia’s biggest gas market – is increasingly with zero emissions nuclear and renewable generation. Andrew Grant, head of oil, gas and mining with London-based financial thinktank Carbon Tracker, says the global view of gas has flipped from it being seen as a cleaner fuel than coal, to it being the second-least desirable source of electricity. He points to analysis by the International Energy Agency that found global gas-fired power generation must begin to decline later this decade under a sustainable development scenario. “Better than coal is not exactly a ringing endorsement,” Grant says. The Paris deal’s implicit goal of zero emissions by mid-century has been acknowledged by Woodside and Santos’s European counterparts, particularly BP and Dutch Royal Shell. Shell, for example, has targets to cut its own emissions to net zero by 2050, and to reduce the “scope 3” emissions released by customers when using its products by two-thirds by moving into clean energy. In contrast, Woodside’s chief executive, Peter Coleman, dismissed the likelihood of billion-dollar investments in renewable energy and the chairman, Richard Goyder, said the company primarily saw itself as “a gas company, with some assets in oil”. Arguments over the future of gas are complicated to some extent by the different ways in which the fuel is used. In Australia, there are three main uses – for power generation, as a feedstock and source of heat in industrial processes, and for heating and cooking by households and businesses. All have been hit by skyrocketing gas bills since an LNG export hub opened at Gladstone in Queensland mid-last decade, linking local prices to those in Asia. The government has been focused on lowering prices to help local users, mostly by pressuring states and territories to increase supply. New gas onshore fields were being proposed and considered when the pandemic hit, sending the global oil and gas prices tumbling. While the fall has offered welcome cost relief for gas users, the government has a different view to some analysts and agencies on the extent to which gas is likely to remain cost-competitive and vital to Australia’s needs. In a written response, Taylor did not answer directly a question about the role he believes gas will play as a transition fuel, or mention emissions reduction or climate change, but emphasised the “essential” role the fuel plays in energy reliability. “[It] could be even more important through a gas-fired recovery,” he said, reinforcing an earlier call for new “fast-start” generators that run only when required. But there is little evidence that the Australian electricity grid will need more gas power. Last year, it provided about 9% of generation. The market operator assessment suggested this could fall to near zero in the second half of this decade before returning in a much smaller amount – less than a third of what it is now – in the 2030s if the grid was to run at lowest cost. In terms of the flexibility in the system needed to “firm up” variable solar and wind energy, the market operator listed pumped hydro, batteries and “demand-side participation” – schemes that offer energy users incentives to scale down consumption when required – as likely sources. On gas, it said only that it may also play a greater role if prices fall. It is an option, but not the only one. Simon Holmes à Court, senior advisor to the Climate and Energy College at the University of Melbourne, says the services needed for a secure power grid are increasingly available from sources other than gas, including government-backed large batteries and potentially through adjustments at wind or additions at solar farms. Tony Wood, the energy program director at the Grattan Institute, believes fast-start gas is likely to have a role in the power grid but says it should live or die on its own merits, and not be boosted by the government through its $1bn underwriting program for new energy projects or any other support. He is just as dismissive of suggestions the government may support new long-distance gas pipelines, which have previously been touted by Nev Power, the former Fortescue Metals executive now heading the federal government’s Covid-19 Coordination Commission. It is broadly accepted gas could be replaced by cheaper electricity in heating and cooking, but is likely to have a longer role in heavy industry and manufacturing. Wood says potential replacements such as green hydrogen are not affordable today, though that could change sooner than expected not long ago, possibly within the next decade. In all its uses, he says, the role of gas is “heading in the same direction”, just on different timeframes, and it should not be the role of government to boost it. “If Angus is right, if he was an all-seeing and all-knowing god who knows gas is part of the answer, then that would be different,” Wood says. “But I don’t think he is.”"

Above: SST heat loss from Hurricane Irene
The title is sarcasm, but it does present an interesting quandary for alarmists. What’s more acceptable – hurricanes and the loss of life and property they bring, or loss of coral reef systems? My guess is that given the dislike for humankind often demonstrated by the environmental movement, they’d go for more hurricanes, and then use them to squall about “increasing extreme weather”. Fortunately, as Dr. Ryan Maue has shown us again and again, there is no upward trend in hurricane frequency.
From the AGU weekly highlights:
Preventing coral bleaching, one hurricane at a time
In recent decades, sea surface temperatures and the occurrence of heat stress in coral communities have soared. 
High surface water temperatures lead coral populations to evict their symbiotic, and colorful, algal residents. The photosynthesizing algae are what feed the coral, and the process-known as bleaching-can eventually kill it, leaving parched white exoskeletons in place of formerly vibrant reefs. However, not all coral reefs seem equally affected by mass bleaching at the hands of global warming. Some processes, like deep water upwelling, are known to offset rising temperatures locally, but Carrigan and Puotinen investigate a novel mechanism that they suggest may be responsible for protecting some susceptible populations.
Tropical cyclones (TCs) induce ocean mixing. Their strong winds whisk heat away from the sea surface, cooling surface temperatures by up to 6 degrees Celsius (10.8 degrees Fahrenheit) in an area typically spanning hundreds of kilometers from the eye of the storm. Though the strong waves associated with TCs are known to damage coral reefs, the extent of the cooling effect far exceeds the localized damage. Using historical TC storm tracks and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Coral Reef Watch’s records of thermal stress from 1985 to 2009, the authors analyze whether or not the cooling effect of TCs could temporarily alleviate escalating sea surface temperatures, staving off coral bleaching. At the basin scale, they find that TCs play a significant role in mitigating thermal stress for coral reefs in the North Atlantic. Further, their analysis suggests that TCs are likely important for the Great Barrier Reef, along with coral communities in western Australia, Japan, and the southwest Indian Ocean, though the spatial and temporal resolution of their model is not detailed enough to make a definitive statement. The authors note that their investigation only considered the effect of TCs on reef ecosystems that were already experiencing thermal stress. They raise the possibility that cyclones could play a preventative role, cooling the ocean waters before the corals’ heat threshold is exceeded.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf you’re like me, some of you will recall that old favorite tune the old man used to listen to on AM radio back in the 60s and 70s: “Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days Of Summer.

Germany’s 31 gigawatt capacity wind parks have been idled by weeks of summer wind doldrums, causing spot market electricity prices to soar. Source: Philip May,  Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license.
Such wonderful summer days are pretty much what we have been having in Central Europe this month. A massive high has been delivering lots of sunshine and warm temperatures. It’s been great. But for wind park operators, this month unfortunately has been a disaster as winds have been lazy too – stuck in the doldrums for weeks now.
Spot-market prices have soared
This has led to less electricity getting pumped into the grid, and so consequently spot market prices have jumped to their highest levels since May. So reports the German media. In the end, it’s the consumer who is going to have to take over the costs associated with idled windparks.

As ‘Focus Online’ reports, referring to energy data service Point Carbon, the electricity price on the spot market (for next-day delivery) reached the highest level in 8 weeks. At 51.50 euros per megawatt hour it reached a high price that was last seen on the German exchange EEX last May.”
Last Wednesday, for example, of the 31 gigawatts of installed wind capacity, only 1 gigawatt was being delivered – a measly 3%. This level of capacity utilization has been going on now for weeks.
Making things worse, an area of clouds kept solar energy output down as well early this week, causing a considerable shortfall in German power generation.
Power generation companies, however, refuse to re-fire conventional power plants because the higher prices still are not enough to cover the costs associated with intermittent operation of conventional plants. The added shortfall only result in prices staying sky-high.
In the end it’s the consumer who has to pay. Just imagine: we’ve got all this available capacity and potential supply, yet the prices keep skyrocketing. This is what happens when complete ideology-obsessed buffoons take over the management of anything.
The latest forecast shows the lazy, hazy, crazy days of summer continuing at least another week, and with  good indications they could be lasting through much of August. Let’s hope so…though it’s not going to help the electric bill.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe recent weather in Germany indicates everything but global warming and widespread drought, which climate experts have been telling us would be the case unless we stopped burning fossil fuels fast.

Germany’s mean temperature trend continues falling sharply (1998 – 2012). 2013 so far is well below normal. (Source: Josef Kowatsch, data from German Weather Service).
Today the online Augsburger Allgemeine reports that the statistics for the 2013 German meteorological spring (March-April-May) have been 95% tabulated and show that this year’s German spring is the “coldest in in decades“. The Chiemgau24 news site reports that it is the coldest spring in 40 years.
This past weekend, snow even fell in parts of Germany at elevations down to 600 meters.
No reasons are cited as to why the spring 2013 is so cold. The Arctic is covered with ice and so it can’t be an exposed Arctic sea disrupting atmospheric patterns.
Chiemgau24 writes (my emphasis):

March was too cold, April was a little warmer than normal, and May will likely wind up a little colder than normal. […]
Five colder than normal winters in a row, the coldest March in decades (in the northeast in 130 years) and now the coldest spring in over 40 years…if that doesn’t lead some climate experts to run out of arguments…”
The Chiemgau24 quotes meteorologist Dominik Jung concerning models:
‘Here the long-term weather models from some international weather services had indicated a “warmer than average and sunny April and May”. But we got just the opposite. On Sunday morning it even snowed again down to 600 meters elevation,’ explained Meteorologist Dominik Jung of the weather portal www.wetter.net.
‘Currently the mean temperature for spring 2013 (calculated from March 1 to May 25) is at 6.1°C. That’s the coldest spring in decades. It’s been more than 40 years since it’s been that cold. In 1970 the average temperature for spring was only 6.0°C,’ explains weather expert Jung.”
This might be a good time for the German Weather Service to think about dropping it’s long outdated temperature chart logo at the header of its website www.dwd.de/.

"As it had already been cancelled once, due to the US government shut-down last October, the latest developments in Iraq made it seem likely the Our Ocean conference, organised by the US State Department, could be cancelled again. Or that US Secretary of State John Kerry would make brief introductory remarks, and then not be seen again, as is often the case when senior government ministers attend science conferences. While he wasn’t present throughout, Kerry dominated the conference earlier this week in Washington DC. And the conviction of his speeches – given at the start and the end, and over lunch and dinner too, exhorting the world’s decision-makers not just to hear the science, but to act on it – gives rise to optimism. The focus of discussions were three of the most serious problems that threaten the ocean: over-fishing, pollution and acidification. None is an intractable problem, given sufficient national and international political will. Improve fishery regulation and traceability, don’t throw rubbish in the sea, and at least make a start on changing energy policy to reduce – and eventually halt – the ecological impact of ocean uptake of CO2. So was it a science conference at all? Not in the usual sense of researchers presenting information for discussion by fellow experts, with few others understanding more than the first couple of slides. It was made clear to those scientists invited to speak that communication was crucial: don’t assume any knowledge of the field, and construct a coherent and persuasive narrative in no more than five minutes. Only a few slides that included graphs were allowed, and they had to be  explained in less than ten words.  Three UK experts were invited to speak: Richard Thompson on marine plastic litter, along with me and Carol Turley discussing ocean acidification. Carol explained the chemistry, scale and unprecedented speed of ocean acidification; I argued the need for more data, on a worldwide basis, to improve understanding, short-term forecasting and long-term projections: what you don’t measure, you can’t manage.  The audience was made up of a very wide spectrum of decision-makers, including heads of state, ministers and other government representatives from around 80 countries, and 400 delegates from industry, charitable foundations, NGOs and UN bodies. US President Barack Obama made his contribution to the conference on video, announcing by executive decree new regulations to counteract illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing in US waters, and also the establishment of what is likely to be the world’s largest Marine Protected Area in the Pacific. A flurry of announcements and commitments followed.  Leonardo diCaprio told the conference how he has always been inspired by the ocean, and pledged an extra US$7m for marine conservation projects. The President of Palau, Tommy Remengesau, announced that 80% of his country’s Exclusive Economic Zone, around 500,000km2 would become a marine sanctuary, phasing out commercial fishing. The Norwegian Foreign Minister, Børge Brende, said it was time to “stop re-arranging deckchairs on the Titanic”, and committed US$1 billion for climate change mitigation.   Proportional to population, the US equivalent spend to Norway’s would be US$68 billion. Kerry didn’t go that far, but did newly commit around US$10 million over the next three years for projects tackling ocean acidification, through NOAA and the Ocean Acidification International Coordination Centre in Monaco. Particular emphasis would be given to helping the development the Global Ocean Acidification Observing Network, in partnership with other national governments, intergovernmental bodies and The Ocean Foundation. Such support comes at a crucial time for the network, established just a year ago at an international workshop in St Andrews. Unfortunately no UK government minister attended the conference, nor were any new UK national marine initiatives announced. Sir David King, the Foreign Office special representative for climate change, did however remind the conference that four years ago the UK established the world’s largest no-take marine protected area in the waters of the British Indian Ocean Territory, as well as a major reserve in the Southern Ocean, and pointed out the challenges in enforcing fishing bans. Will the conference inspire the UK government to make more rapid progress on marine protection around Britain? According to Professor Callum Roberts, such progress is badly needed: few tangible benefits have yet been seen from Britain’s marine conservation zones. But let’s be optimistic. Sound travels faster and further in seawater than in air, so by now the good news arising from this conference should be known throughout the marine realm, with the possibility of even better news to come."
