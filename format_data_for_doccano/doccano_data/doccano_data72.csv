By Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated by P Gosselin)
For years the insurance industry toldus that flooding was becoming more common. The main reasons was man and his CO2 emissions. Homeowners living near rivers got scared, and rushed to buy new insurance policies. The insurance companies beamed.
And the gig worked as long as nobody checked over the calculations made by the insurance companies. When objective science finally did take a close look, the surprise was big: Over the long term there was absolutely no detectable increase in flooding. The insurance companies had created fear among the homeowners for nothing. Actually “nothing” is the wrong word to use here because the new insurance policies weren’t for nothing.
In the jounal “Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences” appearing in May Mai 2012, another regional study on flooding appeared. Jose Barredo of the Institute for Environment and Sustainability of the European Commission and two other colleagues studied the development of Spanish flood damages for the past 40 years. Indeed insurance damages for the period truly had gone up. However this was solely due to the increase in the insured value. A trend in flooding frequency and intensity was not found by the scientists.
Here’s the abstract of the study (emphasis added):
Economic impacts from floods have been increasing over recent decades, a fact often attributed to a changing climate. On the other hand, there is now a significant body of scientific scholarship all pointing towards increasing concentrations and values of assets as the principle cause of the increasing cost of natural disasters. This holds true for a variety of perils and across different jurisdictions. With this in mind, this paper examines the time history of insured losses from floods in Spain between 1971 and 2008. It assesses whether any discernible residual signal remains after adjusting the data for the increase in the number and value of insured assets over this period of time. Data on insured losses from floods were sourced from Consorcio de Compensación de Seguros (CCS). Although a public institution, CCS compensates homeowners for the damage produced by floods, and thus plays a role similar to that of a private insurance company. Insured losses were adjusted using two proxy measures: first, changes in the total amount of annual surcharges (premiums) paid by customers to CCS, and secondly, changes in the total value of dwellings per year. The adjusted data reveals no significant trend over the period 1971–2008 and serves again to confirm that at this juncture, societal influences remain the prime factors driving insured and economic losses from natural disasters.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt his latest Saturday Summary, Joe Bastardi serves up a few observations about the current weather across the globe.
Let’s recall that global warming was really supposed to be having an impact over the land masses, especially during the winters. But the land masses, at least this winter, aren’t cooperating at all. Globally temperatures are in the basement.

The above chart from NCEP shows that currently global temperatures are running below normal. Where’s all the heat gone to? Joe then shows how the alarmist claims that all the frigid US weather is due to global warming are completely bogus.

The above chart shows that except for Europe, all the other global land masses are colder than normal. Joe comments:
What’s remarkable about this is, with the exception of Europe, most of the land masses on the globe are cold. […] This is about the third or fourth winter in a row I’ve seen the hemispheric temperature and the land mass, especially the northern hemisphere, have been colder than normal, and this is part of this process that we described now you know since 2007, 2008, the triple crown of cooling.”
Joe expects that cooling to continue another 15 years – until 2030.
The global anomaly is currently at about -0.1°C. The only ones escaping especially brutal winter conditions in the northern hemisphere are Europeans and polar bears.

"In May, for the second time this year, more than 1.5 million young people in more than 125 countries walked out of schools, colleges and universities in the biggest day of global climate action ever. Young people have protested en masse before – millions marched against the Iraq war in 2003 – but this child-led uprising is happening with unprecedented momentum on a global scale. The urgency of their protests reflects the very narrow window of opportunity left to make positive change. We are already living outside the climate parameters that first gave rise to humans, and the world’s leading climate scientists agree that we have only 12 years to limit global warming to a maximum of 1.5°C. Still, most governments are not doing enough to stay within these limits as set out by the United Nation’s 2015 Paris agreement. The complexities of the climate crisis have become highly politicised, but young people are able to cut through the noise. As Jamie Clarke, executive director of Climate Outreach, explains: “Climate change is the most politically divisive issue in America, more so than gun control and abortion. But young people have the social freedom to say it like it is.” UK Youth Climate Coalition’s Jake Woodier believes that climate strikes are reconfiguring the political sphere. “Children who historically don’t have a voice in politics are really thrusting their opinions into the public domain,” he says. “We are seeing thousands of incredibly intelligent and articulate children who are grasping the severity of the climate crisis better than adults in power.” Here, seven young people who are doing just that, explain where their passion comes from. Dylan D’Haeze, 16, Washington state, US This autumn, Dylan releases the fourth environmental documentary in his award-winning series, Kids Can Save The Planet. “Film-making empowers me because I can visually show problems and solutions in a way that is much easier to comprehend,” says Dylan, who directs, narrates and films his documentaries. With the next US election just 17 months away, his latest film, about voting and civic engagement, is a timely call to action for a new generation. “If you elect people the world really needs into office, then the world will change.” According to Dylan, the main hurdle is trying to convince the government and big corporations that climate change is a serious problem. “Most of them just want to make quick bucks instead of thinking what the world is going to look like for the next generation,” he says. What does he think of Trump? “It’s frustrating that we have a climate denier heading our government – that is two steps backwards from where we need to be right now.” It was ocean pollution that first struck him when he travelled through California three years ago: “The plastic debris we saw on beaches really scared me, and my mum suggested that instead of being afraid, I could do something about it,” says Dylan, who is home-schooled by his parents, Dawn and Kevin, both film-makers. “At first I felt helpless, but then I started discovering solutions that were actually really simple, like carrying bamboo cutlery and taking beeswax wrap to the deli to avoid clingfilm,” he says. Dylan and Dawn are now planning the ultimate home-schooling road trip in the run-up to the 2020 election. For six months, they will drive an electric car from their home on Orcas Island off the west coast, across America to Washington DC, filming as they go. High-profile mentors, including actor and environmentalist Ed Begley Jr, musician Moby and Cowspiracy’s Kip Andersen will join Dylan along the way. He will interview leaders spearheading green initiatives, youth activists from the nationwide Sunrise Movement and pioneers developing renewable energy.  As he travels, he will present his latest film in high schools and colleges, and speak in city halls and state capitals, asking people to make, on camera, a commitment to positive change. “It will be really powerful,” Dawn says. “Young people have to be engaged – there’s no other option.” kidscansavetheplanet.com Yola Mgogwana, 11, Cape Town, South Africa “I see the effects of climate change every single day,” says Yola, from her home in Khayelitsha, one of Cape Town’s impoverished townships. “Our weather is not normal – one day it is hot, the next day it’s raining heavily. It’s a huge problem for farmers, and mudslides wash away houses, leaving poor families without homes.” Eighteen months ago, Cape Town experienced its most severe drought in a century. Residents’ water consumption was limited to 50 litres a day and the city was just weeks away from “day zero”, when taps would run dry. “For me, that was a big sign that we need to change our ways and stand up for nature – because our government wants to profit from the environment, instead of implementing policies that protect it,” she says. In January, Yola began volunteering with the Earthchild Project, which integrates environmental education into classrooms and communities. “Our mission is to monitor our school’s food, water and electricity usage, and encourage other learners to reduce their consumption.” The school’s organic vegetable garden helps feed pupils, and a worm farm transforms food waste into compost, so the children learn how to conserve resources. “Every school should make environmental education part of their curriculum. Climate change is a foreign topic to my family – without this club I would be in the dark,” says Yola, who takes inspiration from the Zulu word “ubuntu”, meaning “I am, because you are.” In March, Yola spoke in front of 2,000 young people in Cape Town, and she presents talks at neighbouring schools. “I want to show the world that we, as black youth from Cape Town’s under-resourced communities and townships, do care about the climate – because we are the ones that get affected the most.” Her plea to the South African government is to take urgent action. “We will not accept a life of fear and devastation. The crisis is now. People are dying.” earthchildproject.org Amy, 15, and Ella Meek, 13, Nottinghamshire, UK Sisters Amy and Ella are on a mission to encourage people, businesses and schools to adopt a “plastic clever” approach to reducing single-use plastics. Three years ago, they learned about the UN’s 17 Global Goals for Sustainable Development while being home-schooled. Shocked by the impact that plastic pollution has on marine wildlife, they decided to do something about it. They founded their child-led campaign, Kids Against Plastic, and in April 2018 they presented their first TEDx talk. “Kids can have a really powerful voice when they find something they are passionate about – but the key is to be educated about it in the first place,” argues Amy, who wishes the school curriculum focused more on environmental issues. Plastic pollution is tangible and ubiquitous, but it’s only the tip of the iceberg. The girls explain that to make every one-litre single-use plastic bottle of water, one-sixth of its capacity of oil is used. “The wasteful production of single-use plastics is so interconnected with the consumption of fossil fuels and global warming, and learning about these problems really opened our eyes,” Amy says. “A youth movement in Bali called Bye Bye Plastic Bags, set up by two girls our age, really captured our imagination back in 2016,” recalls Ella, who now reports on environmental issues for FYI, a weekly news programme on Sky Kids. “I always wanted to be an environmental TV presenter, so it’s great to think others might be inspired by the features they watch on the show.”  As two of 250 British #iwill ambassadors for youth social action, the sisters recently met the environment secretary, Michael Gove: “He seemed interested in what kids like us are doing, but politicians always have so many things on their plates, so it can be hard to get them involved,” Amy says. “We are lucky that our MP, Vernon Coaker, and Gedling borough council have helped us to push change in our local area by installing water fountains and insisting that all vendors at council events adhere to the plastic clever policy (for instance, by using a returnable cup deposit scheme). Often, councillors and politicians are surprised to hear two schoolgirls stand up and talk to them – young voices get their attention and that has a powerful impact.” Last December, the education secretary, Damian Hinds, urged schools to become single-use plastic-free by 2022, something the Meek sisters are excited about. But they still have concerns over the government’s 25-year environment plan. “We worry that there’s no sense of urgency. By 2042, we’ll be middle-aged – it’s frustrating and scary,” kidsagainstplastic.co.uk Harriet O’Shea Carre and Milou Albrecht, both 14, Castlemaine, Victoria, Australia Bush fires are Milou and Harriet’s biggest worry. The teenagers experienced 46C (115F) days last summer, and January 2019 was the hottest month recorded in Australia, according to the Bureau of Meteorology. “The fire danger is really high. There’s a real risk of our houses burning down because we live right near the bush. It could be deadly. It’s really scary,” Harriet says. “All we want is a safe climate; we don’t want money or power, and we haven’t got any ulterior motive. We simply want our futures. How can you tell someone that they don’t have the right to live on and appreciate this planet, and be safe?”  Milou and Harriet started the Australian school climate strike in November 2018, together with their friend Callum Bridgefoot, 11. “Seeing Greta Thunberg leading school strikes in Sweden was really powerful – that’s what inspired us. Twenty of us started striking for climate action outside our MP’s office and it quickly escalated,” Milou explains. Weekly strikes now take place in more than 65 towns and cities across Australia, involving tens of thousands of young people, demanding 100% renewable energy by 2030 and no new coal, oil or gas projects. In February, seven other young activists joined Harriet and Milou in Canberra to present their demands to Bill Shorten MP, then leader of the opposition Labor party. “Meeting us face-to-face was a clear sign he is taking us seriously,” Harriet says. “But we haven’t had an adequate response – we want to see a real plan for change in policy.” “All the scientists agree that we’re right about climate change, so it’s difficult for people to find fault in what we are doing,” Milou says. In response to trolling comments on social media telling them to stay in school, Harriet and Milou insist that striking at the weekend would lack impact. “The people leading our country don’t want to listen to us – they want to shut us down,” Harriet says. “We can use our civil disobedience to capture the government’s attention. If they want us back in school, politicians need to start acting.” Milou says their families are behind them: “They are supportive of what we do because they love us – they would rather have us alive and uneducated than dead and educated.” schoolstrike4climate.com Lilly Platt, 11, Zeist, the Netherlands As Lilly walks to and from school, she litter-picks, often collecting up to 400 pieces of rubbish. She started four years ago, shortly after she and her family moved to the Netherlands from London. She was learning to count in Dutch with her grandfather and as they walked, they counted 91 pieces of litter within just 15 minutes. “My grandpa told me how plastic on the ground eventually makes its way to the ocean,” she says, “so I decided I had to do something about it. We picked it all up and took a photo to post on social media.” After that first pick-up, Lilly started researching plastic pollution and was horrified to read about the oceans’ “microplastic soup”. “Plastic pollution just shows that we consume too much,” Lilly says. “We all need to feel responsible. Think about how much CO2 we have produced since the Industrial Revolution. Just think how many animals have been killed for needless reasons and how many trees have been chopped down for nothing but greed.” She believes that all schools need to educate students about the climate crisis, and that politicians need to pay attention to scientists and strikers. She has been striking outside the town hall in Zeist since September 2018. “Listen, think and open your eyes and see what you have been doing to the world,” she says. “What happens to your body if you are 2C above your normal temperature? You feel very ill, so imagine how the planet will feel. We want world leaders, including Trump, to stay aligned with the Paris agreement, reduce carbon emissions and keep within 1.5C of global warming. Polluters must pay.” Follow @LillysPlasticPickup on Facebook.

Share this...FacebookTwitterClimate alarmists like to claim there’s a 97+% consensus that CO2 is driving our climate…a claim that is patently false, of course. But even if it were true, it wouldn’t mean the science is settled and that they are right.
Having been on the subject of meat-diets and nutrition over the last few days, here too we have another long held belief supported by a overwhelming consensus of doctors and experts that is turning out to be completely wrong. It is the claim that cholesterol is bad for you. Data is showing the opposite is likely true.
It turns out that there’s no data supporting the hypothesis that that it leads to heart disease. In fact it is being revealed that patients have been misinformed by doctors, medical associations and their governments for decades now. The consequence of this false information has been a mass pandemic of obesity along with all the killer diseases associated with it.

Note “Michael Mann” hockey stick at 25:00-minute mark…stunning parallels with climate science. 
Let’s all recall how the science was settled and that 99.9% agreed that cholesterol was dangerous and would kill us if we allowed it to reach levels over 200. It is emerging that this long-supported claim may very well all be completely wrong. In fact there is a massive growing volume of new literature that shows cholesterol is beneficial, and thus it’s only a question of time before medical science will soon be forced to admit to the greatest medical debacle of all time.
Today there is even an international association of cholesterol skeptics. Like climate skeptics, they too were and are being labeled crackpots and so cannot be taken seriously. And as is the case with climate skeptics, it’s emerging that the skeptics are right.

"Seabirds nesting on the remote Farne Islands have been hit by heavy rain which has killed many of their young, the National Trust said. Arctic terns, puffins, guillemots and shags, all suffered losses as chicks including pufflings, or baby puffins, were battered by nearly 127mm (5in) of rain in 24 hours on 13 June.  Five times as much rain fell on the islands, lying off the Northumberland coast, as happened during all of June last year. The month is the time when fledglings are at their most vulnerable. Ground-nesting Arctic terns suffered their chicks being exposed to the elements, and puffins’ burrows were flooded. It will take time to see if the rain has a significant impact on bird numbers in subsequent years but the National Trust warned that the climate emergency could be having an effect with more frequent summer storms. Gwen Potter, countryside manager for the National Trust, said: “The significant rainfall sadly caused many ground-nesting Arctic tern chicks to perish due to exposure to the elements. We don’t know the full impact yet but estimate that tern numbers are likely to dip, by up to 35% this year. “We also know that 300 pufflings perished on one of the islands. Puffins are ground-nesting birds and unfortunately their burrows flooded. We’re continuing to monitor the wildlife on the islands closely. “The complex effects of a changing climate on nature are becoming increasingly frequent and difficult to solve. We are now seeing frequent summer storms washing out nests on the Farne Islands on a regular basis, and a decline in the numbers of surface feeding species such as terns.”"
"As much as we like to think that Australia, with its system of compulsory preferential voting, is protected from the kind of “populist” uprising that has unleashed the Brexit mess and installed Donald Trump in the White House, the result of the last federal election indicates otherwise. Just as in the UK and the United States, Australia has experienced the bewildering phenomenon of people across society voting against their own economic interests. The urgent task of social democrats the world over is to understand why, and to develop a coherent response – a task we have been skirting around for at least decade, since the limits of supply-side economics, or “neoliberalism”, became plainly evident during the global financial crisis.  The election result underlined the strong streak of self-reliance in the Australian character. While the most successful European social democracies smooth income inequality through relatively large tax and transfer systems, Australian egalitarianism was built on the ability of working people to achieve a high standard of living through secure jobs with strong conditions and good wages. The fractures in our economy brought about by globalisation, deregulation, the privatisation of primary industries and essential services, and industrial disruption through technological change, have profoundly undermined the job security of working people across the developed world. The problem is especially acute in regional Australia, where our traditional primary industries, such as mining and agriculture, around which the economic ecosystems of entire regional communities revolve, are facing existential threats from climate change. Many of these regions have for years been afflicted with high rates of un- and underemployment, a lack of options for well-paid career alternatives, and limited markets for the jobs in service industries that have kept employment in our capital cities growing. And even in those ever-growing cities, too many good, secure working-class jobs have been replaced by low-paid, insecure and often meaningless work, while our rate of underemployment is at a record high. People who live paycheck to paycheck are losing faith in the idea that, if they work hard, they will be able to provide for their families; they fear for their children’s future and for their own security in retirement. Social democrats have singularly failed to provide answers for these people. We have accurately identified the problems – the failure of “trickle-down” economics, the erosion of job security, the declining share of prosperity going to wages, the growing wealth divide, and the inevitable move away from carbon-intensive industries to address catastrophic climate change. But by repeatedly talking about the problems facing our society without offering concrete solutions, we simply exacerbate fear. Talk of “just transitions”, “lifelong learning” and such defeatist ideas as providing a universal basic income to people to compensate for the loss of their jobs, offers nothing positive or hopeful for people who are looking for government to ensure they can continue to support themselves. In the absence of real progressive policies to provide secure incomes to working people, the desperate hope that “jobs and growth” from a strong economy will trickle down to those at the bottom of the heap is all there is to fill the void. It is time for social democrats to focus on full employment. This means rejecting the economic framework of the free-market mantra that eschews an active role for government in the creation of jobs. The fact is, when working one hour a week in the gig economy for less than minimum wage takes you out of the equation, a 5% unemployment rate is no longer an accurate measure of full employment. For decades we have been told that if government stays out of the way, the market will create work for everyone who needs it, and do so in the most efficient way. Yet it is now painfully obvious that the market cannot deliver full employment that can support people to live a good life and ensure the fair distribution of our shared prosperity. The case for government intervention in the market’s failure to provide full employment is clear. Social democrats must radically reframe the accepted boundaries of the economic role of government and engage urgently with the task of creating real, sustainable, reliable jobs for people. Beyond making vague promises of skills training and redeployment packages, governments must actively invest in new industries, and put in place the necessary framework to equip people to make the shift out of their old jobs into secure work in a post-carbon economy. This is not beyond our ken. Australian governments have delivered full employment before, most notably in the three decades after the second world war. But such a project necessitates a shift away from market solutions and towards direct government involvement in job creation and industry support. Making new, government-supported jobs in infrastructure, advanced manufacturing, renewable energy and other new and emerging industries will entail all levels of government and industry cooperating across multiple policy settings, and working with local communities to understand the challenges and identify appropriate regional opportunities. This will require an active and interventionist fiscal policy, revitalised industry policy, leveraging government procurement, massive infrastructure investment – including in the care economy to lift the wages of low-paid women – government-funded skills training through an invigorated Tafe system, and guaranteed jobs from the public sector as an employer of last resort within the award wage system. While many local progressive policy thinkers are taken with the US model of a “Green New Deal”, Australia is uniquely placed to create our own comprehensive plan to achieve full employment in the post-carbon economy, one suited to our distinctive environment, population density and labour market structures. This is the most urgent task facing progressive policymakers in Australia today. When social democrats have no answer to the loss of good jobs for an inherently self-reliant populace, then “have a go, get a go” becomes the most compelling offer on the table. Surely we can do better than that. • Emma Dawson is executive director of progressive public policy thinktank Per Capita"

Share this...FacebookTwitterProf. Hans von Storch at his Klimazwiebel has an interview with Swedish meteorology expert Lennart Bengtsson, who just announced he is joining Benny Peiser’s Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF). Bengtsson represents yet another high-profile warmist scientist who has decided that “skeptics” have arguments that need to be heard in a far more open debate.
Klimazwiebel writes (and quotes…with emphasis added):
On the occasion of the press release by GWPF: “Professor Lennart Bengtsson Joins GWPF Academic Advisory Council” I wanted to hear Lennart’s own position on this mattter and prepared some question. Here are his answers:
Before I try to reply to your questions I need to provide some general background
My interest i climate science and in weather prediction has always been driven by scientific curiosity and I have increasingly been disturbed by the strong tendencies to politization that has taken place in climate research in recent years. I believe most serious scientists are sceptics and are particularly frustrated that we are not able to properly validate climate change simulations. I have always tried to follow the philosophy of Karl Popper that I believe is particularly important when you are dealing with complex systems of which the climate system is a primary example. For this reason empirical evidence is absolutely essential. The warming of the climate system since the end of the 19th century has been very modest by some ¾°C in spite of the simultaneous increase in greenhouse gas forcing by 2.5-3 W/m2.
I am concern that this as well as the lack of ocean surface warming in some 17 years has not been properly recognized by IPCC. Nor have the cooling and increase in sea ice around Antarctica been properly recognized. Climate science must be focussed to understand such matters much better and for this reason it is appropriate to have an open mind and not follow the IPCC as believers of a religious faith.
I certainly believe that most scientists are potentially worried because of…”

Bengtsson is a scientist who was always highly regarded, that is until he opened the debate door to let in skeptics and announced he was joining GWPF. The reaction from the alarmists is proving to be harsh, as expected. But already it’s going below the belt.
Putting the GWPF in the same basket as the KKK?
At Klimazwiebel physicist and settled-science insister Georg Hoffmann left a comment where he parallels the GWPF to the Ku Klux Klan:
If Lennart Bengtsson thinks that he has to better understand ‘people with different views’ he has not necessarily to join their club. I am also interested in understanding racism but I wouldnt join the Ku Klux Klan just for better empathy.”
By comparing climate change to racism, Hoffmann attempts to turn it into a moral issue. And questioning it as the GWPF does is deemed as detestable as being in the same camp as the Ku Klux Klan.
And they wonder why sober scientists like Bengtsson and Curry are turning their backs on the alarmist camp.

By Fritz Vahrenholt and Sebastian Lüning
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
The Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft (DPG), in English: The German Physical Society, is wringing its hands over the sustainability of the climate catastrophe. After all, hundreds of physicist jobs are in danger should the catastrophe sputter out. In the March 2014 edition of the information newsletter PhysiKonkret, the DPG poses the rhetorical question (pdf hier):
Climate change: warming pause yes or no?
The DPG lists a number of reasons, but noteworthy is Point 3:
3. Influence of solar radiation. The last decade was characterized by a solar maximum in the year 2000 as well as an above average long solar minimum surrounding the year 2009. That led to a cooling of the earth’s surface.”

In order to not upset the circle of IPCC friends, of course black holes in the ocean which made warmth mysteriously disappear without a trace a la Bermuda Trianagle, were also listed. And: The President of the German Physical Society, Johanna Stachel, announced in a large bold print:
We warn against the view that climate change has stopped. Global warming is advancing unhindered.“
What she most likely means to say is:
We warn climate change not to make a pause. Global warming must immediately continue on.”
Of course this is not written. Overall, it’s all a first good step in the right direction. Finally the sun is being taken as an important factor in the climate interaction scheme.

We can mock and have fun because they predicted this stuff would not going to happen anymore and of course now that it is happening they’re all saying it’s consistent with their theory. It’s unscientific claptrap at this point.
On radical climate scientists proposed measures to deal with skeptics Morano says:
It’s scary stuff. This is their, in many ways their doomsday type, cultist religion where they believe we have brought our own destruction, and it’s a lot of Medieval witchcraft mixed in.”
Morano reacts to Barbara Boxer’s proposals to protect the climate by levying taxes on carbon: “This is witchcraft.”
Morano calls the beliefs of global warming science “pagan culture, primitive civilization“. He also ridicules the New York Times for claiming, “Bundle Up, It’s Global Warming!”

Max Planck economist: ‘Transition To Renewable Energy Borders On Suicide’
Leading economic experts are firing harsh criticism at the energy policy of federal super minister Sigmar Gabriel. Germany as a friendly location for business is not only being weakened, the transition to renewable energy even borders on suicide and is an unimaginably expensive folly.”
Recently Angela Merkel’s grand coalition government just decided they would water down the scale-back in renewable energy subsidies. The Deutsche Wirtschafts Nachrichten quotes Max Planck Institute researcher Axel Börsch-Supan, who has fired harsh words at Federal Economics Minister Sigmar Gabriel:
With their policy, the grand coalition is weakening Germany’s location as a place to do business. This is especially true when it comes to the Energiewende, which is bordering on suicide.”
According to the Deutsche Wirtschafts Nachrichten, other experts are also slamming Germany’s “Energiewende”. For example Ifo Institute director Hans-Werner Sinn calls it an “unimaginably expensive folly“. Marc Tüngler director of a German financial association, calls it “a planned economy without a plan” that makes the Energiewende “unbearably expensive“.
The Deutsche Wirtschafts Nachrichten concludes:
According to experts, the big losers are the consumers, who will have to expect continued increasing electricity prices.

Lomborg, a former green activist, is just latest expert to give a failing grade to the German energy-man-on-the-moon project, which is clearly on a crash-and-burn trajectory. And despite the Energiewende’s imminent failure don’t expect the government to abandon it ever. With typical Teutonic obstinance, expect them fight to very the bitter end – until the energy system is completely ruined and the last trembly-handed-green gets ferreted from his bunker reality-surrounded bunker. That’s the German way.
The schwäbische.de writes:
Taken globally, the German Energiewinde delays global warming only a few hours.”

Though Lomborg commends Germany for its noble effort in tackling the “climate problem”, the Danish economics professor sees it as a huge waste of resources. Lomborg tells the schwäbische.de (translated from the German):
The Germans are achieving very little and are paying too much for it. This is only serving as a deterrent for other countries. With the investment of approximately 100 billion euros in solar systems, climate change is being delayed only 37 hours and is only making electricity expensive. That in turn is making your production more expensive and thus threatens jobs.”
Here I believe the schwäbische.de misquoted, and likely meant to write “approximately 100 billion euros”. In the end it boils down to a grotesque sum of money for virtually nothing.
So what should be done? According to Lomborg the answer lies in technical innovation, and this can be already be witnessed in the USA. Through the technology of fracking for natural gas, the “US-economy is experiencing through the drop in energy prices a revitalization valued at 125 billion dollars per year. At the same time the US has massively reduced its CO2 emissions.”
Lomborg also suggests that German R&D in renewable energy has been failure up to now. He adds: “Instead of investing 100 billion in subsidizing wind and solar, why not just invest the 100 billion directly into developing a better kind of renewable energy?”
Clearly the indications that the German Energiewende as we now know it is going nowhere except over a cliff are mounting. The question is: Will the government bail out before the plunge, or is it going to go over the edge and hope it miraculously survives the crash landing?

"Labour will back measures deterring investment in fossil fuels as part of a new drive to stop the financial sector from funding global heating, John McDonnell will reveal this week. In the latest attempt by Labour to display its green credentials, the shadow chancellor will use a speech in the City on Monday to commit to using the “full might of the Treasury” to tackle the issue. He will commit the party to forcing the private sector into investing in the “green industrial revolution”.  He will announce a review of the financial sector’s role in the climate crisis, looking at “where and how it is causing or exacerbating problems”. It will examine measures preventing financial institutions from “actively contributing to planetary heating or exposing our economy to financial instability”. McDonnell, who has invited Extinction Rebellion, the environmental activist group, to brief his team, will promise to “marshal the resources and levers of power available to the Treasury to fund and drive the climate change emergency programme” under a Labour government. It is the latest sign that Labour is responding to the threat from the Greens, who earned more than two million votes at last month’s European elections, just 300,000 votes behind Jeremy Corbyn’s party. They more than doubled their tally of MEPs in the process. However, while Labour has upped its rhetoric on green issues, there are still few details of what the party would actually propose to do should it win the next election. Labour has committed to the target of reducing carbon emissions to net zero by at least 2050, with McDonnell saying that the party is seeking to bring the target forward. The government has committed to reaching a net-zero target by 2050. It comes ahead of a rally in London on Wednesday 26 June when more than 15,000 people are expected in Westminster to lobby for urgent action on the climate. The event, called the Time is Now, is set to be the largest ever environmental lobby of parliament – and will include schoolchildren, grandparents, nuns, farmers, doctors and surfers. McDonnell will use Monday’s speech to suggest he will implement measures pushing the public and private sectors into investing in technology needed to deal with the climate crisis. “Every one of Labour’s shadow ministerial teams has been charged with producing a programme of action defining their department’s contribution to tackling climate change,” he will say. “With the real prospect of an autumn election, we want to be fully prepared to roll out this climate change emergency programme as soon as we take over the controls of government. “State and private sector resources will be required to invest in the infrastructure of the green industrial revolution envisaged by Labour. This includes the large-scale development of alternative energy sources and a carbon neutral transport system. “Regulation as well as incentives will also be required to divert investment away from fossil fuels and into environmentally sustainable activities.” It is the first in a series of speeches by the shadow chancellor, who has been attempting to set out more of Labour’s economic policy in case a snap election is called later this year. The party is desperate to ensure that its fudged position on Brexit does not doom its chances of securing office. As part of the push, McDonnell will announce an inquiry into the so-called shadow banking system, where borrowing and lending takes place beyond the oversight of regulators. “Much large-scale investment is undertaken in the largely unregulated and opaque shadow banking system,” he will say. “I am launching an independent inquiry into the role and activities of shadow banking in our economy to examine what state intervention may be required to increase the transparency and accountability of this sector to ensure it plays its full role in addressing the climate change emergency that we face.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterJust days ago I posted on a how veteran German Die Welt journalist Ulli Kulke was amazed at how supposedly one of the world’s best meteorological outfits, the Met Office of England, had botched 13 of  the last 14 annual forecasts. Read here.
Kulke accused the Met Office of “systematic false alarms”, saying they “refuse to accept the reality” of no warming and that it was “stunning” that they “never learn.”
Today Paul Homewood’s site features an article that focuses on the very competence of the Met Office Director asking: Can Slingo Get Anything Right? Homewood writes:
Last April, Julia Slingo told us that ‘climate change was loading the dice towards freezing, drier weather.’
Apparently, she actually meant milder, wetter weather.”
Benny Peiser at the Warming Policy Foundation site has just published a far more comprehensive list of botched Met Office predictions, the latest being the forecast for this winter:

Met Office winter forecast: For the December-January-February period as a whole there is a slight signal for below-average precipitation.“
Last summer the UK Spectator wrote a blistering piece that claimed the Met Office had “lost touch with reality” and that “ideology has corrupted a valuable British institution.” It adds:
Last year, it forecast a ‘drier than average’ spring — before another historic deluge that was accompanied by the coldest temperatures for 50 years. Never has the Met Office had more scientists and computing power at its disposal — yet never has it seemed so baffled by the British weather.
But there is no paradox. It is precisely the power of this technology in harnessing climate scientists’ assumptions about global warming that has scuppered the Met Office’s predictions — and made it a propagandist for global warming alarmism.”
Finally Tallbloke here writes that Met Office predictions on sea level rise are equally deplorable.

Warmest November since measurements began? An analysis of global satellite data leads to a different conclusion
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof Fritz Vahrenholt
On December 21, 2013 Spiegel Online reported:
Worldwide temperature record: Warmest November since measurements began. Warm air over Russia resulted in the warmest November since 1891. The entire year 2013 jumps upwards on the temperature ranking list. Is the pause in global warming over? […]  Germany on the other hand had an average November. Westerly winds were the rule and they brought more rain than normal to Central Europe, reported the German Weather Service. While in North Germany the sun shined more than average, as a whole in Germany it was grayer than normal for the time of year. In Australia, parts of North America and Greenland it was even unusually cool. Also Great Britain and Spain experienced lower than usual temperatures. Over the ocean a mean temperature of approx. 16.3°C was measured, that’s 0.54°C above average.
A new November temperature record? How wonderful. In times when the global average temperature refuses to rise and produces only negative headlines, they are now obviously resorting to monthly temperatures. And if the monthly temperatures don’t work out, then daily temperatures are taken: i.e. the hottest 4th of April since measurements began. The main thing is to produce headlines.
A series of problems with surface stations
But now it is known that there is a series of problems with the uneven distribution of surface stations over the globe. Thus it makes sense to compare the alleged November record with the satellite data, which are recorded evenly from every corner of the globe. The established satellite datasets are UAH and RSS. You can see them at the NOAA website. But horrors. Based on the satellite data, November 2013 is not a heat champion at all. When you look at the UAH data, November 2013 was only the ninth warmest. And when using RSS data, November 2013 landed only in 16th place. What a flop. The hot area over Russia also exists in the RSS and UAH data, but is less extreme (see comment on this at WUWT).

"Subscribe now to receive the morning briefing by email. Good morning, I’m Tim Walker with today’s essential stories. Iran says the Trump administration’s “outrageous and idiotic” decision to impose new sanctions on its supreme leader and eight senior military chiefs has permanently closed the door to diplomacy between Tehran and Washington. Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, said on Tuesday that the White House was “afflicted by mental retardation”. The US is also planning sanctions against Iran’s foreign minister, Javad Zarif, who negotiated the 2015 nuclear deal that Donald Trump has torn up. ‘Strong and proportionate.’ As he signed the executive order on Monday in the Oval Office, Trump said the “hard-hitting” sanctions were “a strong and proportionate response to Iran’s increasingly provocative actions”. Jared Kushner is expected to unveil his economic blueprint for peace in the Middle East at a conference in Bahrain on Tuesday, despite the fact that neither Israeli nor Palestinian officials will be present. Kushner’s so-called “peace to prosperity” plan calls for $50bn to be invested in the occupied territories and neighbouring countries, which Kushner claims would create a million jobs and double the size of the Palestinian economy. Vanity project. Without a workable political solution to the intractable Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the plan is seen as little more than a vanity project for the president’s son-in-law. Absent enemies. The Palestinians boycotted the Bahrain conference over the Trump administration’s unequivocal support for Israel, and a late decision was taken not to invite Israeli officials. Trump has said the New York advice columnist who accused him of sexually assaulting her in a department store dressing room two decades ago is “not my type”, as he denied the latest such allegations against him in an interview with the Hill. E Jean Carroll claimed the future president forced himself on her during their encounter at Manhattan’s Bergdorf Goodman store in 1995 or 1996, in an extract from her forthcoming book about the “hideous men” she has encountered in her life. Police complaint. Carroll has said she would consider working with police on a criminal investigation into the alleged attack, though the statute of limitations on such a complaint has already passed. George Soros, Abigail Disney, the Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes and more than a dozen other billionaires have called on the US government to tax extreme wealth in order to address inequality and provide funding for climate crisis initiatives and public health projects. In a letter addressed to all 2020 presidential candidates, the 19 signatories said: “America has a moral, ethical and economic responsibility to tax our wealth more.” Warren proposal. Senator Elizabeth Warren has proposed a “wealth tax” of 2% on fortunes of $50m or more, and a further 1% on assets over $1bn, which she estimates would affect 75,000 families and raise $2.75tn over 10 years. Sanders’ plan. Bernie Sanders has unveiled his plan to wipe out $1.6tn in student loan debt owed by 45 million Americans – and to pay for it through a tax on Wall Street. A UN human rights expert has warned that the world is sliding towards “climate apartheid”, whereby the rich pay to avoid the worst effects of the climate crisis, while others suffer extreme poverty, hunger and the decline of democracy. The US government has removed all but 30 of more than 300 migrant children from a border patrol facility in Texas, after reports that the young detainees were being held in “inhumane conditions” without adequate water, food or sanitation. A former Brazilian ambassador to the US has told the Guardian he is “disgusted” by his country’s foreign policy under its far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, whose diplomatic chiefs represent a “lunatic fringe”. The British actor Dame Judi Dench has defended the work of her disgraced friends Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey, despite condemning their alleged personal misconduct. “You cannot deny somebody a talent,” she told the Radio Times magazine. Stonewall at 50: why the gay bar remains as vital as ever Fifty years after New York’s Stonewall Inn became a symbol for LGBTQ activism, gay bars are declining in numbers across the US. Yet in some areas, particularly in less progressive states and communities, they remain a rallying point at times of both trial and celebration, as Dominic Rushe reports. Toxic America: the risk  chemicals  pose to children Today in our Toxic America series, we focus on the effects on children of the chemicals in our everyday life. Lauren Zanolli explains how to mitigate the risks to infants, while Emily Holden reports on concerns over chemicals in playgrounds, and Leonardo Trasande argues banning dangerous chemicals could save the US billions. How leftwing economists are transforming capitalism Since the 1970s, the left has changed how many people think about prejudice, personal identity and freedom, while surrendering economics to the right. But now, writes Andy Beckett, a transatlantic movement of leftwing economists is building a practical alternative to neoliberalism. The police endorsing violence and racism on Facebook The Plain View project has collated a database of more than 5,000 hateful, racist and Islamophobic messages posted by officers in eight US police departments – many of whom have been removed from active duty as a result. Adam Gabbatt speaks to the lawyer who launched the project. The Democratic presidential field will engage in four hours of televised debates this week. How much of that time will be devoted to questions on the climate emergency? Not nearly enough, says Kate Aronoff. When candidate Jay Inslee inquired about doing a special climate-themed debate, the DNC threatened to bar him and any other candidate who participated from the official primary debates. Why not dare them to try? The US will face their toughest Women’s World Cup test so far when they play France in the quarter-finals, after overcoming Spain 2-1 thanks to a pair of penalties. Also on Monday, Canada were knocked out by Sweden, while Fifa launched an investigation into Cameroon’s behaviour in their loss to England. Rafael Benítez is bowing out at Newcastle United after the club and its coach failed to reach an agreement on a new contract.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI got an email from the head of an Ontario wind-turbine protest-group seeking information about wind power development in Germany.
Ontario, it appears, is poised to industrialize its landscape – thinking this will somehow lead to nicer weather. The head of the protest group wrote that the Ontario windpark promoters and lobbyists “are continually referring to Germany and their Energiewende and how successful their implementation of renewables is in that country.”
First off, the claim that the Energiewende in Germany has been successful is an outright lie, and it shows that Ontarian leaders haven’t done their homework on wind power and renewables. The German politicians and activists who spread that myth forgot to mention that 1) German power rates have skyrocketed due to the feed-in act, 2) industries are now threatening to leave, citing costly and unreliable energy supply, and 3) protests against windparks in Germany are becoming increasingly fierce as nobody wants them in their backyard anymore. Moreover, the outputs are far from what was promised. More than ever plans for new windparks are being forced offshore. But there too the technical problems, and thus profitability problems, are great.
So it shouldn’t come as a surprise that Germany is drastically scaling back its subsidies for renewable energies and windparks. Last year alone Germany saw a 55% plunge in solar investments, and over the last 2 years Germany’s solar manufacturing industry has been all but obliterated. So much for the green dream.
How has Germany been coping with its struggling Energiewende? Answer: they’ve been quietly bringing coal power plants back on line. Last year CO2 emissions climbed for the second year in a row. In a nutshell: Germany’s landscape has been littered with windparks and and solar panels, yet it’s burning more coal today than ever.
10H rule
With all the failure you’d think Germany would be reconsidering its Energiewende. It turns out that the country is doing precisely that.
For example in the idyllic German state of Bavaria, Minister President Horst Seehofer has put into place a 10H rule for new proposed windparks in order to protect citizens and their property. The 10H rule requires wind turbines to keep a minimum distance from of 10 times the turbine’s height from residential areas. For example, a 200-meter tall turbine would need to have a distance of 2000 meters from the nearest home. The result: it disqualifies most plans for new wind parks.

Seehofer says that while he wants to see wind turbines in the state, citizens have to be protected from them.
But the powerful wind lobby is howling in reaction: “The consequence will be the end of the Energiewende,” said Günter Beermann, Chairman of the state association for wind energy.”
The online Main Post here also writes:
The head of the Greens in the state parliament had even harsher words. Ludwig Hartmann from Landsberg: ‘With the 10H distance rule wind energy in Bavaria is dead. […] If wind energy cannot find a home in Bavaria, then the Energiewende in Bavaria will not function.’ The environment expert is calling for sticking to the plan of expanding wind turbines in Bavaria to 1500. Currently there are 600. Minister president Seehofer has distanced himself from the expansion target. ‘I assume that the number will be considerably less with our new concept,’ he told the Süddeutsche Zeitung.”
The oxygen for the wind industry is getting fatally thin in Southern Germany. And even if Seehofer should fail to uphold his 10H rule, then chances will still remain bleak for the wind industry in Bavaria. This is due in large part to the considerable technical and economic shortcomings of onshore wind power. The Main Post writes:
Behind this there is the question of how much wind is there at a location and how profitably can a turbine operate. The rule of thumb: Wind turbines at the coast can produce about 100 percent, wind turbines offshore out in the open sea about 140 percent, wind turbines inland however only about 70 to 80 percent. Which wind turbines are to get subsidized in the future remains the decision of the federal government. Should the limit be set at 80%, then wind energy in Bavaria no longer has a chance. On that experts of the CSU and the opposition both agree.”
And in an interview with the Neue Energie magazine here, German federal parliamentarian Josef Göppel said:
If the pincer movement using the rule with minimum distance of ten times the turbine’s height and minimum performance of 75% gets used, then there will be no chance left for wind power in Southern Germany.”

"We are qualified medical doctors united by our distress at the minimal response to looming environmental disaster. We sympathise with current widespread protest, notably by children who will be most affected. We urge government and media to respond immediately and proportionately. As caring professionals we cannot countenance current policies that push the world’s most vulnerable towards environmental catastrophe. We are particularly alarmed by the effects of rising temperatures on health and heed predictions of societal collapse and consequent mass migration. Such collapse risks damage to physical and mental health on an unprecedented scale.  Present policies and responses are woefully inadequate. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns that we have only 11 years to halve global emissions to meet their 1.5C target, yet last year our global emissions rose yet again. It will be a massive task to avoid catastrophic warming and we need radical action now. Our unchecked consumption, dependence on fossil fuels and decimation of ecosystems continue. The diagnosis is clear and the treatment urgent. Yet politicians prevaricate and global emissions still rise. Governments abrogate their responsibility when pursuing grossly inadequate policies that risk environmental collapse. Non-violent direct action then becomes the reasonable choice for responsible individuals. We support the following key demands, which parallel those made by Extinction Rebellion: • governments and media should be honest about the challenges and urgency of tackling ecological disaster; • governments should effect carbon neutrality within the IPCC timeframe; • governments should establish and be led by Citizens’ Assemblies to enable climate and ecological justice.

"I heard some young activists chanting, “Fuck you, CO2” at the school climate strike on 24 May. It wasn’t the most profane chant I heard that day – there were a lot about politicians. But it worked well: it was short, strong – and kids just like swearing, don’t they? So I didn’t come up with this: I nicked it from the air. But by getting it down on paper, I’m giving it more life. I can imagine people putting it in a window at home, like a party-political poster. In 2017, I did something similar with Theresa May’s words in my poster Strong And Stable My Arse [which was posted around London]. Her repetition of the phrase gave it its power. I just took it and turned it into a poster.  My other artwork for Guardian Weekend magazine – I Should Be So Lucky – was inspired by Kylie Minogue. But we should all be worried about our declining bee populations. We assume the planet will be destroyed by an apocalypse or a big weather event, but actually the death of insects will kill us. People seem to care more about the plight of pandas than everyday creatures such as ants and bees. But that’s a distraction, a magic trick. I worked closely on these with the graphic designer Fraser Muggeridge – it’s a real collaboration. He does all my books and clothing, including my Fuck Brexit T-shirts, and helped produce these covers. He works more like an artist than a designer. He just gets it. How do you make a political statement while still making art? It’s a huge question, but I don’t worry about defining my work. I came up with some slogans and put them down on paper, that’s all. Art is just one ingredient in the stew – it can help visualise and clarify a political message, but it can’t change the world on its own. Like music, or humour, it attracts people to a cause; it seduces them. I’ve been really impressed by the way Extinction Rebellion has utilised graphics and art so well. It has a strong logo, a consistent message, even a style sheet – it’s organised. There are a lot of groups in this area, but no one else has branded itself so well. It uses symbols, some of them ancient, that we all understand: bees, skulls, smiley faces. The public is more or less sympathetic to their aims, and that wouldn’t have been the case even five years ago. Things have moved on. My cover is a drawing made from sunlight. It’s generated by a Little Sun lantern, a portable, solar-powered lamp in the shape of a sunflower that my studio launched in 2012. We wanted to help people living without electricity, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa. Every lamp replaces one that uses paraffin or petroleum, and we’ve already distributed 600,000. That’s a lot of unused oil. To create the work, I set a camera to a long exposure, turned off other lights and danced with the lantern. It’s a visual record of my movement. This ties in with my show at Tate Modern in London, where Little Sun will be part of the exhibition. As an artist, I’m curious about how we turn data – hard facts – about the climate emergency into something tangible. Data doesn’t deal in feelings or emotions, and we need those to engage people, to encourage them to act. Art and culture can give language to things that are hard to articulate. Data is often rooted in fear, whereas art is positive – it can inspire us. I’ve always been interested in how we experience nature. When I did The Weather Project for Tate Modern in 2003 [Eliasson hung a giant sun in the gallery’s Turbine Hall], we knew far less than we do today about the climate crisis. With Ice Watch last year [when Eliasson placed chunks of ice that had broken away from the Greenland ice sheet around London, including outside Tate Modern], the aim was to put people in direct contact with the effects of rising temperatures. By touching, feeling, even hugging the ice, they had a more emotional response. Extinction Rebellion activists staged a “die-in” on the same spot in April, to highlight the decline in the bee population. I love that the public is owning these spaces.  Artists need to look at themselves, too, not just the topics we address. I’m constantly working on how to make my studio in Berlin greener, to reduce its footprint, to reduce my travel, to review my shipping methods. There’s an assumption that we have to wait for others – leaders, politicians – to act, but that’s a mistake: we all have this power. We must unite and become a movement. What response to my Weekend cover do I hope for? That people think about our sun, its power. Can art lead to actual change? Yes – it participates in the larger political debate. It combines our memories with our expectations of the future. • Olafur Eliasson: In Real Life is at Tate Modern from 11 July-5 January 2020. Little Sun solar lamps are for sale at the Tate shop The text on this artwork is a call to action. It comes from a frustration at the apathy surrounding the climate crisis – and I include myself in that. We understand and can articulate what the issues are, we feel strongly about them – yet still we don’t act. I write down lots of ideas, then play around with them. I think about how I would feel reading them. I consider the meaning, whether the message is obvious, direct or too obtuse. I try not to be too hostile. This piece grew from an exhibition I did in 2017 called Shouting In Whispers, which was about the choices we make, collectively and individually, in moments of crisis. It featured five monochrome prints like this – different texts on a rich background colour. The teal colour I’ve used is significant: green, representing the natural world, would have been too obvious, as would blue, which depicts the sea, the sky. Teal is neither one nor the other; it’s deliberately murky. It’s also a calming colour: if you’re trying to say something challenging, the colour has to play a part in the delivery. Red would have been too urgent. This is the first time I’ve directly addressed the climate crisis in my work. As an individual, I do the things many people do: I recycle, I don’t use plastic bags, I think about whether I need to fly. But there are other things that are just part of my life, too: I don’t eat meat, I don’t have children.  Art is incredibly subjective, but I like any art that makes me think. It’s a way of asking questions and of opening up a conversation. I’m passionate about it reaching as wide an audience as possible, whether that’s through a film or a magazine. I like galleries, but they need to be opened up. Being shortlisted for this year’s Turner prize has been incredibly exciting, and an opportunity I don’t want to waste. When it works well, art is transformative – even if you hate it. • Helen Cammock: Che si può fare is at the Whitechapel Gallery, London, until 1 September; the Turner prize 2019 is at Turner Contemporary in Margate from 28 September-12 January 2020. This feature appears in the climate issue of Weekend magazine on Saturday 29 June.

"A climate change protest orchestrated by the Extinction Rebellion activist group briefly blocked Eighth Avenue in New York on Saturday afternoon, between the Port Authority transit hub and the home of the New York Times. The New York police department (NYPD) said 70 people were arrested as they called for more effective media coverage of the dangers of climate change, in a dramatic demonstration that saw people stage a die-in in front of the newspaper building and disrupt traffic in midtown Manhattan.  Two demonstrators scaled the front of the Port Authority building, which houses a major bus terminal and subway interchange, to hang a protest banner. Protesters also climbed on to the canopy outside the Times headquarters and unfurled a banner that encouraged the use of the phrase “climate emergency” instead of “climate change”. One protester, Donna Nicolino, told the Guardian she was ready to be arrested, because “we want the New York Times as well as all the other media to treat climate change as the crisis it is”. She joined a line of people with arms linked on West 40th Street and Eighth Avenue, blocking the road. The group remained until they were arrested by New York City police officers. “The lack of coverage of the climate crisis is completely unacceptable,” said Becca Trabin, a member of Extinction Rebellion’s press and fundraising teams. “It’s a public safety crisis on a global scale.” New sign encourages the Times to use the same style for climate change as the Guardian does: climate emergency https://t.co/WiOrDJm8ny pic.twitter.com/imxWtPFjM5 Trabin said that though it might not be convenient to report on, read about and discuss climate change every day, it should nonetheless be a media priority. “No one wants to hear about the climate crisis every day but if we don’t read about it every day we endanger ourselves,” she said. A spokeswoman for the New York Times, Danielle Rhoades Ha, said that in 2018 the newspaper published 795 articles about the climate, including investigative stories and dispatches from across the globe about the impact of climate change. “There is no national news organization that devotes more time, staff or resources to producing deeply reported coverage to help readers understand climate change than The New York Times,” Rhoades Ha said. “We fully support this group’s right to express their point of view, even when we disagree with it as it relates to our coverage.” For nearly an hour, the block outside the Times building was crowded with demonstrators, onlookers and NYPD officers. A police recording repeated a warning that anyone who did not clear the street would be arrested. A helicopter flew overhead. “Seas are rising and so are we,” chanted one group of demonstrators on the sidewalk, where surprised tourists, workers and bystanders asked for more information. The block remained closed after the demonstration ended as police officers processed the arrest of several demonstrators, including two who had rappelled down the face of Port Authority to hang a sign. Passersby stopped police to ask if a movie was being shot or if there had been a terrorist attack."

Denmark’s online Borsen here quotes the country’s famous Jyllands-Posten concerning the souring acceptance of wind parks in the Nordic country and the growing discontent with regards to the astronomical wind power prices.
Hat-tip: a reader by e-mail.
According to the reports, Danish Climate and Energy Minister Rasmus Petersen “plans to scrap future offshore Wind Power projects” and wants “the price reduced for electric power produced at off-shore wind parks. Otherwise, the minister is ready to drop future projects.”
According to the Jyllands-Posten, the minister said:
“I am unhappy that the price of power from the Anholt offshore wind farm is so high. I think paying 1.05 kroner per kilowatt-hour (kWh) is too much,” he told the newspaper.”

Borse writes:
New projects can be dropped.
The current market price for electricity is DKK 0.25. This means that the Anholt offshore wind farm is costing companies and Danish electricity customers 1.3 billion DKK in green electricity charges annually.
The Minister thus told Jyllands-Posten that he is ready to drop the two large-scale offshore wind turbine projects Horns Rev 3 and Krieger’s Flak with a total capacity of 1000 MW.
In comparison, the Anholt offshore wind farm produces has a capacity of 400 MW and is the largest Danish offshore wind farm.”

"At the end of a week in which the Trump administration rolled back Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan, Mike Pence declined repeated invitations to say the human-induced climate crisis is a threat to US national security.  “What I will tell you is that we will always follow the science on that in this administration,” the vice-president said, in answer to CNN State of the Union host Jake Tapper’s first posing of the question. Tapper responded: “The science says it is.” Pence said: “But what we won’t do, and the Clean Power Plan was all about that, was hamstringing energy in this country, raising the cost of utility rates for working families across this country.” Tapper interjected: “But is it a threat?” Pence did not answer the interjection, complaining instead that “other nations like China and India absolutely do nothing or make illusory promises decades down the road”. He also praised US focus on natural gas and “clean coal technology”. Tapper persevered: “But is what people are calling a climate emergency, is it a threat? Do you think it is a threat, manmade climate emergency is a threat?” Pence said: “I think the answer to [that] is going to be based upon the science.” Tapper insisted “the science says yes” and told the vice-president “the science community in your own administration, at [the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] at the [Director of National Intelligence], they all say it is a threat … but you won’t, for some reason.” “Look,” said Pence. “What the president has said, what we have said is that we’re not going to raise utility rates.” Tapper persisted: “But is it not a threat?” Pence criticised the Clean Power Plan, the Obama-era rule which the Environmental Protection Agency rolled back on Wednesday, thereby relaxing controls on carbon dioxide admissions from coal-fired power stations. He also took aim at the Green New Deal, a package of proposed legislation which Democrats including the prominent New York progressive Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez say would boost the US economy while working to reduce the effects of the climate crisis but which Republicans say would be financially ruinous. Tapper tried once more: “OK. So you don’t think it is a threat, is all I’m saying? You don’t think it is a threat?” Pence said: “I think we’re making great progress reducing carbon emissions. America has the cleanest air and water in the world...” Tapper interrupted, laughing: “That is not true. We don’t have the cleanest air and water in the world. We don’t.” Pence said: “OK.” Tapper asked him to “get back to me with some statistics that show it”. Pence could have reached for the Environmental Performance Index, a joint initiative of Yale and Columbia universities and the World Economic Forum which does in fact rank the US joint-first in the world on drinking water. However, it also places America 10th in the world for air quality and 29th for water and sanitation combined. Pence insisted the Trump administration was “making progress on reducing carbon emissions. We’re doing it through technology, through natural gas, through continuing to support … nuclear energy, clean energy. “The answer, though, is not to raise the utility rates of millions of utility rate payers across the country.” Tapper finally gave up, and asked about Russian election interference instead."
"Theresa May has said she was won over to the cause of tackling the climate emergency on her Swiss walking holidays. In 2017 the prime minister decided to call what would prove to be a disastrous snap general election while on a walking holiday in Wales.  Speaking to journalists en route to her last major international summit, in Japan, May said noticing the pace at which ice had receded over time in the Swiss mountains had inspired her recent announcement that the UK would target net zero carbon emissions by 2050. “I’m pleased to be going to the G20. I’m going to be talking about the importance of us continuing to work together cooperatively, and us working with international partners,” she said. “One of the issues we’ll be talking about climate change, and I’m very pleased to say that when we get off the plane our net zero target for 2050 will have entered law in the UK. And that’s obviously important to ensure that we’re not contributing to climate change in the future. Formed in 1999, the G20 is a group featuring 19 of the world's largest economic powers and the European Union. It was formed in the wake of financial crises in the late 90s, with a view to providing some governance for the global economy. Since 2008 it has held an annual leaders' summit. The 19 countries who are members are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, United Kingdom and the United States. Collectively the members of the G20 account for about 90% of the world's GDP. As well as the 19 countries plus the EU, also attending the meetings are representatives of several permanent guests, including the African Union, International Monetary Fund, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), United Nations and the World Trade Organization. Critics argue that it is too exclusive, and the format locks a significant number of large countries out of high-level discussions on the global economy.  “Just as a small example of why this is important: as you know, Philip and I go walking, not just in Wales but also in Switzerland, and there’s a particular place we go to where over the last decade you can see the glacier retreating quickly – and this has brought home to me the importance of climate change.” She said she would urge other leaders to follow the UK’s example. “The G20 represents 80% of emissions, so actually it’s not just about what the UK does, it’s about what we can do together. So I’m going to be taking a message to the other leaders about the importance of them following the UK’s lead and acting on this issue.” The surprise net zero plan was one of a string of policies announced by Downing Street in recent weeks, as May seeks to secure some legacy beyond failing to deliver Brexit. The climate pledge met with scepticism among some of her cabinet colleagues. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, said that it could cost up to £1tn in lost economic output by the time it was met. But May was keen to respond to the increasing public concern about the climate emergency after the school strikes and a visit to the UK by the climate activist Greta Thunberg. The Treasury and No 10 have also clashed over whether the prime minister can announce a funding boost for education before she leaves office, along the lines of the £20bn-a-year settlement already agreed for the NHS. Hammond is concerned that the Conservatives risk squandering what he regards as their hard-won reputation for careful management of the public finances. But both remaining leadership candidates have made a series of costly promises to cut taxes and increase spending. May was speaking en route to the G20 summit in Osaka at which rising tensions in the Middle East are also expected to be on the agenda. She stressed the importance of Iran abiding by its commitments under the JCPOA, the international nuclear treaty that Donald Trump has pulled out of but which the UK, France and Germany have sought to keep alive. “We have been actively working with others, notably with our French and German colleagues, to do everything we can to ensure the maintenance of the JCPOA. Now obviously, as part of that, it’s important that Iran abides by its commitments,” May said. She added: “We do have, as the UK, a difference of opinion with the United States in relation to the JCPOA. As you know, the US withdrew from the JCPOA. We continue to believe in the importance of maintaining that nuclear deal.” Asked about Trump’s admission that he had come close to ordering airstrikes against Iran, May said: “I think what we need to see in relation to Iran at the moment is a de-escalation of the tensions that we’ve seen in that region.” Mike Childs, head of science at Friends of the Earth, said: “If a day is a long time in politics, a decade is a very long time for the PM to be aware of devastating climate change that she admits to seeing with her own eyes. “We know about the dangers of hitting 1.5°C of global warming so it’s incumbent on any leader to do everything possible, as quickly as possible, to get ahead of this massive risk: there’s no such thing as going too fast in mitigating climate chaos.”"

"G20 countries have almost tripled the subsidies they give to coal-fired power plants in recent years, despite the urgent need to cut the carbon emissions driving the climate crisis. The bloc of major economies pledged a decade ago to phase out all fossil fuel subsidies.  The figures, published in a report by the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) and others, show that Japan is one of the biggest financial supporters of coal, despite the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, having said in September: “Climate change can be life-threatening to all generations … We must take more robust actions and reduce the use of fossil fuels.” The annual G20 meeting begins in Japan on Friday. China and India give the biggest subsidies to coal, with Japan third, followed by South Africa, South Korea, Indonesia and the US. While the UK frequently runs its own electricity grid without any coal power at all, a parliamentary report in June criticised the billions of pounds used to help to build fossil fuel power plants overseas. Global emissions must fall by half in the next decade to avoid significantly worsening drought, floods, extreme heatwave and poverty for hundreds of millions of people. But emissions are still increasing, with coal-fired power the biggest single contributor to the rise in 2018. “It has now been 10 years since the G20 committed to phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, yet astonishingly some governments are actually increasing the amount they give to coal power plants,” said Ipek Gençsü, research fellow at ODI and lead author of the report. “Momentum is growing around the world for governments to take urgent action to tackle the climate crisis and ending subsidies to coal would bring benefits to all [including reduced air pollution] and help set a level playing field for clean energy,” she said. Han Chen, energy policy manager at the Natural Resources Defense Council and co-author of the report, said: “Other governments may struggle to take Japan’s rhetoric on climate change seriously, as this year’s G20 host government continues to pour billions of dollars into propping up coal. If prime minister Abe is serious about dealing with climate change, he should end Japan’s government-backed finance for coal.” Green campaigners are planning protests in Japan against the G20’s coal subsidies and in nations where coal plants are being funded. China is supporting coal plants in the Philippines, opposed by the Oriang women’s movement, which campaigns for gender and social justice. Flora Santos, the movement’s president, said: “We cannot continue to live in peril and in the face of ever-worsening threats to the survival and security of our families. The expansion of the coal industry and projects must stop as soon as possible.” The researchers totalled the financial and tax subsidies given for mining coal and building and maintaining coal-fired power plants, including investments by state-owned companies. They found the average annual amount increased from $17bn in 2014 to $47bn in 2017. In contrast, the subsidies for coal mining halved, from $22bn to $10bn. “In reality, government support to coal is much larger than our report’s numbers show, because many G20 countries still lack transparency on the many ways they subsidise coal,” said Ivetta Gerasimchuk, at the International Institute for Sustainable Development and another co-author. Coal is seen as a sector in terminal decline across the world, from Asia to the US to Europe, and the International Energy Agency reported that total investments in new coal plants have fallen by 75% from 2015 to 2018. The reason state subsidies are bucking this trend may be because governments are choosing to prop up the sector for political reasons, said Gençsü. “They are just kicking the can down the road,” she said. “The money would be much better channelled to managing the [low carbon] transition and setting an end date. Coal use is going to end – it is the trajectory the world is on – but they are really dragging their feet.” About 5% of the subsidies identified in the report went to assisting a transition away from coal, mainly in Germany and the UK. But other programmes have been launched since 2017, including a $15bn fund in China for coal and steel workers, and a €250m scheme for coalminers in Spain, which is not a G20 nation. The World Coal Association did not respond to a request for comment."

By Ed Caryl
There are many indications that sea level was much higher immediately after the last ice sheets melted 7000 years ago. There were other high-stands in the intervening years. Two sources are presented here that attempt to measure past sea levels.
Most Holocene sea level studies depend on geological and archeological evidence and a good deal of speculation. Two studies were found that have substantial evidence, presented in detail.
The first (Aus K.-E. BEHRE, Probleme der Küstenforschung, Bd.28, Isensee-Verlag, Oldenburg, 2003) was found as second and third hand charts in Frans J.P.M. Kwaad’s paper here, in Dutch, translated with Google Translate. The original Behre papers are behind a paywall, here. Other sources cite Behre, but some cast doubt on his work without offering alternatives.
From the charts, new curves were constructed in Excel so that Post Glacial Rebound (PGR) corrections could be made, and curves compared. Behre never took PGR into account in his work. He was also charting the high water marks, not MSL, so his charts set the present sea level to 1.75 meters. To correct for this, 1.75 meters were subtracted from his data. The data were collected in the stretch of seacoast called the German Bight, the area from Dutch Friesland to Danish Friesland, the south coast of the North Sea, centered on Wilhelmshaven.
I took the Wilhelmshaven PGR uplift figure as the starting point for the correction. PGR changes over time, doubling in about every 2000 years as one goes back to the end of the glacial retreat 7000 years ago. 
Figure 1a above

Figure 1b. Both Figures 1a and 1b are from F. J. P. M. Kwaad here. Click for larger view. 
The next data are from the Western Pacific, specifically the Yellow River Delta and the Sunda Strait, taken from J. P. Liu et al, 2004, Holocene Development of the Yellow River’s subaqueous delta, North Yellow Sea. Marine Geology, 209(1-4): page 60. This chart describes the sea level rise at the end of the last ice age. Don’t be confused by the reversal in the horizontal axis. In the literature, time can run left to right or right to left. The time scales can also have zero at the birth of Christ, or at the present day.

 Figure 2 is the sea level rise from 22,000 to 6000 years ago.
The data from these charts, with PGR and High Water correction, results are shown in Figure 3:

Figure 3 is a plot of the last 10,000 years of sea level, combining data from figures 1a, 1b, and 2.
In Figure 3, we can see the agreement between the two data sources for the period from 6000 years before present to 10,000 years before present, validating the procedure.

Figure 4 focuses on the last 8000 years.
By focusing on the last 8000 years, we can also see the sea level high stands at the Medieval Warm period, the Roman Warm Period, and the Egyptian/Minoan Warm Period as well as the Holocene Climate Optimum after all the great ice sheets melted. These latter two high stands are roughly two meters above the current sea level. The low stands are about one meter below current sea level.
When looking at these, keep in mind that there is a delay between temperature and sea level. That delay depends on the amount of temperature change and the level from which the temperature changed. In Figure 4, the delay seems to average at least 200 years.
In the last 8000 years, sea level has been substantially higher than at present, up to 2 meters or more higher in two periods four to seven thousand years ago. Sea level during the Holocene has been falling since that period.

"My first reaction on watching the events at the Mansion House dinner on Thursday was that junior minister Mark Field had grossly overreacted. On reflection, I am not so sure. We can never assume, as your editorial claims (22 June), that “there was no physical threat”. This cannot have been clear at the time; there have been too many occasions when unanticipated assaults have led to death or serious injuries, as in the case of Jo Cox MP. Recent attackers, both individually or in groups, have used concealed knives or explosives to carry out their murderous intentions. Dissent can only be seen to be “non-violent” after the event. I now speculate what might have been my reaction to all this if the protester had been a young man, and the individual who sought to forestall a possible tragedy had been a courageous female. Surely some credit should be given to anyone who decides to intervene when the intentions of an interloper are unclear. The really worrying question in these difficult times remains: how can a large group of people not invited to a major official occasion have managed to gain entry to make their protest, however peacefully, without any prior entrance check? Where on earth were the essential security arrangements?Roger PutnamHolmrook, Cumbria • What I’ve noticed in all the controversy after the manhandling of a Greenpeace protester is that no space has been given to the content of the protest. On Greenpeace’s website I found the alternative speech that the protesters were trying to deliver. It is about the climate emergency and addresses Philip Hammond’s remark that we can’t afford to take the action needed to bring emissions down to zero – in other words we “can’t afford” to take the action needed to safeguard the futures of our children and the people of the world. It’s an eloquent and passionate speech and it deserves to be printed in the Guardian.Morag CarmichaelLondon  • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’ve gotten a few emotionalized, angry e-mails from veggie readers on the story about how meat-eaters are by far much healthier in every respect than vegetarians. They insist that their nutrition is superior and that the University of Graz study is “bullshit”. It’s bought and paid for by the bacon industry!
Yet, nothing better illustrates the fallacy of vegetarianism than looking at the children of vegetarians. The vegetarians, you will recall, like to make it a moral issue in that they blame climate change and animal abuse on meat-eating. They claim it’s the healthiest diet.
But vegetarianism for kids is turning out to be even worse than smoking for adults. One example of the impacts that vegetarianism has on children is vividly illustrated in an article appearing in the Daily Mail here. (There are many on this subject).
Rotting teeth, bone wasting…some excerpts:
…”‘I couldn’t work out what was going on,’ says Holly, who lives in Totnes, Devon. ‘We all ate exceptionally healthily, with plenty of vegetables, nuts and seeds.'”
…”I was assured by the people who devised the diet that we would get all the protein we needed from nuts and seeds, and we also took a daily supplement to replace the nutrients found in animal foods.”
…’But then I started noticing that something wasn’t right. … Bertie and Lizzie’s muscles seemed weak and they had problems seeing at night. … I couldn’t understand why this well-fed child was behaving like this. I was so brainwashed that the fact our bodies were craving dairy products had passed me by.’
…”Her parents, ‘well-known figures in Glasgow’s vegan community’, had unwittingly starved her of necessary nutrients found in fish and meat, causing her to develop the bone-wasting disease usually associated with 19th century slums.”

…'”is mother’s mistake was to follow a fad diet, hyped up by magazines and endorsed by celebrities, to a growing child.”
Sound familiar?
Thankfully, the mothers of the children realized they had been duped by junk science peddled by fashionable fanatics, and eventually brought a responsible diet back to their kids.
Yet, there are many tree-hugging vegetarians out there who insist their way of life has to be imposed on others and demand we stop eating meat. These happen to be the very people who want to tell us what’s best for the climate and the planet…based on, as is the case with vegetarianism, crackpot science peddled by charlatans experts.
If you want the entire human civilization to end up with rotting teeth, brittle bones, weak muscles and blind, then let the nutjob alarmist environmentalists run the show.
It’s clear: Bad science leads to bad results. Example: Greenpeace and golden rice.
The problem with climate science is that it is even worse than vegetarian science! And even scarier, the two are merging.
The calls for a shift away from meat because “it is bad for health and climate” are growing louder by the day.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman alarmist site klimaretter.de here reports on the latest negative developments now hitting Germany’s wind power industry. The latest to be hit is wind-turbine transmission manufacturer Bosch Rexroth AG, which announced it will slash 210 jobs and give up a production plant in Nuremberg.

Image cropped from: www.youtube.com/kGXoE3RFZ8
Klimaretter writes that the reason behind the move is “the changing wind market“, which according to Bosch-Rexroth spokesperson has seen immense fluctuations.
Because 2013 saw 10 gigawatts less wind energy power installed than a year earlier, ‘capacities have to be scaled back’.”
The layoffs come on the heels of Bavaria’s move to restrict the installation of wind parks in its idyllic countryside. However, the company claims that Bavaria’s policy had no impact on the decision.
Bosch Rexroth is just the latest in a series of setbacks the wind energy industry has seen over the last months. Germany’s solar industry has already collapsed and wind energy is just the latest victim in Germany’s rollback of renewable energies. Spiegel here writes that Germany’s solar industry has shed half its jobs in the last two years alone!

Last month German wind energy investment company Prokon filed for bankruptcy. The Local here writes that the company attracted 75,000 investors through a successful advertising campaign, where an 8 percent return on investment was promised. Today these investors are uncertain if they will ever see their money returned at all. The Local writes:
Investors had reportedly pulled €227 million of a total investment of €1. 4 billion, leaving the company far short of the 95 percent capital investment it needed to stay solvent.”
Spiegel here also reports on the dwindling returns and “broken promises” of wind energy investments.
Not only are windparks losing their appeal as a source of energy or as a secure investment in Germany, but resistance from citizens’ groups and environmentalists to planned projects is also rapidly mounting worldwide. Now windparks are facing lawsuits for killed birds. Benny Peiser’s GWPF site here writes:
A $1 million settlement with a renewables business for birds killed at two of the company’s wind farms marks the first time the U.S. government has pursued legal action against a wind developer for bird deaths caused by turbines.
Research published in the peer-reviewed scientific journal Biological Conservation last year estimated that between 140,438 and 327,586 birds—or a mean of 234,012—are killed annually due to collisions with turbines across the U.S.”
Expect more strong headwinds against wind power in the months and years ahead.

"“Come on, stop calling us polluters.” That was the shocking message of denial from the head of the International Air Transport Association at a summit that took place this month as it emerged that rising numbers of passengers are shunning flights because of the climate emergency. Consumers are voting with their feet. Too many perhaps for barely profitable airlines, but too few to shift the corporate inertia surrounding an environmental crisis. The trend may accelerate as planetary disaster unfolds. The industry needs a better strategy than burying its head in the sand. With ice sheets vanishing from the roof of the world and fjords disappearing in the North Atlantic, Big Air must first accept the scale of the problem. Aviation needs to be part of the global commitment to phase out fossil fuels and limit catastrophic temperature rises. Industry emissions are growing faster than original forecasts. This year, for the first time, global aviation emissions passed the one gigatonnes of CO2 mark. The industry contributes about 3% of annual global emissions but could be a 10th or more of the total by 2050. The second step needed is a radical new plan that goes far beyond the current Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation. This scheme only covers 75% of the industry, and experts calculate that a significant reduction of emissions from flying will be needed by 2030 to keep warming below 2C.   Although there’s been a buzz about electric planes, they cannot provide all the answers. Replacing fuel tanks with heavier batteries would not make sense for long flights. Even if some travellers are thinking again, passenger growth outpaces the drop in carbon emissions from greener technology. That is not to say cleaner fuels are not needed. It’s just that such innovation won’t be enough on its own. The demand for air travel needs to be damped. This is easier than one might imagine. Frequent flying is a minority sport: 75% of all flights in the United Kingdom come from 15% of the population. It is the better-off who can afford to fly all year round. They are behind the 40% rise in holiday flights in the last decade – an astonishing 11m extra trips.  To get a feel of the civilisation-wide significance of climate change, think about this fact: a UK resident making a single transatlantic round trip emits as much CO2 as they would in two months of everyday life. To change passenger behaviour might need taxation. A recently leaked EU report suggested that increasing the cost of jet fuel tax by 10% would cut the number of travellers by a similar amount. There might be a case for the first trip or two in a year to be lightly taxed and for subsequent ones to face steeply rising levies. If the UK government was serious about the climate emergency it would think again about a third runway at Heathrow. Pressing ahead with it, or any runway, would make a mockery of Theresa May’s promise to reach net-zero emissions by the middle of this century. The government’s climate advisers said we could hit that target and still be flying in 2050. The aviation sector, they calculated, would account for 31 megatonnes of CO2. If a third runway at Heathrow goes ahead that will shoot past 40 megatonnes of CO2. The polluter ought to pay. The cost of absorbing the equivalent of airline emissions should be raised to make airport expansion less attractive. Although MPs did vote for the third runway, in a few years’ time the transport secretary will have a chance to block Heathrow’s proposals. To save the planet, whoever is in the post should do so."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis year western Europe has experienced a mild winter as a parade of low pressure systems coming in from off the Atlantic has fed the continent with a steady supply of mild southerly winds.
For Germany this winter will be the first mild one in 6 years after a record 5 consecutive winters of colder than normal winters. The warm winter here may be in part due to the massive cold that has dipped and remained deep into North America over much of the winter. As cold Arctic air clashes with warm Atlantic air off the southeast coast of the USA, low pressure systems are spawned and travel across the pond to Europe.
Yesterday Ulli Kulke of Die Welt writes that this milder winter is more the exception than the rule, resulting from the positive North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Despite this year’s warm winter, the winters for Europe over the coming decades are expected to be on the cold side. Kulke writes:
Meteorologist Dominik Jung of ‘wetter.net‘ recently examined the temperature development for many ski areas in Germany, Austria and Switzerland and reached the result that ‘in the last 20 years, its has gotten cooler’ and ‘in some place quite massively’. The trend looks good for skiing.”
The winters, Kulke writes, are very much dependent on the natural ocean cycles.
The changeovers between positive and negative NAO occur in roughly 30 year cycles. And so that means after the last large changeover just before the millennium, there are still over 15 years of ‘good skiing and sliding left’.

"Thousands of people, including primary school children and members of the Women’s Institute, have lobbied MPs, calling for urgent action to tackle the climate emergency and critical loss of nature. About 12,000 people gathered in Westminster on Wednesday to put pressure on politicians, according to the organisers the Climate Coalition and Greener UK, whose members include aid agencies, social groups and conservation organisations.  The Time Is Now lobby comes after months of growing environmental protests, from school strikes to actions by members of Extinction Rebellion, and increasing warnings of the need for unprecedented action to tackle the global climate. Gareth Redmond-King, head of climate change at WWF, said: “Public concern is at its highest level. It is a mainstream issue. There are lots of organisations working hard to raise the profile and focus their MPs’ minds on policies and actions to make sure we take action.” A recent survey showed two-thirds of Britons wanting faster action to tackle climate change. The Guardian has updated its style guide to introduce terms that more accurately describe the environmental crises facing the world.
Instead of “climate change”, the preferred terms are “climate emergency, crisis or breakdown” and “global heating” is favoured over “global warming”. The scale of the climate and wildlife crises has been laid bare by two landmark reports from the world’s scientists. In October 2018, they said carbon emissions must halve by 2030 to avoid even greater risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people. In May 2019, global scientists said human society was in jeopardy from the accelerating annihilation of wildlife and destruction of the ecosystems that support all life on Earth. The editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, says: “We want to ensure that we are being scientifically precise, while also communicating clearly with readers on this very important issue. The phrase ‘climate change’, for example, sounds rather passive and gentle when what scientists are talking about is a catastrophe for humanity.” Other terms that have been updated include the use of “wildlife” rather than “biodiversity”, “fish populations” instead of “fish stocks” and “climate science denier” rather than “climate sceptic”. Damian Carrington Environment editor Theresa May, in one of her last acts as prime minister, is signing into law a target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, which was being debated by the Lords on Wednesday. Campaigners, religious leaders and people of various faiths, led by the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams proceeded along Whitehall on a “walk of witness”. Williams said he was proud the UK was taking the climate crisis seriously. “I compare it with the great struggle 200 years ago with ending the slave trade. Parliament took an option that wasn’t easy, it must have felt risky at the time facing massive entrenched global culture – and things changed,” he said. At least 195 MPs who met campaigners were encouraged to mark their constituency with a pin on a large map of the UK before being taken by rickshaw to speak to their constituents. At 2pm the thousands present rang alarm clocks, mobile phone alarms and sirens, and cheered loudly to symbolise “the time is now”. Jane Alexander, a primary school headteacher from London, brought five pupils from her school, North Harringay primary, to the lobby. She said: “Our children may be too young to vote but they are not too young to have their voices heard.” Michelle Lowe, from Winchester, said she had joined the mass lobby to speak to her MP because “the time is now”. She said: “I have children, who are 22, 20 and 16, and I’m worried about their futures.” The Liberal Democrat leadership contender Sir Ed Davey was among MPs who met constituents. He said it was absolutely clear that the British public was telling politicians to get tough on climate change. Benjamin Halfpenny, from Greener UK, said one of the demands made of MPs was for a strong environment bill to tackle air pollution, water quality and declines in wildlife such as hedgehogs."
"Labour plans to give the Bank of England powers to help check the readiness of City firms to cut carbon emissions and invest responsibly to tackle the climate emergency. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, announced proposals for an unprecedented expansion of the central bank’s role at the heart of policymaking, with officials at Threadneedle Street supporting the Treasury in checking on progress towards carbon targets. McDonnell said the Bank’s governor would also join the next Labour chancellor on a sustainable investment board to oversee lending to British businesses with the aim of boosting productivity. Speaking to City executives in central London on Monday, McDonnell said Labour planned to conduct a review of City practices and how investments could be directed to promote technologies that cut carbon emissions. The review would focus on the shadow banking sector, where borrowing and lending takes place beyond the oversight of regulators. It will report by October as part of Labour’s plans for a “green industrial revolution”. McDonnell said: “I am setting up a review group to overview the financial system as it currently relates to the climate emergency, in terms of both where and how it is causing or exacerbating the problem of climate change and where and how it could be providing solutions to problems.” He repeated his warning that firms listed on the London Stock Exchange that failed to meet environmental targets risked being denied access to the main equity market, forcing them to become private businesses or list in other jurisdictions. “This means that when we delist companies that fail to meet environmental criteria from the London Stock Exchange, investors can be confident that their money is not going on making the world uninhabitable for their children,” McDonnell said. Labour has already set out wide-ranging plans for a network of regional banks and an enhanced post office network to promote investment. McDonnell said these institutions would be given the dual role of increasing investment in green technologies and making a profit. The shadow Treasury team has already met representatives from Extinction Rebellion, the radical environmental protest group, to hear their ideas for addressing the climate crisis. Proposals from the independent Committee on Climate Change, headed by the former Tory minister John Gummer, and from the National Infrastructure Commission have already played a large part in Labour’s thinking, McDonnell said. However, while Labour has committed to the target of reducing carbon emissions to net zero by at least 2050, in line with the government’s aim, there are few policy details to say how it would get there. The review of the City would include commercial banks, investment banks, pension funds, hedge funds, private equity and asset managers to cover areas of the City that often escape scrutiny. Labour has put together a panel to review how the government and the Bank’s new responsibilities can be implemented, including the former head of the civil service Lord Kerslake and the prominent City lawyer Peter Rice. “The UK is and will remain a hub for finance,” McDonnell said. “That gives us all the more responsibility to make sure that the lending that takes place here aids the tackling of the climate crisis rather than fuelling it.” Labour plans to offer a mix of stiffer regulation and tax incentives to promote “large-scale beneficial investment” to support growth. “But we will also fulfil our responsibility to ensure adequate policing of investments using the mechanisms available to us to require companies to live up to their climate change responsibilities,” McDonnell said. The Bank’s monetary policy committee currently sets Britain’s interest rates while its financial policy committee and the Prudential Regulatory Authority oversee the financial stability of the banking sector and City firms. An expansion of the bank’s role to encompass promoting investment and higher levels of productivity while separately supporting Labour’s decarbonisation of the economy would make it the most powerful independent central bank in the developed world. Responding to questions about Labour’s stance on Brexit, McDonnell said he would prefer to campaign to remain in a referendum or general election despite representing a constituency that voted to leave the EU."
"National highest-ever temperature records, typically set in late July or August, are likely to be broken across Europe this week as a potentially deadly early summer heatwave sweeps across the continent. Meteorologists expect previous June highs to be approached and possibly exceeded in Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland, with all-time records likely to fall in some countries.  “The latest forecasts leave little room for doubt: we are heading for a new national record,” said Guillaume Woznica, a French forecaster, noting Météo-France was now predicting peaks of 45C (113F) in the southern towns of Nîmes and Carpentras on Friday. The highest reliable June temperature previously recorded in France was 41.5C on 21 June 2003. The country’s highest ever temperature, recorded at two separate locations in southern France on 12 August during the same 2003 heatwave, was 44.1C. “At our local Potsdam station, operating since 1893, we’re set to break the past June record by about 2C,” tweeted Stefan Rahmstorf, of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. Eastern parts of Germany, including Berlin, are already experiencing their hottest June on record. High temperatures are expected to climb further throughout the week, from Spain to the Czech Republic, as the combination of a storm stalling over the Atlantic and high pressure over central Europe pulls very hot air northwards from the Sahara. Scientists say heatwaves can be particularly dangerous when they occur in early summer, before people have adjusted to seasonal norms. Europe’s 2003 heatwave resulted in the premature deaths of an estimated 70,000 people. A 2015 report on heatwaves and health, by the World Meteorological Organization and World Health Organization, found early summer heatwaves had been shown to be associated with greater impacts on mortality than later heatwaves of comparable or higher temperatures. A heatmap for France for 27 June, tweeted by the university meteorologist Ruben Hallali, next to the Edvard Munch painting The Scream, was widely shared on social media. A gauche carte des températures à 1500m prévues par GFS. A droite le cri de Munch. Jamais vu ça en 15 que je regarde des cartes météo #canicule pic.twitter.com/RIJTXiCUh1 From the low to mid-30Cs on Tuesday in parts of Spain, France and Italy, most weather models predict temperatures will rise by Thursday to the low to mid-40Cs in south and central France and north-east Spain, and the upper 30Cs in much of the rest of continental Europe. As authorities placed health services and retirement homes on alert, urged children and older people to stay indoors, handed out free water and recommended vigilance against dehydration and heatstroke, the French president, Emmanuel Macron said: “As you know, at times like these, sick people, pregnant women, infants and elderly people are the most vulnerable. “We must be vigilant and have preventive measures in place in order to intervene as quickly as possible.” France’s health minister, Agnès Buzyn, said the country was better prepared than in the 2003 heatwave, when 15,000 more people died than in a normal summer. “Our plans have got better and better,” she said. “Our alerts are more efficient.” [#Canicule] Des risques existent pour votre santé, adoptez les bons réflexes.🔎 Consultez nos conseils et informations sur : https://t.co/qAfiTZAr3J pic.twitter.com/nQdIrp0ntC Societal change was going to be necessary, Buzyn said. “We will have to change the way we live, the way we act, the way we work, travel, dress … We are going to have to change our habits and stop thinking these episodes are exceptional.” Among the first to be affected have been France’s high-school students, with the national brevet exams, sat by 15-year-olds, postponed by the education minister on safety grounds from Thursday and Friday until early next week. Brussels halted horse-and-carriage rides for tourists because of animal welfare concerns, Le Soir newspaper reported, while in Germany media reported a 32-year-old man in Hemer, outside Düsseldorf, had stripped naked in the frozen food section of his local supermarket in an effort to escape the heat. Rahmstorf said the current heatwave, following unusually high temperatures last summer that caused increased mortality rates, a decline in crop yields and wildfires inside the Arctic Circle, was consistent with climate scientists’ predictions. “Weather data show that heatwaves and other weather extremes are on the rise in recent decades,” he said. “The hottest summers in Europe since the year AD1500 all occurred since the turn of the last century: 2018, 2010, 2003, 2016, 2002.” Monthly records were now falling five times as often as they would in a stable climate, Rahmstorf said, adding this was “a consequence of global warming caused by the increasing greenhouse gases from burning coal, oil and gas”."

"Environment campaigners have warned that Scotland will lose vital legal safeguards because ministers have failed to ensure environment and pollution laws will be properly enforced after Brexit. They said ministers in Edinburgh had refused repeated requests to table new legislation to guarantee citizens and campaigners in Scotland the same rights they now had under European law.  WWF Scotland, the conservation group, said this meant it would be much harder – if the UK left the EU – for campaigners to legally challenge the Scottish government for failing to uphold air quality standards, or to stop wildlife being culled by Scottish Natural Heritage, a government agency, before other dispersal methods were tried. In an open letter published by the Guardian, many of Scotland’s leading conservation and civic groups have urged Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, to introduce an environment act guaranteeing that legal rights available within the EU continue after Brexit. The letter, signed by 16 bodies including the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, WWF, Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations, National Trust for Scotland and Royal Scottish Geographic Society, said the climate emergency added to the need for legislation. Organised by the umbrella group Scottish Environment Link, the letter says: “Nicola Sturgeon has acknowledged that our planet faces a climate emergency. Inextricably linked to this is growing ecological crisis. “We must not let Brexit derail us from tackling these huge global challenges head on. Whatever the outcome of the current political uncertainties we need robust, binding, targets for the recovery of Scotland’s natural environment, to safeguard both nature and people.” Its signatories want the new act to create an independent regulator to police government and public agency decisions, and enforce environmental laws to at least the same standard as the EU’s. They also want principles of environmental law used by the EU enshrined in Scots law, and binding targets set to improve and protect the environment. Under EU law any citizen can go, for free, to the European commission to challenge a government’s or agency’s failure to uphold EU law. The commission can investigate and take enforcement action, including taking the member state to the European court of justice. Those powers have been used at EU level by the legal group Client Earth to make the UK enforce air pollution regulations; by the RSPB to halt a cull of barnacle geese on Islay, sanctioned by Scottish Natural Heritage; and again by the RSPB, to protect peatlands in England. Michael Gove, the UK environment secretary, is planning to introduce similar procedures after Brexit to cover environmental legal enforcement in England. The Labour-run Welsh government, which like Holyrood has devolved responsibilities for the environment, is involved in that process. Although the UK, Scottish and Welsh governments have cooperated closely on measures to transpose EU environment regulation into UK and Scots law, ministers in Edinburgh have refused to cooperate with Gove’s plans for new regulatory measures. So the Scottish government’s own expert advisory panel and the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Scotland’s national academy, have urged ministers to set up the independent regulator, as sought by the letter’s signatories. Roseanna Cunningham, the Scottish environment secretary, responded to the letter by insisting her government was committed to matching or exceeding the EU’s environment laws, but she refused to confirm it would introduce a new environment act or oversight agency. She said: “While our choice would be to remain fully within EU governance systems our approach will ensure we remain true to the EU environmental principles and ensure governance that fit Scottish needs, circumstances and ambitions. I welcome the continuing involvement of environmental NGOs and civil society in Scotland in this work.” Lang Banks, the director of WWF Scotland, said: “Citizens have a right to raise concerns but we now risk losing the ability to freely access environmental justice. We are in a climate emergency, we’re in the midst of a biodiversity crisis, and this is the point where we need to be ramping up our environmental protections. Brexit means we risk losing the protections we currently have, when we need them most.” • This article was amended on 27 June 2019. An earlier version referred to a legal process to stop wildlife being “inhumanely culled” by Scottish National Heritage. The word “inhumanely” has been removed, and text added to more accurately reflect the situation."

Share this...FacebookTwitterCorrection: A reader has pointed out that the paper is an analysis of some models which shows albedo, often claimed by alarmists as the primary Arctic climate driving factor, is not the number one Arctic amplifier after all, as skeptics have long maintained. The paper itself says nothing about the integrity of models, and thus the title above has been changed.
On model integrity, climate models have been compared to observations, see here and here. The results speak for themselves.
==============================
Spiegel here reports on a paper appearing in Nature titled: Arctic amplification dominated by temperature feedbacks in contemporary climate models – by Felix Pithan and Thorsten Mauritsen of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg.
Hat-tip: DirkH
Climate science often claims that nowhere is the climate changing faster than in the Arctic. Scientists have often attributed these changes to albedo effects. But the new study finds that amplification can also occur without changes in albedo. Spiegel writes that the authors, based on an analysis of models, found the largest contribution to Arctic amplification comes from a temperature feedback, where at lower latitudes warmed air rises faster and more easily than it does in the Arctic. As the surface warms, more energy is radiated back to space in low latitudes than in the Arctic. Thus polar air radiates less heat out into space than tropical air does.
In a nutshell, the two authors have found that the primary amplification factor is the “stolidness” of Arctic air, and less so albedo. In the Arctic warmed air tends to remain more at the surface and heat does not escape as readily.

Spiegel writes:
To balance out the radiation budget at an ambient temperature of 30°C, an increase of 0.16° is enough. However at minus 30°C, an increase of 0.31 °C would be needed, i.e. almost double, which gives Pithan und Mauritsen cause for thought. According to their calculations the lower start temperature in the Arctic is an important reason for the more rapid temperature increase in the Arctic compared to the tropics.”
They found that the surface albedo feedback is only the second main contributor to Arctic amplification, and that other contributions are substantially smaller or even oppose Arctic amplification.
This casts many of the assumptions made in earlier climate models deep into doubt. It’s back to the drawing board (again) for the modelers.
For a science that is more than 95% certain, we sure do see quite a steady stream of surprises with each passing day.
UPDATE: As reader Kurt points out, the claims made by the authors are based on “model simulations”. And we know that over 97% (114/117) of the models have completely missed the barn since 2000.  So if models cannot tell us the temperature, what could they possibly say about the mechanisms driving climate?

Share this...FacebookTwitterOn Consensus
By Ed Caryl
This is in response to comments made by reader G Mitchell.
We are constantly told that there is a consensus in climate science that CO2 is warming the planet, or the deep ocean, (or something) and that if we do not limit CO2 something bad will happen. As one can easily see, there is no consensus on the two “somethings” in that first sentence. We are told that CO2 is responsible for warming, cooling, less rainfall, more rainfall, less snow, more snow, less ice, more ice, more hurricanes, fewer hurricanes, more tornados, fewer tornados, and so on. Each of those things can also be good or bad, (but mostly bad) depending on where and when they happen. The “consensus” seems to morph to whatever bad thing the writer wants to prove. This isn’t climatology, it’s calamitology.
The appeal to authority is scientific fallacy 
The “Appeal To Authority” fallacy is used in each case to back up the claim. The “Trust me, I’m a Climate Scientist” fallacy is constantly used in either the first or second person. It should be pointed out that the title “Climate Scientist” is always self-bestowed, thus is as ephemeral and fallacious as the consensus.
One claim is that “97%” or “99%” of peer reviewed climate science papers support the Catastrophic Anthropogenic Global Warming (CAGW) meme. The first problem with this claim is that getting a paper past the gauntlet of peer review in many climate related journals requires bowing to the requirement for some mention of “global warming” or “climate change” or whatever phrase de jour.
Again and again we find papers that have little or nothing to do with climate change containing those phrases. There are over a thousand peer-reviewed papers taking the converse position. There are also papers cited as supporting CAGW that do not, in fact, support the premise. Fortunately, there are people keeping track of these. I direct the reader to here and here as just two collections.
No agreement on sensitivity means no consensus

There are several “facts” used to back up the claims by “Climate Science”. But there is no consensus on any of these. Climate sensitivity is the first and most important claim as it is the entire underpinning to the argument. There is no agreement on climate sensitivity, there are only opinions. Does the doubling of CO2 content in the atmosphere result in warming? If so how much? Opinions range from some small negative number to above six degrees C, including, of course, the number zero. Even the IPCC cannot settle on a number; the latest iteration being from 1.5 to 4.5°C. A range of three cannot be described as a consensus. The large numbers depend on there being a large positive feedback, as the basic radiation physics of CO2 alone describes a sensitivity of 1°C. The stumbling block of course is the unknown effect of water vapor and clouds. Water vapor is the other (and dominant) greenhouse gas.
No agreement on CO2 lifetime means no consensus
Another “fact” is CO2 lifetime in the atmosphere. This is described in peer-reviewed papers as from less than 7 years to over a hundred, the larger number of course, is used to predict doom. This is hardly a consensus.
Other “facts” in dispute include how much natural variability contribute to observed warming. Ocean cycles and solar variability are two important and heavily argued contributors. Volcanism, natural and man-produced aerosols are others. There is hardly a consensus in this area either. For some recent opinions, go here.
The “Appeal To Authority” and “Ad Hominem” attack fallacies are also used to put down the contribution of skeptical blogs and those that write for and comment on them. It is as if those that do not “believe” are refused a license to think. This is the crux of the problem. This is the reaction of the religious, not scientists. No other scientific field so denies the amateur a place. Why is this so? Follow the money.
Climate science does not require a specialist; it requires a generalist. The knowledge needed crosses all the boundaries. Knowledge in chemistry, physics, geology, biology, botany, mathematics, computers, literature, and library science are all needed, not specialist knowledge, general knowledge. The underlying data and principles involved are not difficult to understand. Anyone widely read in these fields can make a contribution, if they keep an open mind and just think.
My own contributions here are not intended as revealed truth, that would be a religious view. They are suggestions based on the data as found, meant to stimulate thought. This is the basis of science.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhat implications could a low-activity sun have on earth? Fritz Vahrenholt’s and Frank Bosse’s latest solar report.
===============================================
The Sun in December 2013: Coming Back To Life
By Frank Bosse and Fritz Vahrenholt
Translated and edited by P Gosselin)
For solar observers there was quite a bit of activity last month, namely sunspots, and not too few of them. Activity even reached 84% of the mean value calculated from cycles 1-23. With an official SSN (sunspot number) of 90.3 the sun reached a second peak in December 2013, see the following chart:

Figure 1: Comparison of solar cycle 24 activity to the mean value of the previously observed cycles and to that of solar cycle 5.
As far as sunspot activity is concerned, the peak was comparable to what we observed 25 months ago (November 2011), but this time most activity occurring in the sun’s southern hemisphere: 82%. In the sun’s first cycle 24 outbreak, most of the activity happened in the northern hemisphere. To compare the activity of the current cycle to that of past solar cycles, we plot the sunspot anomalies from the mean for the number of sunspots up to 61 months into the cycle (blue curve in Figure 1). This yields Figure 2:

Figure 2: Accumulated number of sunspots since the beginning of the cycle, taking modified method of counting before 1945 though the “Waldmeier- Discontinuity” (see Cliver et al. 2013). Cycle 24 so far is the 5th least active cycle in over 250 years.
The low level of activity of the Dalton Minimum at the start of the 19th century is plain to see, as well as the rather relatively subdued activity that followed until about 1950. Then there was a significant increase until cycle 23 which heralded a drop that is now continuing today. Single months with increased activity hardly change the overall trend. As before we are currently seeing the lowest level of solar activity in terms of sunspots in the last 170 years.

So just what are sunspots?
From the sun’s moving plasma, magnetic fields are generated and they are able to strongly impact the energy flow in the sun’s upper convective layer.

Figure 3: The sun’s general structure. At the core the energy is generated by nuclear fusion. This energy is transported outwards by radiation, and then by convection through moving plasma. Source: Wikipedia. Kelvinsong: This file is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license.
These fields can cause convective energy flux to reduce locally, and so dark spots form on the sun’s surface. When that happens multiple times at nearby regions, different poled magnetic field lines interfere with each other and a short circuit is created. As a result the magnetic fields collapse and the pent up energy can suddenly burst. This is what we call a so-called flare – a solar explosion. When it is powerful enough, solar material gets ejected out into space with such violence that it literally escapes the sun’s gravitational field and flies out into space. This is the so-called coronal mass ejection (CME). It can have adverse consequences should it strike the earth and the material cloud reacts with the earth’s magnetic field and strong fluctuations occur. These in turn induce large currents within conductors at the earth’s surface (geomagnetic storms).
Our networked world is thus more prone to such events than 60 years ago. Power and communication networks and satellite outages can have consequences. However, very often such risks do not occur because several conditions have to be present before a serious outage takes place. A discussion on the impacts of CMEs in cycle 24 was held in December 2013 at the autumn American Geophysical Union conference. It was determined that that the latest geomagnetic storms have been really low in strength compared to what we observed before. They are even faster than they were in previous cycles. That can be traced back to a 40% reduced counter-pressure in the corona (see Figure 3). As a result the CMEs were able to move faster, yet have less impact. You can see the video of the presentation on the subject here.

On the other hand one can conclude: The reduced solar activity since 2006 reduced the density of the corona by a considerable amount. This not only has great impacts at the sun’s surface, but also out within the sun’s sphere of influence, which is also where the earth happens to orbit. So we can continue to wait with suspense what will be discovered next. Should it end up (as many scientists suspect) that solar activity continues to decline until the middle of the century, then there remains lots of potential. As Leif Svaalgard says at the end of the video: “None of us alive have ever seen such a weak cycle.”
Interesting times!

Share this...FacebookTwitterJudging by the German government’s own press release (from the Ministry of Environment) regarding the release of the new IPCC report, one could easily argue that it is in a state of complete confusion.
Federal Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks and Federal Research Minister Johanna Wanka see the latest IPCC report “as further proof that urgent action on climate change” and are therefore “advocating ambitious, rapid climate action in order to slow down the global increase in temperatures.”
Federal Environment Minister Hendricks commented:
Climate change is happening every day. This is why we have to do two things: firstly to combat climate change and make sure that global warming does not exceed 2 degrees Celsius, and secondly to prepare for the consequences of unavoidable climate change.”
The press release states that the government is “taking the risks very seriously” and has “already developed an adaptation strategy and an action plan“.
The press releases outlines a range of actions, “from developing early warning systems for extreme weather events to adaptation concepts for urban planning and specific changes to building legislation“. Then the press release boasts about all the money it is going to spend in “honoring international commitments like funding climate and biodiversity projects in newly industrialising and developing countries with a total of 1.4 billion euros” and allocating “more than 250 million euros for adaptation-related projects.”
If that were not enough of a waste of money, the press release also writes that German Research Minister Johanna Wanka will be using climate models to prepare regionally for the future:
In recent years we have considerably advanced the development of climate models. We will now focus on using and implementing our findings at regional level, for example to back up local investment decisions or develop targeted regional adaptation strategies. Climate and adaptation measures are particularly effective when planned regionally and implemented with scientific support.”
Unfortunately, news of the performance of the climate models have yet to reach the German government:
 
Germany’s Research Minister Johanna Wanka is impressed by the climate models’ performance.

The Federal Research Ministry is so impressed by the climate models that it boasts having “spent a total of 750 million euros on projects and research institutions in the areas of climate and energy in 2013 alone“.
Moreover, the press release keeps talking about adaptation measures, and makes no mention of curbing greenhouse gases.
Adapting to climate protects climate?
Federal Research Minister Wanka then states that its “KLIMZUG funding programme facilitates the testing of strategies for adaptation to climate change and related weather extremes in various regions“.
Minister of Research Johanna Wanka adds:
Education and research can make a difference in changing climate awareness worldwide. If people are successfully adapting to climate change at home, in their communities, this will make an important contribution to protecting our climate in general.”
So adaptation is climate protection? I’ve always understood it as our protection from the climate. Germany’s Ministry of Environment didn’t do itself any favors making the press release public. One would be hard pressed to find a press release that is more confused. She seems to be mixing up adaptation with mitigation.
Also the German government is pledging more money for climate research in order to close the “knowledge gaps” and for “understanding how climate change works” in a field where it is claimed everything is already understood and the science is settled. Federal Research Minister Wanka:
The report shows that there is a further need for research on climate change. Closing knowledge gaps and understanding how climate change works will help us develop more effective adaptation strategies and protect ourselves better against the effects of climate change.
On the surface the press release tells us that the German government’s plan is all about adaptation and shows no plans to knock down CO2 emissions 80% by 2050. There’s no mention of rapidly expanding renewable energies nor of scaling back fossil fuels.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s something really cool and likely something you’re going to look at regularly.
Axel Bojanowski reports here at Spiegel on an outstanding interactive global weather real-time animation tool. The animation is the creation of US programmer Cameron Beccario.

Image cropped from: earth.nullschool.net.
You can use the mouse to rotate the globe and to activate the animation of what is happening on the planet, real time. By clicking on a certain location, the exact longitude and latitude coordinates are appear along with wind speed data in a box. It’s really fascinating.
Bojanowski says to open it with Firefox or Crome browser!
For example in the above cropped image, the tiny circle all the way in the upper left corner appears and the box contains information for that location such as wind velocity and coordinates
This probably is known to others already. For me it’s the first time I see it.
Enjoy. It’ll be handy to use as storms approach.

"Al Gore has said the global economy requires a fundamental upgrade to become more sustainable in order for the world to survive an environmental crisis and widening social divides. The environmentalist and former US vice-president said the world was in the early stages of a “sustainability revolution” that had “the magnitude of the Industrial Revolution and the speed of the digital revolution”. “The scale of our global challenges has never been clearer,” Gore said. The urgent need to address the world’s sustainability crisis is laid bare in the latest annual report from Generation Investment Management, which was co-founded by Gore and David Blood, a veteran Goldman Sachs investor, in 2004. The fund has more than $22bn worth of assets under its management, which it invests in technologies that can improve food production, healthcare and energy provision. “We have entered an age of environmental crises and of widening social divides. Incremental improvements to address these challenges are no longer enough; our economic system requires a fundamental upgrade to sustainability,” Gore said. The report concludes that an environmental breakdown is taking place alongside a fraying of the “social and economic fabric”. This threatens to create a “disruptive”, economy-wide sustainability crisis. It says the world’s rising use of fossil fuels and unsustainable food and meat production is accelerating the climate crisis while driving a global healthcare breakdown. Colin le Duc, a partner in Generation, said the world was continuing to grow its use of coal and combustion engine vehicles even though the negative effects of fossil fuels on the climate and human health were well known. Although many countries have set dates to permanently end sales of petrol and diesel cars, 90% of children now breathe toxic air, according to the report. Meanwhile, global obesity levels are rising in line with a growing global appetite for meat and packaged foods despite warnings that healthcare is an unsustainable cost for most governments. 1. Extreme weather events 2. Natural disasters 3. Failure to halt climate change 4. Water crises 5. Cyber attacks 6. Biodiversity loss 7. Mass involuntary migration 8. Manmade environmental disasters The report says there are now more overweight people in the world than underweight people for the first time in history. This is in part due to rising meat consumption. On a per capita basis, meat consumption in China has more than doubled in the last 30 years but still lags behind that of the US by about 50%. The dual impact of a health and climate breakdown could be made worse by a growing divide between rich and poor, which risks encouraging populist politics and global geopolitical instability. This political upheaval could spell bad news for global markets and economic systems while investors and policymakers try to adapt to the crisis. “It is clear that the way we are organising ourselves is not working,” Le Duc said. The report says the scale of the transformation needed is unprecedented and will mean “transitioning away from an incumbent energy system we have relied upon for more than 150 years, a revolution in global food systems – and much more.” Le Duc urged investors to embrace the “nuanced complexity of the transition to a sustainable economy” when assessing which companies offer sound investments in the coming decades. Gore said advances in technology, business model innovation and policy changes were “all aligning with society’s increasing demand for zero-carbon, equitable and inclusive economic growth”. The cost of renewable energy and electric cars is falling, while meat substitutes and alternative proteins have broken through into the mainstream. Meanwhile, investors have divested more than $7tn from fossil fuels. A sustainable economy would require even greater shifts from the global investment community, according to Le Duc. “There are plenty of investors that need to wake up to sustainability. Around $17tn is being invested with environment and social governance considerations – that’s a lot of money but it’s a very small proportion of global capital,” he said. He said a deeper understanding of the systemic shifts under way across all sectors was required by business leaders. “This represents the biggest investor opportunity ever writ in history. The economy has never been as big as it is today, and has never needed as much change.”"
"After six years of the Coalition promising to cut red tape, Scott Morrison has used his first major speech since winning the election to promise to continue cutting red tape. In a speech to the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Western Australia, which acknowledged the “challenges and headwinds” facing the economy, Morrison said the government’s previous red tape-cutting initiatives had created savings of $5.8bn.  But now he wants to go further, shifting the onus to business and industry to identify the delays, using Donald Trump’s economic plan as the inspiration. “This will be a renewed focus on regulatory reform but from a different angle,” Morrison said. “Rather than setting targets for departments or government agencies, we’ll be asking the wider question from the perspective of a business looking, say, to open a mine, commercialise a new biomedical innovation, or even start a home-based family business. “By focusing on regulation from the viewpoint of business, we will identify the regulations and bureaucratic processes that impose the largest costs on key sectors of the economy and the biggest hurdles to letting those investments flow,” he said. “While reducing taxes has had a major impact in the United States, it was actually the Trump administration’s commitment to cutting red tape and transforming the regulatory mindset of the bureaucracy that delivered their first wave of improvement in their economy.” Morrison said agencies such as the WA Environment Protection Authority had created uncertainty over emissions targets for the resources sector and were a barrier to investment. That comes after reports WA is considering going alone with its own carbon price, in the face of the federal government’s insistence it will meet its Paris targets, despite the government’s own data showing emissions continuing to increase. Asked about states going forward with individual plans, Morrison reiterated the Coalition’s insistence on “responsible targets”. “Well, all I know is that when any target is set that is not responsible and there are not clear policies and mechanisms that achieves it, all it tends to do is crush business and investment confidence and cost jobs,” he said. “So I think we should all be working together to create jobs, not cost them. “And the government sets our overall emissions reduction targets. Ours have been consistent for many years now. What’s more important is we’re meeting them. Our 2020 targets, we will exceed by 369m tonnes of abatement and similarly we’ll meet our 2030 targets. “So I think, you know, we all agree you need to take action on climate change and we’re taking responsible and effective action.” Australia’s emissions have risen every year for the past four years."
"It is hard to believe it needs stating, but it does. The oil industry is not your friend. Whatever it might say about its ethical credentials, while it continues to invest in fossil fuels, it accelerates climate breakdown and the death of the habitable planet. You would think this point was obvious to everyone. But over the past few weeks, I have spoken to dozens of environmentalists who appear to believe that Shell is on their side. I’ve come to the bizarre conclusion that there is more awareness of the oil industry’s agenda within the arts than there is among conservation groups.  Last week, the actor Mark Rylance brilliantly articulated his reasons for resigning from the Royal Shakespeare Company over its sponsorship by BP. The oil company had been subsidising cheap tickets for young people. It might be trashing the world these young people will inherit, but they can watch some great shows. This is bread and circuses – without the bread. “Surely,” Rylance asked, “the RSC wants to be on the side of the world-changing kids, not the world-killing companies?” To judge by its responses to his complaints across the years, apparently not. But, thanks to campaigning groups such as Platform, Art Not Oil, BP or not BP? and Culture Unstained, theatre companies, museums and art galleries are at least aware that there’s a conflict. Two months ago, Shell announced a $300m fund for “investing in natural ecosystems” over the next three years. This, it claims, will help to “support the transition towards a low-carbon future”. By paying for reforestation, it intends to offset some of the greenhouse gases produced by its oil and gas extraction. In conversations with environmental campaigners from several parts of the world, I keep hearing the same theme: Shell is changing, Shell is sincere – so shouldn’t we support it? The fund sounds big, and it is – until you compare it with Shell’s annual income of $24bn. Shell’s transition towards a low-carbon future is almost invisible in its annual report. Renewable energy doesn’t figure in its summary of financial results. When I checked with the company, it told me it had no discrete figure for its income from low-carbon technologies. Nor could it tell me how much it invested in them last year. But it did pour $25bn of investment into oil and gas in 2018, including exploration for new fossil fuel reserves in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico and off the coasts of Brazil and Mauritania. Among its assets are 1,400 mineral leases in Canada, where it makes synthetic crude oil from tar sands. Some transition. Shell’s “cash engines”, according to its annual report, are oil and gas. There is no sign that it plans to turn the engines off. Its “growth priorities” are chemical production and deep water oil extraction. It does list low-carbon energy among its “emerging opportunities” in future decades, but says it will develop them alongside fracking and liquefied fossil gas technologies. In the future, the company says, it will “sell more natural gas”. But as an analysis by Oil Change International explains, “there is no room for new fossil fuel development – gas included – within the Paris agreement goals”. Even existing gas and oil extraction is enough to push us past 1.5C of global heating. Shell is a company committed for the long term to fossil fuel production – which is another way of saying ecocide. It is also explicit about the purpose of schemes such as its natural ecosystems fund. The company’s success, its chairman says, “will depend largely on whether society trusts us. Investors invest in companies they trust, governments allow trusted companies to operate and consumers buy things from people they trust.” Among the company’s strategic ambitions is “to sustain a strong societal licence to operate”. Restoring natural ecosystems is crucial to preventing climate breakdown. As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) points out, drawing down large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is essential if we are to stand any chance of preventing more than 1.5C or even 2C of global heating. By far the best way of doing this is through natural climate solutions: protecting and restoring living systems such as forests, mangroves, salt marshes and peat bogs. As they develop, they absorb carbon dioxide and turn it into solid carbon, in the form of wood, mud and soil. In April, with a small team, I launched a campaign to prioritise these solutions. But the IPCC also makes it clear that natural climate solutions do not compensate for the continued release of greenhouse gases. We also need immediate and drastic cuts in fossil fuel production. To sustain a habitable planet, we must leave fossil fuels in the ground and protect and rewild living systems. The age of offsets is over. Shell, however, intends to keep finding and developing new reserves. Only last week, it withheld its support for a legally binding target to reduce the EU’s emissions to net zero by 2050. Trumpeting its investment in natural ecosystems looks to me like a means of sustaining its social licence to extract the gas and oil that will destroy our lives. As if to highlight the distracting nature of Shell’s public relations, earlier this month its chief executive, Ben van Beurden, gave a lecture in which he instructed people to “eat seasonally and recycle more”. He lambasted “consumers who choose to eat strawberries in winter”, explaining that his driver had revealed that he “had bought a punnet of strawberries in January that were grown in Chile”. What are the chances that the jet fuel used to fly them here was supplied by Shell? They who have put out the people’s eyes reproach them of their blindness. To me, Shell’s strategy is so transparent that it is hardly worth debating. It wants to stay in the fossil fuel business, but it needs to fend off the regulation that might threaten this business. If the company is not prepared to abandon its cash engines, it must change people’s perceptions of its activities. Shell’s natural ecosystems fund, in my view, is blatant greenwash. But the company’s strategy is working. A remarkable number of people who should be fighting Shell instead see it as a green alternative to Exxon, persuaded by what is, in comparison with the company’s filthy investments, a tiny sop. Shell has longstanding relationships with four “environmental partners”: the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, the Nature Conservancy, Wetlands International, and Earthwatch. I believe it is just as wrong for these groups to take its money as it is for the RSC to take money from BP. It surprises me that there is not as much pressure on them to break their links as there has been, for example, on the British Museum, whose relationship with BP is becoming a national embarrassment. But naivety about Shell is not confined to its partners. Plenty of well-intentioned organisations and people, who share my enthusiasm for natural climate solutions, appear so desperate to clutch at any straws of hope that they are prepared to see this company as part of the solution. Shell is not our friend. It is an engine of planetary destruction. • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"

"Last week, the government rejected recommendations from the Commons environmental audit committee report on the impact of fast fashion – including a 1p per garment levy. Ministers also rejected a ban on burying or incinerating clothes that could be recycled. According to the Waste and Resources Action Programme (Wrap) UK households sent 300,000 tonnes of clothing to landfill in 2016.  According to a 2019 EU report fashion companies produced two collections a year in 2000, but this had increased to five by 2011, with some chains such as Zara offering 24 collections per annum. The report stated that this had led to clothes being regarded as “nearly disposable” goods. One washload of polyester clothes can release 700,000 microplastic fibres into the environment. It is estimated that half a million tonnes of these microfibres end up in the sea each year. Polyester, made from fossil fuels, is non-biodegradable. Microfibres from synthetics are a major contributor to microplastic pollution – a 2019 Bangor University survey of UK rivers, reservoirs and lakes found micro-plastic pollution at all locations tested. According to the Pulse of Fashion report in 2015 the industry was responsible for 1,715 million tonnes of CO2 emissions. The UN states that the fashion industry consumes more energy than the aviation and shipping industry combined. The Pulse report forecast fashion emissions to grow by 63% by 2030. The production of clothing is very water-intensive. According to the 2017 Wrap report the average water footprint for a kilo of cotton (equivalent to pair of jeans and a shirt) is 10,000-20,000 litres. India and Pakistan are major suppliers of cotton to the UK, but both countries suffer from high levels of water scarcity."

"The first person to face trial over the Extinction Rebellion protests in April has been found guilty of a minor public order offence for blocking a road in central London. Angie Zelter, 68, was given a conditional discharge at Hendon magistrates court on Tuesday after being arrested for lying in the road near Parliament Square on 17 April. She had been taking part in protests in which thousands of people  blocked key sites across the capital over 10 days to highlight the escalating climate emergency.  Defending herself, Zelter outlined the “clear and unequivocal” scientific evidence of climate chaos and the threat ecological breakdown posed to the future of humanity, citing a swath of scientific studies, UN-backed reports and academic papers. She told the court that although this was only a “dry summary” and a “minute fraction” of the available evidence, it proved that her peaceful civil disobedience was both necessary and proportionate. Zelter told magistrates that humans faced mass extinction unless governments implemented wide-ranging changes. Extinction Rebellion is a protest group that uses non-violent civil disobedience to campaign on environmental issues. Launched in October 2018, with an assembly at Parliament Square to announce a 'declaration of rebellion' against the UK Government, the group has staged regular demonstrations against current environmental policies. More than 1,000 activists were arrested in April 2019 after protesters occupied four sites across London, as well as blocking roads, disrupting a railway line and conducting a protest at Heathrow. Other demonstrations have included a semi-naked protest inside the House of Commons and blockading streets in London, Cardiff, Leeds, Bristol and Glasgow. The group says climate breakdown threatens all life on Earth, and so it is rebelling against politicians who “have failed us”, to provoke radical change that will stave off a climate emergency. The movement has become global with groups set up in countries include the US, Spain, Australia, South Africa and India. Martin Belam The judge, Margot Coleman, said that although she was mindful of the evidence from Zelter, the case “was a matter of law not morality”. “Your argument does not provide you with a defence to these charges,” she said. Zelter, who has been involved in various campaigns concerning the arms trade, environmentalism and nuclear weapons since the early 1980s, was convicted of breaching a section 14 order, which the court heard had been imposed because the Extinction Rebellion protests were causing widespread disruption to businesses and the wider community. The order gives police the power to clear static protests from a specified area. The court heard she had been lying in the road near Parliament Square and refused to move when asked to do so by the police. Zelter disputed the implementation of the section 14 order, arguing the disruption was minimal compared with the “chaos that will ensue from climate breakdown”. “I am fearful for the future for myself, for my family and for all living creatures on this fragile planet,” she said. “I believe there is a real and substantial threat to all our lives, and that, in accordance with the science, urgent and systemic changes to our society must be taken now to mitigate the danger. That is why I took action.” Zelter said her history of campaigning and protests – she has established various protest groups and been arrested and imprisoned several times – proved she had not made the decision to take part in the Extinction Rebellion action lightly. “I hope it shows that my actions … were not taken spontaneously or lightly but came out of [a] lifetime [of] concerns and that I have tried everything I could think of to create the changes necessary to combat climate change and prevent catastrophic collapse.” She said the overwhelming evidence of climate breakdown had left her feeling “frustrated, depressed and, at times, hopeless”. “I cannot really understand why those ‘in power’ have refused to act. After all, it is their world too … ” she said. “When our society and ecosystem collapses around us, none of us will be able to eat, drink, or breathe money.” Coleman ordered her to pay £640 costs, but Zelter said she would not. Speaking outside the court she said she was considering an appeal. “I am sad that the judge did not take the broader view of finding me not guilty because of the severity and urgency of the climate emergency,” she said."
"Britain increased support for fossil fuel projects overseas to almost £2bn last year, marking an elevenfold increase over the previous 12 months. Backing for oil and gas operations in Oman, Kuwait, Brazil and other countries, amounted to more than a quarter of the total commitment by UK Export Finance (UKEF), the government agency responsible for promoting British exports with credit, guarantees, loans and insurance.  The amount was more than double that committed to the high-emitting sector in any of the past four years, according to an analysis by the investigative environmental journalism outlet DeSmog UK. Britain claims to be a climate leader even as it promotes companies that contribute to greenhouse gases overseas. Last month MPs declared a climate emergency but faced criticism over climate plans deemed inadequate by environmentalists. The Committee on Climate Change says cutting greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 is necessary, affordable and desirable. Here are some of the actions needed to make that happen: • Petrol and diesel cars banned from sale ideally by 2030 and 2035 at the latest. • Quadrupling clean electricity production from wind, solar and perhaps nuclear, plus batteries to store it and connections to Europe to share the load. • Connection of new homes to the gas grid ending in 2025, with boilers using clean hydrogen or replaced by electric powered heat pumps. Plus, all homes and appliances being highly efficient.   • Beef, lamb and dairy consumption falling by 20%, though this is far lower than other studies recommend and a bigger shift to plant-based diets would make meeting the zero target easier. • A fifth of all farmland – 15% of the UK – being converted to tree planting and growing biofuel crops and restoration of peat bogs. This is vital to take CO2 out of the air to balance unavoidable emissions from cattle and planes. • 1.5bn new trees will be needed, meaning more than 150 football pitches a day of new forests from now to 2050. • Flying would not be banned, but the number of flights will depend on how much airlines can cut emissions with electric planes or biofuels.  This month parliament’s environmental audit committee said the UK was sabotaging its climate credentials by providing “unacceptably high” subsidies that locked poorer nations into a fossil fuel future. A separate study this year found the UK led the European Union in giving subsidies to fossil fuels. UKEF said its support for oil and gas helped ensure the competitiveness of an industry in Britain employing 300,000 people. A spokesperson said the agency “fully recognises the importance of tackling climate change and the need for a mix of energy sources and technologies as the world transitions to a low carbon economy”. In a press release UKEF headlined the latest figures as the “best results for 28 years” even though its annual report acknowledged high potential environmental and social risks for several of the projects. The agency’s biggest single energy deal last year involved £734m in support of the Duqm oil refinery project in Oman. Other large sums were the £248m for oil exploration in Brazil, £171m for an oil refinery in Kuwait, and several hundred million for power projects in Iraq. The total £2bn support for fossil fuels last year compared with £175m in 2017, £857m in 2016, and £432m in 2015, according to DeSmog. The figures did not include the aviation and the motor industry, though Airbus, Boeing and Norton Motorcycles also figured prominently on the latest list of supported projects. Companies selling pipeline surveillance equipment to Kuwait, Qatar, India and China, also featured. By comparison, support for renewables last year slumped to £700,000, and covered mostly wind turbines in the Netherlands and Germany. The Guardian has updated its style guide to introduce terms that more accurately describe the environmental crises facing the world.
Instead of “climate change”, the preferred terms are “climate emergency, crisis or breakdown” and “global heating” is favoured over “global warming”. The scale of the climate and wildlife crises has been laid bare by two landmark reports from the world’s scientists. In October 2018, they said carbon emissions must halve by 2030 to avoid even greater risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people. In May 2019, global scientists said human society was in jeopardy from the accelerating annihilation of wildlife and destruction of the ecosystems that support all life on Earth. The editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, says: “We want to ensure that we are being scientifically precise, while also communicating clearly with readers on this very important issue. The phrase ‘climate change’, for example, sounds rather passive and gentle when what scientists are talking about is a catastrophe for humanity.” Other terms that have been updated include the use of “wildlife” rather than “biodiversity”, “fish populations” instead of “fish stocks” and “climate science denier” rather than “climate sceptic”. Damian Carrington Environment editor Kerry McCarthy, a Labour MP and member of the environmental audit committee, said the agency needed to clean up its act.  She said: “These shocking figures show UKEF is increasingly undermining attempts to tackle our climate emergency. Instead of making renewable energy a priority, as UKEF assured us they were doing when they appeared before our inquiry in March, their own accounts show that support for fossil fuels has increased more than tenfold over the past year. Not only that, support for renewables has declined by a third.” Outstripping all of them were arms deals, which topped the list with more than £3bn support for weapons systems and Typhoon aircraft sold to Qatar, and with several million pounds for explosive ordnance purchased by Saudi Arabia."

Share this...FacebookTwitterScience journalist Axel Bojanowski, a trained geologist, at Spiegel writes how scientists think they may have solved the riddle of growing Antarctic sea ice in a warming world.

Mysteries surround Antarctica…scientists realizing oceans play huge role on climate. Photo: NASA-JPL.
No question the planet has warmed some since 1900 as it crawls out of a little ice age and back to a new Holocene optimum. Bojanowski writes:
For a long time scientists thought the problem would simply pass. They expected it was only a fleeting oddity.”
It turns out that the high level of Antarctic sea ice hasn’t been an oddity at all and continues to set new record highs. Now red-faced scientists are desperately searching for an explanation, even a temporary one, that will at least allow them to buy some time. Bojanowski writes:
Never before since measurements began in the late 1970s has there been so much ice at the southern continent at this time of the year.”
Bojanowski cites climate scientist Hugues Goosse of the Université Catholique of Louvain in Belgium, who says that Antarctica is behaving differently due to the fact that it is surrounded by oceans, and not continents as is the case in the Arctic. Goosse tells of ocean dynamics acting as a likely driver in polar ice behavior.
News for Goosse: Ocean cycles are a climate factor that climate scientists always had a habit of denying in the past. Skeptics argued again and again that oceans indeed acted as one of the earth’s primary thermostats, but were always dismissed. This is one reason why climate models have been so wrong.
Yet, Goosse insists the phenomenon is “temporary”. Spiegel writes:
Goosse believes in “temporary fluctuations in weather patterns”, for example changes in the prevailing wind directions. In the meantime winds are blowing over the southern continent more outwards towards the sea and thus are blowing ice outwards in all directions.”
Why this is happening is unclear. But Bojanowski cites a theory proposed by the National Snow and Ice Data Center, who think the ozone hole over the South Pole may be playing a role.

The mystery of Antarctic sea ice seems bigger than ever. Bojanowski writes of yet another explanation: Finnish researcher Petteri Uotila thinks the answer is that the Atlantic and the conditions in the Antarctic are linked:
‘I think this explanation solves the Antarctic sea ice paradox,’ believes Petteri Uotila of the Finnish Meteorological Institute in Helsinki, who was not involved in the theory.”
The theory is proposed by scientists at the New York University (NYU) who claim they see an “amazing relationship” between the Atlantic and Antarctica via the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO).
The Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation is the water temperature in the Atlantic fluctuating over decades, depending on how strongly the currents flow. And the fluctuations have an impact on years-long climate data all the way to Antarctica.”
Bojanowski cites Xichen Li of NYU, who says it’s no coincidence and is even confirmed by computer simulations. Bojanowski summarizes:
Obviously the Atlantic climate see-saw has the sea level around Antarctica fluctuating. As a result sea ice extent is changing. How this precisely functions remains unclear, however. ‘It appears we have discovered a surprising remote effect,’ Li says.”
So it’s obvious that the science of sea ice is still massively fraught with overwhelming uncertainty and will remain so for a very long time. The proposed Atlantic-Antarctic link does confirm what many skeptics have been claiming for years: the oceans play a massive role.
Veteran meteorologist Joe Bastardi has been telling us for years that the Arctic sea ice extent is driven in large part by the AMO and that today’s low Arctic sea ice levels are directly linked to the currently positive (warm) AMO. If the warm AMO has an impact on Antarctic sea ice, why wouldn’t it have an impact on the Arctic, which is directly next door? Once again the scientists are only realizing (admitting) what has been obvious to skeptics for a decade now.
Finally scientists like Goosse are waking up. Bojanowski quotes:
Here we are dealing with natural fluctuations that are only masking the warming.”
I.e. Goosse is finally admitting that we haven’t been seeing any warming for years. We suspect that in about 10 years from now, when the mask is off, scientists like Goosse will also see that there never was much warming behind the mask to begin with.

As is evident from the last 15 years, the CO2-driven climate models (and the people pushing them) have a fundamental problem: They did not, or falsely predicted, the current climate development.”
Malberg writes in the conclusion:
The anthropogenic CO2 impact on climate is greatly over-estimated by the climate models and uncritical media, as the recent climate development clearly shows.”
To support this he presents charts that clearly tell us the warming has stopped:

 It’s not only global atmospheric temperatures that have been cooling, but so have sea surface temperatures:

Malberg also cites a paper appearing in Nature (August 2013) by Yu Kosaka and Shang-Ping Xie, who conclude that the missing warming since 1998 can be explained in large part by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), i.e. a natural climate process. Their model of global warming showed that about 60% (0.4°C) of the 0.68°C warming occurring between 1975-1998 can be explained by the PDO.
The decline in PDO intensity that then began in the late 1990s corresponds to the end of global warming:

In his report at EIKE, Malberg goes into further detail on the PDO’s impact on global climate. He writes that the ocean alone is an internal, secondary climate factor, and that it is not the primary climate driver. And because global temperatures are not responding to rising CO2, the trace gas can no longer be regarded as being a main driver behind climate.
Solar activity today comparable to Dalton Minimum

As the primary factor driving climate, Malberg believes it is the sun. The following charts shows the mean value for sunspot activity since 1679 along with mean Central European temperature anomaly:


Chart source: Horst Marlberg
The above two charts show a striking similarity. Malberg writes at EIKE:
Because of empirical analyses on climate change since the Little Ice Age and analyses of the behavior of the ENSO (BWK SO 18/10 and SO 05/12), we can assume that the integral (direct and indirect) solar impact on decadal climate scales is the primary and original factor.”
And adds:
With solar cycle 23 came a drastic decrease in solar activity, with a mean sunspot count of 40 in the current solar cycle 24. Such a collapse in solar activity was last seen 200 years ago during the solar Dalton-Minimum.”
The German meteorologist also says that the sun’s current activity is “without a doubt comparable to that of the Dalton-Minimum and corresponds to the approximately 200-year solar activity oscillation of the de Vries cycle“.
No warming until the middle of the 21st century
Malberg writes near the end of the essay that according to the 200-year cycle, no warming can be expected until the solar activity starts picking up again in the middle of 21st century:
The observed data of the last 300 years speak a clear language: The ‘fickle sun’ as the primary driver is what decides the fundamental extent of the cooling and the warming. The climate hypothesis of the dominance of the anthropogenic climate influence belongs immediately under scrutiny. The anthropogenic CO2 influence on climate behavior is greatly exaggerated by climate models and the uncritical media – as the recent climate developments clearly show.”
Professor Dr. Horst Malberg is the former director of the Meteorological Institute at the Free University of Berlin and a member of the EIKE Committee.

"Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has acknowledged that our planet faces a climate emergency. Inextricably linked to this is the growing ecological crisis. We must not let Brexit derail us from tackling these global challenges head-on. Whatever the outcome of the political uncertainties, we need robust, binding targets for the recovery of Scotland’s natural environment to safeguard both nature and people. This is why we have come together from across Scottish society to ask the first minister to bring forward a new Scottish environment act. Ensuring our world is rich in nature is the best insurance we have against dangerous climate heating. Protecting, restoring and enhancing Scotland’s natural environment would help limit temperature rises and help us adapt to changes that we cannot avoid. It would also give us so much more.  Everyone has the right to a clean and healthy environment. Nature enriches people’s lives. It cleans our air and water, improves our physical and mental health, underpins Scotland’s global image and exports, and improves the places we live. For all these reasons, we are calling for a Scottish environment act that makes Scotland’s vision to be an environmental world leader a reality.Andrew Bachell Chief executive officer, John Muir Trust Lang Banks Director, WWF ScotlandMartin Baxter Chief policy adviser, Institute of Environmental Management and AssessmentPeter Cairns Director, Scotland: The Big PictureCarol Evans Director, Woodland Trust Scotland Ian Findlay Chief officer, Paths for All Angus Hardie Director, Scottish Community Alliance Dr Deborah Long Chief officer, Scottish Environment Link Sandy Luk Chief executive officer, Marine Conservation SocietyAnne McCall Director, RSPB ScotlandBrendan Paddy Director, Ramblers ScotlandJo Pike Chief executive, Scottish Wildlife TrustMike Robinson Chief executive, Royal Scottish Geographical SocietyJason Reeves Head of policy and communications, Chartered Institute of Ecology and Environmental ManagementRuchir Shah Head of policy, Scottish Council for Voluntary OrganisationsSimon Skinner Chief executive officer, National Trust for Scotland • Congratulations to Patrick Barkham on his fascinating feature, (Reforestation of the tropics is in full swing – will it solve the climate crisis?, 19 June), illustrated with a delightful photograph of two little Kenyan girls carrying seedlings. It ought to be compulsory reading for everyone, especially climate-change deniers. I would love to believe that those who can plant trees will redouble their efforts, and those who cannot will applaud and encourage this lifesaving measure. The feature includes the fact that about 15bn trees are felled every year, dwarfing replacement efforts. Another cause for lament is the possibility of the building of a third runway at Heathrow. Aeroplanes emit carbon dioxide and ozone faster and in greater quantities than road traffic. If we keep launching more and more of these metal monsters into the air, the best tree planters in the world will be unable to compete. Wonderful work in reforestation is at risk of being nullified.Penelope MaclachlanHanwell, London • Patrick Barkham’s survey of tree planting oddly made no mention of Ecosia’s search engine, which has so far planted 60m trees from the advertising revenue generated by internet searches made by its 7 million users. It’s worth keeping a Google search engine for the rare occasion when Ecosia doesn’t do the trick, but it’s an effective way of planting trees.Charles YoungOxford • Would the UK do more to prevent “climate apartheid” (Report, 26 June) and help poor countries if it diverted some of its aid money to reduce carbon emissions and fossil fuel use at home? If aid were diverted to restore the subsidy to home solar panels in Britain (Home solar panel installations fall by 94% as subsidies cut, the guardian.com, 5 June) would there be more long-term benefit to developing countries that are being harmed by our carbon? I write about Mozambique, which was recently hit by two cyclones made worse by climate change, and which caused huge damage. Mozambique needs money to rebuild, but, unfortunately, if Britain will not increase spending on the climate crisis, it might benefit most if the aid was spent in the UK.Dr Joseph HanlonLondon • I was staggered at the narrowness of vision reflected in Andy Beckett’s piece on new left economics (There is now an alternative, Long read, 25 June).

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online German daily Die Welt here  has an interview with ARD public television chief meteorologist Karsten Schwanke on why it’s so cold in North America. He attributes the severe cold to an “unusually stable pattern by the Jet Stream“.
As I read the interview I waited for the “is global warming the cause?” question. It didn’t come until the very end. Overall the interview was quite factual throughout, much to my relief.
Schwanke tells Die Welt that the cold air mass was brought down to the states by a “polar vortex” and that “North America is geographically predestinated for cold air to come south very quickly because there are no mountain ranges to block the way.”
So we see from Schwanke’s explanation that such a phenomenon is not unknown and is natural; it happened in the past. Time magazine for example blamed global cooling for the development of “circumpolar vortices” back in 1974: Read here. And Princeton physicist William Happer says: “Polar vortices have been around forever. They have almost nothing to do with more CO2 in the atmosphere.” Read here.
Schwanke tells Die Welt that currently there is a very clear pattern in the northern hemisphere, one that is made up of four main blocks of weather: “There are two cold regions, namely North America and Central Siberia, and two warm regions: Europe and Eastern Siberia.” Schwanke describes the current Jet Stream as having very few dips and rises, thus causing large regions to remain stuck in a certain weather pattern for weeks.
Forecasts beyond 8 days are “rather uncertain”
On how long the cold pattern will continue keeping North America in its grip, Schwanke says this is very difficult to say: “There are various weather models that are still currently contradicting each other. Forecasts more than eight days into the future are in any case rather uncertain.”
On how the cold weather in North America impacts the weather in Europe, Schwanke says:

Very cold air masses that flow from North America into the Atlantic end up mixing with warmer air from the south. This is how gigantic low pressure systems are formed over the Atlantic and produce south west currents – this is why it’s so warm where we are.”
There we have it: mid and north Atlantic storms are triggered by cold air masses.
On the question as to when winter will finally arrive in Germany, Schwanke thinks there may be a fundamental change in the works over the next two weeks, but the models are still too uncertain on this.
When asked if man can have an impact on the weather, Schwanke replies that “today there is not really any serious scientific evidence to show that really works – getting clouds to rain for example. The energy movements in the atmosphere are so great that a few human measures would be smaller than pin pricks.”
At the very end: He is asked if there a connection between extreme weather and climate change? Here Schwanke replies saying that cold snaps “will not change global warming, which we are experiencing: Eastern Siberia is warmer than it has been in a long time. Europe will have one of the warmest winters in a long time.”
Unfortunately Schwanke obviously has not looked at the global temperatures for the last 15 years. NO WARMING!
He then tells Die Welt there were some papers out that showing that Arctic sea ice extent could have an impact on the Jet Stream waves. But he didn’t come across as being too convinced. Why should he be? The great US cold snaps of the 1960s and 1970s were delivered by polar vortices at a time when Arctic sea ice extent was high.
Also there are papers showing a strong correlation between solar activity and European winters.

Share this...FacebookTwitterEurope and especially Germany have been enjoying an unusual, weeks-long spell of mild weather with temperatures in the double-digit Celsius range. Southerly winds have kept the continent mild for weeks. Warmists have been coming out and saying: Aha! Just as we predicted! And they are even claiming the same about the deadly cold weather gripping North America. 
Meteorologist: extremes are natural and nothing new
However, yet another veteran German meteorologist has come out and dumped cold water on the claims that the supposed weather extremes are signs of a warming planet. Meteorologist Udo Baum at wetter.net here tells readers that the extreme cold wave gripping the US and the mild weather in Europe are nothing unusual and are all part of natural weather.
Far greater fluctuations were common in history 
Baum writes:
Indeed a look back at the last 2000 years shows that there have been already even far greater fluctuations. Individual winters were so cold that rivers and lakes froze over. But also some winters were so mild that it never snowed in the flatlands and that flowers and fruit trees blossomed  two months earlier than normal.
The fluctuations between individual years are much too great to allow us to attribute them directly to long-term climate trends. And this winter is still not over and surprises are completely possible. […]
There are still too many inconsistencies and too many unknowns within the complex and chaotic climate system. Here it’s warmer; there it’s colder. The role of the oceans is still not sufficiently researched, carbon dioxide is not the only problem-gas in the atmosphere, says the team at wetter.net.
Methane plays a considerably more aggressive role. The interactions of water vapor content in the atmosphere play a large role.
Thus we maintain that the USA is not facing an ice age and that winter is not going to disappear in Central Europe in the future. In two or three weeks the weather may be entirely different, never mind next winter.”
Natural factors under-stated – can reverse man-made impacts

On natural climate factors, Baum writes:
The warming trend that is enhanced by man over the last four decades can suddenly switch back because of natural cycles or natural catastrophes and their one-time effects.”
Winter returning to Europe
On another topic, people have been asking me if we’re going to see any winter this year. Unfortunately the spring-like weather is about to end across much of Europe in a couple of days. The weather models are now pretty much unanimous and show a fundamental change in weather patterns in the works.
Donnerwetter here writes:
For the coming weeks almost all computers are showing a weather change to winter. Many centimeters of new snow are expected at temperatures at around -2 Grad C in the central mountains and 0 Grad C in the lowlands. Next week the eastern winds are back. At times frost of up to -10 Grad C are expected at night.”
The cold pole over the high north now has the chance to move closer to Europe and Asia. In addition in the days ahead continental, permanent sub-freezing air is gathering in Siberia and deep into Russia.
Thus the huge cold snap in the USA indirectly could level the way for winter to reach Europe, but likely in a less dramatic manner. Currently signs are mounting that  the downward temperature trend will get a boost next week. More and more models are pointing to the possibility a cold air mass extending out to Central Europe from the northeast.”
Here’s the 10-15 day outlook, thanks to Joe Bastardi at Twitter:

"France is falling behind on tackling the climate emergency despite ambitious promises to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a new report has found, saying Paris is worryingly far from delivering its goals. The stark warning from France’s independent advisory council on climate comes at a key moment, as the eurozone’s second-biggest economy attempts to present itself as a world leader on the climate emergency. The centrist president, Emmanuel Macron, who sought to counter Donald Trump by promising to “make our planet great again”, has tried to encourage other European nations to aim for neutral carbon dioxide emissions across the EU by 2050.  Opinion polls have showed the climate emergency is a growing priority for French voters, who increased the Green party’s score in European elections last month.  But the report handed to the prime minister, Édouard Philippe, on Tuesday night suggests that everyday life in France does not match the political promises. France needs to seriously strengthen its climate policies – particularly on transport, car use and building renovation – if it is to meet its commitments under the Paris climate agreement, the experts said. Crucially the report comes just as its authors described “a new era in the long-running rivalry between France and Britain: who will decarbonise the fastest”. The UK government announced this month that it had committed to a net zero emissions target for 2050, making Britain the first major economy to do so – with one of the most ambitious goals set by a leading polluting nation. In parallel, the French government is working on a draft energy and climate bill with the same target for 2050. France and the UK are the largest countries so far to set such an ambitious objective in legislation. France gets about 75% of its electricity from nuclear energy, which past governments argued meant lower carbon dioxide emissions than neighbours using coal. The government has pledged to reduce the nuclear energy share to 50% in 2035. But the report points to the ways in which the French government must work far harder to prepare the country for change. Carbon dioxide emission reduction has not been happening fast enough in France, the report found. France’s first official objective, the 2015-18 carbon budget, was not met. During this period, annual emissions decreased by only 1.1%, much less than planned. The rate of decrease needs to triple by 2025 to catch up on the objectives, the authors said. The key culprit in this “gap between ambition and reality” was transport: emissions have not seen a real decrease in the last 10 years, including from cars and lorries. “There is not enough modernisation of transport, or if there is, it’s going towards private cars and not public transport,” said Corinne Le Quéré, chair of the advisory body that drew up the report. Another problem is emissions from buildings, which have decreased three times more slowly than anticipated. Building renovation had not been effective enough. “France’s commitments are ambitious, but at the current rate, they are unlikely to be met,” Le Quéré said. “As long as actions to cut carbon emissions remain at the margins of public policies, France does not stand a chance of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.” She said it wasn’t enough to leave the climate crisis to an environment ministry. “It must be a national priority, central policy in all of government,” she said. Macron faced a crisis in climate policy late last year when the anti-government gilets jaunes (yellow vests) protesters took to the streets against a new carbon tax intended to urge motorists to change their behaviour. People in the countryside said it was deeply unfair to hike taxes on fuel use where there was no alternative transport to private cars. The tax was later abandoned. Le Quéré said lessons must be learned from the crisis and policies aimed at shrinking emissions should be fair and seen as fair, without increasing inequalities in different geographic areas. The report said that carbon budgets should be more ambitious and set in law. The carbon neutrality objective should include international transport, from aviation to shipping, and a strategy to reduce the country’s global carbon footprint, which includes emissions from goods manufactured in other countries for consumption in France. Last year, Macron’s high-profile environment minister, Nicolas Hulot, quit saying the government was taking only “mini steps” that were insufficient to deal with climate change."

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf you’re in Berlin next month, here’s an event you’ll want to put in your calendar.
Dr. Peter Heller of Science Skeptical writes here that Germany’s Helmholtz Association is holding a podium discussion in Berlin on March 17, 2014. The title:
“What can we believe? The climate debate and its impacts”
So even some prestigious German science research institutes are starting to second guess claims that climate science is settled and the debate is over. Moreover, skeptic views (the very backbone of scientific progress) are being given a serious platform for open discussion once again.
The podium discussion invitation reads (my emphasis):
The next segment in our Fokus@Helmholtz discussion series is titled: ‘What can we believe? The climate debate and its impacts’. At the end of March the second part of the IPCC Report will presented to the public  in Yokohama, Japan. It will once again cast questions about climate change, its impacts on man and environment. International scientists are already discussing amid controversy and are jockeying for a mutual answers in the climate question. When scientists are struggling, how can citizens understand what is going on with our climate and act responsibly? Why is the dispute among the scientists so fierce? What’s driving the climate skeptics? And: Which questions can climate models answer at all? Many people are asking what should be believed: Is climate change not really as bad as first thought? What impact does man have on it and to what extent? What roles do political interests play when it comes to forecasts?
We warmly invite you to the fourth of the Fokus@Helmholtz series taking place Monday, 17 March 2014, at 7 p.m. (entrance starting at 6:30 p.m.) in the DKB Atrium (Taubenstraße 7, 10117 Berlin). Under the title: “What can we believe? The climate debate and its impacts“ we would like to mutually discuss with you and with representatives from business, advanced education and non-university research.
Please register.
The event series Fokus@Helmholtz brings research, politics and society together on a regular basis in order to discuss the controversial questions of the future. The Helmholtz Association and its invited guests would like to look beyond the horizon, to question options for action, and to provide food for thought.”
Wow! Hard to believe but the Helmholtz here is testing a return back to science. Gone, at least for the moment, are the claims the discussion is over and the crude attempts to marginalize alternative viewpoints. Are we seeing a climate science renaissance?
The Helmholtz provides the program itenary:

Welcome:

Prof. Dr. Jürgen Mlynek, President of the Helmholtz Association

Podium discussion:

Frank Drieschner, Die Zeit
Dr. Oliver Geden, Foundation for Science and Policy
Dr. Peter Heller, “Science Skeptical Blog”
Prof. Andreas Hense, University of Bonn
Prof. Hans von Storch, Helmholtz Centre Geestacht Ventre for Material and Coastal Research

Moderation: Jan-Martin Wiarda, Helmholtz Association
“Four or five years ago this hardly would have been possible”
Peter Heller, a named participant in the above podium discussion, writes at Science Skeptical:
Also even if I am just the “quota skeptic ” it is indeed courageous of the Helmholtz Association to invite someone like me. Four or five years this hardly would have been possible or even considered. By the way, my participation is not because of the profile and impact of Science Skeptical, but solely because of the recommendation by Hans von Storch, whom I wish to thank.
The event description, however, still shows a deficit in partiality. ‘What is driving the skeptics, I don’t know and it is also not relevant. Indeed the question is foremost what is it that the alarmists find so neat about their horror scenarios and transformation fantasies. In the end, reason needs no further justifications. However insisting there’s a need to believe in something, does. Believe what you wish, but keep in mind there is a difference to knowledge.
I’m really curious to see how things will go. And at the and of the evening should people go home with the knowledge that skeptics are not people who practice occult rituals and worship Satan, but rather are the ones with a clear and calm heads in the climate debate, then that will certainly suffice.”
Any readers who happen to be in the Berlin area and who command the German language, this is one event you may not want to pass up. German skeptics can look forward to a good discussion – should Heller not get disinvited, that is.
For now let’s just say that Helmholtz Association is on “Disinvitation Watch” for the next few weeks.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe rich are mugging the poor – now in foreign countries, too.
According to online Spiegel here, a general counsel to the European High Court has ruled that consumers in one country also have to pay green energy feed-in subsidies to producers in foreign countries as well.
That means that heavily industrialized Germany may soon have to pay energy feed-in subsidies to foreign renewable energy producers as well. Spiegel writes that as a result:
The renewable energy subsidy on electric builds may soon increase further.”
The ruling arises from a recent case where a Finnish wind park had supplied energy to Sweden but was never paid the feed-in subsidy. The Finnish wind park took the case to the EU, who then ruled in favor of the Finns – claiming that the Swede’s refusal to pay represented “a discriminatory limitation of the free flow of goods“. A country must not only pay the green-energy subsidy to domestic producers, but also to those delivering from another country.
Spiegel writes, should the ruling be upheld by the EU High Court:
…it would have considerable consequences also for Germany because neighboring states like Austria, France or the Netherlands would be able to feed-in their low cost hydro-electric, solar or wind energy into the local power grid. For this they would receive the German feed-in rate. The German consumer – once again  – would have to pay.”
Already 600,000 German families are having their power cut off annually because they are no longer able to keep up with sky-rocketing electricity bills. Not only is the energy feed-in act turning out to be a huge wealth-redistribution scheme from the poor to rich property owners domestically, but one that redistributes to the rich in foreign countries as well.

Share this...FacebookTwitterFormer IPCC Author Kevin Trenberth admits in a new paper: PDO ocean oscillation contributed to the 1976-1998 warming phase
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translation, editing by P Gosselin)
It took a while, but ocean cycles have finally been adopted by the IPCC as an important climate factor. With John Fasullo, Kevin Trenberth has written in a new paper appearing in the journal Earth’s Future that the warming pause taking place since 1998 indeed may have something to do with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Also even Trenberth’s pal Stefan Rahmstorf suddenly thinks it’s a good possibility, writing in his Klimalounge blog on December 16, 2013:
Leading US climatologist Kevin Trenberth has been conducting research in this field for 20 years and has just published a comprehensive enlightening article on the subject. Trenberth emphasizes the role of the ENSO’s long-term fluctuations, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Said in simpler terms: It’s about phases in the tropical Pacific that have more frequent El Niños and phases that have more frequent La Niña conditions (like right now), which can last up to decades. The latter brings with it an ongoing somewhat slower warming of the earth’s surface temperature because more heat gets stored deeper in the oceans. One important point here: even if the surface temperature is stagnating, our planet continues to absorb a net amount of heat.”
The other “important point” that Rahmstorf fails to mention is of even greater importance. Trenberth explicitly admits in his new paper that the 1976-1998 warming phase is attributed in part to the positive phase of the PDO (original text):
The picture emerging is one where the positive phase of the PDO from 1976 to 1998 enhanced the surface warming somewhat by reducing the amount of heat sequestered by the deep ocean, while the negative phase of the PDO is one where more heat gets deposited at greater depths, contributing to the overall warming of the oceans but cooling the surface somewhat. The Pacific Ocean appears to account for the majority of the decadal variability… Nevertheless, the events in the Pacific undoubtedly also affect the Atlantic, Indian, and Southern Oceans as the system acts collectively to equilibrate to these changes in the flow of energy.
In 2012 when we brought up the PDO as one of the triggers for the 1976-1998 warming in our “Die kalte Sonne” book and proposed ocean cycles as a sort of pulse generator for temperature cycles on a decadal scale, we were met with fierce resistance from the German climate science establishment. Now less than 2 years later, “Die kalte Sonne” finds itself as mainstream science.

At a Royal Society meeting in 2013, Julia Slingo of the Met office played devil’s advocate and posed the following question to Prof Jochen Marotzke of the German Max Planck Institute of Meteorology, see the 42:46 mark royalsociety.org/marotzke.mp3:
“…it’s a great presentation about 15 years being irrelevant,  but I think, some of us might say if you look at the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and it’s timescale that it appears to work, it could be 30 years, and therefore I think, you know, we are still not out of the woods yet on this one. … If you do think it’s internal variability, and you say we do think the Pacific Decadal Oscillation is a key component of this, and it’s now in it’s particular phase, but was previously in the opposite phase, could you not therefore explain the accelerated warming of the 80s and 90s as being driven by the other phase of natural variability?”
Simplifying Slingo’s  incoherence: “If the current cooling is due to the negative PDO phase, then wouldn’t the warming of the 80s and 90s be a result of the positive PDO phase back then?”
Marotzke answers after much incoherence of his own:
Um…I guess I’m not sure.”
These people make no sense at all. They are sure it’s the oceans’ cold phase gobbling up heat when temperatures fail to rise. But when temperatures increase, they just can’t be sure that the oceans are involved at all, and insist they would not bet much money on it. Of course it just can’t work only one way. Marotzke is delivering only what would call unadulterated absurd science.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe latest Sunday print edition of Switzerland’s flagship Neue Zürcher Zeitung (NZZ) has a story blasting Europe’s failure in curbing CO2 emissions through the implementation of its CO2 emissions trading scheme (ETS). See right image.
Hat-tip Hajo Smit
The NZZ story bears the title:
Why the dreck doesn’t cost anything.
With its emissions trading, the EU wanted to be a leader in global climate protection. However it has contributed nothing to lowering greenhouse gases. A European debacle.”
Soviet-scale debacle
The NZZ reports that the emissions trading scheme started out “as a good idea” but never got anywhere. From the NZZ’s portrayal, one easily concludes that the ETS debacle is on a scale of a major Soviet central planning implosion.
The program was supposed to involve 11,000 companies, among them the worst emitters, and to get them to pay real money for each tonne of emitted greenhouse gas. But the trading scheme failed to function as hoped and the price ended up falling to the paltry 5 euros per tonne level that it is at today. Companies have no incentive to invest in energy saving technology when carbon certificates are so cheap.
The NZZ writes:
The targets for reducing greenhouse gases that the EU set to achieve by 2020 will be reached mainly because the economy in many European countries crumbled.”

With certificate prices so low, the EU is a long way from the 40 euros per tonne price level it needs to get power companies to move away from burning coal, says BP chief economist Christof Rühl.
Not only have many citizens in EU countries been burdened by the hardships of economic collapse, which has have led them to reach their emission targets, the subsidies spent on supporting completely ineffective green technologies are costing consumers an arm and a leg as well. The NZZ writes the Germany alone is paying 20 billion euros annually in feed-in charges: “Under the bottom line, this money has done very little for the climate.”
The NZZ blames the failure of the emissions trading scheme on the EU’s “fear of damaging it’s own economy with climate protection“.
In 2008, the global economic crisis led to reduced industrial production in Europe, and thus acted to dampen CO2 certificate prices further. The market was flooded with emission certificates which could be had at dirt-cheap prices and thus having no impact in getting industry off coal.
Experts blame the design of the emissions trading scheme for its downfall, saying that it never had anything to do with climate protection to begin with. What made matters even worse, the NZZ writes, was that as more and more green energy came on line, the demand (and the prices) for CO2 emission certificates dropped further, thus allowing Europe’s industry to easily skirt costly CO2 reduction measures.
The NZZ writes that Germany alone has a surplus of 2.2 billion certificates and experts say it’ll take 15 years to work them off. According to WWF Germany climate expert Regine Gunther:
Thus the flagship of the European climate protection is as good as sunk and the EU as a protector of the climate will be AWOL for the entire time.”
The NZZ writes that before anything changes, Europe has to somehow get over its fear of damaging its economy.
Imagine that. The NZZ and green climate rescuers seem to view economic damage as a sort of irrational fear. For them a rational fear is the world coming to an end in 2099.

"Ever since the G20 of leading global economies was founded, its summits have mostly been convergent occasions, marked by attempts to find common ground and remembered for nothing more unseemly than a bit of jostling among the heads of government to be on the front row of the group photograph. Japan’s prime minister Shinzō Abe clearly takes this traditional view about the G20 summit which he will host in Osaka on Friday and Saturday. “We want to make it a meeting that focuses on where we can agree and cooperate rather than highlighting differences,” he said recently. But there is a balloon-puncturing problem with Mr Abe’s approach, and it answers to the name of Donald Trump. If there is one issue on which this year’s summit clearly ought to be showing global leadership, it is the climate crisis. The subject is indeed on the Osaka agenda but, in spite of efforts by countries including France, there is no prospect of serious or effective action. That is no surprise from a group of nations which almost tripled the subsidies they gave to coal-fired power plants between 2013 and 2017, with China, India and Japan itself leading the way. But it is Mr Trump’s decision to walk away from climate accords and to back fossil fuels that creates the wider permission for these other terrible derelictions.  Mr Trump’s disruptions do not end there. The US president uses these gatherings not to build alliances to solve common problems but to knock his adversaries – and sometimes his supposed allies – off their stride. He is not looking for general agreement, which he thinks is for wimps. He is looking for American advantage over friend and foe. That’s the reason why the summit is already overshadowed by the increasingly serious trade war between the United States and China (Mr Trump will have an all-smiles bilateral with Xi Jinping on Saturday). And it is certainly the reason why Mr Trump has used the run-up to Osaka to have a pop at his hosts, whom he claimed would respond to an attack on the US by watching it “on a Sony television”, attacking India for raising tariffs and then, inventing false figures, berating Germany as a “security freeloader”. Since Mr Trump’s Friday schedule involves one-on-ones with Mr Abe, India’s Narendra Modi and Germany’s Angela Merkel, it seems these mind games are part of a deliberate strategy of disruption. This is not a novel conclusion. Mr Trump used the same approach before his recent visit to Britain, when he praised Boris Johnson and attacked Sadiq Khan and the Duchess of Sussex. If Mr Johnson becomes prime minister and Britain were to back off from supporting European opposition to the White House’s Iran strategy, Mr Trump would count this a job well done. Mr Trump’s bullying is also selective. Among the world leaders whom Mr Trump has not attacked in advance – but with whom he will also be meeting in Osaka bilaterals – are Vladimir Putin of Russia, whose country systematically interfered in the 2016 US election, and Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, who has just been accused by the United Nations of orchestrating the murder and dismemberment of the opposition journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Some would argue that Mr Trump’s bullying approach gets results in cases such as Latin America, where the administration slapped unilateral tariffs on all Mexican imports to the US in an attempt to curb migration. Mexico’s subsequent agreement to send more troops to guard its own southern border was portrayed by the White House as a vindication of Mr Trump’s tactics. But it was not a long-term solution to a deep-seated issue of regional inequality, and the tragic photograph of the drowned bodies of the Salvadorans Óscar Ramirez and his daughter Valeria underscores that it has in fact solved nothing. Like the UN, the G20 is a deeply frustrating forum. The limits of an organisation that cannot lead the way on the climate crisis, which struggles to contain the globally damaging US-China trade war, and which is happy to hold its 2020 summit in Riyadh are stark. But we inhabit a global society and economy, as Japanese warnings about a no-deal Brexit this week underline. Forms of global governance are needed more than ever, and it remains the case that an imperfect G20 is still better than none at all. • This article was amended on 28 June 2019 because an earlier version misspelled the prime minister of India’s first name. This has been corrected."

Share this...FacebookTwitterA couple years ago, Europe was acting deadly serious about forcing the rest of the world’s airlines flying in out of Europe to purchase airline emissions certificates. The rescue of the planet was at stake.

European bureaucrats actually deluded themselves into thinking the USA, China, Russia and other global powers would dance to their tune. Background info: here, here and here.
That was the fantasy.
Now reality has hit European bureaucrats once again. Suddenly Connie Hedegaard and her EU bureacrats have decided they don’t need to charge foreign airlines to purchase CO2 emission certificates every time they fly over, into, or out of the kingdom of the EU after all. They’ve realized that 14% of the planet in favor of Kyoto can’t really boss around the other 86% who are not. It turns out that protecting multi-billion euro Airbus orders and avoiding trade sanctions are more important than climate protection after all. Thank God for the wonders of the self-correcting free market.
European media outlets are (barely) reporting that international flights may continue flying over, in, and out of Europe without having to buy pollution permits. The law applies only to flights between two European airports, so reports the Wall Street Journal here.
The climate bedwetting Klimaretter here reports that Germany’s Greens are outraged by the European compromise, saying the compromise is “clearly too little for the challenges stemming from the worldwide growth in air traffic.”
Klimaretter adds that the compromise may be only be stopped by the EU-Parliament, whose official vote is still pending.”
Boy, that’s a going to be a really tough vote: Do we commit economic suicide or not?

Share this...FacebookTwitterAs Antarctica sets new maximum sea ice records, sensationalist scientists at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) remain relentless in conjuring up cataclysmic meltdown scenarios for the frozen continent. This is the case with a new paper by Levermann and Mengel appearing at Nature Climate Change. 
Yet, when we read a little further, we realize that their drama-filled scenario of an “uncorking” of the East Antarctic Wilkes Basin, all accompanied by a 4-meter rise in global sea level, is not even supported by any observed data. Rather it is merely the product of a computer simulation, one that is no doubt likely fraught with lots of adventurous and dubious assumptions.
Spiegel journalist Axel Bojanowski writes about this spectacular horror scenario, and dumps plenty of cold water on it.
First Bojanowski starts by writing that the PIK scientists warn that “a collapse of the ice shelf threatens”. Levermann and Mengel write that “a sole ice cork blocking the glacier mass inland is preventing it from flowing into the ocean“. They are worried about the cork melting due to run-away global warming, and thus clearing the way for the massive Wilkes Basin ice sheet to cataclysmically collapse into the ocean.
While most media outlets took the sensationalist Potsdam study at face value and ran with it (see here for example), Bojanowski and Spiegel took the time to check the facts and consulted other polar experts on the matter before irresponsibly spreading fear among the public. Bojanowski cites other (warmist) polar scientists and discovers that they have strong doubts about the latest PIK scare scenario. The chances of an “uncorking” of the Wilkes Basin are purely speculative. Moreover Bojanowski writes that the scenario is not even new and that the IPCC has already looked into the matter and is reserved about it. He writes:
The UN climate report (IPCC), which summarizes climate science, is reserved: Up to now the region shows no trend; the East Antarctic ice appears stable.”
Bojanowski writes that a significant warm-up of the East Antarctic sea would be needed for the PIK drama to occur.
He also contacted Heinrich Miller of the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Ocean Research (AWI) and asked him about the PIK scenario. Bojanowski quotes Miller in the Spiegel piece:
It would necessitate a change in ocean circulation so that considerably warmer water would be led to the coast.”

Bojanowski then points out:
Currently the opposite is occurring: sea ice is expanding.”
Bojanowski also writes of the uncorking: “the study leaves open on how this would happen”.
Of course Spiegel writes that the scenario can’t be ruled out entirely because a melting of the East Antaractic has occurred before in history, such as “during the Pliocene and Miocene“.
But even Miller adds here:
Unfortunately there’s a lack of data on the deposits that would allow us to draw conclusions on whether such melts have happened already before.”
Bojanowski concludes:
You can’t get such data by running computer simulations, rather only by boring on site in the icy cold of East Antarctica.”
Indeed. This is just a nice way of saying science begins with observations and real data, and not by putting your run-away fantasies in computer code.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLast week I wrote how an expert government committee recommended scrapping Germany’s once widely ballyhooed EEG renewable energy feed-in act.
Photo: Dr. Klaus-Peter Krause. Source: freiewelt.net
Today at the Freie Presse here economics expert and veteran journalist Dr. Klaus-Peter Krause slams the EEG act, saying “it belongs in the dustbin”: “Too expensive, and too unstable.”
Increasingly as energy poverty in Germany mounts, companies close their factories due to soaring electricity prices, power supply becomes too unstable, and one renewable energy company after another bite the dust, the pressure for the government to scrap renewable energies is growing. Yet the German government obstinately refuses to admit it the act is mortally flawed.
Krause writes that although the share of renewable energy in Germany’s energy-mix has increased, “it has done so at an enormous cost.” According to Krause the costs of the feed-in subsidies have risen form €883 million per year in 2000 to a whopping €23 billion in 2013. Meanwhile over the same period the share of renewable energy rose from 7% to 23%.
Worse, Krause writes that the EEG law has done nothing to reduce CO2 emissions across Europe. Germany’s coal consumption has actually risen over the last few years. “The EEG has not delivered more climate protection, rather only higher electricity costs.” Krause cites Prof. Helmut Alt of the University of Aachen, who calls the EEG act “the most gigantic subsidy law of the postwar period.”

Krause also believes that the EEG act is dividing the country:
The EEG act has created a two-class society of those exploiting the act, and the losers. Those exploiting it are going all out in securing their financial advantage.“
Krause ends by quoting a government official who wishes not to be named:
 The EEG must be regarded as an instrument of abuse by state power and especially contradicts the social-civic responsibility of the legislators.”

Duhamel writes:
The good professor Turney, wanted to show how global warming was affecting the planet.  He apparently had visions of clear sailing, but he picked a year in which Antarctic sea ice reached one of the highest expanses ever recorded. […]
Gosselin writes that ‘the expedition was designed to generate lots of publicity.’  And it has, just not the kind the expedition leaders had in mind. […]
That failure put people in danger for a publicity stunt. […]

In essence, this expedition was trapped by a preconceived, but false, perception of global warming.
Let us make no mistake about this expedition. A major part of it was indeed to stoke up global warming publicity. It is not for nothing four journalists were on board, among them two from the Guardian and one from the BBC.
And again today Andrew Revkin of the New York Times at Twitter refers to Turney’s expedition as a “fiasco”.
Also NatGeo throws Turney under the bus: natgeo-antarctica-ship-ice-trapped-1.

Share this...FacebookTwitterVeteran German journalist Ulli Kulke of Die Welt writes a summary of 2013 in terms of the global warming debate at his blog donnerunddoria.welt.de. He concludes: “Once again evidence has mounted that we are slowly but surely departing from the view of a global apocalypse.”
On 2013 global temperature, Kulke writes:
We will hear that 2013 was one of the ten warmest years of recent history (probably one of the seven warmest). And with great certainty the following will be concluded from all this: This is proof that global warming is galloping unhindered, if not accelerating. But according to the statistics this is not the case at all, especially the latter. It cannot be emphasized enough: One of the ‘ten warmist’ or ‘seven warmest’ in fact shows that global warming has reached a relatively high level, but also that the dynamic for a further warming has halted, at least for the time being. […]
In the meantime there’s another observation that has been officially recognized. Even the IPCC confirmed in its fifth assessmernt report from last September: There has been no statistically significant warming in the last one and half decades. […]
Thus global warming has stopped – and has done so even while CO2 emissions have increased unhindered.”
2013 was a blow to the credibility of climate models and CO2 sensitivity. Kulke:
It was just last year – and regrettably this was kept away from the public’s attention – that many scientific peer reviewed papers appeared in scientific journals showing that CO2’s effect on the climate, its ‘climate sensitivity’, had previously been estimated to be much too high.”
2013 saw the death of the science that claimed CO2 is causing more storms. Kulke writes:
Here there are no indications that the number or intensity of hurricanes and typhoons have increased over the last decades. Quite to the contrary. The tendency is, for both strength and frequency, significantly less, as shown by this compilation umistakably shows. Also the last 2013 report from the IPCC: The authors downgraded the statements on the probability with respect to the previous report of 2007.”

And 2013 saw another grand climate conference failure in Warsaw:
No one expected there would be an agreement on a binding reduction of CO2 emissions. And of course there wasn’t. What a surprise…just like every year before. […]
Once again what became clear in Warsaw: In the end it’s not really about CO2 emissions – it’s mostly about money and a redistribution from North To South.”
Also Kulke writes it is very clear that in countries like Canada, Japan, Russia, Great Britain and Germany have been sending out loud signals that their enthusiasm about climate protection is waning.
The list of naysayer countries has gotten considerably longer.”
Kulke adds that even climate refugees seeking asylum from sea level rise were turned away:
All that remains to be mentioned for 2013 is the court case in New Zealand where a citizen of the Pacific island nation of Kiribati attempted to be recognized as a a climate refuges because his island nation is supposedly going under. The judge threw out the case – mainly due to formal reasons. That’s a pity because she could have provided the Polynesian with a real factual reason: namely that the islands of his nation are not going under. Quite to the contrary in the last 50 years the islands are growing, as you can read about it here.”
2013 was in fact so bad that even after almost everyone had closed the books on the year and unanimously called it a knockout for the skeptics, 2013 delivered two other massive bonus blows that left the warmists reeling at the very end of the year: the Chris Turney Antarctic expedition debacle and the record North American cold wave. These last-second blows are carrying well into the year 2014.
Never has a new year started off so well for the skeptics. The debate tipping point is steadily getting closer.

=====================================
The Sun in January 2014 and News of the Sun’s Polar Field
By Frank Bosse
(Translated, edited by P Gosselin)
Over the last month solar cycle 24 (SC24) has seen some rather brisk activity. The sunspot number (SSN) reached a value of 82.0, which however was only 77% of the normal value (106) for the 62nd month into a cycle. The southern hemisphere (SH) contributed to most of the overall result in January, outperforming the northern hemisphere (NH) 61:21. The following graphic depicts current activity (in red) and normal activity (in blue):

Figure 1: The course of SC24 in relation to the mean value of all observed cycles.
The figure also shows SC5 in light red. SC5 has some degree of similarity to the current cycle so far. The next figure shows a comparison of the acti9vity of each indiviual cycle after 62 months into the cycle with little changing over the past few months:

Figure 2: Accumulated SSN anomalies of the cycles.
The chart depicts the anomaly of the accumulated sunspots for each cycle 1-24, from the mean value for month 62 into the cycle. SC24 began in December 2008.
So what is the activity determined by and are there indicators for the strength of the upcoming cycle? There is a lot of thought going on over this question. The favorite indicator is the strength of the polar magnetic field during the minimum between 2 cycles.
One of the very good predictions was developed by Leif Svalgaard already at the end of 2004 when he pegged the current cycle would be the weakest in the last 100 years. His 3-month smoothed maximum SSN of 75, which was derived from observations of the sun’s polar field, matches up very well to the present counts.
Since this has been confirmed, polar magnetic fields of the sun are recognized early indicators. At Stanford University they are being measured with great meticulousness and have been on the decline since recording began in 1976.

Figure 3: Polar fields of the sun since 1976, source.
Here we see that the field always reverses at the cycles’ maxima, and that it reaches a maximum when during the minimum of a cycle. The theory on this: The remnants of sunspots drift to each of the poles of the NH and SH (they do not cross the solar equator) and they provide for the reversal of the polar field. It’s a sort of see-saw that has been in steady decline since the SC21/SC22 minimum. Thus, pole reversal is a result of the activity of the ongoing cycle. Data can be downloaded from the above mentioned source. Our main interest is aimed at the behavior at the maximum, i.e. pole reversal. Here we evaluate the smoothed data of the magnetic field and the following diagram is yielded:

Figure 4: Polar solar magnetic field (in centi-Gauss) at the maxima of cycles 21-24. 
The data for the period of 30 days before until 30 after crossing the zero-point were evaluated and they determine the slope of the quite linear behavior. Also here falling activity is very well depicted. If we set 1980 equal to 100%, then it drops in 1990 to 51%, to 43% in 2000, and to only 22% in 2013. Not only the maximum magnitude of the polar magnetic field at the cycle minimum for sunspots has always gotten less over the last 30 years, but so has the speed of the pole reversal during the periods of SSN maxima!
So what’s with the polar field? That we are witnessing an especially weak effect is also depicted by the following diagram, which shows the course of the first 320 days after pole reversal:

Figure 5: The course of the unsmoothed data of the polar field after pole reversal.
What we see is a record: After almost one year since pole reversal, we have once again reached a zero-point, which was measured on January 12, 2014. Never has such a behavior been recorded since the beginning of data recording.
Could this delayed build-up of the polar field be an indication of the strength of the SSN minimum in about 5 years? This magnitude is namely the first predictor for the upcoming SC25. Looking at the data shown here, should we expect a Maunder-like “grand minimum” beginning in 2020? To date all indications point to low numbers…surprises cannot be excluded!

"I am now 68 years of age but when I was 21, in my final year at university, I became aware of major problems then facing the world – war, poverty, acid rain, ozone depletion, desertification, deforestation, species loss, civil and military uses and abuses of nuclear power, pollution, population growth, consumerism and the climate crisis. I was determined to devote my life to helping solve these problems. After spending three years in Cameroon, learning about deforestation for timber and cash crops such as palm oil, and the exploitation of the rich resources of Africa to the detriment of locals and enrichment of corporations and western societies, I returned home to the nuclear weapons crisis of the cold war. I joined the Greenham Common protests, founded the Snowball civil disobedience campaign and then later the anti-nuclear weapons group Trident Ploughshares. I also became involved in work on the climate crisis. I learned that everything is connected and that it all has an impact on the climate, on biodiversity and on the sustainability of life on Earth. I discovered more about how our reliance on fossil fuels was causing the greenhouse effect and soon joined with climate scientists and local environmentalists to start a group in Norwich that tried to educate the public.  We put up maps showing how much of East Anglia and London would be under water as temperatures soared and the sea levels rose. This was in the early 1980s. We concentrated on what individuals could do to lower their carbon footprints – by putting up solar panels, changing lightbulbs, practising recycling and re-use, eating less meat, using public transport, shopping carefully and locally, and consuming less. After discovering the impact that UK timber imports were having on the loss of old-growth forests and their biodiversity, I even got involved in carbon sinks and sustainable forest management. I worked with major UK timber importers to persuade them to stop importing timber stolen from indigenous reserves in South America and Asia. But of course individuals changing their personal lifestyles was not enough. Governments had to get involved and make systemic changes. However, very few people and governments listened to us. We were Cassandras, considered doom-mongers, nihilists, mad. But if governments had acted then, we would not be at crisis point now. I cannot really understand why those in power have refused to act. After all, it is their world, too. I know politicians are relentlessly lobbied by the extractive industries, that there is a revolving door from politics and the civil service to the oil and aviation industries. But when our society and ecosystem collapses around us, none of us will be able to eat, drink, or breathe money. We know what to do to tackle the climate crisis, but it is not being done. Yet to be depressed and to lose all hope only makes the problem worse. I am fearful for the future for myself, for my family and for all living creatures on this fragile planet. I believe there is a real and substantial threat to all our lives and that, in accordance with the science, urgent and systemic changes to our society must be taken now to mitigate the danger. Over the past 40 years I have tried everything I could think of to create the changes necessary to combat the climate emergency and prevent catastrophic collapse. That is why I took part in a peaceful road blockade in April with Extinction Rebellion, as a result of which I was convicted this week of a public order offence. I believed our action could persuade our government to implement three demands to help save our world for future generations. First, to tell the truth by declaring a climate and ecological emergency and to work with other institutions to communicate the urgency for change. Second, to act now to halt biodiversity loss and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by 2025. Third, to go beyond politics and be led by the decisions of a citizens’ assembly on climate and ecological justice. Following the wave of actions in London that began on 15 April, I believe that the necessity of our work, and its success in raising the alarm, are now widely acknowledged.  Like most people, I do not like being arrested. I did not want to spend three days in police cells refusing what I considered to be unreasonable bail conditions preventing me from returning to the protests. I do not enjoy spending time in courts, nor do I wish to spend scarce resources travelling from Wales to London for the hearings. If the government had done its job of acting in the public interest by providing people with honest information about the scale and urgency of the threat, if it had addressed the threat instead of compounding it, I would not have needed to engage in nonviolent direct action. Even though I did refuse to move when asked to by a policeman, I believed I was justified in remaining at the protest and taking part in what I considered to be a reasonable and proportionate response to the climate emergency. I believed that my action, alongside many of the thousands gathered in London that week, would help avoid disaster and lead to change. And this has been proved to be true. It has opened up a space for real debate about the climate emergency and what practical actions can be taken. Wales became the first country to formally declare a climate emergency. A few days later, the UK government declared a climate and environmental emergency. I have been involved in persuading my own town council in Knighton, Powys, to declare a climate emergency and to hold public meetings to decide what practical actions can be taken. I believe that this would not have happened without the creative disruption we caused in central London. Given that our fragile planet is undergoing a climate crisis that will soon culminate in chaos and massive loss of life, I had to do all in my power to bring about the necessary changes to prevent this catastrophe. I hope you will agree that what I did was a reasonable, proportionate and necessary response to the emergency situation we are in. • This is an edited extract of Angie Zelter’s statement at Hendon magistrates court on 25 June. She was found guilty of a minor public order offence and given a conditional discharge"

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s WirtschaftsWoche here (Business Week) reports on German steel and engineering giant ThyssenKrupp’s reaction to rising renewable energy costs, warning that “unless the correct decisions are made concerning renewable electricity, Germany as a location for steel production is in jeopardy.”
ThyssenKrupp is struggling to keep its steel-making operations alive in Germany in the face of skyrocketing energy costs owing to renewable energies, and joins the list of endangered German industries in the famous Ruhr Region, home to heavy industries such as steel and coal-fired power production. The statement by ThysssenKrupp aims “to increase the pressure on the German government,” WirtschaftsWoche writes.
According to Chief Financial Officer Guido Kerkhoff, the company is reeling from hefty losses of almost 8.3 billion euros incurred over the last 3 years, most coming from its US operations.
Although the company is still eking out profits in Germany, much of that is due to the company’s partial exemption from having to pay the feed-in tariffs for renewable energy. But the exemption is being seriously challenged in Brussels on the grounds that it represents an unfair competitive advantage, and thus may be revoked. WirtschaftsWoche quotes ThyssenKrupp’s CEO Heinrich Hiesinger, who in an interview with the Düsseldorf based Rheinische Post said:
Last year ThyssenKrupp paid out 85 million euros in renewable energy feed-in surcharges. If we had had to pay the full feed-in amount, it would have meant a burden of 350 million euros for us.“ That’s more than what the company earns in its European steel plants. As a comparison, in the fiscal year 2012/13, the company earned before interest and taxes (EBIT) 62 million euros.”
Industry is sending a loud and clear message to German lawmakers. Even North Rhine Westphalia’s socialist Minister president Hannelore Kraft is getting the message. Flashback: Read here.

"This past Saturday, I was among hundreds of activists with the group Extinction Rebellion NYC who protested outside the New York Times headquarters in midtown Manhattan to demand better coverage of the climate crisis. Protesters lay down on Eighth Avenue, staging a “die-in” to block traffic. We draped a banner the length of the Times building that declared, “Climate Emergency = Mass Murder”. Sixty-seven of us got arrested. Somewhat to our surprise, our protest received a good deal of news coverage. CBS, CNN, the Guardian, and the Associated Press ran stories. The Times even published one, a Reuters dispatch that quoted a Times spokesperson defending the newspaper’s coverage. “There is no national news organization that devotes more time, staff or resources to producing deeply reported coverage to help readers understand climate change than the New York Times,” the spokesperson said.  But is even the New York Times truly conveying the climate emergency now facing humanity? And what about the many other news outlets that don’t do a fraction of the climate reporting the Times does? The media as a whole lets us down every day by either treating the climate crisis as a non-story or, worse, by propagating misinformation designed to confuse people and thwart action. Recently I learned that ABC’s World News Tonight devoted more broadcast time to the new royal baby in a week than it spent on climate change during the entire year of 2018, according to data analyzed by the watchdog group Media Matters. ABC, CBS, and NBC did not mention the words “climate change” or “global warming” once during the combined 28 news stories they ran about catastrophic flooding in the midwestern United States in March. Which is why I and countless other young people around the world will be climate-striking against the news media this coming Friday – protesting outside TV, radio, newspaper and other news outlets to demand that they start covering climate crisis like the emergency that it is. With a few valuable exceptions, most of the media has a long way to go before they can claim to responsibly cover the climate story. Schoolchildren around the world have been skipping class on Fridays to stage climate strikes for nearly a year now, yet most news outlets continue to devote more attention to trivial topics than to the existential crisis that threatens to make this planet uninhabitable in the course of my lifetime. I agree with the Swedish teenager who started the climate strike movement, Greta Thunberg, who says that if the media were reporting responsibly on the climate crisis “we would rarely talk about anything else. As soon as you turn on the TV, almost everything would be about that: headlines, radio, newspapers.” I am 14 years old; Greta is 16. The climate crisis will most powerfully affect our generation and the generations after us, and scientists have repeatedly warned that humanity is running out of time to avoid the worst impacts. Last October, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change declared that we had just 12 years to slash greenhouse gas emissions by half or else lock in a future of hellish temperatures, catastrophic droughts and storms, and millions of deaths. But how can we get the necessary political and economic response to this emergency when so few people know the full truth? During the many Fridays I have sat outside UN headquarters in New York City on climate strike, I have been bombarded by comments from people who don’t understand why I am striking. Many of them “adult-splain” falsehoods and misinformation to me, nonsense that I suspect they learned from media reports. We will never get the action we need to save our planet when most people still don’t know there is a crisis to begin with. This is why my fellow activists and I have decided that we must extend our climate strikes from our initial target – governments, with their power to implement different policies – to the news media, whose reporting shapes the public mood and therefore the potential public pressure against those governments. This Friday, I will be striking outside Fox News headquarters in New York City because Fox’s coverage of the climate crisis is especially terrible. Unlike the other broadcast networks, Fox doesn’t practice climate silence. It does something worse: it spreads climate misinformation – for example, by reporting as fact the lie that the well-established science linking greenhouse gas emissions with rising temperatures is unfounded. When the US Senate was about to vote on the Green New Deal last March, Fox aired more than twice as many prime-time segments discussing the Green New Deal as MSNBC and CNN combined. But Fox’s coverage was full of climate denial talking points, including absurd suggestions that the Green New Deal would get rid of cows and cost a stratospheric $93tn. So I’m calling on fellow youth climate strikers the world over to join me in targeting any irresponsible news outlets in their communities on 28 June. We must send a message that it is past time to make coverage of the climate emergency an urgent and continuing priority. If you are a reporter or other news outlet representative, I urge you to not only cover these strikes, but cover the climate crisis as well! Report on the science, the climate models, the economic and social impacts, the biodiversity loss and, above all, the Green New Deal and other solutions to the climate crisis that we’re not talking enough about. The world needs to wake up to the climate crisis, and the media needs to remember that it is supposed to function as society’s alarm clock. At the moment, too many news outlets are letting humanity sleep through our planet’s impending catastrophe. Isn’t it time they woke more of us up? Alexandria Villaseñor is the 14-year-old founder of Earth Uprising International and lives in New York City, where she strikes every Friday in front of the United Nations headquarters, demanding world leaders take action on the climate crisis. This article is being co-published by the Nation, the Columbia Journalism Review and the Guardian as part of Covering Climate Now, a project to catalyze improved media coverage of the climate crisis."

It appears the US national weather services are right on their heels when it comes to who can make the all-time least accurate outlooks.
And we’re supposed to believe these people when it comes to their climate forecasting?
At this week’s Weatherbell Saturday Summary here, Joe Bastardi puts up the results of how well the NOAA winter outlook issued last fall ended up doing.
Here’s what their outlook called for:
Note how they said the chances for normal temperatures were about even for much of the country and warm down south. Averaging it out: a moderately warmer than normal winter. Today we see that the Midwest is having one of its harshest winters in decades and that the Great Lakes are almost completely frozen over.
Here’s how the winter has been so far:

One couldn’t be more wrong even if he tried like hell to be so.

 Weatherbell’s outlook for winter 2013/14. Source: Weatherbell.
Weatherbell pretty much nailed it dead on.
Unfortunately, the outlook situation for this winter by the same US weather services is just as sorrowful for Europe. Last fall some German meteorologists, basing their outlooks on charts from the US weather services, were warning of strong chances that the winter would “be really cold“. But instead of a brutal cold winter, Europe is now ending up with one of its mildest ever. The opposite is what has actually happened.
I think taxpayers and citizens deserve much more than getting information that is constantly turning out to be consistently wrong – for both weather and climate outlooks. We’re getting sick of it. How about getting some competent people back into these organizations for once?
With private meteorologists, we at least have the option of firing them. But with the state weather offices, we have to put up with their screw ups and keep hearing that we’re just deniers whenever we lift a finger and that we ought to just keep quiet. And if that weren’t bad enough, at NASA GISS they are even altering and rewriting the temperature history in a twisted desperate effort to make their faulty forecasts appear correct!
To Joe’s credit, he says we ought to respect the people at the US weather services for their work.
But I don’t – not anymore. What for? I guy flipping a coin would do a far better job.

"European cities are taking exceptional steps to limit the impact of a historic early summer heatwave as temperatures across the continent approached monthly and, in some places, all-time records. Authorities have warned that temperatures could pass 40C and reach 45C in parts of the continent by Saturday as a plume of hot air moves north from the Sahara, sucked northwards by a stalled storm over the Atlantic and high pressure in central Europe.  In Germany, where the 38.6C recorded on Wednesday in Coschen, near the Polish border, exceeded the country’s previous June high, officials imposed a 120km/h speed limit on stretches of the Saxony-Anhalt autobahn as the road surface began to deteriorate, while rail tracks buckled near Rostock on the Baltic Sea. Weil wir #sprachlos sind 😅: Wie würden Sie dieses Bild betiteln?Als kleine Inspirationshilfe - ein #Zitat des Herren: „Et is halt warm, wa?“ Und jetzt Sie!#Hitze #safetyfirst #LebenAmLimit pic.twitter.com/BiM27ydDEy In Brandenburg, police said they were “speechless” as a man was stopped riding his moped naked, and after guards caused uproar in Munich by ordering a group of women to put their bikini tops back on, the city council was set to debate a by-law change to allow topless bathing. Schools in parts of France, meanwhile – where an all-time heat record of 44.1C could be beaten on Friday – were expected to remain closed until the end of the week, while authorities in Paris, Lyon, Strasbourg and Marseille banned older cars from entering their city centres to combat pollution. Is this a record-breaking heatwave? Temperature records for this time of year have already been broken across much of Europe. The highest ever June temperatures were recorded in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria, Andorra, Luxembourg, Poland and Germany, while France registered an all-time record high of 45.9C. Why is it so hot? The latest heatwave, caused by an “omega block” – a high-pressure pattern that blocks and diverts the jet stream, allowing a mass of hot air to flow up from northern Africa and the Iberian peninsula – follows a similar extreme weather event last month that made it the hottest June on record. Is this heatwave a result of climate breakdown? It is not possible to pin the heatwave definitively on climate change because weather varies naturally. Moreover, the effects of climate change are not simple. For example, heavy rain and cloud across northern Europe is likely to become more common as the buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes the jet stream weather system to become fixed in position. However, this year’s weather is certainly in line with the predictions scientists have made of rising temperatures, more heatwaves and prolonged droughts interspersed with periods of heavy flooding. What are the negative impacts of a heatwave? The body’s ability to regulate its own temperature is crucial; babies and older people are less well able to regulate their temperature and should stay in well-ventilated conditions. In the 2003 European heatwave there were about 70,000 excess deaths attributed to the long hot spell. People with underlying illnesses can also have problems, and even those who are healthy can experience difficulty sleeping and discomfort, so people are advised to stay hydrated and wear loose clothing at night. There is also an impact on farmers. While warmth at the right time is crucial for crop growth, excessively high temperatures can inhibit that growth, particularly if they are prolonged. Livestock can also suffer in the heat and need extra care. Fiona Harvey Environment correspondent Regional Île-de-France authorities estimated the measure would affect nearly 60% of vehicles circulating around the French capital, including delivery vans and trucks, and many cars older than 10 years, which have higher emissions than newer models. With temperatures in Milan forecast to hit 40C, charities were preparing to distribute 10,000 bottles of free water to the homeless and other people in need, while 33 of Spain’s 50 provinces will be facing record-breaking temperatures, which could reach 44C. Innsbruck’s famous “fiaker” carriage horses were taken off the streets as the city recorded 36.7C, breaking the 2012 record for Tyrol state of 36.6C. Three people, including two in their 70s, died in southern France after suffering heart attacks and other problems while swimming. French authorities have warned of the dangers of diving into cold water in very hot conditions, but there was no immediate confirmation the deaths were related to the heatwave. In Poland, the interior ministry said 90 people have drowned so far this month trying to cool off in lakes or rivers, and in Lithuania 27 people were reported to have died in similar circumstances as temperatures in the Baltic state soared above 35C. Strong winds and high temperatures helped fan a forest fire in Catalonia, in Spain, which destroyed some 2,500 hectares of land. Hundreds of firefighters and 14 water-dropping aircraft were battling the blaze on Wednesday night. Scientists have said Europe’s 2019 heatwave, like last year’s, was closely linked to the climate emergency and that such extreme weather events will be many times more likely over the coming decades."

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf you think things couldn’t get more absurd with Germany’s Energiewende, think again.
The German Bundesverbandes der Energie- und Wasserwirtschaft (Federal Association of Energy and Water Management) or BDEW, released its latest report on electricity production in Germany. The BDEW represents about 1800 companies of the energy and power sector.
Germany burns more coal, emits more CO2!
According to the German Press Agency (dpa), the BDEW reports coal power plants provided 45.5% of Germany’s electric power needs in 2013 compared to 44% in 2012. That’s an increase of more than 3%. Although Germany has invested hundreds of billions in green energy, CO2 emissions are rising. In 2013 renewable energy provided 23.4% of Germany’s electricity needs, up from 22.8% in 2012.
Natural gas, often considered a reliable alternative to coal and nuclear, fell in Germany from 12.1% to 10.5% German power companies say natural gas is too expensive. The dpa writes that “the share of electricity produced by burning lignite reached the highest level since 1990.”
German onshore wind power faces cuts

Solar energy’s share, despite billions in investments, only rose from 4.2% to 4.5%. Wind power production in Germany took a hit in 2013. Its share of German power was only 7.9% in 2013 compared to 8.0% in 2012 (a drop of 3.5%). The BDEW says this was due to the weather (less windy than 2012). Overall wind power in Germany is facing new hurdles. The dpa reports:
Energy Minister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) wants to present a framework for a more affordable Energiewende by Easter – foremost subsidies for wind turbines onshore may be cut back.”
Cold weather foils Germany’s fight against global warming
For whatever reason the Süddeutsche zeitung left out the following from the dpa:
The increasing CO2 emissions that threaten Germany’s climate targets are traced back, according to Müller, foremost to the long heating season at the start of 2013 and the falling share of gas.
In other words: Cold weather foiled Germany’s fight against global warming in 2013.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAfter Monday’s April Fool’s release of the IPCC WGII SPM and the subsequent gasps of horror coming as a reaction from top government officials, you’d think little time would be wasted in taking clear, decisive actions to “protect the climate”. Recall how the situation is urgent and that decisive, immediate action needs to be taken quickly!
It turns out that the gasps of horror were mere show – designed to appease green activists. In reality, it turns out governments really aren’t that alarmed by the IPCC’s science and don’t take it that seriously after all. As you are about to read, actions speak much louder than words, no matter how quietly and discreetly the actions are carried out.
The German DPA press agency has just released a report: EU postpones climate fees on international flights until 2017.
“Climate protection”, no matter how urgent it is said to be, will just have to wait.
For a number of years the European Commission threatened to force all airlines flying into, out of, and over Europe to pay carbon emission charges, or else face being locked out of it’s busy airspace. Background info: here, here, here and here. But countries like the USA, Russia, China protested loudly and threatened to retaliate massively.
Brussels shoots kneecaps of European airlines
Today the DPA announces that Brussels has backed off and decided to postpone charging international airlines for emission permits until 2017. News of this loss of face is being buried in the back pages of the internet and media outlets. But Internet site CO2 Handel here writes:

In the view of the aviation industry, the postponement is only going to be a burden on the airlines in Europe. The president of the German Association of Aviation (BDL), Klaus-Peter Siegloch, spoke of a European-island-solution. ‘It distorts competition, does not help the climate, and weakens the aviation companies in Europe.'”
What better present could foreign, non-European airlines possibly dream of. Now they have a nice competitive advantage – served to them on a silver platter, courtesy of Brussels.
The Greens are fuming – not because of the unfair competition, but because Europe has decided once again that the climate isn’t really that much in trouble. It can wait, after all.
European green Parliamentarian Rebecca Harms of Germany called the move “irresponsible”:
Originally the law was supposed to cover one third of the global aviation emissions. It’s lunacy to considerably weaken this effective climate protection instrument now.”
The move to postpone this “effective climate protection instrument” just goes to show you what Europe really thinks of the IPCC’s latest warnings. Not much!

"Twenty candidates – ten candidates per night – will take the stage during this week’s two-part Democratic primary debates. Each debate will last two hours, and, excluding introductions and interruptions, each candidate will have roughly 12 minutes of total speaking time. How much of that can we reasonably expect to be devoted to the climate crisis? If past debates are any indication, not much. There were no direct questions about climate change posed in either the 2012 or 2016 debates. In refusing grassroots calls for a debate focused on climate change, Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez has promised this time would be different. In a Medium post composed after backlash to his decision, Perez wrote that he considers climate a top issue, and “made clear to our media partners that the issue of climate change must be featured prominently in our debates”. Given that network news spent more time covering the Royal Baby in one week than they’d spent in a year on climate change, that’s not exactly a convincing sell. If the DNC really did care about climate as much as Perez claims, it’d see the debate stage as a chance to offer a valuable counter-weight to the relative silence across television news about the climate crisis.  Why, moreover, would the DNC let such an opportunity go to waste? As the Trump administration continues to deny the basic reality of climate change – with some even cheering it on – fully owning the climate challenge as their own could be a boon for Democrats. Recent European parliament elections saw a flood of voters to the European Greens, as the climate crisis emerged as a top concern for many on the heels of massive Fridays for Future demonstrations and Extinction Rebellion in the UK. Climate fears are beginning to take hold of voters in the United States as well, and the DNC would be stupid to not capitalize on the fact that their party is the only one with any nominal claim to be taking the potential end of the world seriously. If the DNC isn’t going to take advantage of that fact, then Democratic presidential hopefuls should. When candidate Jay Inslee inquired about doing a special climate-themed debate, the DNC threatened to bar him and any other candidate who participated from the official primary debates. Why not dare them to try? Given the anti-establishment mood of many voters, it could play well for independents to stick it to the stingy party apparatus. Virtually every front-runner except for Joe Biden has backed the idea of a Green New Deal, and even he has called it a “crucial framework”. Fifteen have also supported the idea of a climate debate. If climate change really does matter to them, then the coherent move would be to rebel against the DNC and give voters a chance to hear their thoughts on the greatest existential threat facing humanity. With Republican leaders like Mitch McConnell and Matt Gaetz already starting to come around on climate, Democrats’ homefield advantage on the issue may not last long. A climate debate shouldn’t be about haggling over targets and degrees and parts per million, but about the full scope of what the challenge actually entails. From housing to immigration to healthcare, there’s no policy field which won’t be touched by rising temperatures in the coming decades. Contra Perez, the climate crisis isn’t an “issue” so much as the foundations on which all politics is going to play out. Making that a core concern for the party is an opportunity for Democrats to do something they haven’t in a very long time: present a plan for how to make people’s lives better. What candidates can bring forward – or fail to – is a vision for what a fairer and more democratic low-carbon world could look like, most thoroughly articulated so far by advocates for a Green New Deal. Promising to be better than Trump on climate is no recipe for the kind of rapid decarbonization required to save our collective skins. A climate debate, as such, should try to accomplish a relatively simple goal: to make candidates explain as succinctly as possible their plans to keep warming below 2C or less, and deal with the effects of whatever level of warming we do get. Leading climate scientists and energy experts can pore over the candidates’ answers in the days and weeks afterward, and evaluate how far each candidate’s plan will actually get us toward that goal. Then voters can decide whether those plans sound like they would build a world worth living in – DNC be damned. Kate Aronoff is a writing fellow at In These Times.

"The UK’s biggest carbon capture project will soon block thousands of tonnes of factory emissions from contributing to the climate crisis, by using them to help make the chemicals found in antacid, eyedrops and Pot Noodle. Within two years a chemical plant in Cheshire could keep 40,000 tonnes of carbon from the air every year, or the equivalent of removing 22,000 cars from the UK’s roads. The plant’s owners, a division of the Indian-owned Tata conglomerate, will then use the captured carbon to make the chemicals found in glass, baking soda or even medicine. The project is a step-change in the UK’s battle to cut carbon emissions from heavy industry and will capture more than 100 times the carbon dioxide trapped by an existing trial at the Drax power plant in North Yorkshire. The plans are backed by the government, which has agreed to give Tata Chemicals Europe a £4.2m grant towards the £16.7m cost of the project. Drax will receive a £5m government grant for a pilot, which could keep up to 16m tonnes of carbon from the air by the mid-2020s. In total the government plans to spend £26m to spur nine carbon capture projects which are “essential” if the UK hopes to reach its goal of cutting carbon emissions to net-zero by 2050. It is also spending £170m to create a net zero carbon “industrial cluster” in the UK by 2040. Carbon capture effectively traps the emissions from power plants or factory flues before they enter the atmosphere and contribute to global heating. The trapped carbon dioxide could be piped into permanent underground storage facilities, but it can also be purified to make products. Tata plans to refine the carbon emissions to make a high-grade liquid version of carbon dioxide which will help make sodium bicarbonate, or baking soda. The company is the only UK-based maker of baking soda which is in high demand by the pharmaceutical sector to help treat conditions from heartburn to kidney disease. It is also found in ear and eye drops. Tata is also the only company in the UK which produces soda ash, or sodium carbonate, which is used to make detergents, lemon sherbet power and glass. Martin Ashcroft, head of Tata Chemicals Europe, said the “hugely exciting” project would help to “reduce our carbon emissions, whilst securing supplies of a critical raw material”. Tata also owns one of India’s biggest energy companies and has promised to end investment in coal plants to focus of wind and solar power. Chris Skidmore, the minister for energy and clean growth, said: “Cutting edge technology to capture carbon will cut emissions as we work towards a net zero economy, while creating new jobs – a key part of our modern industrial strategy.”"

"Plastics are among the most ubiquitous materials in our economy, our lives, and our environment. They are also among the most pervasive and persistent pollutants on Earth. In recent years, stark images of beaches, waterways and wildlife filled with plastic have spurred demands for action to address plastic pollution. These calls are coupled with growing concern that plastic and its toxic additives pose serious risks to human health at every stage of the plastic lifecycle. Far less attention has been paid to the impacts of this same lifecycle on the Earth’s climate. This is a dangerous oversight. From catastrophic wildfires in California to searing heatwaves and record drought in India, the scale and growing severity of the climate crisis are undeniable. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns that humanity must limit warming below 1.5C or face far greater and potentially irreversible climate chaos. To achieve this, we must cut global emissions 45% by 2030 and reach zero net emissions by 2050. A recent report by the Center for International Environmental Law and partners shows that plastic’s rapidly rising emissions put these critical goals at risk. In 2019, plastic production and incineration will add over 850m metric tons of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere – equivalent to the emissions from 189 coal-fired power plants. By 2050, these emissions could rise to 2.8bn metric tons, equivalent to 615 new coal plants. Why are these emissions growing so rapidly? Because plastics are made almost entirely from fossil fuels. Natural gas, oil and coal account for 99% of what goes into plastic. Thus, plastic’s climate impacts begin not in the oceans, but at the wellheads and drillpads where plastic is born. Moreover, refining those raw materials into plastic is among the most energy- and carbon-intensive of all industrial processes. In 2015, just 24 ethylene facilities in the United States emitted as much carbon dioxide as 3.8m passenger vehicles. Globally fracking to produce ethylene produced as many emissions as 45m passenger vehicles. If growth continues on its present trajectory, plastics could creat 56bn metric tons in greenhouse emissions by 2050 The North American fracking boom is poised to make this situation much worse. Fueled by cheap fracked gas, Exxon, Shell and other petrochemical producers are massively expanding the infrastructure for making plastic. The American Chemistry Council projects that the industry will invest over $200bn in more than 330 new or expanded facilities by 2025. Just one of these facilities, a massive ethane cracker being built by Shell in Pennsylvania, could emit up to 2.25m tons of CO2 yearly. Nor do emissions end once plastic’s useful life is over. While the carbon emissions associated with recycling are minimal, less than 9% of plastic is recycled annually. Effective recycling rates are lower still. As indicated by China’s recent ban on plastic waste imports, much of the plastic waste that has been sent to Asia for recycling has no economic value. It was and always has been just trash. In the face of China’s import ban, communities are increasingly turning to incineration as the way to deal with that trash. This incineration alone could add 4bn metric tons of carbon to the atmosphere by 2050. If growth continues on its present trajectory, plastic production, use and disposal could create 56bn metric tons in cumulative greenhouse emissions by 2050 – consuming a staggering 13% of the Earth’s entire remaining carbon budget. The climate impact of plastic that escapes into the environment is harder to quantify, but may be even more significant. Research demonstrates that the 57tn microplastic particles at the ocean’s surface continually release small amounts of greenhouse gases – and will continue doing so indefinitely. The climate impacts of this are difficult to quantify because those surface particles represent only a fraction of 1% of plastic in the ocean. Nor do they include the massive amounts of plastic on beaches, riverbanks and farmlands worldwide that are releasing greenhouse gases even faster. More troublingly, scientists have found that microplastics are interacting with and often negatively affecting plankton in ocean basins worldwide. These microscopic plants and animals form the foundation of ocean ecosystems and also create the biological carbon pump that makes the oceanic carbon sink function. This raises the currently unquantifiable but deeply troubling prospect that rising plastic pollution could disrupt the Earth’s largest natural carbon sink, further accelerating the climate crisis. Whether measured by its impacts on the climate, environment, or human health, the rising flood of disposable plastic creates risks humanity can no longer accept. Just as the roots of the climate and plastic crises are interlinked, so too are their solutions. Simply put, it’s time to break free from plastic. We must end the production of single-use, disposable plastic, stop the development of new oil, gas and petrochemical infrastructure, and accelerate the transition to sustainable, circular economies and zero-waste communities.

"The UK and other EU governments are in breach of international obligations by failing to be open about their policies to tackle emissions from aviation, a coalition of NGOs has said. The group is lodging a formal complaint over the secrecy surrounding regulation of emissions from international flights, which they say allows the aviation industry to be a “climate laggard”. Last year, aviation emitted 895m tonnes of carbon dioxide – 2.4% of global energy-related CO2 emissions, according to Carbon Brief. If aviation were a country it would be the sixth biggest emitter in the world.  But the UK and other EU governments are in breach of international obligations relating to the release of environmental information because they are failing to disclose details on cutting emissions, say the NGOs which are part of the International Coalition for Sustainable Aviation. The Aarhus convention, which was agreed in 1998, enshrines the right for everyone to receive environmental information held by public authorities. The parties to the convention are required to make the necessary provisions so that public authorities contribute to these rights to make them effective. The coalition of NGOs will raise its complaints on Thursday at a meeting of the working group of members of the convention in Geneva. The UK, EU and European governments are all members of the International Civil Aviation Organization, a UN body incharge of reducing the carbon footprint of international aviation. But the ICAO has been criticised for its secrecy. Its agenda and discussion documents are not released to the public or the media, and the meetings are held behind closed doors. Documents do emerge through leaks, but the ICAO rules warn participants that they face “unlimited liability for confidentiality breaches”. Andrew Murphy of the NGO Transport and Environment said the UK and others were using these rules to avoid releasing their policies, and were therefore in breach of the Aarhus convention. He said governments had failed to release their submissions to the ICAO environment committee, which meets every three and has drawn up the first scheme for international airlines to declare their emissions, known as Corsia. Murphy said: “Governments have been using this UN agency’s arcane rules to dodge their obligations under international law. They are required to be transparent in how they regulate aviation emissions. Their secrecy is one of the reasons why the airline sector remains such a climate laggard.” Under Corsia, international aircraft will this year have to start monitoring their emissions as part of ICAO measures. Central to these measures is a market-based system of purchasing emissions offsets rather than a requirement to directly reduce aircraft emissions. Air transport companies can reduce the amount of carbon emissions they have to offset by using biofuels. A final decision on the rules around what kinds of biofuels can be used was made last week at an ICAO meeting, but the policy has not been published. The Guardian asked the ICAO to release details of the policy, but the agency was not able to provide the information in time for publication. Corsia was agreed in 2016 by the 36 ICAO member countries and has taken until this year to implement. But some believe it will not have the required impact on reducing emissions produced by an aviation industry which predicts passenger numbers doubling to 8.2 billion by 2037. A spokesperson for the Department for Transport – which sends officials to ICAO meetings – said the UK did not publish official correspondence with the UN body because it is was “not an environmental organisation” and that its work involved confidential information which was commercially sensitive. “We strive for maximum transparency and recognise the importance of public access to information, which is why we are seeking to improve ICAO practices in this area,” the DfT said. “We are engaging with the ICAO and all its other member states, and will continue working to ensure our international environmental responsibilities are upheld.”  • This article was amended on 28 June 2019 to clarify that the ICAO responded to the Guardian’s request for details of the policy, but was not able to provide the information in time for publication."

Share this...FacebookTwitterMore an eight years ago Al Gore, according to Laurie David, prophesized that unless we acted immediately we had only “ten years left to save the planet from a scorching.” The ever skeptical Rush Limbaugh put up his countdown clock (see below) on January 27, 2006.

Rush Limbaugh’s countdown to a scorching clock. Cropped from: www.rushlimbaugh.com/earth_cooks
With less than 2 years away to go to the prophesized “scorching”, now is a good time to check to see how much closer we have gotten to it temperaturewise – to see if we should be making plans to move up into the Arctic.
What have global temperatures been doing since then? The chart shows: nothing!

If anything, the trend is showing a slight cooling and there are no signs of any “scorching” in sight.
Conclusion: Al Gore’s prophesy has been nothing but a hoax. And because Al Gore continues to claim to the contrary, despite what the data show, and continues to profit by perpetuating the scare, he stands accused of defrauding the public.

The idiotic UK Guardian reports today on a global warming theory of unprecedented absurdity, one fabricated with the help of crystal balls by Prof Ben Marzeion of the University of Innsbruck in Austria and Anders Levermann of the bedwetting Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. The Guardian writes:
Marzeion said that by looking at sea level rises over such a long timespan – 2000 years – such short-term uncertainties would be smoothed out. His co-author, Anders Levermann, of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said: ‘After 2000 years, the oceans would have reached a new equilibrium state and we can compute the ice loss from Greenland and Antarctica from physical models. At the same time, we consider 2000 years a short enough time to be of relevance for the cultural heritage we cherish.'”
Meanwhile the Niagara Falls and Great Lakes freeze
Meanwhile as hysterical scientists and journalists fret over their fraudulent melting sea ice horoscopes, today we read that the Niagara Falls and the Great Lakes have frozen.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAs a whole, Europe has enjoyed a relatively very mild winter this year, as one Atlantic low after another have regularly pumped mild Atlantic air over much of the continent. But that pattern was interrupted by a blast of cold air from the East about 10 days ago. The results have been deadly.
13 die of cold in Romania
First, Spiegel here reports that 13 people have died of cold in Romania over the last week as temperatures there have dipped to -18°C. In Austria 2 people were killed in an avalanche after heavy snowfalls.
Poland hard hit
www.wetter.com site here reports that 26 people have recently been killed by the bitter cold in Poland. Since November 1, at least 52 people have died of cold in Poland. In Germany the bitter cold claimed the life of a 57-year old Saxony Anhalt man who died of hypothermia as temperatures dipped to -16°C.
Almost 60 dead in the Baltic countries

The bitter cold has also taken a severe toll in the Baltic countries. The online German language Das Baltikum-Blatt here reports that at least 58 people have died due to cold so far this winter with temperatures recently dropping to -20°C.
In Bulgaria at least 4 people have died of the cold over the last few days, so reports the online SOTT site here.
Anomaly storm and unusual cold in USA
Düsseldorf’s online RP here reports that a winter “anomaly storm” and unusual cold are now gripping the USA (a spell cast by black carbon witchcraft, no doubt).
The RP calls the current US cold snap “historic”.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSwedish climatologist and meteorologist Lennart Bengtsson, former director of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, one of the most eminent climate scientists, has joined the London-based Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF) and an impressive roster of skeptic scientists and experts.
The move has sent shock waves across the climate science community, blogosphere, and into parts of the major media, for example Spiegel.
Science journalist Axel Bojanowski at Spiegel conducted an interview with Bengtsson to find out more about the motives behind the move. What follow are some excerpts.
A need to open the debate
On why Bengsston joined the skeptical GWPF, he says that he saw a need for more debate in climate science:
I think it is important to enable a broad debate on energy and climate.”
He also felt compelled to join the GWPF because he wants to contribute his meteorological knowledge “to open the debate“.
Debate in climate science is something that has been horribly lacking and it has been the target of massive suppression and censorship efforts.
Climate science consensus is senseless
Bengsston is also harshly critical of the efforts to enforce consensus:

I see no necessity on the part of the IPCC to make efforts to usher a consensus. I think it is essential that society has areas where a consensus cannot be enforced. Especially in an area like the climate system, which is incompletely understood, a consensus is senseless.
Climate models in need of review
Another aspect swaying Bengsston to speak up has been the abject failure of climate models. In the interview Bengsston maintains that he’s a friend of climate prognoses, but that they are now due for major review in order “to secure their credibility“. He says the IPCC has not been critical enough over the models:
It is frustrating that climate science is not able to validate their simulations correctly. The warming of the Earth has been much weaker since the end of the 20th century compared to what climate models show.”
Solving problems of future generations “pointless”
Many policymakers claim that it is our generation’s responsibility to solve the problems of future generations. Bengsston characterizes this notion as senseless and pointless. To illustrate why, he asks readers to look back to 1914 and asks if it is reasonable for the people back then to solve the problems of 2014. “It would be pointless!”
On the future Bengsston says civilization…
…will require twice as much primary energy as today. We need to promote new science and technology. We need a more open approach, especially here in Europe, which includes the issues of nuclear energy and genetic engineering so that the growing world population can be supplied with energy and food.”
Policymakers instead are creating problems for future generations
Right now as Bengsston sees it, global policymakers are totally on the wrong path and they risk leaving behind a planet that will not be able to cope with the needs of future generations. In trying to solve the future problems, they are only going to succeed at causing great big ones.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s energy feed-in act is skidding out of control – and risks causing a social uprising. The power grid is becoming ever more precarious and electricity prices for consumers are at record levels. The German government, on the other hand, is reacting like a petrified deer caught in the headlights. It doesn’t know what to do.
Yesterday, Germany’s number 1 daily by circulation, BILD here, launched a campaign to get the government to take real action – to do something, and quickly!
Hat/tip: Benny Peiser
Germany’s feed-in act forces power companies to buy all energy produced by green sources (wind, solar, bio, etc), whether it’s needed or not, and to force-feed it into the power grid. Power companies are also forced to pay exorbitant prices to the green energy producers. This gross market interference is wreaking havoc on the European power markets. On windy and sunny days, huge amounts of excess energy end up getting dumped on the market and power producers incur huge losses, which of course just get passed on to the consumers.
Sometimes prices on electricity exchanges even go negative. Despite these negative or ultra low prices on the electricity exchanges, consumers are paying record prices. So distorted has the market become.
So Bild newspaper is taking action and is openly demanding the government take action. Bild presents the facts:
What’s absurd: Even when prices on the power exchanges fall (last year it fell from 4.2 to 3.6 ct/kWh), the green energy producers get their money. Effect: The cheaper electricity becomes, the more the consumers have to pay.”

This is what happens when mastermind green bureaucrats, obsessed with the fantasy of rescuing the climate, start interfering with markets with completely nutjob ideas. Bild adds:
The feed-in surcharge is the main driver behind electricity costs. Currently it represents 14 percent of the price. At the beginning of this year the surcharge jumped again by 1 cent to 6.2  cents per kilowatt-hour. A sad record!
To blame for this is a design fault in the EEG Feed-In Act. Here prices are guaranteed for the wind and solar park operators.”
No risk! Bild writes:
This guaranteed price is financed by the feed-in surcharges – paid by the consumers!
Never before have rich, large property owners seen such a risk-free bonanza. Who pays? The poor consumers who cannot afford property on which to install a windpark or solar system! Indeed every year 600,000 Germans get their power cut off because they no longer can afford the exorbitant electricity prices. This is how Germany is reducing its CO2 emissions: The poor are having to go without!

By the European Institute for Climate and Energy
Copenhagen/Hamburg: A Danish study that cost the taxpayer more than €2.6 million and supported by the freeloaders of the wind power, led by world’s largest wind turbine manufacturers Vestas, Siemens, and Vattenfall in Denmark, is to provide for a smooth and unobstructed process for wind turbine projects – without any protests.

The Danish wind industry is complaining that it is getting increasingly difficult to get citizens’ acceptance for their projects.

Thanks to the Ministry of Research and public financing, an interdisciplinary study was written by scientists from three universities from Denmark, Ireland and England and supported by representatives of those with an interest in the wind industry. The study investigated the exchange between the organizations of the wind energy opponents, covering topics such as windpark fraud, species protection, sleep disturbance and Nina Pierpont, doctors from the state of New York who researched wind turbine syndrome which causes illness owing to low frequency noise, which 30% of Swedish residents living near windparks suffer from.
The connections between 323 websites of national and international wind opposition organizations and associations were monitored and analyzed.
Just in tiny Denmark alone there are currently 200 citizens’ initiatives and associations. Worldwide there thousands of groups and associations with hundreds of affiliated initiatives.
In response the websites of wind power opponents worldwide published a graphic of the study 2050 in order to confirm their strong network structure and to make it clear that they are a force to be reckoned with. The citizens have a democratic right to transparency and participation – worldwide. Preserving nature and its biodiversity, the landscape and human health is the mutual target of this global movement.
Vestas is providing a scandal in that it continues to spread the myth there are no adverse impacts on human health from infra and low frequréncy noise, despite a recently uncovered Vestas-PPP from 2004, which indicates to the contrary: windwahn.de/skandal-in-der-sauberen-windkraftbranche.

"This is the first piece in ‘Next left: where to now for Australian progressives?’, a new series on what the election result means for the progressive side of politics and the path forward Political commentators reflexively overinterpret election results. The story we’ve been told is that the Coalition’s win means that “Australian voters” have rejected Labor’s radical plan for reform of the tax-and-spend system, confirming that Australians prefer stability and incremental change.  Yet if one in 50 (2%) had voted the other way the pundits would have junked this narrative and told us, with great authority, that by endorsing Labor’s vision “Australian voters” showed they’re ready to embrace change. One in 50 could have switched to Labor if Clive Palmer had decided to spend his $60m on a new house instead of an election. Or if Labor had chosen a more credible leader. Or if, a week before election day, a minister had been outed cheating on his expenses. Yet such a random event would then have caused the pundits to offer a sharply different analysis of the state of Australian society. Poring over the seats won and lost, analysts have observed that many people voted against their economic interests, both at the lower end and the upper end. Some electorates dominated by low- and middle-income households, especially in the regions, voted conservative even though they would have gained from Labor’s plan to rebalance the tax system to benefit low-income households. Many in the wealthiest electorates shifted to Labor even though their taxes would be higher. It’s a phenomenon noted a few years ago in the US. Donald Trump promised huge tax cuts for the rich and no change to a desperately unfair health system, yet millions of Americans on the margins voted for him. Trump duly delivered on his promises and they still support him. Labor’s inability to attract enough votes has been blamed on its unduly complicated message. Some say its marketing misfired. People were confused and so voted against their own interests. The answer is a simpler message marketed more effectively, and by a leader who is more relatable. And Labor must cut back on the promises of improving the tax-and-welfare system because voters could not understand it, or because they are prey to scare campaigns. In other words, they blame confusion for voters’ irrational behaviour. But it’s more plausible that those who vote against their economic interests are as rational as other voters; it’s just that they don’t behave according to the pundit’s mental model – in which economic interests guide rational voting behaviour. For these citizens voting is less about economics than about culture. They are voting to protect a culture, that is, a social environment and way of life made up of values, behaviours and symbols that accord with their sense of who they are and where they fit. Those in wealthy suburbs who vote against their economic interests by supporting Labor or the Greens are also voting for culture; in their case, they want to change it. The argument that “money doesn’t buy happiness” is typically attributed to the comfortable middle classes, but it can apply at the other end too. At the lower end, those who vote against their economic interests might be worse off under a conservative government, but they will feel better because of the psychic wages they receive from knowing their anxieties are being recognised and addressed. These psychic wages compensate for any decline in material living standards. Progressives often have trouble understanding that culture can trump economics and around the world they are losing elections because the power of culture is growing while they continue to speak the old language. Culture now matters more than class, which is a dilemma for progressives in the cities who support the class interests of low-income people in the regions but represent a culture that many in the regions resent. The message of Donald Trump’s slogan “Make America Great Again” was: “You’re losing the world you know, the one that gives you a firm identity, and I will bring it back.” In Australia, it’s the same sentiment that the Coalition, with the help of shock jocks and conservative commentators, has been exploiting, not least with its attacks on political correctness and defence of “religious freedom”. In regional Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania, where Labor performed very badly, the culture many identify with is a nostalgic, inward-looking one resentful towards the cities. One Nation attracted the votes of this cohort and channelled them to the Liberal and National parties. It should be remembered that low-income electorates in the big cities still voted solidly for Labor. But over the last decades a new kind of voter has emerged, one driven by cultural anxiety, who no longer feels that Australia is the country he or she grew up in. And it’s not. It’s partly due to immigration, a situation created by John Howard as much as anyone else when he allowed a huge increase in the rate of migration, making parts of Australia’s cities feel alien. Feeling like “a stranger in my own country” is perhaps stronger among those who look on from elsewhere rather than those living in it. When the New South Wales Labor leader Michael Daley was forced out of office for saying that “our kids” are fleeing Sydney and being replaced by Asian immigrants with PhDs, in many parts of Australia people felt he spoke to their anxieties – even those who can’t stomach the race-baiting of Pauline Hanson. The most articulate spokesman for the alienated “white working class” is Mark Latham, who arguably foreshadowed the Trump model. Speaking after the election, on Sky After Dark, he bitterly denounced the inner-city lefty elites in defence of those who “hate the idea of a Plibersek, a Wong, a Keneally patronising and condescending and constantly inferring there’s something wrong with working people and only these elites know how working people should run their lives”. (Like One Nation, Latham has a woman problem.) Les Murray is their poet. Success heaped accolades and money on Murray but it could never wipe away the seething resentment he felt at being looked down upon by the elites. “It’s my mission,” he said, “to irritate the hell out of the eloquent who would oppress my people.” “His people” are the everyday people, the real people who they set themselves against the intellectual, the pompous, the fake. And so they vote for regional candidates who, from the cities, appear to be comical buffoons because they are buffoons who speak their language. The rise of the culture of resentment filled a gap left by the decline of traditional working-class culture, one that the working class could identify with and be proud of. The demise of Australia’s working-class culture was due mainly to the decline of manufacturing, with global shifts in the division of labour. It was hastened by the Hawke-Keating government’s industrial accords, which marginalised trade unions as activist organisations and eroded the political emotion on which the ALP was founded, solidarity. When Bob Hawke sang Solidarity Forever at the 2012 Australian Council of Trade Unions conference it was mere nostalgia, a wistful dirge for a time when the workers could be inspired by the sentiment. Without an effective trade union movement, the Labor party has lost its ballast. Yet the past clings on in the form of Anthony Albanese and the power of union bosses in the factions. When unionists “betray” the party by supporting the conservatives, as mining and forestry workers have, aren’t they only reflecting the society of self-interest that Labor governments as much as conservative ones created with their free market reforms? If Labor is to build a constituency based on socially and environmentally progressive ideas then it has to aim to win government not by splitting the difference between culturally backward-looking voters in regional Queensland and forward-looking voters in the cities, but by winning progressive voters in traditional Liberal party seats. That means no longer buying into the demonisation of the Greens, who are its natural allies in building a progressive future. After all, the Greens’ platform shows stronger commitment to social justice than Labor’s does, and Labor’s climate change policy is now (at last) based on the science and therefore close to the Greens’ one. Of course, the politics of the election were more complicated than I have presented them. But the argument I am making points to a profound underlying trend in Australian society. Identity politics among the young has been excoriated by commentators on the right; but identity politics is thriving in the bush. Just ask Barnaby Joyce. It’s no accident that the hi-vis jackets our political leaders donned at every campaign photo op are also the uniform of the gilets jaunes protesters in France. The gilets jaunes are raging against the wealthy cities and the smug elites that live in them. The yellow vest symbolises the common man; putting it on is a protest against his invisibility. It was a movement sparked by rising fuel taxes among those who depend on their vehicles. They were not opposed to action on climate change as such but objected to having to be the ones to pay the price for it. And they’d been anxiously watching boats carrying Syrians and Africans arrive on Europe’s shores. The gilets jaunes complain: “We no longer count in our own country.” A movement with no platform and no leaders, it’s a manifestation driven by resentment at the apparent complacency of those prosperous cities, and the rage is concentrated, as if by a magnifying glass, on Emmanuel Macron. In Australia too, the electoral power of culture is most intense in the struggle over how to respond to climate change. It reached its sharpest point in the election campaign when Bob Brown’s convoy of Adani protesters arrived to a hostile reception in Clermont in north Queensland. This was the climate change election. The climate question had moved from the margins to the mainstream for the first time. It wasn’t enough to push Labor over the line but, for a growing proportion of the electorate, perhaps now a third, and much higher among young people, it is the compelling issue that will not go away because the heatwaves are not going to stop and the scientists are not going to change their minds. The historical forces are moving, and it would be foolish for the Labor party to pull back now. In Britain, the House of Commons declared a climate emergency. In the US, Democratic party presidential contenders have transcended Barack Obama’s cautious strategy and are lining up to announce strong climate policies. After all, in a land of climate science denial, which half of science do you ditch to find the middle ground? The conservatives turned climate change into a cultural battle. When the Tea Party emerged in 2009, it did not take long, backed by Fox News and the Koch brothers, before climate change was added to the toxic brew of sins attributed to “the liberal elite”. Global warming was no longer a scientific and environmental issue but a cultural one. Prominent conservatives including Sarah Palin shifted from supporting action to cut emissions to denouncing global warming as a liberal plot. From a situation in which there was little difference between Republican and Democratic voters on the need to take action, within a few years of 2009 a wide gulf had opened up, to the point where in 2016 a man who dismissed climate science as a Chinese hoax was elected president. When Trump ridiculed climate change his people understood who the targets were – Al Gore, Hillary Clinton and the know-it-alls in the east coast cites. The conservatives who imported climate science denial to Australia saw their actions explicitly as part of their culture war.  When climate change was sucked into the culture wars two worldviews faced each other uncomprehendingly. Those of an inward-looking and nativist disposition could argue that Australia shouldn’t cut its emissions because it will make no difference to the world; those with an outward-looking temperament insist that we are global citizens as well as Australians and must accept our responsibilities. Conservative politicians in regional Australia have been stoking a kind of metrophobia, playing up resentments against “city elites” and enlarging myths about latte-sipping sophisticates sneering at their backwardness. Environmentalists occupy the central place in this demonology. They refer not to “the Greens” but to “the inner-city Greens”. The demonisation of the Greens reached scandalous proportions in March when rightwing politicians and Murdoch commentators responded to the massacre of innocents by a neo-Nazi in Christchurch by denouncing “extremists from the right and the left”. There are no extremists of the left. To equate trespassing by animal rights activists to mass murder is grotesque and deeply offensive to the victims. Besides, animal rights activists are not environmentalists, as the conflicts over culling prove. The deniers who have taken over the Liberal and National parties are a radical fringe but they now dominate conservative politics. The moderates are afraid of them. Among the public, explicit denial of the science is the preoccupation of a small minority, perhaps 10%. But a larger portion shares the deniers’ antipathy towards environmentalism, and nowhere more so than in regional Queensland and Tasmania, where Labor lost the election. On the surface, the Adani mine is about jobs, but beneath it the mine has become the foremost symbol of the cultural rift between the regions and the cities. The anti-Adani convoy brought this cultural conflict starkly into view. If it’s not irrational to vote for culture over economics, it makes no sense to vote to protect a culture that is being overwhelmed by unstoppable natural forces. Climate activists of all kinds see the issue not so much as one of science (that’s settled), nor of economics (we should make the transition whatever the cost) but of moral obligation. They identify themselves as standing for the survival of humankind and the natural world. They cannot allow the Adani mine to go ahead because it is the symbol of the end of the world. The deniers have been returned to office, led by a man who gleefully rubbed a lump of coal in the faces of the opposition. The prime minister has handed responsibility for cutting Australia’s emissions to Angus Taylor, a man who appears to reject climate science and the facts about Australia’s problems in meeting its Paris targets. The appointment is a brazen two-finger salute to all those who take global warming science seriously. Then there is Matt Canavan. The minister for resources sees it as his duty to promote coal as vigorously as he can, including allocating public subsidies for the construction of new coal-fired power plants. Building new coal plants isn’t about economics or good energy policy; all of the experts and all of the energy industry executives agree it’s reckless. The banks won’t go near it. Canavan has castigated industry for supporting a transition out of coal. For Canavan, Taylor and Morrison, building a new coal-fired power plant would be a decisive win in their war against environmentalism. Winning the culture war is much more important than their commitment to the free market. But they can only hold back the tide for so long. The school kids who staged this year’s strikes sense they live under an ever-darkening shadow. Their fate is to be born into a time when there are no more dreams of utopia; the only hope is to avoid a worse dystopia. They will constitute a growing share of the electorate. Today’s self-funded retirees will be dead. The party that will govern Australia in the future will be the party of the young. It would be political folly, as well as morally indefensible, for Labor to step away now. The most powerful image from the school strike on 3 May was of a distressed girl speaking to the camera. “What’s going to happen to humankind?” she wept. “What’s going to happen to the whole world, if no one does anything?” The terror she is carrying around haunts more and more young people, who at school and at home have absorbed the implications for themselves of the unfolding climate crisis. Their feelings of dread are based on solid scientific facts, reinforced by experience each time a heatwave scorches the streets, autumn will not come, fire razes a forest that’s not supposed to burn, and the Great Barrier Reef limps on to its final death. It’s the future of politics in Australia. • Clive Hamilton is professor of public ethics at Charles Sturt University in Canberra"

Share this...FacebookTwitterRenewable energy in Europe has just taken another nail in its coffin.
Thanks to Germany’s infamous EEG energy feed-in act, electricity prices for consumers and industry have long been rising sharply, and now there’s a looming threat of a revolt.
Today the online business magazine Unternehmen Heute quotes former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroder’s soon-to-be-published book, which warns of a revolt by consumers and industry. The timing of Schröder’s words could not come at a worse time for renewable energy proponents, and will no doubt act to take a lot of the momentum out of the already ailing renewable energy movement in Europe. A number of countries have announced major scale-backs on green energy subsidies. Unternehmen Heute writes:
Electricity must remain affordable, Bild newspaper (Saturday edition) quotes Schröder’s book ‘Clear Words’, which will appear in mid February.
The support for renewable energy through the electricity price will lead consumers, especially the ones near the bottom of the income scale, to eventually revolt and say: We can’t afford this any more.”
Schröder adds that eventually renewable energies will soon “have to compete on the market by themselves. They should not be permanently subsidized.”
The former Chancellor also thinks that Germany will not shut down its remaining nuclear power plants by the year 2022, as planned, and believes Angela Merkel acted hastily in passing legislation requiring their shutdown in the wake of the Fukushima accident in Japan. Schroder writes in his book:
My impression is that a complete shutdown will not happen that quickly: consumer and industry will revolt and put policymakers under pressure to postpone the shutdown date because of cost reasons.”

Moreover, Schroder writes in his book that German companies are already reconsidering plans to build plants in Germany, and are considering setting up in low-price-energy locations instead.
Schroder’s views are a major blow to renewable energies
Schroder’s views take a lot of wind out of the renewable energy sails and will only add to the mounting pressure that is having policymakers putting the brakes on renewable energies. Nuclear energy in Germany may not be dead after all.
Even chancellor Merkel is adding conditions to the target of achieving 80% renewable energy by 2050. At the 1:15 mark in the video at the end of the Unternehmen Heute story, she says:
With this expansion corridor, we can quite harmoniously reach the expansion target of 80%. However, only if our industry is able to stay competitive globally and electricity remains affordable for all.”
In other words, kiss the 80%-renewable-energy-by-2050 pipedream goodbye. Right now Germany has not even began to scratch the surface when it comes to powering the nation’s transportation system with green energy. Here too biofuels are being roundly rejected and its subsidies cancelled.
In summary, even as Brussels likes to beat its chest over its ambitious plans for green energies, policymakers everywhere in Europe are in reality abandoning their once lofty targets in droves.

Likely it’s just a temporary technical glitch. I don’t know enough about this to speculate what could trigger this. Are other German readers having problems accessing Climate Depot?

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt his blog, Die Welt veteran journalist Ulli Kulke writes about the British Met Office’s seemingly obstinate refusal to cast off its ideological addiction to planetary warming and the Office’s consequently resulting overblown annual global temperature forecasts year after year.
Systematic false alarms
As the data roll in, it’s now clear that 2013 was “among the top 10 warmest years” and is thus good enough for the media to proclaim that global warming is happening unhindered and that everyone has to remain in a state of alarm.
And climate institutes just keep on sounding alarms of hotter years ahead. Kulke writes:
Example: The climate scientists at the British Met Office. They have always issued false alarms, and today we can even say systematic false alarms. Of all the annual forecasts on global temperature made this century, 14 in total, the scientists have wound up landing above the actual value 13 times. Paul Hudson, climate and weather expert of the BBC, points this out.”
Flipping a coin would already represent a vast methodological improvement for the Met Office. Kulke writes that it is obvious that the Met Office has “learned nothing from their experience“, and adds:
Apparently they just refuse to accept the reality that the trend is no longer going up in any significant statistical way (as even the IPCC has admitted this in the meantime). It is stunning, but some never learn.”

For 2014 the Met Office predicts that global temperature again will be 0.57°C above the long-term average.
It sounds as if the Met Office scientists are just playing a broken record.
===========================
Minus 73°F in Siberia
Aside from the story of failed forecasts from the Met Office, extreme cold is now gripping large parts of Siberia, with some locations showing temperatures at 60°F below zero and colder. One location taken from early this morning shows -73°F. So much for melting permafrost!
