"The Turnbull government has opened discussions on new fuel efficiency standards for vehicles which it says could cut consumer fuel spending by up to $28bn by 2040. Fresh after being forced into a hasty retreat by conservatives over a potential emissions intensity trading scheme which experts argue would allow Australia’s electricity sector to reduce emissions at least cost to consumers – the government has regrouped and opened a new policy conversation about regulations that would force car manufacturers to supply cars with more fuel-efficient engines.  The ministers for energy and the environment, Josh Frydenberg, and urban infrastructure, Paul Fletcher, issued a joint statement on Tuesday that said new standards could reduce Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions by up to 65m tonnes by 2030, “with these reductions helping meet Australia’s emissions reduction targets”. They flagged three potential proposals – new fuel efficiency standards; upgrading the existing air pollution standards for cars, trucks and buses, “in line with higher standards which already apply in Europe, the US and many other countries”; and a discussion paper exploring options to “improve the quality of our road transport fuels to reduce noxious emissions”. The ministers said new emissions standards would make fuel consumption more efficient, and as a consequence motorists would save money. “This translates into annual fuel savings for the average owner of a passenger car and light commercial vehicle of up to $519 and $666 respectively.” The government will likely face resistance from car manufacturers who argue the compliance burden associated with onerous fuel efficiency standards pushes up the price of vehicles. But the government’s recent decision to rule out any form of carbon trading for the electricity sector increases the urgency of achieving emissions reductions in other parts of the economy if Australia is to have any hope of complying with its Paris target.  The Turnbull government has ratified the Paris international climate agreement which requires Australia to reduce emissions by 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2030. The Paris target builds on Australia’s 2020 target of reducing emissions by 5% below 2000 levels. A range of experts have made it clear that the Coalition’s Direct Action policy does not deliver a viable mechanism to ensure compliance with the Paris target. “Current fuel standards expire in 2019 and we need to be ready with new standards to ensure Australians can have access to the right fuel for the latest vehicle technology,” the ministers said in the joint statement issued on Tuesday. “The right standards will deliver further health and environmental benefits. The government will continue to explore other ways to reduce vehicle running costs and emissions, such as the type of information provided to consumers when buying a car, and support for emerging technologies.”"
"No doubt nearly everyone is familiar with the story. In early 2014, Malaysian flight MH370 left Kuala Lumpur Malaysia, on a flight to China. The flight disappeared from communication and was never found; despite great search efforts.  It isn’t that there is no evidence of the crash. In July of last year, a portion of a wing was found near Madagascar and Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean. Since then, other debris has been found in the Western Indian Ocean.   Using the location of where the wing debris were found, oceanographers from University of Santiago de Compostela (Spain), the United States National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the University of Miami, University of Hawaii, and the Commonwealth Science Industrial and Research Organization (CSIRO) in Australia have a lead. Their hypothesis is published in the Journal of Operational Oceanography and can be found here. The authors used two sets of data to help track the possible paths of the debris. First, they took advantage of observations from NOAA’s Global Drifter Array. These drifters have a surface float and an anchor or drogue that extend to 15m deep, and a suite of sensors that communicate via satellite their location and parameters like ocean currents, surface ocean temperature, pressure, wind, and salinity. In the Indian Ocean alone, there are approximately 400 of these drifters at any time, providing continuous ocean measurement information. At some point the drifters loose their drogue and these are the ones used in this study as they better simulate debris dynamics.  The authors tracked drifters that were released or that traveled near the search area in the southeastern Indian Ocean. Several of these drifters traveled across the Indian Ocean to the final destination near Reunion Island, very near where the wing debris was found, and the duration it took the drifters to make their trek was similar to that of the debris. In addition, the authors used a computer model of ocean currents from the University of Hawaii. This model incorporated the surface ocean winds and provided a realistic simulation of ocean currents during and after the plane crash. Using these computer-derived currents, the scientists released thousands of replica drifters to see where they traveled.  By combining the real trajectories from actual instruments with the simulated trajectories, scientists were able to identify the location where a crash was most likely, shown in the image below. More recent debris discoveries confirm the general westward drift predictions from the computer program and analysis. While the assessments from this study are interesting in that they are related to the MH370 accident, the techniques that the researchers developed can be used for other ocean-debris scenarios and are useful both for basic research as well as more tangible applications for societal benefits, such as search and rescue efforts, oil spills, and fish larval transports. I contacted author Joaquin Trinanes to ask about the difficulties of this project and its importance. He told me:  There are many factors that affect the trajectories and distribution of ocean debris. A critical aspect is related to the exposure of the floating objects to the wind, which can greatly impact the forecast of the location of the debris. It is challenging to solve but imperative with the advance in the developments of the observational and modeling efforts. His colleague, Gustavo Goni added,  Studies like the one carried out here shows the value of maintaining a global ocean observing system to monitor different parameters in the oceans, such as ocean currents in this case, but of others like sea surface temperature, winds, salinity, oxygen, etc.; which are key to understand how the ocean is linked to weather, climate, and ecosystems. In addition, this monitoring also serves for other direct applications, such as debris tracking, oil spill monitoring, fisheries stock assessments, sea level rise, etc. I think it is really great to solve a basic research problem but also to connect it to practical applications. Great work, folks."
"A key figure picked to prepare the US federal environment agency for life under a Donald Trump administration has met in Washington DC with some of the world’s most notorious and longest-serving climate science deniers, including One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts. Myron Ebell, of the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), was picked by the now president-elect to lead the Environmental Protection Agency “transition team” back in September. Trump has pledged to strip many powers from the EPA to boost fossil fuel production. Ebell has spent two decades trying to undermine the science linking dangerous climate change to fossil fuel burning. E&E News reported that Ebell was at one meeting hosted by the CEI and held in the hearing room of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee. The EPW committee is chaired by Senator James Inhofe who, like Trump, has described human-caused climate change as a hoax. The meeting was not open to the public or the press, E&E News reported, with Ebell refusing to give any details. But details of the gatherings have been made public by some of the climate science denialists who attended. The attendee list reads like a who’s who of the climate science denial world. Australian senator Malcolm Roberts, of the far-right One Nation party, who is in the US, revealed he had given a speech at a CEI meeting with Ebell. Roberts wrote the meeting was a gathering of the Cooler Heads Coalition and then listed some of the participants. They included Marc Morano, Randy Randol, Steve Milloy, Chris Horner, Craig Rucker, Patrick Michaels, Ken Haapala and James Taylor. The views of most of the attendees are in direct contradiction to the overwhelming majority of scientific research published over decades, as well as the positions of the world’s major scientific academies. Also listed by Roberts as attending was Breitbart writer James Delingpole, who published a picture of himself, Roberts and Ebell on his Twitter account. Delingpole says climate change is “junk science” and has said that “hanging is too good” for climate scientists. Three of the attendees — Ebell, Randy Randol and Steve Milloy —were part of the Global Climate Science Communications Team in the late 1990s. The GCSC was a coalition of thinktanks and fossil fuel companies that hoped to shift people’s understanding of the science linking fossil fuel burning to human-caused climate change. At the time, Randol was a lobbyist for ExxonMobil and Milloy was the executive director of The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition — a tobacco industry-funded front group. One of the meeting’s attendees, lawyer Chris Horner, was named this week to Trump’s EPA “landing team” alongside Ebell. Horner, who has been funded by coal companies, is known for launching multiple FOIA requests targeting the email inboxes of climate scientists and government officials. Many see his work as harassment. Also in attendance, according to Roberts, was Fred Singer – a former advisor to TASSC who set up his first group to attack climate science in 1990. Trump this week named current ExxonMobil chief executive Rex Tillerson as his nomination for the Secretary of State. On Twitter Tony Heller reported that Tim Ball, a retired geography professor and climate science denier from British Columbia, told the EPW meeting: “I’ve waited 40 years for this moment.” In November 2016, Ball and Heller were in Australia for speaking engagements at the invitation of Roberts who claims there is no evidence linking climate change to human activity. Ball then travelled to the US for a two-day conference organised by G. Edward Griffin with the title: Global warming: An Inconvenient Lie. Griffin, who runs Freedom Force International, which organised the conference, is a conspiracy theorist who claims there is no such thing as the HIV virus, that climate change is a hoax and that a US military plane shot down one of the passenger flights that crashed during the September 11 attacks in the United States. The full line-up of attendees at the Cooler Heads Coalition listed by Roberts was Tony Heller, Tim Ball, Fred Singer, Ken Haapala, Craig Rucker, Randy Randall, Steve Milloy, Marc Morano, James Delingpole, Chris Horner, Myron Ebell, Tom de Weise, James Taylor, Pat Michaels, Austin Smithson, Brandon Middleton, Marlo Lewis and “Mandy from Senator James Inhofe’s staff”.

"Asked if he is fearful about the impact of climate change, Tønnes “Kaka” Berthelsen’s response is typical of many Greenlanders. “We are more concerned about the Maldives,” he said bluntly. Greenland has lived with extreme environmental changes for a decade or more. Sea ice is forming two months later and melting one month earlier. Rivers fed by retreating glaciers are at record levels. And temperature records were smashed twice this year, with stunned meteorologists rechecking their measurements after 24C was recorded in the capital, Nuuk, in June. Traditional hunters are giving up their dog teams because there is three months less hunting on sea ice but climate change is “no disaster”, according to Berthelsen, the deputy manager of Knapk, Greenland’s hunters and fishers’ association. The 56,000 inhabitants of the largest island in the world that is not a continent must adapt, fast. In the sea, new fish species are arriving. On land, the melting ice is set to reveal a wealth of zinc, iron, uranium, gold, and rare earth elements that some predict will be the largest deposits outside China. Greenland believes that climate change will bequeath the wealth to win the ultimate political prize: full independence from Denmark. The country gained self-rule in 2009 but its economy is still sustained by a 3.2bn kroner (£362m) annual grant from its former colonial masters. The vast majority – more than 90% – of Greenland’s export income is from fish, and 2016 was the best ever year, according to Berthelsen. Greenland’s “pink gold”, cold-water shrimp, is moving further north and new fish species – mackerel, herring, cod and Atlantic bluefin tuna – are entering the country’s waters. “We haven’t seen such big cod stocks since the 1970s,” said Berthelsen. But in the far north, climate change is hastening the decline of hunting. “The traditional way of life is very challenged,” said Bjarne “Ababsi” Lyberth, a biologist and hunting expert for the Association of Fishers and Hunters. People “used to go hunting for weeks on the sea ice. They would go so far out they couldn’t see any land. Now they can travel only for one day by sea ice, there’s too much open water and it’s unstable.” Greenland has three climate types – polar, Arctic and sub-Arctic – and the effects on the nation, its people and wildlife are varied. In the polar region, hunters report that polar bears “haven’t changed much” said Lyberth, and still look in good health. Further south, the bears have less body fat and are seen more frequently near villages, scavenging for food. Hunters also find it is impossible to store their meat in caches on the ice, as they once did, because hungry polar bears take it. “The changes that Europe and the rest of the world are becoming aware of have been going on in Greenland for 10 or 20 years,” said Lyberth. “It’s not something that scares people. It’s more a question of adapting.” Losing three months of sea ice means that hunters are getting rid of their dog teams, which are expensive to feed and maintain, and switching to fishing. But during the long winter darkness it is easier to hunt on ice with dogs than take a boat out fishing. “Climate change not only has an economic impact but an enormous impact on culture and how we are dealing with traditional lifestyles,” said Aleqa Hammond, the country’s former prime minister, the first female to be elected in 2013, and now a member of the Danish parliament.  “Greenlanders are very good at seeing the new opportunities. We have simply refused to be victimised due to climate change. I am very optimistic. I see more positive options for the country than negatives. I wish that it wasn’t happening but it is and that’s a fact. Once it’s there you have an obligation to do the best out of it.” Lyberth gives the example of hunters forming small teams to target minke whales as an example of rapid adaptation: “It requires skills and knowledge but the hunters are learning very quickly.” But Hammond says investment is required to turn hunters into fishermen: “Moving from hunting to fishing is not an easy task for many – it requires quite a bit of investment both in equipment but also knowledge to ensure they will be capable of making a living as fishermen.”  New processing facilities will be built in Greenland so it can export “value-added” cod fillets rather than the whole fish: migrant labour may be required to staff these new facilities. Greenlanders can now buy home-grown potatoes and salad in Nuuk supermarkets but many southern farmers have struggled with drought in 2015 and 2016. Grass growth is stunted, sheep are smaller, and farmers are forced to buy winter food rather than use their own hay. The number of sheep farmers has fallen from 74 in 1983 to about 37 today. Self-sufficiency in food may be a long way off but 70% of Greenland’s energy is now renewable hydropower from melt-fed rivers. Hammond speaks of 100% renewable energy, and attracting energy-hungry server farms, which companies such as Google and Facebook typically situate inside the Arctic Circle. She also predicts a growth in tourism with ships entering newly ice-free fjords. “Greenland is becoming a new tourist frontier,” she said. But the vision of a climate-changed Greenland as a tourist-friendly wilderness is challenged by the rapid industrialisation that will occur if Greenland becomes a big mining nation. Greenland’s move towards independence in 2009 crucially included ownership of its own mineral reserves. Numerous exploratory licences have been issued to multinational mining companies. According to the government’s Ministry of Mining Resources, Greenland’s first mines – a feldspar minerals mine and a ruby and pink sapphire mine – are expected to go into production in 2017. Other mining projects include a zinc mine and a rare earth elements mine, drilling for gold in Nuuk fjord, and “promising” exploratory drilling for a nickel-copper-cobalt mine. If – or when – the mining boom takes off, Greenland’s indigenous population will be dwarfed by migrant labour. Small countries suddenly enriched by mining often experience corruption or social problems but Hammond insists Greenland has prepared strong laws governing labour rights and mining royalties. The country has established a fund modelled on Norway’s oil-derived sovereign wealth fund. “Greenland’s parliament has adopted a mineral fund but it doesn’t mean we’ll be going round with a million dollars in each pocket,” said Hammond. “It will not be used in the short-term but will ensure that Greenland is set up for bad days and used with good sense – and with a unanimous vote in the parliament.” Søren Hald Møller, permanent secretary for Greenland’s prime minister, Kim Kielsen, said the government viewed climate change as a concern, shortening the winter ice season in the north and stopping winter hunting and fishing.  “We know that climate change also creates new opportunities, for example in new pelagic [cod, herring, mackerel] fisheries. But still, no one can just jump from one occupation to another that is completely different,” Møller says. “My hope is that we as a society can adapt in the best possible way to the climatic changes, simply because we as a nation and as a people cannot prevent it.”"
"When she turned eight, Kehkashan Basu decided that she was grown up enough to begin her lifetime’s work. And so on her birthday she planted a sea grape seed in the garden of her parents’ apartment block in Dubai.  “I was born on 5 June, which is World Environment Day,” says Basu . “I thought it was preordained that I’d grow up to take care of mother earth and become an eco warrior. So at the age of eight I thought I could start doing something good for the planet on my own.” The plant is still going strong and Basu’s activism is also going from strength to strength. Earlier this month she was awarded the Children’s peace prize, started by charity KidsRights, for her eco work. Now 16, Basu’s goal is to mobilise children across the world to help promote sustainability. Basu’s achievements outstrip those of the most ambitious teenagers. After planting her sea grape tree, she started doing ground-level environmental campaigning when she was nine, and was elected the United Nations Environment Programme (Unep)’s global coordinator for children and youth at the age of 12. In the same year, she founded her organisation Green Hope, which advocates for grassroots environmental youth activism and eco education. Green Hope now has 1,000 members and Basu says that the organisation planted the majority of the trees in Dubai’s Festival City district.  Basu believes that carbon offsetting is the way forward. People cannot be expected to sacrifice everything, she says.  “For everything I do that has a big carbon footprint, I plant trees based on the carbon dioxide emitted, so you don’t feel guilty about doing something,” she says. “You have to live your life, so whatever you do you start by offsetting. Tree planting is the simplest and most effective way of doing this.” Basu has travelled the world for her work – that must mean a lot of trees dotted across Dubai. Basu admits that many of her classmates had “the misconception that the environment was boring”. But Basu, determined as ever, turned attitudes around and soon had her school planting trees and cleaning mangrove plantations. “We kayak into the mangroves, clean up the plantations and then kayak back.” The work has had a powerful impact on her classmates. “They realised what was at stake – our future – and they got involved.” Children are ideal people to educate, Basu says, not just because they will be around for longer, but because they wield an influence many people underestimate: “A lot of children can convince their family and schools – and from there it grows out.” Basu visited restaurants in the Al Qusais area of Dubai to talk them into recycling, and she convinced beauty salon owners to stop using harsh chemicals. Then she started spreading the message via her friends and talking to nearby schools. Al Qusais is near the industrial area of Dubai, which proved to be advantageous. “If I spread awareness at schools, they would spread it to the parents who work in the industrial area,” she explains. There’s no doubt Basu’s parents have been enormously influential. She says her work was inspired by them as they were always diligent about reducing waste – turning off lights, not wasting water – and going to charity drives every Friday night. “They’re always behind me, whatever I choose to do, and they always tell me to follow my dreams and not let others put me down.” Her father is a general manager for a company that distributes electronic products in the United Arab Emirates, and her mother is the programme coordinator of Green Hope. So she is her mother’s boss? There’s a slight pause. “I wouldn’t say boss because we are all equal in my organisation. But yeah, I work with my mom,” she says. It’s easy to forget that Basu is a teenager. She’s more intelligent and better informed than most adults, as well as diplomatic. When asked about Donald Trump’s climate-sceptic stance she doesn’t go off on an adolescent rant about older people ruining the future for the young, but says instead: “We live in uncertain times … we should continue to do what we’re doing and not lose hope.” Her Twitter feed features pictures of her at conference or of children wielding plastic bin bags and picking up litter in Dubai. “I have been practising time management since I was eight,” she says when asked how she fits in school work around everything else.  Does she ever feel like she’s missing out on the carefree fun of being a child? “I think everyone’s definition of fun is different,” says Basu. “I love doing my work. If I didn’t love it, I wouldn’t be doing it. I have involved so many children, including my friends, and we enjoy it.”  When she’s not doing schoolwork or environmental campaigning, Basu plays the piano (she’s just passed her grade eight exams) and the guitar. “My favourite band is the Beatles, I think they’re awesome.” Asked to name her inspirations, Basu says Ban Ki-moon and Achim Steiner, former executive director of Unep. Anyone slightly less bureaucratic? “Wangari Maathai and Jane Goodall. Green Hope works extensively with Maathai’s organisation, the Green Belt Movement, and with the Abu Dhabi branch of Goodall’s Roots and Shoots. It’s female empowerment as well as doing stuff for the environment.” Gender equality is part of Basu’s vision. “Without it you cannot achieve a sustainable world. Both halves of humanity need to work together.” Basu has been subject to the sexism many women and girls experience, including being told that she couldn’t be a pilot when she expressed an interest in it as a young girl. People also ask why she wants to be CEO of her own organisation “because that’s something for males”. The negativity hasn’t put her off: she wants to expand Green Hope to every country , and even though she still has two years of school left, she’s already set her sights on an MBA at Harvard. When she was 12, Basu gave a rousing speech to Unep’s governing council. In it, she quoted Mother Teresa: “Yesterday is gone. Tomorrow has not yet come. We have only today. Let us begin.” She already has.  Join our community of development professionals and humanitarians. Follow @GuardianGDP on Twitter. Join the conversation with the hashtag #SheMatters."
"As a child growing up in the early 1980s, I often daydreamed of space exploration and interstellar frontiers. The leap into outer space seemed tantalizingly close. In the science fiction stories I read, the chronology of the future was also the potential biography of adulthood. One story projected a settlement on Mars in 1995; another depicted the grim labor of asteroid mining a decade later; a third imagined an encounter with alien artifacts in the Alpha Centauri system after 2020. The common thread in these stories, easily intuited even by an 11-year-old, was the lesson that the Earth was not our home. Now the science fiction dream of leaving the planet behind appears to be coming true. One of the most striking effects of climate change — often remarked upon by writers — is its power to unsettle our basic understanding of the modern world. Our planet is changing into a strange and unstable new environment, in a process seemingly outside technological control. The fossil fuels that once promised mastery over nature have turned out to be tools of destruction, disturbing the basic biogeochemical processes that make our world habitable. Even the recent past is no longer what we thought it was. Scientists are telling us that the whole territory of modern history, from the end of World War II to the present, forms the threshold to a new geological epoch.  Our new planet is emerging quickly. The global climate is only one of nine earth system processes under threat. Land use is changing rapidly thanks to urbanization, agriculture, and population pressure. The rate of biodiversity loss is increasing in many ecosystems. Acidification is affecting marine biodiversity as well as the capacity of oceans to absorb carbon dioxide. The supply of fresh water in many regions is deteriorating. Aerosol loading and ozone depletion threaten the stability of the earth system’s atmosphere. Industrial agriculture has perturbed the global nitrogen and phosphorus cycles. Finally, chemical pollution may pose a risk not just at the local or regional level but also worldwide. Indeed, the planet’s biosphere bears so many marks of anthropogenic influence that it no longer possible to uphold the age-old distinction between the realm of wilderness and the world of human habitation. To call attention to this unprecedented danger, the atmospheric chemist Paul Crutzen and the ecologist Eugene Stoermer in 2000 proposed a new name for the geological epoch we inhabit: the Anthropocene. For the first time, humans have become the prime drivers of the planetary climate. We have left behind the relatively stable pattern of natural variability that governed the environment in the Holocene epoch, beginning some 11,700 years ago. In the original formulation, Crutzen and Stoermer picked 1784 as the origin of the new epoch: the year of James Watt’s patent for a steam engine with a separate condenser. Britain’s early transition into the fossil fuel economy marked the end of the Holocene. More recently, the Working Group on the Anthropocene, established to validate the epoch in formal stratigraphic terms, has shifted the chronology of the Anthropocene from the Industrial Revolution to the Great Acceleration—the economic boom after World War II.  From a geological perspective, the dating of the Anthropocene turns on the problem of how to identify a stable and durable stratigraphic signal that might be detected by observers in a distant future. What sort of fossils will we leave behind? Geologists sometimes joke about the Coca-Cola layer of modern civilization. Among the plausible candidates proposed by the Working Group on the Anthropocene are microplastics, metal alloys, and artificial isotopes. Such stratigraphic markers must be placed in their historical context. The scientific identification of the Anthropocene with the year 1945 gives us not just a plausible geological end to the Holocene, but also a watershed that fits comfortably with a great body of scholarly work about the historical consequences of World War II.  The Great Acceleration, like the Anthropocene, is a concept of fairly recent coinage. It surfaced in an interdisciplinary workshop in 2005 and was popularized by Will Steffen in the discourse on planetary change. The name was meant to echo Karl Polanyi’s famous thesis about the rise of market society and the social basis of all economies. But the Great Acceleration takes Polanyi’s approach a step further by suggesting an environmental foundation to economic development. Postwar growth must be understood in not only its social but also its biophysical context. In scientific terms, the Great Acceleration captures the systemic and interrelated impacts of economic development on the biosphere. It is closely connected to the idea of “planetary boundaries” put forward in 2009 by the environmental scientist Johan Rockström and his group of collaborators. “Planetary boundaries” represent approximate quantitative values for thresholds of environmental risks beyond which we can expect nonlinear and irreversible change on a continental or planetary level. Most famously, climate scientists have warned that any carbon emissions above 350 parts per million (ppm) represents unacceptable danger to the welfare of the planet and humanity. The big rise in emissions that brought us past this threshold happened in the past three generations. While the origin of fossil fuel burning goes back to the Industrial Revolution (which set us on an emissions path beyond the Holocene’s natural variability of 260 to 285 ppm), the truly dramatic rise in carbon dioxide emissions, from 310 to 400 ppm, has occurred between 1950 and 2015. The concept of the Great Acceleration encourages us to conceive of postwar capitalism as a biogeochemical process: the history of post-Fordism, the triumph of the welfare state, les trente glorieuses, and the rise of the BRIC powers all contributed to the upward trend of emissions and the increasing disequilibrium of the carbon cycle.   A dark picture of the present moment emerges in the Indian novelist Amitav Ghosh’s recent book The Great Derangement: Climate Change and the Unthinkable. The title captures his scathing diagnosis of the condition of literature and culture in the age of the Anthropocene. Why is it, he asks, that the literary world has responded to climate change with almost complete silence? How can we explain the fact that writers of fiction have overwhelmingly failed to grapple with the ongoing planetary crisis in their works? For Ghosh, this silence is part of a broader pattern of indifference and misrepresentation. Contemporary arts and literature are characterized by “modes of concealment that [prevent] people from recognizing the realities of their plight.” By failing to engage with climate change, artists and writers are contributing to an impoverished sense of the world, right at the moment when art and literature are most needed to galvanize a grassroots movement in favor of climate justice and carbon mitigation. Ghosh himself grapples with this question not in a work of fiction but in a wide-ranging essay about the relation of literature to science, history, and politics. The arc of the argument carries him from the birth of the novel to the industrialization of Asia, from the environmental politics of the military security state to, in a move that might surprise some observers, an examination of how organized religion might take the lead in promoting future mitigation efforts. According to Ghosh, the cause of the “great derangement” is a certain kind of rationality. The authors who invented the bourgeois novel relied on probability to win the trust of their readers. Plots and characters were embedded in accounts of material life that gave them the sheen of ordinary experience, reflecting the regularity of middle-class life. This literary strategy rested in turn, at least in part, on the worldview of the Victorian natural sciences. In Charles Lyell’s geology, all explanations depended on a principle of uniformity. Nature acted in the same incremental way in all places and times. Change was always gradual and never catastrophic. The literary effect of bourgeois probability was to banish the account of extraordinary or bizarre happenings to marginal genres like the Gothic tale, romance novel, and science fiction. This externalization of the strange and unlikely explains the failure of modern novels and art to wrestle with anthropogenic climate change. Bourgeois reason takes many forms. The uniformitarian geology of Lyell had affinities with classical political economy. In Adam Smith’s economic vision, the natural world was fundamentally stable and benign. There was no room for sudden oscillations of climate. Famine was the product of political meddling with markets, not a failure of natural supply. Indeed, the self-regulating properties of the free market were supposed to reflect the homeostatic balance of the natural order. Here political economists were indebted to 18th-century natural history and the concept of an economy of nature. This conceit about a fundamental fit between the economy and the natural world has enjoyed a long afterlife in classical liberal thought. One way to think about the longevity of these Enlightenment ideas is to see them as ideological manifestations of Holocene stability. The small variability of temperature and carbon dioxide levels for more than 11,000 years has given rise to deep-seated habits and ideas about the harmony of the natural world. In the Holocene, it made quite a bit of sense to idealize the environment as a stable envelope for the economy. The commitment to indefinite economic growth espoused by the economics profession in the postwar era is perhaps its most triumphant expression. Ironically, the new 1945 start date for the Anthropocene implies that such Promethean optimism reached its peak just as the Holocene world came to an end. While human population has tripled in the postwar era, demographic growth is not in itself an indicator of high emissions; despite sustained population increase, Afghanistan has emitted only a fraction of the carbon dioxide of affluent countries. But Ghosh insists that demographic baselines matter as much as rates of growth. Consider a simple counterfactual scenario: if the population of the United States had been 10 times smaller, we would expect a drastically lower pattern of emissions. Conversely, if the large populations of Asia had industrialized earlier, consuming more fossil fuel in the past, we would likely have arrived at the critical boundary for dangerous climate change more quickly. By definition, the carbon footprint of any given nation is a product of the size of the fossil-burning population. Ghosh concludes that European imperialism held back the entry of Asia into the fossil fuel economy, but that when China and India finally adopted coal and oil on a large scale in the 1980s, this proved a decisive turning point for the planet, bringing “the climate crisis to a head.” For Ghosh, the entry of Asia into the Great Acceleration drives home a bitter truth about the environmental foundation of the modern economy. As a latecomer on the stage, Asia has “unwittingly stumble[d] upon the secret that is the key to the plot.” By driving up worldwide demand for energy and resources while at the same time increasing the amount of waste and pollution in the system, Asian growth is pushing the economy closer to the critical boundaries that must be maintained in order to keep the planet habitable. The lesson of this “revelatory experiment,” Ghosh insists, “is that the patterns of life that modernity engenders can only be practiced by a small minority of the world’s population.” The promise of the Great Acceleration cannot be universalized: “Every family in the world cannot have two cars, a washing machine, and a refrigerator—not because of technical or economic limitations but because humanity would asphyxiate in the process.” If this is a correct assessment, then the basic aims of economic development and social justice will need to be redefined in order to accommodate the realities of growth on a finite planet. In theory, a transition to renewable energy and sustainable agriculture would provide much-needed ecological relief, yet the task of scaling up new technologies to meet growing demand is truly monumental. Despite the lip service given in the Paris Agreement to a maximum of 2.0°C, emissions are likely to exceed this goal by a significant amount. To make things worse, the calendar of emissions leaves little time for popular mobilization. Ghosh admits that the “horizon in which effective action can be taken is very narrow.” On the political side, we also have to reckon with the power of entrenched interests. Ghosh rightly suggests that fossil fuel growth is at the heart of the dominant system of power. Will the richest nations voluntarily give up their positions of preeminence in the name of climate justice? Defenders of the modern state have for centuries embraced economic growth as the key to maintaining territorial and military power. An “equitable regime of emissions” aimed at “contraction and convergence” directly challenges this global distribution of power and wealth. Far more likely than voluntary degrowth and climate justice is a strategy of “open-ended counter-insurgency, militarized borders, [and] aggressive anti-immigration policing” — what Christian Parenti calls the “politics of the armed lifeboat.” But despite Ghosh’s dark sense of realism about our political options, he still manages to find hope in surprising places. “The very speed with which the crisis is now unfolding,” he notes, might save many parts of the world from the destructive social and cultural consequences of the Great Acceleration. Still more provocatively, Ghosh proposes that religious traditions might offer the most effective social basis for popular resistance. Ghosh observes that religious movements could “mobilize people in far greater numbers” than secular organizations. Religious belief reaches beyond the boundaries of nation states and embraces “intergenerational, long-term responsibilities” that “do not partake of economistic ways of thinking.” Indeed, the “idea of the sacred” involves an “acceptance of limits and limitations” that strongly resembles the ethos of stewardship and simple living central to radical forms of climate justice. Could it be that religious belief, with its appreciation of “nonlinear change” (i.e., apocalypse and planetary disaster), might be our best resource in breaking the spell of Holocene thought? Some of us might worry that religious tradition is just as likely to subvert earth system science as it is to support it. But I take Ghosh’s broader point to be salutary. The magnitude of environmental change we now face will demand a fundamental reorientation of modern politics, economics, and culture. This is the only way to make a home on our new planet."
"The extreme warmth of 2016 has changed so much for the people of the Arctic that even their language is becoming unmoored from the conditions in which they now live.  The Yupik, an indigenous people of western Alaska, have dozens of words for the vagaries of sea ice, which is not surprising given the crucial role it plays in subsistence hunting and transportation. But researchers have noted that some of these words, such as “tagneghneq” (thick, dark, weathered ice), are becoming obsolete.  After thousands of years of use, words are vanishing as quickly as the ice they describe due to climate change. The native inhabitants are also in peril – there are 31 Alaskan towns and cities at imminent risk from the melting ice and coastal erosion. Many will have to relocate or somehow adapt.   “In December, we normally have waters covered in ice but right now we have open water out there,” said Vera Metcalf, director of the Eskimo Walrus Commission, which represents 19 native communities stretching along Alaska’s western coast. “We are so dependent upon sea ice conditions. It’s our life, our culture.”   Arctic sea ice extent slumped to a record low in November, winnowed away by the warming air, warming seas and unhelpful wind patterns. The region’s 2016 temperature has been 3.5C warmer than a century ago. In some locations the divergence from the long-term average has been an eye-watering 20C.   On 21 November, the decline on the long-term average of sea ice extent for that day was 888,000 sq miles (2.3m sq km) – an area 10 times larger than the UK, but smaller than the long-term average. “Almost every year now we look at the record of sea ice and say ‘wow’, but this year it was like ‘three times wow’,” said Tad Pfeffer, a geophysicist at the University of Colorado. “This year has been a big exaggeration on the trends we’ve already been seeing.”  These numbers have resonance for people who require dependable rhythms in the environment in order to survive. In remote Alaskan communities, the stores sell goods priced to reflect their journey – $20 for a pizza, $15 for a gallon of milk. If you can’t butcher a 1,000lb walrus because there is no sea ice to support both of you, then you might well be left hungry.  “The window of opportunity for hunting continues to shrink,” Metcalf said. “The communities are worried about this because food insecurity is something we are now having to tackle every single day.”  Metcalf grew up on St Lawrence island, a far-flung piece of the US that sits just 36 miles from Russia in the Bering Sea. The island is thought to be one of the last exposed fragments of a land bridge that connected North America to Asia during the last ice age.  In 2013, the island’s two main communities managed to catch just a third of the walruses they normally do. Last year, Gambell, the largest settlement, snared just 36 – down from the 600 it could expect just a few years ago.   Sea ice is further out from land than it once was and is becoming treacherously thin for hunters to traverse. Walruses, which require sea ice for resting and giving birth, often have to resort to heaving themselves on to crowded strips of land. These grand tusked beasts can trample each other to death in such conditions.  “It’s not like the walrus populations are changing, it’s that the climate is changing the conditions,” Metcalf said. “We are trying to plan better but we can’t go out every day and hunt. We can try to adapt and hunt caribou or moose but it’s not easy. It comes at a cost to us.” The Arctic is warming at twice the rate of the rest of the world and there are “early signs” that this temperature increase is speeding up, according to Jeremy Mathis, director of the Arctic program at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Mathis moved to Fairbanks, Alaska, in 2007 and even in that time he has seen startling changes – the -40C winters he endured in the first few years have almost completely disappeared.  “For people who live in the Arctic, there is no debate over whether their environment is changing,” he said. “We are seeing a destabilization of the environment in the Arctic. The ice is melting earlier and earlier and coming back later and later in the year. For people here that means a clear impact upon food security and their way of life.”  Frost locked deep in the soils is melting, causing buildings to subside. Communities are seeing their coastlines erode and are increasingly exposed to lashing storms without the protective barrier of sea ice.   Several Alaskan towns and villages are wrestling over whether to fight these changes or retreat to relative safety. Two coastal villages, Shishmaref and Kivalina, have voted to relocate while a third, Newtok, has taken the first tentative steps to do so. The warmth of 2016 – almost certain to be a global record – has added to the sense of haste. The regrowth of sea ice as Alaska enters winter has been so painfully slow that many communities will be left without a buffer to storms next year. Should a large storm hit, it could prove disastrous. Such a calamity would at least free up money from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema). The cost of relocating a village of just a few hundred people is around $200m – a bill that neither the federal nor Alaskan government is keen to pick up. Some people in remote communities note, darkly, that a ruinous storm would at least be followed by federal dollars that would allow them to fortify or move. “These communities need to be moved as soon as possible before a large storm hits,” said Victoria Herrmann, managing director of the Arctic Institute. “There hasn’t been much guidance as to whether they can move or who will pay for it. There are around 230 villages affected by sea level rise and they will all need a plan over the next few years as sea ice continues to retreat.” It takes a certain stoic hardiness to live in a place of such frigid cold. But Herrmann said that even those who have had to adapt to changes in the past have found the unravelling of 2016 “very scary”. She added: “What we are seeing is incredible. It’s quite frightening in terms of what it means for the future.” A solution doesn’t appear imminent. The US has no national sea level rise plan, no system to deal with displaced people. Even as the country’s first climate change refugees emerge from within its own borders, the issue is very much on the sidelines. The incoming president isn’t sure what the fuss is about, vacillating between calling climate change a “hoax” concocted by the Chinese or simply claiming that “nobody really knows” if it exists. While the politics plays out, wrenching decisions will have to be made.  “Having to move elsewhere is unimaginable,” said Metcalf. “As an elder told me the other day, we are not going anywhere. We’ve been here for centuries. But we may have to consider it, for the sake of our children and grandchildren.”"
"Businesses are buying more wind and solar electricity than ever before to help lower their carbon footprint in offices, stores and factories. But the two sources of renewable energy are far from getting equal love from corporate America. Wind energy has long been the favorite. Businesses, not counting power companies, signed 2,000 megawatts of it in 2015, a jump from 100 megawatts in 2009, according to the American Wind Energy Association. Wind energy is enabling Google, the largest corporate buyer of renewable electricity in the world, to hit the 100% renewable energy goal, which it expects to achieve next year. The company has inked 2,548 megawatts of wind contracts and 141 megawatts of solar from projects around the world. Interest in solar energy is growing, but at a slower rate. Solar contracts shot up to 1,070 megawatts in 2015 from 339 megawatts in 2010, said the Solar Energy Industries Association. Wind energy has historically been much cheaper than solar, making it a more attractive option, especially when energy can be a major expense for a company. As more businesses come under pressure from their customers, investors or government regulators to cut their greenhouse gas emissions and help rein in global warming, they will be looking for low-carbon energy that can compete with the price of coal and natural gas. Wind and solar are not the only sources of electricity with lower carbon footprints than coal and natural gas. Hydropower and nuclear are too, and, unlike solar and wind, are able to produce electricity any time. But hydropower plants require access to ample sources of surface water. A nuclear power plant can take longer to secure permits and cost more than building other types of power plants. “Corporate participation (in buying solar and wind) is still relatively new,” said Brian Janous, director of energy strategy at Microsoft, which recently announced the biggest wind energy contract, at 178 megawatts, in its renewable energy portfolio. “It’s only within the last few years that we’ve seen an uptick, and we’ve yet to fully address the challenges in expanding this market.” America pioneered early research and development of commercial turbines, installing the world’s first wind farm in 1980 and leading the amount of installations, in megawatts, until the late 1990s, when Germany and eventually China began to catch up and then slowly push ahead. Solar hasn’t experienced the same long term and consistent investments and construction, which help to lower cost. Wind power costs cratered 66% in the last six years, said the American Wind Energy Association. The lowest price for a wind contract is around $0.02 per kilowatt-hour while it’s $0.03 for solar, said Ryan Wiser, a renewable energy market researcher at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, part of the US Department of Energy. That minor difference in price can add up to a hefty bill for heavy users of electricity, such as data centers that require an around-the-clock electricity supply. More than half of the 4,000 megawatts of new wind energy contracts last year, and 3,440 megawatts this year, were signed by companies across industries from tech to grocery chains, according to the wind trade association and the Rocky Mountain Institute. Utilities bought the rest. Amazon, for example, has invested more in wind and solar in the past two years. It’s paying for power from a 150-megawatt wind farm in Indiana and waiting for a 208-megawatt wind project in North Carolina to come online soon. It’s also signed agreements for several hundred megawatts of new wind energy that are scheduled to start delivery in 2017. Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Dow Chemical and 3M are buying five times more wind than solar, said Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Solar has become an increasingly attractive option following a massive construction of factories to build solar panels, mostly notably in China. Prices for solar contracts have dived 63% over the last five years, said the solar trade association. In the 2016 ranking of top corporate solar energy buyers, Target gets the top spot with 147.5 megawatts of installed capacity, according to the solar trade association. The retailer is followed by industrial real estate developer Prologis (107.8 megawatts), Apple (93.9 megawatts), Costco (50.7 megawatts) and Kohl’s (50.2 megawatts). Businesses looking to sign renewable energy contracts or even develop their own solar or wind projects often find themselves on a steep learning curve about borrowing money, structuring contracts and understanding the complex rules that govern the electric industry. Getting rid of these road blocks will encourage more companies to lower their use of fossil fuel energy, business leaders said. For a company that operates in many states or even countries, figuring out a way to standardize renewable energy contracts helps it to save money and time, Janous said. “How do we make deals more attainable for not just Microsoft but smaller companies? There has to be some simplification,” he added. In cities where the local power companies don’t offer much, if any, wind or solar energy for sale, businesses could install their own solar panels or wind turbines on their properties. The cost of this do-it-yourself model has historically been higher than paying for electricity supplied by the local utilities, noted Herve Touati, managing director of Rocky Mountain Institute’s Business Renewable Center. But that cost is coming down and, in some cases, lower than the electricity from the grid. “It’s cheaper for Microsoft to use onsite generation than ask utilities to double their existing grids,” Touati said. Companies with renewable energy contracts or a stake in a solar or wind farm typically don’t use that low-carbon electricity directly – electricity from power plants of all types usually enters the transmission lines and gets mixed up. As a result, businesses would count the amount of solar or wind they pay for against their overall electricity use to calculate their carbon footprint reduction. Despite uncertainties about the impact of a Trump administration on renewable energy – the president-elect has criticized regulations that pressure businesses to address climate change – businesses and market analysts said the prices for renewable energy have fallen steep enough to make them a more feasible option. “Certainly, there are many policy questions yet to be answered, but I don’t see the US election having a significant impact on our commitments,” Janous said."
"The volume of coal used across the world fell for the second year running in 2015 and is set to stay below peak levels in 2016, reported the International Energy Agency (IEA). The influential thinktank – an autonomous Paris-based organisation – has downgraded its medium-term coal market forecast for the fifth year in a row and expects demand to plateau until 2021, but not fall fast enough to align with the international goal of holding global warming below 2C. China will be critical, as the consumer of half the world’s coal. There remains “a large degree of uncertainty” around its trajectory, said Keisuke Sadamori, director of energy markets at IEA. Last year’s historic climate deal in Paris put the writing on the wall for fossil fuels, the biggest source of greenhouse gases. Yet a shift away from the most polluting fuel – coal – in the US and Europe is being matched by an energy boom in emerging Asian economies. China is starting to ease off on the heavy industry that drove its rapid wealth creation and environmental destruction in the past decade, shifting to service sectors. Meanwhile, it is exporting coal power technology to Asian neighbours, Africa, some poorer European countries and even the US. The one technology that could potentially throw the sector a green lifeline – carbon capture and storage (CCS) – is stalling, the IEA warned on Monday. Four pilot projects to pump greenhouse gas emissions from burning coal underground are collectively storing 8m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year. Total coal emissions are 1,500 times that. Investment decisions for the schemes in operation were taken years ago. No new projects have got the green light since 2014. “One year after the Paris agreement, we don’t see progress on carbon capture and storage, despite the fact CCS is crucial to achieving the 2C target,” said Sadamori. The coal market report was prepared with input from the Coal Industry Advisory Board, which includes mining majors like Peabody and Glencore. As such, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) noted it painted a rosier picture for the industry than the IEA’s latest world energy outlook, which highlighted pressures on coal from energy efficiency, renewables and policy measures. Sadamori acknowledged that the IEA did not predict the structural decline of coal in China. Two years ago, it was still expecting growth. “At the time, Chinese demand growth was continuing rather robustly, so we didn’t anticipate the Chinese demand development,” he said in a press call. In its 2015 report, the Agency outlined a scenario under which Chinese coal use had already peaked, although it was not taken as the central case. Even with its tendency to see upsides for miners, the IEA expects the recent revival in coal prices to be short-lived. In the US, the world’s third largest coal market, there was a massive 15% drop in consumption in 2015. While the report does not directly address the impacts of Donald Trump’s election to the US presidency, it highlights market factors driving coal off the system. For all Trump’s promise to put miners back to work, those economic trends are not expected to change."
"It is the meal most associated with the UK, along with slurping tea and moaning about the weather. But the great British fish supper could be on the way out, replaced by more continental variations such as squid and chips, as seas continue to warm, the British Ecological Society will be told this week.  Britons may have to adopt a more continental diet when it comes to fish, as climate change sees cold-water fish such as cod gradually replaced by squid and other warm-water species, according to research led by Dr John Pinnegar of Cefas, the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science.  “Our models for 2025 and beyond suggest that seawater temperature may continue to rise in the future,” said Pinnegar. “As a result, UK waters will become more hospitable for some species and less suitable for others, with the overall result that most commercial species will move northwards.”  Squid numbers have increased dramatically over the past 35 years in the North Sea, according to Cefas, which has monitored North Sea fish populations for the past 114 years. It said squid was found at 60% of its 76 survey stations in 2016, compared with just 20% in 1984. The organisation analyses records of where fish are caught and water temperature, to monitor the impact of climate change and fishing intensity to long-term changes in abundance. Cod numbers have been slow to recover after overfishing drastically reduced their numbers, according to Cefas. While there was 1.3m tonnes of cod in the North Sea in 1971, numbers fell to 124,000 tonnes in 2004. Following the imposition of fish stock quotas, that increased to 295,000 tonnes in 2016, but scientists believe cod reproduction has been hampered by warming waters. The UK became a net importer of fish in 1984, a year after the Common Fisheries Policy and its quotas were introduced. Two-thirds of British catch – including scallops and langoustines – are exported, while British consumers remain loyal to varieties of traditional fish no longer caught by Britons, such as cod. “UK consumers enjoy eating quite a limited range of seafood, but in the long term we will need to adapt our diets,” said Pinnegar. “In 2025 and beyond, we may need to replace cod and other old favourites with warm-water species such as squid, mackerel, sardine and red mullet.” Pinnegar, who will present his results at the British Ecological Society annual meeting at ACC, Liverpool, on Monday, said small-scale fisheries targeting warm-water species such as squid, sardine and anchovy would be likely to overtake fisheries catching more traditional species such as haddock and cod. The Scottish Fisherman’s Federation recently argued that Brexit could help the UK’s fishing industry to become a world-leading seafood exporter like Norway, the world’s leading producer of salmon and the second largest seafood exporter. Bertie Armstrong, its chief executive, said the referendum result would enable Britain to regain control of its waters after decades of “common grazing” rights given to European neighbours."
"The impact of Donald Trump’s presidency on the environment may not be as catastrophic as some fear, says leading climate economist Lord Nicholas Stern. The cross-bench peer said that while it was difficult to predict what Trump would do in office, those worried that Trump’s leadership spelled disaster for the planet should focus on the good things he has said on climate change rather than dwelling on the bad.  “I think the right thing to do in the circumstances is to pick up on the good things that people say,” said Stern. “To try to suggest to them that their thinking is sound on this subject … not focussing on the contradictions.” One example was Trump’s statement to the New York Times last month that there was “some connectivity” between human actions and climate change, a shift from his previous claims that climate change is a hoax perpetuated by the Chinese to damage the US economy. Environmentalists, green NGOs and scientists have so far been pessimistic about the prospects of a Trump administration, with one prominent climate scientist saying a Trump presidency “might be game over for the climate” and another, Prof Kevin Trenberth, from the US National Center for Atmospheric Research calling his election “an unmitigated disaster for the planet”.   There has also been a surge in donations to US green groups since the election.  Trump’s selection earlier this week of Rex Tillerson, the CEO of Exxon Mobil, as his preferred choice for secretary of state caused concern among environmentalists. The company spent millions promoting falsehoods about climate science despite knowing as early as 1981 about the connection between fossil fuels and global warming.  Speaking in London, at the launch of a book on the media’s coverage of climate change by Dr James Painter at Oxford University, Stern was more sanguine about the prospect of the Exxon CEO as Trump’s chief diplomat. Stern, who came to prominence with his highly influential report on climate economics for Gordon Brown, pointed out that in recent years the oil boss has come out in favour of a carbon tax to control emissions and his company has embraced mainstream climate science. Stern also suggested that states and cities might be able to act on climate change, even if the federal government does not have it as a priority, citing the example of Ontario, Canada, which dramatically reduced emissions at the same time as Stephen Harper’s right-wing government was back-pedalling on the issue.  “The US is a complicated place,” he said. “It’s a fabric of states. It’s a fabric of cities.” One cause for hope is the state of California, which surpassed France as the sixth largest economy in the world this year, and has pledged to cut carbon emissions by 40% by 2030.  Another reason for optimism, he said, is that there are no signs of other countries stepping back from their commitments under the Paris agreement signed last December. “If the US are not going to be in the vanguard other countries will take the leadership,” he said, “China has been crystal clear that they will carry on.” Lastly, he said the market was now working against the most polluting fossil fuels. “[Trump’s pick for head of the Environmental Protection Agency] Scott Pruitt can’t persuade people to build coal-fired power stations. Why would they?”   Lord Stern understatedly bullish on #Trump & climate change - can't force building of new #coal power stations #risjenvironment But Stern warned that environmentalists must remain vigilant. “There’s no point wringing hands and weeping into whatever it is we weep into,” he said, “at the same time, be alert, be very alert. These are difficult times.” Richard Black, the director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, a non-profit thinktank, added: “There’s no way to present a Trump presidency as constructive for progress on climate change. But I think there’s a tendency to overestimate the effect of the administration,” he said. “The notion that a Trump presidency will transform the energy landscape of the US is probably a bit fanciful.”"
"It’s almost an accepted dogma that in the United States (and in several other countries), liberals are much more in favor of taking actions to curb climate change whereas conservatives block such actions. That’s certainly true within the halls of power. For instance, in the United States, it has become a litmus test for Republication candidates to deny humans are causing climate change, to try to claim that it isn’t important, in many cases to demonize the messengers (the scientists), and to work to halt climate science so we won’t know how bad the problem is. Conventional wisdom – and in fact the seemingly obvious message from this past election – is that this denial is good politics. If you want to get elected as a conservative, you have got to be anti-science.   But perhaps what we thought was so just isn’t. A fascinating study was just released by Yale and George Mason Universities that involved a national survey of American opinions. What this survey found was astonishing. Almost 70% of registered voters in the U.S. believe that their country should participate in international agreements to limit global warming. Only 1 in 8 registered voters believe the U.S. should not participate in such agreements. Similarly, 70% of respondents support limits on carbon dioxide, the most important human-emitted heat trapping gas.  Moreover, they agree to limits even if that means electricity costs will increase (although they won’t). What this means is that 7 in 10 registered voters agree with President Obama’s signature climate accomplishment, the Clean Power Plan. When considered by party affiliation, the responses were 85% for Democrats, 62% for Independents, and 52% for Republicans. Yes, even among Republicans, whose elected officials systematically mock science, the majority of voters are in agreement about the importance of taking climate change seriously. Amongst the respondents, more than 80% agreed that if a carbon tax is imposed, the revenues should be used to improve U.S. infrastructure, and large majorities support using the funds to help displaced fossil fuel workers or reducing the national debt. A deeper dive into the results reveals that American voters are more knowledgeable about energy and the energy economy than is the president elect. They recognize the connection between the new clean energy economy and their own country’s economic vitality.  More than half of voters understand that transitioning to newer and cleaner fuels will improve economic growth and create new jobs – something we are already seeing. A small minority believe that transitioning to a clean-energy system will hurt the economy. Furthermore, a majority support exploring clean and renewable energy on public lands by a very large margin compared with those who support more fossil fuel extraction on those same lands. The architects of this survey are the best of the best in this business. Dr. Anthony Leiserowitz and Dr. Ed Maibach are very well known in this area. They were joined by a talented team of colleagues from George Mason University and Yale University. I wrote to the authors and they responded: A large majority of Americans want our nation to step up and do its part to limit climate change, and nearly all Americans understand that a clean energy economy is our destiny. The single most surprising thing we learned in this survey was that 8 out of 10 Americans want our nation to limit global warming pollution by regulating it, taxing it, or both, while only 1 out of ten prefer for the United States to take neither action. It’s interesting that over the past eight years, we have seen enormous drops in the cost of renewable energy, particularly wind and solar. Now, these energy sources are economically competitive with fossil fuels. We have also seen a major reduction of cost in all forms of energy. It’s an environment that should hurt renewables. With petroleum, natural gas, and coal in such abundance, you would think solar and wind would suffer. But they haven’t.  And the U.S. consumer hasn’t suffered. Prices for energy are low, this leaves more money in peoples’ pockets at the end of the month. But along with this, the U.S. has reduced emissions. It’s exciting to have a comprehensive energy plan that works. Lower costs, lower emissions, more clean energy. It would be interesting to look forward four years to see if this trend continues. I hope it does, but the incoming transition team has been hostile to a rational energy plan. If we go backwards on the energy economy, it will hurt the environment as well as the economy. It would be ironic if the very people who voted for President-elect Trump were the ones most hurt by such a turn of events."

"The Indian government has forecast that it will exceed the renewable energy targets set in Paris last year by nearly half and three years ahead of schedule. A draft 10-year energy blueprint published this week predicts that 57% of India’s total electricity capacity will come from non-fossil fuel sources by 2027. The Paris climate accord target was 40% by 2030.  The forecast reflects an increase in private sector investment in Indian renewable energy projects over the past year, according to analysts. The draft national electricity plan also indicated that no new coal-fired power stations were likely to be required to meet Indian energy needs until at least 2027, raising further doubts over the viability of Indian mining investments overseas, such as the energy company Adani’s Carmichael mine in Queensland, the largest coalmine planned to be built in Australia. India’s energy minister, Piyush Goyal, has been appealing to wealthier nations to provide capital to invest in renewable energy projects to help the country reach and exceed the targets agreed in Paris in November 2015. Significant state investment has not been forthcoming, but Tim Buckley, a director at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said India had made up the shortfall with an influx of capital from the domestic and overseas private sectors in the past 12 months. Japan’s Softbank has committed to invest $20bn (£16.2bn) in the Indian solar energy sector, in conjunction with Taiwanese company Foxconn and Indian business group Bharti Enterprises. In September the largely French state-owned energy company EDF announced it would invest $2bn in Indian renewable energy projects, citing the country’s enormous projected demand and “fantastic” potential of its wind and solar radiation. Adani opened the world’s largest solar plant in Tamil Nadu earlier this year, and in October the energy conglomerate Tata announced that it would aim to generate as much as 40% of its energy from renewable sources by 2025. Buckley said India’s “absolutely transformational” forecast was also driven by technological advancements that have led to the price of solar energy falling by 80% in the past five years. “India is moving beyond fossil fuels at a pace scarcely imagined only two years ago,” he said. “Goyal has put forward an energy plan that is commercially viable and commercially justified without subsidies, so you have big global corporations and utilities committing to it.” In the 2027 forecasts, India aims to generate 275 gigawatts of total renewable energy, in addition to 72GW of hydroenergy and 15GW of nuclear energy. Nearly 100GW would come from “other zero emission” sources, with advancements in energy efficiency expected to reduce the need for capacity increases by 40GW over 10 years.  About 50GW of coal power projects being developed in India would be “largely stranded” under the forecast, Buckley said, with official modelling showing that “none of these plants are required before 2022 and only possible before 2027”."
"In Sudan’s eastern state of Gedaref, nicknamed “the granary” for its vast rows of sesame, sorghum and millet, banks of sediment and gravel are popping up as high as hills around the farms – the result of deforestation and erratic rains causing watering holes to overflow.  Locals call them karab, meaning “something useless”, says environmental scientist Tarig El Gamri, standing atop one such mound. He points out the water mark swirls etched around one of many deep gullies near the village of Wad Hassan, a 45-minute drive east of Gedaref city.  “Climate change affected the intensity of rainfall. When it is very intense, you have very quick and very high runoffs, and this is what we are seeing now,” says El Gamri, a project coordinator at the Sudan Higher Council for Environment and Natural Resources. “They spoil the soil. Now you see they cannot cultivate such land, because it has lost the levelling.”  In 2015, Gedaref had 70ml of rain. This year, it has had 600ml so far. These extremes have led to flash floods and desertification, which is destroying arable land.  “Last year, the rain didn’t come and everything was destroyed,” says Aisha Youssef Ahmed in the neighbouring village of Siraj Alnour. More intense droughts and failed rains have ruined harvests and also affected livestock: the cows that used to grow big and strong are skinny and often have to be sold off. Ahmed, 65, never thought that “rich, lush and productive” Gedaref would become a place “where everything has got worse”. But while floods from overflowing wadis are washing away fertile topsoils or morphing farmland into unworkable shapes, the annual riverbank floods that people relied on to grow watermelons have declined due to heat, evaporation and dam construction in Sudan and across the border in Ethiopia. “The river level has changed over the past 15 or 20 years,” says Wad Hassan’s chief, Ahmed Omar, standing on a rock next to the water where men paddle out in canoes to catch ever more scarce fish. “[The water level] used to be much higher.” Omar, 60, has seven children, all of whom will become farmers in a state where most people farm and more than half the population lives below the poverty line. Only a few children make the two-hour walk from Siraj Alnour – home to about 220 families – to a village that has a school. The scorching temperatures so exhaust and dizzy the children that they often have to be put to bed after school. Others are told to play only in the sparse patches of shade offered by thorn trees. “Summer was always hot, but the winters are getting hotter. It used to be cooler, like 15C-20C” says Siraj Alnour’s chief, Idriss Mohammed Abdallah, who remembers the many trees of his boyhood in the 1970s. “Year after year they disappeared and the forest shrank as the village grew.”  It was then that the desert and gullies moved in. “We had to shift here because the land was moving and pushed us back,” he says, standing in one of many gullies that threatens the new village.  “Now it depends on the trees, as the desert is moving towards us. People won’t be able to settle here. They won’t stay in the same place,” he says – even though “there is nowhere else to go” for farmers in one of Sudan’s most important breadbaskets. Khalid Hashim Ibrahim, the state agricultural coordinator, says: “All of Sudan is affected by the low production in Gedaref, and also the production here is exported to other countries, especially neighbouring countries like Ethiopia and Eritrea and also the Gulf countries, like Saudi and the Emirates – for animals and food. This is very clear if you go to the north of the state. Some agricultural areas [have] now become sand soil.”  By way of example, Ibrahim points to Butana village’s population shrinking from 72,000 to about 12,000 seasonally, and the resulting conflicts over grazing lands or services in swelling cities. The UN development programme has been running pilot climate change adaptation programmes in Butana, Wad Hassan and Sirag Elnour to try to stop good soils from shifting or drying up, and farmers waiting on rains and grains to survive. Solar-powered water pumps have eased the reliance on rain-fed agriculture and allowed people to plant a greater range of crops. “Now, because of these extra irrigation methods, we can grow all vegetables,” says Omar. Between the houses lie many community gardens full of tangled vines. Farmers proudly show off two varieties of cucumber and kiss some of the fruits of their newfound, year-round irrigation. Small nurseries – comprising of a few rows of mud and wire mesh frames – are growing thousands of seedlings into trees, which are planted around homes and fields for protection against the elements. The introduction of butane gas has stopped people from using charcoal, while heavy fines are imposed on anyone who cuts down trees – which people now understand are their only defence. Unless people really start working to save Gedaref’s soils, says Ibrahim, “the future is very dark”.  “The period between the 1970s to 2000 was very comfortable here in Gedaref, but now there are some big problems,” says Khalid Hisham Ibrahim, echoing the view of several farmers. “Low productivity, high temperatures and high fluctuation of rainfall … There is a consensus about this phenomena,” as well as about climate change-related health issues like increasing outbreaks of malaria.  Ibrahim, who farms to supplement his tiny government salary, has wondered whether he should leave one of Sudan’s only peaceful patches of green to find work in the capital, Khartoum, or – like thousands of others – cross the deserts and the seas for a new life. “No, Khartoum not good – to Gulf countries, to other countries,” he says, before guffawing at his next thought. “Maybe migrate to America!” • Hannah McNeish’s trip was funded by a grant from the Earth Journalism Network"
"Congress quashed the hopes late Tuesday of reviving the United States’ export credit agency, which had been aiming for a stopgap lifeline allowing them to approve more than $20bn in new deals, many of which pose imminent harms to the environment. Now, the fate of a pristine coral reef, an east African mangrove forest, and the livelihoods of farmers and fishermen in a south-east Asian river delta lie in the hands of a new Congress and president.  Since 2009, when Barack Obama became president, the Export-Import Bank has signed almost $34bn worth of low-interest loans and guarantees to companies and foreign governments to build, expand and promote fossil fuel projects abroad, according to an investigation by the Guardian and Columbia University’s Graduate School of Journalism’s Energy and Environmental Reporting Project. That spending has undermined Obama’s record on climate change emissions. And critics say several proposed bank financing projects would further erode Obama’s climate legacy, undercutting the carbon reductions he has made domestically with new emissions abroad. Among the roughly 30 new projects the bank is considering are a coal-fueled power plant in Vietnam’s Mekong delta; a natural gas liquefaction plant in Mozambique; power plants in Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Pakistan; and a petrochemical complex in Egypt expected to emit 3m metric tonnes of greenhouse gases annually. “Financing projects like this are both a climate disaster and they also have these local impacts,” said Kate DeAngelis, an international policy analyst at Friends of the Earth. Whether the bank can, or will, finance these projects is uncertain. Lawmakers were expected to take action this week that would have revived the authority of the bank to pursue at least $20bn in deals that have been piling up since July 2015, when it was blocked from financing new deals costing more than $10m. But a stopgap funding measure unveiled on Tuesday didn’t include a provision. Congress is expected to vote on the bill later this week. Democrats and a majority of Republicans support the bank, but a few Republicans, led by Alabama senator Richard Shelby, have blocked the bank from being fully operational for more than a year. Shelby, chairman of the Senate committee on banking, housing and urban affairs, has refused to hold hearings for new board appointees. Supporters say the bank’s limitations have put American jobs and the wellbeing of US businesses on the line. A year ago, General Electric announced plans to shift more than 500 jobs from three states to France, China and Hungary because US export financing wasn’t available. Supporters had hoped to incorporate language in this week’s budget bill allowing the bank’s board to approve deals costing more than $10m without a quorum. The bank is one board member short. Andy Koenig, vice-president for policy at the conservative non-profit Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, said many of the pending deals are “as close to the approval process as they can possibly get” and could be “disbursed and go in rapid succession” if the bank’s deal-making power is restored. He added that little is known about which foreign companies and US exporters would benefit. “We have a lot of questions about what’s in those pending transactions,” he said. Caroline Scullin, senior vice-president for communications at the bank, said the bank does not disclose financial information about projects, including the amount of proposed financing, until the deal is added to the board’s agenda. She said the Mozambique LNG project is unlikely to come before the board for several months. In the Mozambique province of Cabo Delgado, a proposal to construct an onshore liquefied natural gas plant could result in the relocation of thousands, the destruction of fragile coral reefs, and greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to an estimated 5.2m metric tonnes of carbon dioxide each year, more than an average coal plant, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. In 2010, Texas-based firm Anadarko struck gaseous gold about 30 miles offshore: enough natural gas to justify building a $15bn gas processing facility on land that an estimated 2,700 Mozambicans call home. As part of the proposal, an underwater pipeline would be constructed to move gas from drill ships to an onshore processing plant. Offshore reserves have since yielded discoveries of an estimated 75tn cubic ft of gas, more than two and half times the amount consumed in the US in 2015. The discovery of natural gas, which would be liquefied onshore before its transport to local and foreign markets such as China and India, has the potential to revive Mozambique’s plunging national economy and stimulate job growth and investment in infrastructure like roads and hospitals. But although the plant’s initial design was revised to avoid the most sensitive habitats, Anadarko’s environmental impact assessment spells out a list of wide-ranging consequences: clearance of mangroves, introduction of invasive species from ballast shipping water, greenhouse gas and toxic sulfur dioxide emissions, soil erosion, and ecological losses to wetlands and the birds, reptiles and amphibians that inhabit them. Coastal seabeds would be dredged to create shipping lanes and a corridor for the 30 mile-long pipeline, which scientists say could damage coral reef networks. Natural gas, which is made up primarily of methane, burns cleaner than coal and oil. But methane, which scientists say is more than 30 times as potent as carbon dioxide in its greenhouse effect, frequently leaks from pipes, wells and processing plants. Research has shown methane leaks are consistently underestimated, and the EPA established new rules in 2016 designed to curb methane leakage. Even so, said Anadarko spokesman John Christiansen, the fuel source “is vital toward reaching carbon-reduction objectives as stated by the Obama administration on multiple occasions”. It’s unclear if the bank will finance the project and, if so, for how much. Officials from Anadarko declined to provide details, and bank officials say the amount of proposed funding is considered business confidential. Because of the magnitude of the Mozambique project, if the bank doesn’t provide financing Anadarko will have to look to other foreign export credit agencies, said Christiansen. There are 38 other official export credit agencies. The bank is also considering financing a 1,200MW coal-fired power plant in south-west Vietnam, despite moves starting in 2014 to limit such financing to only the poorest countries. Congress has since taken actions to allow the bank to finance coal projects in countries that are not among the world’s most impoverished, such as Vietnam. The Long Phu 1 power plant, which is currently under construction near Vietnam’s Mekong delta, threatens nearby farms and the local fishing industry, say environmentalists. And although the bank recognizes the plant could have significant environmental and social impacts, supporters say it will provide electricity for the growing demands of towns and cities in southern Vietnam. Government projections say that by 2030, coal is likely to be the country’s most relied upon source of electricity. The Vietnam government has listed Long Phu 1 among a list of nearly 30 facilities that will receive special monitoring for environmental pollution. Hang Nguyen, management assistant for the non-profit sustainable energy group Green Innovation and Development Centre, praised the plant’s proposed use of a cleaner and more modern form of power generation. Even so, she said: “It still leaves a big concern about the environmental and social impacts.” “I really don’t know why the US Ex-Im Bank decides to consider funding for coal power plants in Vietnam because the policy of Barack Obama is quite strong,” Nguyen said. “We thought that Obama wanted to stop coal in the US and he also wanted to stop coal in other countries.” The Energy and Environmental Reporting Project is supported by the Blanchette Hooker Rockefeller Fund, Energy Foundation, Open Society Foundations, Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Rockefeller Family Fund, Lorana Sullivan Foundation and the Tellus Mater Foundation.

"Sat in the centrally heated school Christmas concert, I sang, like countless others, In the Bleak Midwinter, not knowing the half of it. Christina Rossetti’s mournful, yearning poem, later set to music by Gustav Holst, was written in 1872, but speaks of a “bleak midwinter, long ago”, relocating the nativity to a chill northern landscape where, “Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone.”  If Rossetti conjures a folk memory, the best candidate for that bleak history is the decade from 1430-1440, according to a new paper published in Climate of the Past, the open access journal of the European Geosciences Union. It was a period of “exceptional cold” driven by “chaotic internal variability within the climate system”. Crops failed, food and fuel prices rose. Malnutrition and famine struck many parts of Europe. Weakened populations fell prey to disease and pestilence, themselves worsened by environmental and living conditions. It was such a threat to the medieval order that authorities responded by changing trade policy, banning food exports and introducing new approaches to protect people from hunger, such as communal granaries for storage. In a warming world today, we are more used to rising temperatures leading to weather extremes and crop failures. In both 2007-2008 and 2010-2011, extreme climatic conditions led to food shortages and price rises globally. Drought and wildfires in Russia and Ukraine led to controls on wheat exports. A long-suspected irony of global warming is that Arctic ice-melt will slow or even switch off the Gulf Stream that warms Europe. An extraordinarily high Arctic temperature anomaly was one of 2016’s most alarming climate stories, with the freak temperature referred to as “insane” by the Washington Post.  It now seems more likely that, rather than being plunged back into a medieval deep-freeze, consequential changes in the Gulf Stream will merely slow the warming of Europe. But others have pointed out that this, linked to the sheer volatility and unpredictability of a warming climate, could still produce more severe winter weather patterns, such as snowfall and blizzards. One thing Europe’s bleakest decade reminds us, is that even without two centuries of being destabilised by industrial pollution, as is the case today, the climate can flip rapidly and dramatically. For that reason, and to prevent loading nature’s environmental dice even more heavily against us, the obligation has fallen on the world’s wealthiest countries to change themselves as rapidly as the climate is capable of changing.  One of the most tenacious notions is that we are stuck with broadly the lifestyle choices and economy that we have. Yet 2016 has demonstrated how quickly politics can change. And there is a huge amount we can learn from our own past and ability to engineer rapid change, whether the uptake of new energy sources and technologies, the building of transport infrastructures and cities, or new social contracts to guarantee the health, education, freedom and rights of populations. To grow the conversation on rapid transition, several organisations ranging from the New Weather Institute, to Steps at Sussex University, the Manchester Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, the Centre for Alternative Technology, and energy researchers at Leeds University and have been working together over the last year. In 2017 they hope to push against a counsel of despair that the world will not live up to the climate commitments made in Paris in 2015, and demonstrate how rapid change is not only possible but has happened before. The next in this particular series of articles will be the last. It began 100 months ago with the objective of charting action in a crucial period to address potentially catastrophic climate change.  Back then, we proposed that with conservative estimates, this was the period of time before it was no longer “likely” that we would stay below a temperature rise of 2C. For the last of the series I will be asking a range of people what our chances are now, and what it will take to stay the right side of that line, and go further to meet the Paris commitment of keeping to a maximum 1.5C rise. Just as the climate can flip suddenly from cold to warm, there is every chance of a thaw in our frozen incapacity to accept the need for rapid change and act."

I found not a single reference to one of the key drivers of climate change, the relentless increase of population, now scheduled to be 11.5 billion by 2100.

"Scientists are forecasting ice-melting temperatures in the middle of winter for some parts of the Arctic for the second year in a row. And analysis shows such recent record temperatures there would have been virtually impossible without human greenhouse emissions. Over the coming days, some parts of the Arctic are expected to get gusts of warm air that are more than 20C hotter than usual for this time of year, some of which will tip over the 0C melting temperature of water. Maximum temperatures in parts of the Arctic will be warmer than the maximum over most of Canada for the next five days, according the global forecasting system run by the US National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa). The extreme temperatures predicted coincide with record low sea-ice levels in the Arctic, which have already been wreaking havoc with weather North America, Europe and Asia, according to leading climate scientists. A low pressure system near Greenland is pulling the warm air towards the Arctic, in a similar pattern to that seen in 2015. And a paper published this month showed events like that, called “midwinter warming”, were occurring more frequently, and made more likely by the loss of winter sea ice – something itself caused by climate change. With less ice, warm air moved closer to the Arctic and could then more easily be swept over it, the scientists claimed. “These are very strange temperatures and are getting very close to hitting the freezing point, which is incredible for this time of year,” said Andrew King, a climate scientist from the University of Melbourne in Australia. But it’s not just predicted maximum temperatures that have been extreme. November and December have seen record average temperatures over the Arctic, averaging 2.5C above the usual for this time of year. Temperature anomalies like that have been linked to changes in migration patterns of marine mammals, cause mass starvation and deaths of reindeer as well as impact the habitats of polar bears. Now King and colleagues have shown the recent extreme average temperatures are almost certainly caused by climate change. And while they are still rare events – expected once every 200 years – they will be average by the year 2040. King and colleagues compared model simulations with and without the influence of human-caused greenhouse gas concentrations. “The record November-December temperatures in the Arctic are not seen in the natural world simulations where human influences have been removed,” King wrote in a piece published in The Conversation. “In comparison, in the current climate with human effects included, this event has at least a one-in-200-year return time.” By the 2040s, the event is expected to occur every second year, on average. The work has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, but uses methods the team have used several times before in work that has been peer-reviewed."

"Climate scientists have done a great job winning the scientific arguments about climate change. To be clear about what I mean, we have done a very good job investigating whether or not the Earth’s climate is changing (it is), what is causing the change (humans), how much will it change in the future, and what will be the impacts.  There are no longer any reputable scientists who disagree with the principle view of that human emissions will cause climate change that will lead to societal and human losses (they already are). So, I use the term “win” here not to indicate it was a battle of “us” versus “them”. Rather, I mean “win” in that we have faithfully followed the scientific method, explored alternative hypotheses, checked and rechecked our work, and have come to a truth that is unassailable. We’ve done our job.  In the past, that is where our job ended. I mean maybe we would help with a press release on a breaking study, do an interview. But only rarely. Now, particularly with an issue like climate change, that has such an impact on peoples’ lives, scientists are being asked to go further. We are being asked to effectively communicate to the public why this matters, what will happen if we take action or not, and what some trade-offs are. This means we can be put in an uncomfortable position where we’re forced to advocate. Some of my colleagues are understandably skittish about advocacy and avoid it religiously. Others, like myself, will advocate on occasion but be very clear about when the scientist hat comes off and the advocate hat is put on.  But regardless, scientists are tasked with communicating complex science in a short amount of time, to people with varied backgrounds. This is a really tough ask, especially when we are not trained at it. Fortunately, we are getting help. The art of effective scientific communication is being shared with scientists to help us properly convey concepts. A very recent publication by several communication experts has been published in the World Meteorological Organization Bulletin. The lead author, Susan Hassol and her co-authors weave together effective language and accurate science in an uncommonly profound way. The results are simple suggestions that the rest of us can use to be both true to facts as well as clear. The article centers around the influence human-caused warming has had on natural disasters. We know that some disasters, such as coastal and flash floods, heat waves, heavy rainfall, and drought are increasing. But how do we talk about the human effect on such events? The authors remind us that heavy rainfall that can cause flooding has increased markedly because warm air holds more water.  Regarding heat waves, the summer-long extreme heat of 2013 in Australia was made approximately 5 times more likely due to human-caused warming; and there are other examples reviewed. Now, this doesn’t mean that climate change was the sole cause of a particular event. And this is the fallback position of most scientists. Our hesitancy to highlight the role of human warming in individual events makes listeners think that the influence of climate change on extreme weather is smaller than it really is.  It is more accurate to say that all weather events are now influenced by climate change. Some weather events are coming on stronger; they last longer, or are more severe. As a result, climate change is increasing the impact of these events. The authors reviewed various examples of extreme weather events for which attribution studies allow scientists to make meaningful statements about the role of human-caused climate change.  Another point made in the paper is that with acute weather events, speed of reporting is key. We need to speak with as much clarity as possible while a weather event is still in the media. Fortunately, advances in scientific understanding are enabling us to make statements about the human influence on extreme events that can be conveyed through the media to the interested public. It is important to make these connections while events are still a matter of public interest. The authors note three factors that enable confident conclusions about the influence of climate change on certain types of extreme weather. First, we need to have a strong understanding of the physical processes involved in the extreme weather event. Second, high-quality observations are needed so we can assess whether the type of event (such as flood, heat wave, drought, storm, etc.) is changing over time. Finally, climate models are necessary that can simulate the type of extreme weather event.  So, as we move forward, we must ensure that these three items are maintained. For instance, if we neglect funding of observational equipment, we may no longer be able to conclude whether and how events are changing as the climate warms.  This is a good, readable report. I would encourage not only scientists to read this, but also anyone else who regularly communicates climate change effects to an audience, whether receptive or hostile."
"The palm oil industry is one of the world’s biggest, projected to be worth $88bn (£70bn) by 2022. While it has pumped billions into the local economies of countries like Indonesia and Malaysia, the aggressive expansion of the industry has also become synonymous with widespread environmental and community destruction. With global demand increasing, Africa has become the new frontier of industrial palm oil production. As much as 22m hectares (54m acres) of land in west and central Africa could be converted to palm plantations over the next five years. As the industry sets its sights on Africa, how can we ensure the mistakes of the past are not repeated? Is it possible to establish a sustainable palm oil industry that operates in a way that protects environmental and human rights and provides local communities with genuine opportunities? These questions formed the heart of a seminar discussion, hosted by the Guardian and supported by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), that brought together a panel of experts from civil society and the private sector, chaired by journalist Eliza Anyangwe.  “Investment and expansion in palm oil is growing – and growing fast – in Africa,” said Abraham Baffoe, Africa regional director at Proforest, an environmental rights and responsible sourcing NGO. “If palm is planned and implemented very well then it has the potential to provide jobs and economic development – but if planning and implementation is poor, it has the potential to create deforestation, loss of habitat and loss of livelihood in local communities.” Last month at the UN climate conference in Marrakesh, ministers from seven African countries pledged to implement sustainable palm oil production, saying that while Africa was open for business, palm oil investment must comply with the principles of sustainability, transparency and the protection of human rights. Baffoe acknowledged this as an important and significant step, but raised concerns that the high-level commitments at COP22 are not yet reflected in the way large-scale oil palm plantations are being established in countries such as Liberia and Cameroon. The agri-industrial model used by many palm oil producers in south-east Asia usually involves companies leasing land from the government. Local people are then asked for their consent and offered development incentives and jobs at the plantations. This, warned Baffoe, was being unhesitatingly replicated in Africa by companies racing to secure concessions without acknowledging the issues it could raise at local community level. “When land is legally owned by the government, communities still have traditional-use rights and that is a form of ownership,” he said. In Baffoe’s experience, palm oil companies in Africa are striking land deals with the government first, before speaking with local communities. “This is how you get conflict,” he said. The concept of Free Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) is at the heart of the sustainability agenda for the palm oil industry. The principle – that a community has the right to give or withhold its consent to proposed projects that may affect lands that they customarily own, occupy or use – is now a key doctrine in international law and central to the RSPO’s principles and criteria. Tom Lomax, a lawyer and human rights coordinator at NGO Forest Peoples Programme, was highly critical of the tactics he had witnessed palm oil companies using to secure the consent of local communities in Liberia. “I could write a book about palm oil companies’ methods for manipulating consent,” he said. Lomax described examples of palm companies offering local people jobs before they had secured the consent of the whole community. “Division within communities has been pursued by companies to undermine the principle of consent. You can really undermine [the community’s] cohesion, their collectability, their ability to make their own decisions as a whole – and once this has been done, cohesion is almost irreparable.” In response to the assertion by other panelists that palm oil investment brought development and helped lift local people out of poverty, Lomax argued that economic analysis (pdf) had shown that the palm oil industry had contributed very little to the south-east Asian economy. “What we need is a palm oil industry [in Africa] based on secure land rights – and this is something we don’t currently have,” he said. “We need a palm oil industry based on a mixed economy that will satisfy [local people’s] food needs, their cultural needs and their income needs. Yes it will take investment, but not the extractive kind that treats local land as freely available and local people as cheap labour.” All the panelists agreed that identifying “the community” from which consent was required presented serious challenges: both to those groups looking to protect local people from exploitation and to the palm oil companies seeking approval. “Often, people who are considered a community [by the palm oil companies] are not a community at all,” said Lomax. In places like Liberia, whole administrative districts have been labelled as one coherent community by palm oil companies, he said, when the people in a potential palm oil concession are, in fact, culturally, economically and socially diverse. Christopher Stewart, head of corporate responsibility and sustainability at Singapore-listed agribusiness Olam International, agreed this presented private sector companies with a complex challenge: “Companies often have to make very difficult decisions and are very pressed internally about how to address these very difficult problems [with consent]. The intermediaries that often operate between themselves and the communities are not necessarily fully trustworthy either. “It’s very complex. We need to keep an open mind and encourage partnership – and encourage local players especially – to participate in this debate.” However, Stewart insisted that the agri-industrial model could still work to the benefit of local communities if sustainable palm oil production remained at the heart of a company’s investment model. He cited the example of Olam’s palm oil operations in Gabon – where the company has planted almost 50,000 hectares of palm – as evidence that sustainable production can be implemented in Africa. He pointed out that even though the company had leased land from the government of Gabon for 15 years, anyone from the local community who didn’t want the land they were using for farming to be converted to palm could have it excluded from the concession. “We have seen an incredible transformation in the communities we have reached out to,” Stewart said, pointing out that when Olam first arrived in one rural community it had malnourished children, people subsisting on bushmeat and no electricity, healthcare or employment opportunities. When Olam offered the local people employment, 95% said yes.  “The town now has a thriving market and Olam is putting $1.6m a month into the local community,” said Stewart. “Whatever problems come with palm oil development, doing it right can be a win-win situation.” However, Stewart conceded that the company’s self-proclaimed success implementing sustainable frameworks in a country such as Gabon won’t necessarily translate to other countries.  Another panelist, Rachel Barré, sustainable sourcing manager at L’Oréal, said that the company’s experiences in south-east Asia had convinced her of the need for strong leadership from the top of the supply chain. “We rely on these [raw] materials to manufacture our products and we are convinced it can contribute to the whole economy if it is well done and well managed,” she said. However, Barré acknowledged that as an “upstream” link in the palm oil supply chain, L’Oréal was far removed from the communities affected at plantation level. With more than 40% of global palm oil production coming from smallholder farmers, could a focus on developing a smallholder model, instead of just rolling out large agri-industrial plantations, work for the expansion of palm oil across Africa? Not without a lot of investment from the private sector, said Baffoe, who claimed governments were often not willing to provide the necessary support for farmers to participate in the palm oil boom. “Palm oil development has a very significant initial cost and that cost has been a constraint for smallholders, he said. “Civil society must look at how it can support smallholders in meeting the costs of establishing their own plantations.” Given that average smallholder palm oil yields are significantly lower in Africa than in other palm regions, such as Malaysia or Indonesia, smallholder farmers in Africa will need support from the private sector if they are to see the benefits of palm oil expansion into the continent, said Barré. “You need to put in the investment and technical assistance so farmers can get their palm to the market at the right price in the right conditions,” she said. With governments keen to continue granting palm oil companies large-scale concessions across Africa, the race to ensure that this is an industry that develops along sustainable guidelines seems far from won."
"Few casual observers would recall the winner of the men’s 105kg weightlifting category at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. Many, though, will remember the athlete with the broad smile who danced his way into a 14th-placed finish. David Katoatau is an unlikely climate change activist. An affable weightlifter from Kiribati, a collection of atolls spread across an area of the Pacific Ocean the size of India, Katoatau never intended to become a global ambassador for his small country. Yet with rising sea levels posing an existential threat to the i-Kiribati (as inhabitants of Kiribati are known), the Olympian felt compelled to raise awareness.  Dancing has always been part of Katoatau’s lifting routine. He dances when he wins and he dances when he loses. Katoatau first raised eyebrows for his joyous celebrations after winning gold at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, and then burst into the collective imagination with his performances in Rio de Janeiro. Yet beneath the jubilant dancing is a serious message. Katoatau’s homeland is imperilled by global warming. “I want to see a future for Kiribati and our youth,” he tells Guardian Australia. “I don’t want my country to disappear.”  Travelling to Kiribati is no easy feat. From Australia, it can take almost as long to reach this isolated Pacific country – if connections are not favourable – as flying to Europe. Two flights a week from Nadi, Fiji, constitute the primary link between Kiribati’s capital and most-populated atoll, South Tarawa, and the distant outside world. After several hours of endless turquoise ocean, reef islands suddenly materialise just north of the equator.  A British colony until 1979, 110,000-strong Kiribati has since become synonymous with climate change. Most of Tarawa sits less than two metres above sea level, and the impact of storms has become increasingly severe. Even to the deeply religious i-Kiribati, many of whom refuse to believe that their homeland might one day become uninhabitable, the reality of climate change is now undeniable. According to a World Bank report, by 2100 more than 80% of the land mass of Kiribati’s main atolls could be inundated during tidal surges.  Climate change also exacerbates the innumerable other challenges faced by Kiribati. The island nation is crippled by non-communicable diseases, and missing limbs attributable to diabetes are a common sight. One of the least developed states in the Pacific, Kiribati is dependent on fishing licence revenue and foreign aid. But with rising sea levels threatening its very existence, long-term development funding can be hard to find.  A visit to Katoatau’s family home in Buota, the last atoll in the Tarawa chain connected by road, underlines the immediate threat global warming poses to the residents of Kiribati. Perched on an elevated platform in his tebuia, a traditional dwelling, the weightlifter’s father gazes out towards the high-tide mark just metres away.  “You can see the impact of climate change here with your own eyes,” Katoatau Utimawa says. “Before the sea was further down the beach, now it comes up close to the house. There is water here on both sides, so if the tide becomes much higher there will be no land left at all.”  Indeed, a king tide has already washed away the house Katoatau built after his Glasgow triumph in 2014. “The new house was built next door,” says Utimawa. “When the high tide came, it was washed away. Our son is a weightlifting champion and told the world about the threat of climate change. And then he became a victim of climate change himself.”  Given his childhood inspiration, it is no surprise that Katoatau’s athletic achievements have transcended sport. The 32-year-old grew up in Nauru, where his father worked in the phosphate industry, and was drawn to weightlifting by the success of a local competitor.  “At the time there was a champion in Nauru, Marcus Stephen, who won the country’s first-ever Commonwealth Games gold medal,” Katoatau says. “I wanted to be like him.” Stephen claimed seven golds across three Games, before entering politics and later serving as the president of Nauru.  Katoatau’s family returned to Kiribati, where the budding young weightlifter was confronted by the absence of any suitable facilities in his homeland. Without a training venue, he practiced barefoot on the beach after rising at 6am each morning – the barbell became too hot to touch once the sun started beating down. At 16, Katoatau began attending international competitions and moved to the Oceania Weightlifting Institute, at the time based in Apia, Samoa, and now located in Noumea, New Caledonia. The enthusiastic athlete soon became a sporting talisman for Kiribati, with Katoatau competing in the 2008 Beijing Olympics and 2012 London Olympics. It would be in Glasgow, though, where he gained a global reputation.  “We were overjoyed with David’s performance at the 2014 Commonwealth Games,” his father says. “That was the first time Kiribati had ever won a gold medal at a major international event. The whole country was happy.” It was also in Scotland that Katoatau first became a climate spokesman for Kiribati. As his uncle David Lambourne muses, it was perhaps inevitable that the successful weightlifter would become linked with the threat faced by his homeland.  “As David’s international prominence grew, the foreign media realised that they did not know much about Kiribati, but what they did know was climate change,” says Lambourne, an Australian who moved to Kiribati in the 1990s as a volunteer and went on to spend nearly a decade as the country’s solicitor general. “So in Glasgow he was inevitably asked about climate change, and in the ensuing years he has become deeply engaged in the cause. In some ways, he is an accidental climate activist.”  Katoatau quickly embraced the role, and in 2015 wrote a moving open letter calling attention to the plight of his compatriots. “I beg the countries of the world to see what is happening to Kiribati,” he wrote. “The simple truth is that we do not have the resources to save ourselves.  “We will be the first to go. It will be the extinction of a race. Open your eyes and look to the other low lying level islands around the Pacific – they will soon fall with us. In the not too distant future we will all drown.”  Already popular in his homeland before the Commonwealth Games, Katoatau’s success in Glasgow saw him anointed Kiribati’s “golden boy”. His face was soon on billboards across Tarawa spruiking everything from tea to crackers, and most locals express a deep sense of pride when asked about the weightlifter.  “Kiribati is a very small country and has never really had a prominent athlete before,” Lambourne says. “People here identify strongly with him – he is a great ambassador. They see in David a representation of what they want the rest of the world to see in Kiribati. He is one of the very few i-Kiribati who have made any mark on the world stage.”  Katoatau’s international profile would rise further in August, when he travelled to Rio de Janeiro for the 2016 Olympics. Despite finishing 14th in his category, the infectious enthusiasm Katoatau demonstrated through his dancing – and the deeper underlying message – captivated a global audience. His routine soon went viral, and major media outlets were effusive in their coverage of this squat i-Kiribati sportsman.  “David has been able to attract the world’s attention to Kiribati,” says the minister for women, youth and social affairs, David Collins, who also has responsibility for sport and heads the Kiribati national Olympic committee. “I have received phone calls and emails from all over the world about David’s dancing at the last Olympics. He truly deserves his position as our golden boy, and we pray that he keeps going. I believe he can make it to the 2018 Commonwealth Games.”  While defending his medal on the Gold Coast may be first on the agenda, Katoatau also harbours longer-term ambitions to coach the next generation of i-Kiribati weightlifters. “I will return to Kiribati,” he says firmly when asked about retirement plans, despite the relative safety of his present home Noumea from the climate change threat. “I already have a coaching diploma, and I can train all the lifters to become like me.”  Weightlifting is booming in Kiribati, due in no small part to Katoatau. Although a lack of resources still hampers the sport, and it trails behind football and volleyball from a participation perspective, Kiribati could soon become a regional weightlifting powerhouse. Given the health problems and poor diet endured by many locals, increased youth participation in sport has considerable societal benefits.  “David’s success has had a very positive impact for the local weightlifting federation,” says Collins. “Just last month he came home to help out in a youth selection program, and participation doubled with kids trying out for a chance to train at the same institute as David.”  Katoatau’s story is inspiring and dispiriting in equal measure. As world leaders squabbled over minor emission reductions at international meetings, this smiling sportsman from an isolated atoll in the Pacific took matters into his own hands. Kiribati is now inextricably associated with rising sea levels in the global consciousness, thanks in part to its dancing weightlifter, and donor-funded adaptation programs are helping to reduce Kiribati’s vulnerability.   “You only need to look at discussions on social media about Kiribati to see David’s impact,” says Lambourne, one of the few expatriates to learn the language and fully integrate into local society. “You had people who had never heard of Kiribati before, and were suddenly aware not only of Kiribati as a nation but also the existential threat it faces. That is a hugely important message.”  Yet it might be too late to save Kiribati. The former government bought 6,000 acres in Fiji in 2014 as part of its “migration with dignity” scheme, while an i-Kiribati man generated headlines last year after unsuccessfully seeking climate change refugee status in New Zealand. Even if predictions of Kiribati’s imminent reclamation by the waves are premature – as some scientists suggest – there is little doubt that coastal erosion, drinking water shortages and increased population density will render Kiribati uninhabitable this century unless drastic action is taken.  Despite his global profile, Katoatau sometimes feels helpless. “I really do not know,” the weightlifter says when asked whether his message is being heard. “I hope the world is listening. I hope someone comes to help my country. We are suffering. But I can only try my best.”"
"Australia’s chief scientist, Alan Finkel, has said investment in the electricity sector has stalled because of “policy instability and uncertainty” – and he’s warned that current federal climate policy settings will not allow Australia to meet its emissions reduction targets under the Paris agreement. In a 58-page report that has been circulated before Friday’s Council of Australian Governments meeting between the prime minister and the premiers, Finkel has also given implicit endorsement to an emissions intensity trading scheme for the electricity industry to help manage the transition to lower-emissions energy sources.  While there is no concrete recommendation to that effect, the report, obtained by Guardian Australia, references the evidence from energy regulators that such a scheme would integrate best “with the electricity market’s pricing and risk management framework” and “had the lowest economic costs and the lowest impact on electricity prices”. Finkel also notes advice from the Climate Change Authority which says market mechanisms have the lowest average cost of abatement, and of the options modelled, an emissions intensity scheme “had the lowest impact on average residential electricity prices”. The positive commentary from the chief scientist cuts directly across political arguments the Turnbull government has made since dumping its nascent attempt to use the review of the Direct Action policy to explore an intensity trading scheme for electricity – equating carbon pricing with higher power prices for consumers. The Finkel report was commissioned by the energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, at the last meeting of state and federal energy ministers, which followed the political controversy that erupted after South Australia endured a statewide blackout in September. The Turnbull government has wanted to use the much-anticipated report as a springboard to wind back state-based renewable energy targets, which it says are making the electricity market less secure. But while noting renewables present ongoing challenges to network stability, challenges that have to be carefully managed, Finkel has pointedly warned the federal government its current climate policy is inadequate as it stands. He also makes the point that a lack of clarity at a federal level about policy and regulatory settings can also affect network security and prices for consumers. Finkel’s report says the relatively short horizon of federal climate policy, coupled with the Abbott government’s attack on the federal renewable energy target, has put investment in abeyance. “There is evidence that investment in the electricity sector has stalled and investors have become less responsive to investment signals,” the report says. “This is due to policy instability and uncertainty driven by numerous reviews into the renewable energy target and a lack of clarity about the policies to reduce emissions after 2020.” “Investment in renewable energy dropped by 52% between 2013 and 2014 and has not yet recovered to the level required to satisfy the RET [renewable energy target].” Finkel says there is a pressing need for clarity in policy to unlock much-needed investment in the national electricity market, and he says if the clarity fails to materialise, electricity prices will rise for consumers, and energy security will become more of an issue.  “For businesses to take risks on the future and invest, they need to be confident that emissions reduction policies and the mechanisms to achieve them are consistent with Australia’s international commitments and will not change drastically in the future.” “Because of the long-term nature of electricity sector investments, investment confidence depends strongly on long-term policy signals.” “The lack of predictability in the electricity sector creates uncertainty around which generation and network assets investors should either invest in or divest from.” “If businesses do not invest when needed, this will impact on the security and reliability of electricity supply.” He also says explicitly the current climate policy, which includes Direct Action, the RET, and the national energy productivity plan, will not guarantee Australia meets its Paris commitments. “While the electricity sector must play an important role in reducing emissions, current policy settings do not provide a clear pathway to the level of reduction required to meet Australia’s Paris commitments,” the report says. Finkel says the RET is designed to achieve an increase in large-scale renewable energy generation to 2020 “but not beyond”. “The policy also ends in 2030, meaning that projects commencing in 2020 will need to recover their capital costs over only a 10-year period.” He says the Direct Action policy has focused predominantly on land-sector abatement, with very few projects seeking to improve the efficiency of electricity consumption. Finkel says the safeguard mechanism “is not calibrated to drive emissions reduction”. The Turnbull government on Monday flagged an emissions intensity trading scheme for the electricity sector as part of its scheduled review of its Direct Action climate policy. But the overture was dumped when Frydenberg folded in the face of internal pressure – a decision which has been widely criticised as short sighted and counterproductive by business, the energy industry and climate groups. Friday’s Coag meeting will also hear a push from the South Australian government to revive emissions trading in the wake of the Turnbull government’s decision to preemptively rule it out. But the push from the premier, Jay Weatherill, appears unlikely to secure unanimous support from other state governments. South Australia has been leading the charge on an emissions trading scheme for the electricity sector for some months, but New South Wales rebuffed the push on Thursday. The Labor governments in Victoria and Queensland have also backed away from carbon pricing in favour of beefing up their state renewables policies. Before Friday’s talks, Malcolm Turnbull continued efforts to equate carbon pricing with higher electricity prices, and he revived previous criticism of the South Australian government’s positive disposition to renewable energy. “What South Australia is doing is putting at risk the jobs of South Australians, the prospects of South Australian business. Jay Weatherill’s approach to energy has been condemned by the business community in South Australia, they’re appalled,” Turnbull told 3AW on Thursday. “Major industrial centres – Whyalla, mines, Nyrstar mine and so forth – have had to close down because they don’t get reliable power,” he said. “The South Australian Labor government has delivered an absolute double whammy of not being able to keep the lights on and having the most expensive electricity in Australia.” But the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, blasted Turnbull for his conduct over the course of the week. “Malcolm Turnbull is demonstrating that he is under pressure, that he is lashing out, and that now he is making terrible decisions about the future of climate change and what governments can do about it,” Shorten said. “Malcolm Turnbull has been muted on taking proper action on climate change. He has been gagged from talking about the solutions we need to tackle harmful carbon pollution.” “This week has become the sickest joke of climate change policy since Malcolm Turnbull got elected.”"
"Tech giants are jockeying to be the first to hit a 100% renewable energy goal. Google, which has invested in solar and wind energy for a decade, intends to get there by 2017. Google is the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy, and plans to buy enough wind and solar energy to offset all the electricity used by its 13 data centers and offices in 150 cities worldwide, the company said Tuesday.  Apple seems close to reaching its own 100% goal as well. The company said it achieved 93% in 2015. An Apple spokeswoman said the company has yet to set a year for when they would likely cross the finish line. For Google, hitting the 100% target means for every unit of electricity it consumes – typically from coal or natural gas power plants – it would buy a unit of wind or solar electricity. The company wouldn’t say how much electricity it will need to have purchased by the end of next year to reach its 100% goal, but did say that the amount would exceed the 5.7 terawatt-hours solar and wind energy that it bought in 2015. “We want to run our business in an environmentally responsible way, and energy consumption is the largest portion,” said Neha Palmer, head of energy strategy and development at Google’s Global Infrastructure Group. Google is taking a big leap to that 100% goal, having achieved just 37% in 2014. The company has invested in renewable energy ever since it kicked off the construction of a 1.6-megawatt solar energy system in 2006. Since 2010, it’s signed 2.6 gigawatts worth of solar and wind contracts. The tech giant isn’t alone in setting the 100% target. A global campaign to promote 100% renewable energy use in the business world includes Ikea, Facebook, Starbucks and Johnson & Johnson.  Businesses, like homeowners, have historically relied on their local utilities for power. In 2015, about 67% of the electricity generated in the US came from fossil fuels. Businesses would have to build and run their own solar or wind farms if they want to hit their 100% more quickly, but that will require hefty investments and expertise they don’t have. As a result, when companies set strong renewable energy goals, they often reach them by buying enough solar and wind electricity or renewable energy credits to offset their use of electricity from coal or natural gas power plants. Some companies, such as Google and Microsoft, have invested in solar and wind power plants to help increase the amount of renewable energy the local electric grids. Or, using their clout as large energy customers, they work on convincing their local utilities to invest in renewable energy. Once extremely expensive, solar and wind have seen their prices falling significantly in the past 10 years. Government tax breaks have also helped to make solar and wind more affordable to both businesses and homeowners. The price for building large solar farms, that have the scale to provide utilities, dropped 12% in 2015, according to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, part of the US Department of Energy. Market analysts expect the prices to continue to fall even with the abundance of cheap coal and natural gas. The pressure on countries around the world to meet their targets from the Paris climate agreement, which went into effect last month, will make renewable energy attractive, said Bloomberg New Energy Finance. The research firm has projected that solar and wind will become the cheapest sources of electricity for “most of the world” after 2030. “Renewable energy has become incredibly cost effective,” said Dan Kammen, a professor of energy at the University of California-Berkeley. “There is no company on the planet that can’t make a 100% energy target a viable, cost-effective strategy.” Yet most businesses have yet to set a renewable energy target. That’s because cost isn’t the only issue. Big companies tend to have an advantage over smaller firms because they have the resources to understand the energy markets and negotiating contracts to buy renewable energy, said Colin Smith, solar analyst for GTM Research. “You’re talking about very complex deals and arrangements with unique risk profiles that most companies aren’t fully well equipped to understand,” he said. Google currently pays for wind and solar power from 20 renewable energy projects in the US and abroad, in places such as Sweden and Chile. However, it doesn’t limit itself to buying solar and wind only in regions where it operates, and sees itself as a champion of reducing the emissions produced by the electric industry, which is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the US. “Wind and solar developers couldn’t get financing without us guaranteeing to pay for the power in the long term,” said Palmer. Setting the 100% renewable energy goal is not the only way to reduce a company’s carbon footprint, said Dan Reicher, executive director of the Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance at Stanford University. Businesses should first look at cutting down on their energy use and becoming more energy efficient, said Reicher. That will then reduce the amount of renewable energy they need to procure. “Energy efficiency tends not to sound as sexy, just as putting solar panels on your roof is more interesting than putting an efficient furnace in your basement,” he said. “But from an economic and environmental perspective, you want to start with energy efficiency.” Reicher also noted that electricity isn’t always the biggest source of energy for a business. FedEx, for example, uses far more energy in transportation, he said. “Often a big chunk of a company’s business goes beyond electricity,” said Reicher. “What are they doing on the industrial side, on the transportation side, for heating and cooling?” The election of Donald Trump as president has worried renewable energy supporters about the progress made to make solar and wind competitive against coal and natural gas. With the new administration under Donald Trump, renewable energy supporters worry that the government will stop supporting renewable energy. Trump has vowed to revive the coal industry, which has seen half a dozen bankruptcies in recent years as it struggles to compete with the cheaper natural gas. But whether the new administration will create anti-renewable energy policies remains to be seen, Reicher said. Google doesn’t anticipate changes to its renewable energy initiatives in the near future. “The results of any one election won’t change our plans,” said Palmer."
"Around the world, traditional subsistence practices provide a resilient source of ecological knowledge that improves humanity’s ability to respond to environmental crises. In Central Asia, a herding lifestyle practiced for millennia is increasingly threatened by the speed and magnitude of climate change. Although the global mean temperature is predicted to rise by 2C over the coming century, this trend will likely be more severe in high altitude and high latitude environments. In the subarctic steppes of Mongolia, nearly one-third of the population makes their living through migratory herding of livestock – sheep, goat, horse, cattle, camel, and yak. For these herders, the effects of climate change have been immediate and dramatic. Mongolia has experienced summer droughts, extreme winter weather, pasture degradation, a shrinking water supply, and desertification, leading to seasonal herd die-offs. These processes have a cascading effect, reinforcing other issues caused by human activity and globalisation.  How will nomadic society respond to these obstacles? Archaeology offers a long-term perspective on the relationship between people and the environment. In comparison to other parts of the continent, the grasslands of Mongolia are dry, cold, and inhospitable. Precipitation is infrequent and seasonal, making pastures susceptible to overgrazing. Horses, which can open snow-covered winter pastures for other livestock and move quickly over long distances, would have helped to mitigate the challenges of life in the Mongolian steppe. Archaeologists have long been aware of the ecological advantages to horse herding and riding, and used them to develop explanations for the origins of nomadic cultures made infamous by Genghis (Mongolian: Chinggis) and Khubilai Khan. One popular archaeological theory championed by Russian scholar Anatoly Khazonov1 argues that more sedentary herders developed horseback riding and seasonal migration as a way to cope with prolonged drought during the late second millennium BCE. If mobile herding societies first coalesced during a centuries-long dry spell, contemporary climate trends might not seem such a fatal threat to nomadic life.  However, as researchers have acquired detailed record of ancient climate conditions, a different pattern has started to emerge –a link between wet, productive grasslands and the success of nomadic empires. Because water is the limiting factor for life in the Eastern Steppe, rain has a direct impact on the number of livestock an area can support. A recent investigation of paleoclimate records from the Tarim Basin of western China revealed that the great Mongol empire flourished during an anomalously wet period, linked to hemispheric cooling. “Increased carrying capacity for livestock translates into increased carrying capacity for herders,” says study co-author Dave Putnam of the University of Maine.  Putnam and colleagues argue that cooler, wetter conditions prompted the southern expansion of grasslands and made long-distance military travel on horseback through arid regions easier – favouring the spread of pastoralism, and facilitating the Mongol conquests. Putnam cautions that their work only demonstrates a correlation, and more data is needed to demonstrate causality. However, other recent work implies that this pattern is far older than the Mongol empire.  The first direct evidence for widespread mobile pastoralism in Mongolia dates to the late bronze age, around 1200 BCE. Researcher Jean-Luc Houle at Western Kentucky University studied this early nomadic period, and found little evidence for ecological stress. Instead, he argued that these herders, who may have practiced the first horseback riding in Mongolia, seemed to have a healthy diet and an economy with enough surplus animals to conduct conspicuous ritual sacrifices – at some sites, the number of animals killed reaching into the thousands. Houle’s current studies suggest that the Xiongnu (another early empire known for prompting construction of parts of the Great Wall) also rose to power during a wetter interval at the end of the first millennium BCE. So if the first mobile herding societies (and many nomadic empires thereafter) developed and spread under a wetter climate, what does this mean for contemporary nomads facing unprecedented warming and desertification?  The answer may be surprisingly complex. One man I spoke with, Jantsankhorloo, lives near Terelj national park not far from Mongolia’s capital Ulaanbaatar. He has seen many new challenges in his seven decades as a herder, many of them caused by human activity rather than climate. He notes that urban expansion, fencing, increased animal populations, and more traffic near the park have damaged grasslands and made subsistence more difficult. In mineral-rich areas, mining has also depleted local water sources. More than dry summers and difficult winters, he worries most about the loss of traditional knowledge among the younger generation. Many young people have left the countryside for the city, and no longer learn the skills of horsemanship and animal husbandry. In the coming years, the success or failure of Mongolian nomadic life may depend in large part on how people respond to and mitigate these anthropogenic problems.  Modern technology has also impacted herding. Many herders living in the drier, flatter Gobi regions have abandoned horses for Chinese motorbikes – enabling them to move farther distances with their animals, and cope with easily overgrazed pastures. Critics denounce the practice as “lazy” and un-Mongolian, expressing concerns about the effect it may have on the environment and livestock health. Even as technology helps herders cope with changing ecological parameters, it may also have unintended consequences. With this whirlwind of social and technological change occurring alongside the changing climate, it’s unclear exactly how the future may play out for nomads in eastern Eurasia. Nonetheless, it seems unlikely that wet and productive environment that accompanied the emergence of horse culture in the region – and some of its greatest nomadic empires – will characterise the near future. As arid conditions stretch further northward, Putnam sees many herders “caught between a desert and a cold place” – with less biomass translating into reduced forage, and a narrowing window for nomadic life. As climate change endangers Mongolia’s herding traditions, it also threatens ecological knowledge essential to our collective resilience to environmental disaster.

"Malcolm Turnbull’s climate policy stance is “bullshit” according to his own searing assessment when Tony Abbott advanced similar ideas. That was back in the days when Turnbull let facts interfere with his decisions.  In 2009, just after he was dumped from the Liberal leadership, Turnbull wrote a blog in which he provided some frank and forceful thoughts about the climate change position of the man who had beaten him. Like a ghost from a more principled past, his old arguments now apply to his own position.  “First, let’s get this straight. You cannot cut emissions without a cost. To replace dirty coal-fired power stations with cleaner gas-fired ones or renewables like wind, let alone nuclear power or even coal-fired power with carbon capture and storage, is all going to cost money ... So any suggestion that you can dramatically cut emissions without any cost is, to use a favourite term of Mr Abbott, ‘bullshit’. Moreover, he knows it,” Turnbull the backbencher-with-convictions wrote. “The whole argument for an emissions trading scheme, as opposed to cutting emissions via a carbon tax or simply by regulation, is that it is cheaper – in other words electricity prices will rise by less to achieve the same level of emission reductions …”. But when Turnbull minister Josh Frydenberg said a review of Abbott’s Direct Action policy – which the Coalition had retained all those years – would at least consider a low-cost form of emissions trading for the electricity sector, it took Prime Minister Turnbull just 36 hours to can it.  Whether or not Abbott understood the limitations of his Direct Action policy, we know for sure that Turnbull is right across those limitations now. He ruled out the so-called baseline and credit trading scheme even though it was what the policy had been designed to possibly morph into, what the government had been privately assuring stakeholders it would consider, had broad support from opposition parties, industry and the environment movement, and had the prospect of finally ending the stupid barren years of climate wars and delivering business the policy certainty it has been pleading for for years. He ruled it out even though – true to his own 2009 argument – it was also far cheaper for the government and for consumers. Cheaper according to the Australian Energy Market Commission and the Australian Energy Market Operator and the electricity transmission sector – based on modelling done by CSIRO – and the independent Climate Change Authority. It has been tacitly endorsed by the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, in his review of the electricity sector and the experts say it is the policy most likely to avoid disruption in the electricity sector because it would provide some certainty for investment. And he ruled it out before the review had even considered it. Why would a leader rule out what seemed like such a logical option? Why would he rule out all carbon pricing options? 2009 Malcolm had a pretty good take on that too. “The fact is that Tony [Abbott] and the people who put him in his job do not want to do anything about climate change. They do not believe in human-caused global warming. As Tony observed on one occasion, ‘climate change is crap’,” he wrote. Those same climate sceptics in the Coalition still don’t want to do anything about climate change, and even though Abbott is no longer prime minister they still seem to be calling the shots. At least Kevin Rudd tried to legislate his climate policy – an emissions trading scheme – in the face of a hysterical scare campaign, before finally abandoning it without an alternative. After a couple of stern words from backbenchers Abbott and Cory Bernardi, Turnbull decided not to even try to make the argument.  Perhaps the review will come up with other means to meet Australia’s climate change obligations. But the only obvious alternatives are more Direct Action-style direct government funding for abatement, which Turnbull has previously observed is “a recipe for fiscal recklessness on a grand scale” and “a very expensive charge on the budget in the years ahead”. Then there is change forced through government regulation, which, as he said in his blog, is also more expensive (and goodness me, what would the Coalition conservatives say about big government and red tape?). Which leaves us back in the “bullshit”: the insistence that existing policy is fit for purpose and that some kind of carbon pricing scheme will be more expensive and result in a less reliable electricity system. All the available evidence says the exact reverse, unless of course you are comparing the cost of the scheme with the cost of doing virtually nothing to reduce emissions. In 2009 Turnbull described the only kind of climate policy that could win the favour of the climate sceptics in his party. “Any policy that is announced will simply be a con, an environmental figleaf to cover a determination to do nothing.” First we got fake news – made-up stories that get shared so often that people start to believe them. Now that we have governments ignoring available evidence, we risk fact-free fake public policy.  If Barnaby Joyce keeps saying a carbon price will force us all to live in the dark in caves, people might be persuaded to ignore the experts and believe that he’s right. After all he got a long way with that great $100 lamb roast line. And at least he looks like he means it. When the prime minister delivers the old lines about a carbon price pushing electricity bills up – like when he was getting called out by the premiers at Coag on Friday – he sounds like he’s reading from someone else’s script. Perhaps that is because he still dimly remembers his assessment – again in his 2009 blog – about politicians who refuse to act in line with their convictions and the available facts. “Politics is about conviction and a commitment to carry out those convictions. Many Liberals are rightly dismayed that on this vital issue of climate change we are not simply without a policy, without any prospect of having a credible policy, but we are now without integrity. We have given our opponents the irrefutable, undeniable evidence that we cannot be trusted,” he wrote. It’s hard to put it better than that."
"The governor of the Bank of England has warned that the fight against climate change will be jeopardised unless companies with big carbon footprints come clean about their exposure to global warming risks. Writing in today’s Guardian, Mark Carney says a new set of guidelines drawn up over the past year should be implemented so that investors can allocate capital to those companies with the best ideas to hit the target of keeping the rise in global temperature to less than 2C.  Carney, writing jointly with the former New York City mayor, Michael Bloomberg, said citizens, consumers, businesses, governments and international organisations were all taking action in response to extreme weather events. “The challenge is that investors currently don’t have the information to respond to these developments,” they said. “This must change if financial markets are going to do what they do best: allocate capital to manage risks and seize new opportunities. Without the necessary information, market adjustments to climate change will be incomplete, late and potentially destabilising.” Bloomberg has been heading a taskforce into climate-related financial disclosures set up in December 2015 by the Financial Stability Board, an international body established by the G20 in the aftermath of the 2008-09 crash with the aim of reducing risks in global markets.  Carney and Bloomberg said in their article that financial disclosure was “essential to a market-based solution to climate change”. They add: “A properly functioning market will price in the risks associated with climate change and reward firms that mitigate them. As its impact becomes more commonplace and public policy responses more active, climate change has become a material risk that isn’t properly disclosed.” Bloomberg’s taskforce will on Wednesday publish its recommendations for a voluntary disclosure code. It will cover four areas considered by Carney and Bloomberg to be vital to how businesses operate – governance, strategy, risk management and metrics. The taskforce included representatives of banks such as Barclays, the world’s biggest mining company BHP Billiton, the Indian steelmaker Tata and the chemical company Dow. All members of the taskforce had signed up to the disclosure recommendations, Carney and Bloomberg said. “We encourage others to participate in the consultation, to become early adopters thereafter, and to encourage firms in which they invest to also make the disclosures.”"
"The energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, has folded in the face of internal pressure, declaring the Turnbull government will not pursue emissions trading as part of adjusting its climate policy to meet Australia’s international emissions reduction targets. In media interviews on Monday morning Frydenberg explicitly said a looming review of the government’s Direct Action climate change policy would canvas the desirability of a trading scheme for the electricity sector.  But after backbenchers and one cabinet minister – Christopher Pyne – dissented vociferously from that view over the course of Monday, Frydenberg told 3AW on Tuesday night he had not flagged an emissions intensity trading scheme for the electricity sector. “It’s always been our policy to have a review. I didn’t mention an emissions intensity scheme – that’s not in any document to the Coalition has put out,” the minister said on Wednesday night. “The Turnbull government is not contemplating such a scheme. We are not advocating such a scheme”. “What we are focused on is driving down electricity prices and … energy security.” He said an emissions trading scheme was “not the policy of the Turnbull government”. The recanting followed a day of canvassing government dissenters. Coalition sources have told Guardian Australia Frydenberg spoke to a number of opponents of carbon pricing over the course of Tuesday. On Tuesday night, the former prime minister Tony Abbott also weighed into the poisonous internal debate. He told Sky News: “I’m sure the last thing ministers want to do is reopen questions that were settled for our side back in 2009.” “We’re against a carbon tax. We’re against an emissions trading scheme. We’re against anything that’s a carbon tax or an ETS by stealth,” Abbott said. “We are the party of lower power prices and should let Labor be the party that artificially increases [electricity] prices under Greens pressure.” The terms of reference for the Direct Action review Frydenberg outlined at the beginning of the week include considering policy mechanisms to reduce emissions on a “sector-by-sector basis” – which was interpreted by analysts as a green light for the review to consider an emissions trading scheme in the electricity sector. On Monday Frydenberg went a step further, telling the ABC the government would look at an emissions intensity scheme for the electricity sector as part of the review of Direct Action. “Now, as you know, the electricity sector is the one that produces the most emissions; around a third of Australia’s emissions come from that sector,” the minister told the ABC’s AM program.“We know that there’s been a large number of bodies that have recommended an emissions intensity scheme, which is effectively a baseline and credit scheme. “We’ll look at that.” Frydenberg’s initially positive comments on Monday are in line with advice to the government from the Climate Change Authority, from the energy industry and the CSIRO. On Tuesday Australia’s electricity and gas transmission industry called on the Turnbull government to implement a form of carbon trading in the national electricity market by 2022 and review the scope for economy-wide carbon pricing by 2027. While Abbott once characterised carbon pricing as a wrecking ball through the Australian economy, the new report, backed by the CSIRO, says adopting an emissions intensity scheme is the least costly way of reducing emissions, and could actually save customers $200 a year by 2030. Some stakeholders believe the Finkel review into energy security and Australia’s climate commitments may also float the desirability of an emissions intensity scheme for the electricity sector when it presents its preliminary fundings to Friday’s Coag meeting of the prime minister and the premiers. Business and Australia’s energy sector has been calling on the government to deliver policy certainty in order to allow an orderly transition in the electricity sector from emissions intensive sources of power generation to low emissions technologies."
"When the skies open up and deluge an area, the results can be catastrophic, with roads washed out and homes destroyed by the resulting flash floods. Such extreme downpours are already occurring more often across the US, but a new study finds that as global temperatures rise, storms could dump considerably more rain and skyrocket in frequency. The study, in the journal Nature Climate Change, suggests that storms that now occur about once a season could happen five times a season by the century’s end, a 400% increase.  And when such storms do occur, they could produce up to 70% more rain. That means that an intense thunderstorm that would today drop about 5cm (2 inches) of rain would drop 9cm in the future. Such massive amounts of rain occurring more often could put significant strain on infrastructure that already struggles to deal with heavy rainfall, as seen across the country this year in places from Louisiana to West Virginia. “I think this is one of the most severe consequences of climate change, at least in the US,” said the study’s co-author, Andreas Prein, of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado. Heavy downpours have already increased across the entire continental US, according to the 2014 National Climate Assessment, mostly notably in the north-east, where they have risen by 71%. Such an increase in extreme precipitation is expected as temperatures rise due to heat-trapping greenhouse gases accumulating in the atmosphere. One of the basic properties of the atmosphere is that moisture increases with temperature. That means when a storm forms, it has more moisture available to fuel rains. Several extreme rainfall events have already been made more likely because of warming, analyses have shown. “We see this in the real climate already. It will only intensify,” Prein said. The most extreme rains happen in convective storms, or ones that feature rapidly rising air at their core. These storms happen on scales too small for global climate models to capture, though, meaning they can’t provide a detailed look at rainfall trends. To get down to the level of those storms, the NCAR researchers used a higher-resolution model that captures finer details, but takes much longer to run – in this case, an entire year. What they found was that if greenhouse gas emissions continue on their current path, the storms that produce the most intense rainfall will increase broadly across the Lower 48. The Gulf and Atlantic coasts, where oceans provide abundant moisture, would see some of the biggest increases in frequency and rainfall amounts. But even in the central portions of the country, which are expected to get drier overall as rising temperatures cause more soil evaporation, the most intense storms will drop more rain in the future. Essentially, the region will see fewer of the moderate storms that are a crucial source of water now and more of the intense storms. That shift has serious implications for agriculture, one of the main economic drivers in the region, as heavy rains can be damaging to crops. However, if the world, including the US, acts to limit emissions over the coming decades, these increases in rainfall won’t be as large. “It’s really in our hands to change that if we want to,” Prein said."
"Mathias Cormann has refused to say if the Turnbull government still has confidence in Dr Alan Finkel after the chief scientist warned Australia would not meet its emissions reduction target under the Paris agreement with current federal policy settings. “Look at our track record,” Cormann told Sky News on Sunday. “People thought that we couldn’t meet the 2020 emissions reduction target based on our policy settings and indeed we are exceeding those targets.  “We are very confident that with our policy settings we are able to meet the 2030 emissions reduction targets.” Asked if he had lost faith in Finkel, given Finkel warned clearly last week that the government’s policy settings had to change if it wanted to meet its 2030 emissions reduction target under the Paris agreement, Cormann said: “My answer is pretty self-evident.” The Turnbull government is still reeling from a major policy backdown from the environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, last week, when Frydenberg signalled a review of the government’s Direct Action policy would consider whether an intensity scheme for electricity was an option only for him to fold within 36 hours after an angry backlash from backbench conservatives.  To calm his colleagues, Frydenberg said the Coalition would not contemplate either a carbon tax or carbon trading – comments that pre-empted the findings of his own Direct Action review and the independent Finkel review released later in the week. Finkel’s report, handed to the prime minister before Friday’s Coag meeting, said investment in Australia’s electricity sector had stalled because of “policy instability and uncertainty”. It also gave implicit endorsement to an emissions intensity trading scheme for the electricity industry to help manage the transition to lower-emissions energy sources. Following the Coag meeting on Friday, the South Australian premier, Jay Weatherill, who supports an emissions intensity scheme, publicly rebuked the prime minister for pre-emptively killing off the debate. Cormann said on Sunday the government’s review of its Direct Action policies should only be considered a “housekeeping review” because the Coalition’s climate change policies were settled before the 2013 election. “Our policy settings in relation to action on climate change have been settled for some time,” he said. “There is a review taking place consistent with the terms of reference that have been released by the minister. This is really, you should be looking at this review as a housekeeping review. This is very much routine. “This was never designed to be a review to question again, or fundamentally to reopen and revisit, questions that have previously been resettled after very lengthy and intensive debate [inside the Coalition].”"
"The European Central Bank’s (ECB) quantitative easing programme is systematically investing billions of euros in the oil, gas and auto industries, according to a new analysis. The ECB has already purchased €46bn (£39bn) of corporate bonds since last June in a bid to boost flagging eurozone growth rates, a figure that some analysts expect to rise to €125bn by next September. On Thursday the bank said it would extend the scheme until 2018.  But an EU pledge to cut its carbon emissions by at least 80% by mid-century could be undermined by the asset purchasing scheme, according to investments revealed in an analysis of the bank’s international security identification numbers (ISINs) by campaign group Corporate Europe Observatory.  These show that the bank has made 11 separate bond purchases from Shell, 16 from the Italian oil company Eni, seven from Total, and six each from Repsol and OMV. In Italy, gas utilities account for 68% of securities transactions bought with QE money, and in Spain the figure is 53%. The ECB says that it cannot reveal the value of individual bond purchases without creating a market distortion. Bank sources confirmed that they were aware of all the ISIN numbers. “We have a monetary policy objective with our programme and that, for us, is the prevailing reasoning,” one source told the Guardian. Unlike the European Investment Bank (EIB) or European Bank of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the ECB is not obliged to consider the effect that its investments may have on climate change. But the shadow climate minister, Barry Gardiner, told the Guardian: “The European Central Bank should be aligned with Europe’s industrial strategy and energy policy. By signing up to the Paris agreement, the EU has committed to create a net zero carbon economy in the second half of the century. “Therefore the investments that the ECB supports should not undermine Europe’s central policy thrust to transition its economy to one powered by clean energy.” Dr Simon Zadek, the co-director of the UN environment programme’s inquiry into the design of a sustainable financial system, said: “In 2016, it is no longer acceptable to have a monetary policy that is misaligned with long-term policy objectives whether these concern growth, climate change, or other aspects of sustainable development.  “The ECB should take the opportunity of its QE program to explain how its actions align with Europe’s climate commitments, and then move to correct any imbalances.” ECB sources say that as an independent central bank, no change to the current QE policy could come from any other source than the bank’s decision-making bodies. At present, the ECB coordinates bond-buys by national central banks in eurozone countries, under a corporate securities purchasing programme (CSPP). Purchases are often carried out in line with national priorities. The Bundesbank’s most frequent securities acquisitions were in car industry flagships Daimler and BMW (15 times each), and in VW (7 times).   The ECB has also purchased bonds in Estonia’s Eesti Energia, which invests heavily in north American tar sands operations, and in the Austrian gaming corporation, Novomatic. An ECB spokesman disagreed that oil, gas and auto investments are over-represented in its asset purchases and said the “ holdings of bonds issued by different economic sectors are broadly in line with those of the eligible universe”. Kenneth Haar, who authored the analysis for the Corporate Europe Observatory , said: “Whichever way you look at it, this investment pattern cannot be justified. We should be looking for a public investment policy that puts combating climate change and creating jobs first, not mindlessly throwing public money into the coffers of Big Oil and car makers.  “It would have made so much more sense to use these billions of euros to create employment in environmentally sustainable sectors instead.”"
"Churchill, on the banks of the Hudson Bay in Canada, is known as the polar bear capital of the world. Hundreds of bears gather there each year before the sea freezes over in October and November so they can hunt seals again from the ice for the first time since the summer.  I first went there 12 years ago at this time of year. The place was white, the temperature was -20C, and the bears were out feeding.  This year I came back to make a film for Danish TV and set up live feeds of the bears. It was so different. In mid-November there was no snow or sea ice or ice; the land was green or brown and the temperature was 2C. The bears were walking around on the land waiting for the ice to form. It was like summer. October had seen unprecedented temperatures all around the Arctic leading to a record-breaking slowdown of sea ice formation. Local people told me they had never seen it like this before.  With Geoff York, director of conservation at Polar Bears International, we pored over satellite maps every day. It was shocking. The whole 470,000 sq mile bay was completely ice-free. This is the southernmost colony of polar bears in the world and in the past about 1,000 bears would be there. But studies have shown that in the last 20 years the surface temperature of Hudson Bay has warmed by about 3C.  This has had a massive effect on the bear. The western Hudson Bay population has declined by more than 20% in 30 years. It’s the same elsewhere. New analysis of data from the southern Beaufort Sea in north-west Canada and Alaska suggest even greater population declines there. We saw about 20 bears around Churchill in the 10 days I was there. That’s actually a few more than I saw last time, when I was there 12 years ago, but that was because most of the bears were out on the ice then. The ones we did see this year appeared thin, restless and hungry, and were starting to be more aggressive. There was a mum and a cub and it was very emotional because it looked pretty certain that the cub would not survive much longer. The days of bears in this region having triplets seem to be over. The declining sea ice has decreased hunting opportunities, so the bears are smaller and fewer cubs are being born in this area. Every year, York told us, the bears spend one day more on land and one day less on the ice. That does not sound much, but it’s one day less hunting, and over 30 years they are getting one months’ less food.  The ice is getting thinner; it’s melting earlier and it’s coming later. New studies suggest that polar bears can only survive for about 180 days on shore. York was clear: “If sea ice loss continues at the same pace or faster than we have seen here over the last 30 years, this is definitely not sustainable and researchers predict polar bears could become regionally extinct by mid- to end of this century.” The polar bear is an icon of climate change. What is happening near Churchill is a clear sign that change is taking place now. When I returned to Europe, the frost finally came. It should have been one month earlier. This is about much more than polar bears. If an animal that is designed to survive here can’t make it, we are in trouble. It’s really about us.  • Lars Ostenfeld was talking to John Vidal"

"Storms during the winter of 2013-14 generated the maximum recorded sea level at 20 of the 40 tide gauge sites around the UK, as well as the largest number of extreme sea level events in any season in the last 100 years. This is one of the findings of scientists from Southampton University who have been studying coastal flooding around Britain to try to understand the increasing threat from storm surges in various parts of the coast.  There are several factors involved in who will get flooded and when. The track of the depressions, the direction of the wind and the state of the tide dictate which places are vulnerable at any one time. To help people predict when coastal communities might be at risk the scientists have developed a historical record of coastal flooding called Surgewatch, which gives a report of each event since 1915 and its severity. Those with memories of recent storms or extra information are asked to contribute. But a disturbing finding is that none of these serious flood events occurred during severe storms but those classed as moderate. This was because none of the severe storms coincided with a high spring tide so were not enough on their own to overtop the sea defences. In other words, so far the UK has been lucky. The conclusion must be that with sea levels rising at around 3mm a year and storms getting more frequent and violent, it is only a matter of time before a major storm and a spring tide coincide, and bring widespread destruction to somewhere along Britain’s coastline. "
"Surrounded by 750,000 square miles of ocean, the low-lying Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) is emblematic of the threat climate change poses to small island nations. This Micronesian country of coral atolls faces worsening droughts, tropical storms, coral bleaching, coastal inundation and flooding – all exacerbated by rising temperatures and sea levels. In the face of such an existential threat, the country has also seen a mass exodus of its inhabitants: exact numbers are unclear, but anything between one-fifth and one-third of the population has migrated visa-free to places such as Hawaii, the Pacific north-west and other parts of the US under an agreement called the Compact of Free Association. North-west Arkansas alone saw an increase of nearly 300% in its Marshallese population between 2000 and 2010. Some young Marshallese, however, are choosing to return after years living abroad, drawn back by the desire to help their homeland confront its challenges.  Some are attracted by generous education grants: Marshallese students receive loans for overseas education that are converted to grants when students return to the country to work in the public or private sector for one year of each two years of support. That’s what brought back 26-year-old Yoshiko Capelle and her husband Jesse, 28, after four years study political science at the University of Hawaii. Jesse said returning to the capital Majuro with their two young children has been “bitter-sweet”. Majuro’s crowded conditions and eroding coastlines required some getting used to, but a network of family support and world-class fishing and diving made their return easier, he said. When Jamal Reimers, 39, moved to the US in 1997, the Marshall Islands were gripped by drought. After years living in Oregon, Arkansas and Idaho, Reimers returned to Majuro in 2015 with his two oldest children; his wife and two youngest remain in Idaho. “I knew climate change had impacted my land but came back regardless,” said Reimers, who added that he returned to “give back – and [to] fight until we can’t fight [any] more”. Today Reimers manages the family business – a commercial water bottling company that treats sea water using reverse osmosis. Dustin Langidrik, 28, was born in Hawaii and studied in Fiji before returning to the Marshall Islands. Today he works with the University of the South Pacific building solar desalination water purification units on remote atolls using man-made materials and locally available plants.  “I know there’s a lot of people who don’t seem to understand the situation we are in,” he said. “Climate change is real. It is not a joke. It’s really taking a hard toll on people’s life.” Marshall Islands’ president, Hilda Heine, acknowledges the threat of outbound migration, which is also fueled by high unemployment, stressed infrastructure and public service and housing shortages.  Many islanders leave in search of medical treatment for conditions caused by the aftereffects of US nuclear tests on nearby Bikini and other atolls. Cancers and associated lifestyle diseases like diabetes strain this remote but urbanized nation of around 60,000. But Heine displays the stubborn optimism of a pioneer among her people. She was the first Marshallese citizen to earn a PhD, she served as education minister and in 2016 was elected the first female head of state of a Pacific island nation. “No country wants to see its talent migrate,” she says. “We’re hopeful that Marshallese will want to return home to make a difference after they’ve become educated and skilled overseas.” Heine knows the power of investing in education. In 1993 she temporarily relocated to Hawaii to provide her children with a strong academic upbringing. Heine’s own daughter, 29-year-old Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner, returned to Majuro in 2014 to fulfill her education grant obligation. Today Jetnil-Kijiner has a master’s degree in education and teaches at the College of the Marshall Islands. Along with fellow returnee Milañ Loeak, Jetnil-Kijiner is co-director of Jo-Jikum, a non-profit fostering youth leadership and activism seeking solutions to climate change. Jetnil-Kijiner says it’s presumptuous to assume that the islands are doomed. “It’s frustrating because [journalists] are looking for this sensational story of people fleeing islands that are becoming remote and empty,” she says, adding that not all Marshallese have accepted the role of climate refugees. According to Jetnil-Kijiner, Marshallese migration is essentially the same as in other parts of the world – the search for new opportunities, a better way of life or the desire to be near family. Jetnil-Kijiner – who is recognized for her poetry as much as her activism – rejects the idea that her people are ready to give up on their homeland.  In a 2011 poem entitled Tell Them she wrote: “Tell them we don’t want to leave. We’ve never wanted to leave. And that we are nothing without our islands.”"
" Piers Sellers, a climate scientist and former astronaut who gained fame late in life for his eloquent commentary about the earth’s fragility and his own cancer diagnosis, has died. He was 61. British-born Sellers, who flew on three space shuttle missions between 2002 and 2010, died on Friday morning in Houston, Texas, of pancreatic cancer, Nasa said in a statement.  Sellers shared his astronaut’s perspective on climate change in Leonardo DiCaprio’s documentary, Before the Flood, released earlier this year. He told DiCaprio that seeing the earth’s atmosphere as a “tiny little onion skin” from space helped him gain a fuller understanding of the planet’s delicacy. He also wrote a New York Times op-ed about grappling with the meaning of his life’s work after learning he had terminal cancer. In both the film and the op-ed, he was optimistic, arguing that he expected human ingenuity to rescue the planet from a dire future of runaway global warming. The Nasa administrator, Charles Bolden, described Sellers “a tremendous public servant who was dedicated to Nasa, the nation and the world”. “Piers was dedicated to all facets of exploration,” Bolden said. “His curiosity and drive to uncover new knowledge was generously shared with audiences around the world, both from space and in wide travels to reach as many people as possible with an essential understanding of our fragile planet. “His legacy will be one not only of urgency that the climate is warming, but also of hope that we can yet improve humanity’s stewardship of this planet. His cancer diagnosis became a catalyst for him to work even harder on efforts to save the planet from global warming for the benefit of future generations.” Bolden said Sellers “was a strident defender and eloquent spokesperson for our home planet, Earth”.  “Spacewalker and scientist, free thinker and friend to our planet, and all who seek new knowledge – to say he will be missed would be a gross understatement,” he said. Originally from Crowborough in East Sussex, the University of Leeds and Edinburgh graduate gained American citizenship to fulfil a childhood dream of flying into space. “When I was a kid, I watched the Apollo launches from across the ocean, and I thought Nasa was the holy mountain,” Sellers said earlier this year when Bolden presented him with the Distinguished Service Medal, the agency’s highest honour. “As soon as I could, I came over here to see if I could climb that mountain.” Sellers was deputy director for sciences and exploration at Nasa’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. He started working for Nasa as a scientist in 1982 and joined its astronaut corps in 1996. He logged 35 days in space during the three shuttle missions to the International Space Station and was appointed an OBE in the New Year’s Honours List in 2011.  “As an astronaut, I spacewalked 220 miles [354km] above the Earth,” Sellers wrote in his op-ed. “Floating alongside the International Space Station, I watched hurricanes cartwheel across oceans, the Amazon snake its way to the sea through a brilliant green carpet of forest, and gigantic night-time thunderstorms flash and flare for hundreds of miles along the equator. “From this God’s-eye view, I saw how fragile and infinitely precious the Earth is. I’m hopeful for its future.” Sellers wrote that the best way he could imagine spending his final months was to continue working, despite knowing he would not live to see the worst of climate change or the harnessing of possible solutions. “New technologies have a way of bettering our lives in ways we cannot anticipate,” Sellers wrote. “There is no convincing, demonstrated reason to believe that our evolving future will be worse than our present, assuming careful management of the challenges and risks. History is replete with examples of us humans getting out of tight spots.” Associated Press and Press Association contributed to this report"
"A batch of stolen emails was released to the public, with evidence pointing towards Russian hackers. The media ran through the formerly private correspondence with a fine-toothed comb, looking for dirt. Although little if any damning information was found, public trust in the hacking victims was severely eroded. The volume of media coverage created the perception that where there’s smoke, there must be fire, and a general presumption of guilt resulted. The year was 2009, and the victims were climate scientists working for and communicating with the University of East Anglia. The story was repeated in 2016 with the Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee.   After 1,000 of climate scientists’ private emails were stolen and published online, snippets of text were taken out of context and misrepresented to falsely accuse the scientists of scandal, conspiracy, collusion, falsification, and illegal activities. Climate deniers and biased media outlets whipped up such froth over these misrepresentations that various organizations launched nine separate investigations to identify any possible scientific wrongdoing uncovered by the emails. They found none. Nevertheless, “Climategate” caused temporary erosion in public trust of climate scientists. Like most such news events, people quickly forgot and the effect soon faded; however, the stolen emails were made public just a month before the Copenhagen international climate summit. The well-timed release of the hacked emails provided a distraction that helped sink the negotiations, which were generally viewed as a failure. A serious international climate agreement was delayed for another six years. Similarly, the stolen emails released by Wikileaks did not identify any damning revelations about Hillary Clinton. The leaks had the desired effect – Clinton’s emails received three times more nightly news network coverage than all policy issues combined.  Gallup consistently found that Clinton’s emails were dominating the news Americans were receiving about her. The constant flood of overwhelming media coverage of the emails created the perception that Hillary Clinton was somehow ‘just as bad’ as Donald Trump.  Although Clinton won the popular vote by a margin of over 2% and close to 3 million votes, the email effect helped Trump win the election.  As President Obama said at his year-end press conference last Friday: This was not some elaborate complicated espionage scheme. They hacked into some Democratic party emails that contained pretty routine stuff, some of it embarrassing or uncomfortable, because I suspect that if any of us got our emails hacked into, there might be some things that we wouldn’t want suddenly appearing on the front page of a newspaper or telecast even if there wasn’t anything particularly illegal or controversial about it. And then it just took off. And that concerns me. And it should concern all of us. The exact same could be said of the hacked Climategate emails. The contents of the emails were so benign that those trying to attack climate scientists were forced to take statements out of context. For example, a sentence using the word “trick” as in “technique” was distorted and claimed to mean the scientists were nefariously trying to trick people. And the distortions worked. The media treated the hacked emails like a scandal, and the scientists who were its victims were treated like criminals. Even Jon Stewart jumped on the faux scandal bandwagon. At the American Geophysical Union conference last week, attorney Michael Mandig, who represents Dr. Malcolm Hughes and other climate scientists on behalf of the University of Arizona, put his finger on the problem: Having general, open access to a researcher’s email is the functional equivalent of eavesdropping. Those trying to block climate policy by any means necessary have resorted to trying to make scientists’ private emails public, via either hacking or frivolous Freedom of Information Act requests. But there’s no reason to electronically eavesdrop on private discussions between scientists. As Dr. Hughes noted: Email has enabled collaboration without geographical limits in science to an extraordinary degree. Treating scientists’ emails as public records, subject to twisting by anti-science ideologues, chills the vital expression of competing, and changing, views on which science depends. Science is a competition of ideas, and scientists are critical of each others’ work. Informal discussions between scientists, whether over the telephone or in hallways or via email, depend on privacy to allow the free and frank exchange of ideas. As President Obama noted, everyone says things in private emails that we wouldn’t want aired in public. Climategate and the 2016 presidential election provided perfect examples – despite no incriminating content, the media treated both events like scandals, and public perception of climate scientists and Hillary Clinton were damaged as a result. For the climate scientists who lived through Climategate, the Wikileaks email scandal crated a sense of déjà vu. In both cases, the Russian petrostate may have been the perpetrator of the illegal email hacks, and emerged as the winner of the faux scandals, while the rest of us lost. By helping elect Donald Trump, Russia now has a friendly American leadership replacing an outgoing administration that sought to punish their invasion of Ukraine and bombing in Syria. Russian operatives covertly interfered with the American election to aid Trump’s campaign, and Americans responded by electing Vladimir Putin’s preferred candidate. Russian agents may also have been behind the Climategate email hack (although the perpetrators were never identified), and again they achieved their intended goal of shaking public trust in their victims, and disrupting the Copenhagen conference. Russia is manipulating us through these email hacks, and Americans keep falling for it. The president-elect is already denying the evidence presented by his own intelligence agencies, and many Americans seem to believe anything he says. Despite his international aggression, Olympic doping scandal, and interference with the presidential election, Republicans have a far more favorable view of Putin than of their own current President. Here is Republicans and Democrats on Vladimir Putin since July 2014. pic.twitter.com/s4I6FY5cbt Germans are worried that Russian hackers will try to influence their elections next. After all, they achieved their goals with the Climategate and American election hacking. Until we stop letting the email hackers play us for fools, these Russian cyber-attacks will undoubtedly continue."
"Barack Obama has permanently banned new oil and gas drilling in most US-owned waters in the Arctic and Atlantic oceans, a last-ditch effort to lock in environmental protections before he hands over to Donald Trump. Obama used a 1953 law that allows presidents to block the sale of new offshore drilling and mining rights and makes it difficult for their successors to reverse the decision.  However, Obama’s ban – affecting federal waters off Alaska in the Chukchi Sea and most of the Beaufort Sea and in the Atlantic from New England to the Chesapeake Bay – is unprecedented in scale and could be challenged by Trump in court. The president-elect has vowed to unleash the country’s untapped energy reserves and exploit fossil fuels. He has previously questioned the science of climate change, threatened to tear up the Paris climate agreement and appointed climate-change deniers in his cabinet. This has led to a scramble from environmentalists calling on Obama to impose whatever regulations and executive orders he can to protect his climate legacy. Tuesday’s move came in a joint announcement by Obama and the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, who also put a moratorium on new oil and gas leasing in its Arctic waters, subject to periodic review. Obama, currently on holiday in Hawaii and with only a month left in office, said in a statement: “These actions, and Canada’s parallel actions, protect a sensitive and unique ecosystem that is unlike any other region on earth. They reflect the scientific assessment that, even with the high safety standards that both our countries have put in place, the risks of an oil spill in this region are significant and our ability to clean up from a spill in the region’s harsh conditions is limited. “By contrast, it would take decades to fully develop the production infrastructure necessary for any large-scale oil and gas leasing production in the region – at a time when we need to continue to move decisively away from fossil fuels.” In 2015, just 0.1% of US federal offshore crude production came from the Arctic. A Department of Interior analysis shows that, at current oil prices, significant production in the Arctic will not occur. “That’s why looking forward, we must continue to focus on economic empowerment for Arctic communities beyond this one sector,” the statement said. Campaigners welcomed the announcement. Jacqueline Savitz, a senior vice-president at the advocacy group Oceana told the Associated Press: “This decision will help protect existing lucrative coastal tourism and fishing businesses from offshore drilling, which promises smaller, short-lived returns and threatens coastal livelihoods. “The people of the Atlantic coast refused to allow their way of life to be compromised and we commend their hard work making their voices heard in Washington.” Few energy companies have expressed a wish to drill any time soon off the coasts thanks to abundant cheap shale oil in North Dakota and Texas. Exploratory drilling in the Arctic is costly and risky.  But with Trump in the White House, the obscure law could face a challenge. Dan Naatz of the Independent Petroleum Association of America told the Associated Press: “Instead of building on our nation’s position as a global energy leader, today’s unilateral mandate could put America back on a path of energy dependence for decades to come.” And Erik Milito, upstream director at the American Petroleum Institute, told Reuters: “We are hopeful the incoming administration will reverse this decision as the nation continues to need a robust strategy for developing offshore and onshore energy.” Canada will designate all Arctic Canadian waters as indefinitely off limits to future offshore Arctic oil and gas licensing, to be reviewed every five years through a climate and marine science-based life-cycle assessment."
"“Everyone was leaving the village where I grew up, and it was all because of water,” says Jamila Bargach, whose village in rural Morocco has steadily emptied of people amid severe water stress. As in most of rural Morocco, climate change and population pressures have led to more unpredictable rainfall patterns and the depletion of natural water sources, such as underground aquifers, in the area around the village of Taloust. Situated in the country’s south-west Sidi Ifni region, close to the coast, the area is extremely arid as it borders the northern Sahara desert. Average annual precipitation is less than 130mm.   In recent years, repeated cycles of intense drought followed by flash floods have led to deaths and the devastation of local infrastructure. Desertification, land degradation and the advance of the Sahara also affect the area. However, the Sidi Ifni region does have one precious resource: fog. “We began to read about ‘fog harvesting’ projects around the world, and we wondered if we could repeat it here,” says Bargach. “Our observations started in 2006, and we saw that on average we have 143 days of fog a year.” The fog is caused by a unique microclimate. Warm air driven by ocean currents makes landfall on Morocco’s Atlantic coast around the town of Sidi Ifni; as the humid air rises, it hits the natural barrier of Morocco’s Anti-Atlas mountains, which start just 35km east from the coast and rise to more than 2,500m. From there, the air turns into blankets of thick fog, particularly between December and June. For years, the community saw this as a bad thing: they believed the fog prevented rainfall, turned fields to mud and made people ill. “Lots of people were reluctant – and even negative – at the beginning of the project. Some even thought that cloud water would not be safe to drink,” says Bargach, who is now director of non-profit organisation Dar Si Hmad. “We weren’t sure if it was going to deliver and we didn’t want to disappoint people. But slowly people began to be convinced, and now the local women call the nets their ‘wells’.” Over the past 10 years, Dar Si Hmad has erected vast mesh nets to capture the moisture at an altitude of 1,225m on the slopes of Mount Boutmezguida – for what is now the largest fog-harvesting project in the world. About 600 square metres of mesh nets capture water particles from the fog, which then condense and drip into collection trays. Roughly 6,300 litres of water can be harvested daily. The water is then filtered and mixed with underground water. More than 8km of pipelines have been installed to share the water between about 400 people in five villages. The benefits are obvious: clean water that is both instant and free. “We used to spend at least four or five hours going to collect water every day from wells in neighbouring villages, or collecting the rain in tanks during the rainy season,” says Zeyna Hamou Ali, 20, a local woman who works as a coordinator for Dar Si Hmad. “This made it very difficult for us to go to school because it’s just accepted by everyone that it’s a woman’s job to go and get water.” The population of these areas of south-west Morocco consists predominantly of rural Berber women, the indigenous inhabitants of north Africa who speak a dialect of the Tamazight language. Rates of illiteracy among rural communities in Morocco are surprisingly high: more than 40%, with women accounting for the lion’s share of that figure. Dar Si Hmad also provides training and educational opportunities to women from the villages.  The idea of harvesting fog was first developed in South America in the 1980s and there are other projects in Chile, Peru, Ghana, Eritrea, South Africa and California in the US. In 2017, Dar Si Hmad plans to start installing the next generation of bigger and better “cloudfisher” nets, developed in Germany. These larger nets will double the amount of water collected and connect another eight villages to the network.  In recognition of its contribution to finding innovative, community-led solutions to climate change, Dar Si Hmad was awarded the 2016 UN momentum for change award. Ali and the project’s directors travelled to collect the award at the COP22 climate change conference, which took place in Marrakech in November. “This is the first time I’ve left my village,” said the wide-eyed Ali at the glittering event. “You can see how much this project has changed my life.”"
"The idea that Donald Trump might become a “normal” American president once he moved into the White House was always for the birds. The 2016 contest was an abnormal election won by an abnormal politician. It was an abnormal election because hackers linked to the Russian government worked to help Mr Trump’s cause; because the head of the FBI tossed a political hand grenade into the closing stages of the contest which helped Mr Trump’s cause; and because, since a US supreme court ruling in 2013, states that want to have exploited a power to impose voter ID rules that intentionally keep African Americans off the rolls. Oh, and 2.8 million more Americans voted for Hillary Clinton than Mr Trump. That’s hardly normal either. Mr Trump was and remains an abnormal politician because he threatens changes that, with almost no exception, are genuinely destructive to American values and interests, not least to the interests of many of those white working-class voters who voted for him in the hope of change. He has now assembled a government team which, again almost without exception, testifies to this reality. These appointments confirm that he cannot be regarded as a president like any other. Perhaps, in five weeks’ time, when he actually succeeds Barack Obama in the Oval Office, he will start to do things that suggest otherwise. But that has not happened yet.  The first threat from the new appointments is that it is Team Corporate America. The new secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, is one of the biggest oil moguls on the planet, chief executive of ExxonMobil, friend of Vladimir Putin and the Middle Eastern petrolocracies. The new energy secretary, Rick Perry, is an oilman and a climate change sceptic. Scott Pruitt, the new head of the Environmental Protection Agency, a body he would like to see closed down, holds those prejudices even more strongly. This will be a pro-carbon, pro-drilling and anti-climate change administration like no other. It is also political Christmas for the Wall Street bankers. The new Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, is a former Goldman Sachs investment banker whose stated priority is to cut corporate taxation by more than half. He will join former Goldman banker and Breitbart chief Stephen Bannon, Mr Trump’s ultra-rightwing chief strategist, and the Goldman president, Gary Cohn, who will become, in effect, the new president’s chief economic adviser. Mr Trump may have railed against bankers, and Goldman in particular, during the campaign, but he has put them at the heart of his economic thinking. The third fox in the governmental hen house is the military. Mr Trump said during the campaign that he knew “more than the generals” about the threat from Islamic State. But the generals will occupy key roles in his administration to such a degree that the head of Human Rights Watch has said there will be a whiff of “military junta” about it. With James Mattis at defence, the temperamental Islamophobe Michael Flynn as national security adviser, John Kelly in charge of the enormous homeland security bureaucracy and Mike Pompeo as the new CIA director, military men have seized some key jobs. Whether this heralds the politicisation of the military or the militarisation of politics will be a key question. Mr Trump’s appointments also point unerringly towards the dismantling of federal government programmes in other crucial areas. Making Andrew Puzder labor secretary puts an opponent of raising the minimum wage in charge of it. Betsy DeVos at education will be a privatiser running public schools policy. Tom Price at health and human services is both an arch-critic of Mr Obama’s affordable care programme and a privatiser of the Medicare retirement care programme. Ben Carson at housing and urban development does not agree with government safety nets. Overall, the military will prosper at the expense of the poor. Guns not healthcare. There is nothing normal about any of this; just as there is nothing normal about appointing Jeff Sessions, the Alabaman who has spent years in the Senate trying to roll back voting rights for African Americans, attorney general; and nothing normal about the expected appointment of an anti-choice justice to take the vacancy on the supreme court. In heavily tainted circumstances, America has elected a president who seems wholly unable to distinguish between private interest and public responsibility. As long as Mr Trump does so little to respect his own office, it is hard for others to respect him and it as they would normally."
"The government will outline the specific risks it believes Britain faces due to the impact of climate change, in a landmark report to be delivered early in the new year. It will be the first response made by Theresa May’s administration to a major environmental concern and will have considerable implications for future green policy.  The UK climate change risk assessment – the first since 2012 – will spell out what the government believes are the major risks facing Britain as global warming continues.  This year the Committee on Climate Change, a body of experts set up under the Climate Change Act to advise the government, said Britain was poorly prepared for global warming. Likely impacts included deadly heatwaves, flooding and food and water shortages, it said. “It will be very interesting to see how much the government accepts this view,” said Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy. “If it does then it will have to outline – within a year – how it intends to protect the nation. New coast defences, flood protection, water supply systems and other measures will be needed, and those won’t be cheap.” Flooding has already proved to be particularly costly for the UK in recent years. Six of the seven wettest years on record have occurred since 2000, and more than 5m homes in England – one in six of the total – are now considered to be at risk of flooding. “The problem is that many people still do not understand the risks involved,” Prof John Krebs of Oxford University, a member of the climate change committee, told the Observer this year. “There is a standard line that an area might have one chance in every 100 years of being flooded. But there are dozens of such areas, so these chances accumulate, making it very likely that somewhere in Britain will be flooded every year. This makes the issue far trickier. It is a wider one than is realised.” The government’s rating of this danger in next month’s climate change risk assessment report will be watched with intense interest. It is estimated that the annual cost to the nation of flooding will rise from about £340m at present to about £620m in 2050, when it is projected that 1.3m homes will be at high risk of flooding.  There are also fears that extremely hot summers – when people die of heat stress, and homes and public transport become extremely uncomfortable – could be typical by the middle of the century. This will be a particular issue for hospitals and care homes, which are not designed to cope with overheating. In addition, many are in flood-prone areas. Apart from flooding, heatwaves and drought, several other areas of risk are also being assessed: • Freshwater supplies, which could be disrupted as temperatures continue to rise. • New pests and diseases and invasive non-native species of plants and animals. • Changes to coastlines caused by rising sea levels. • Disrupted trade and possible military intervention fuelled by wars and migration around the world, stoked by climate change. The forthcoming report will be watched with special interest because the coalition government that preceded the current Tory administration halved spending on measures aimed at mitigating the impact of climate change. The then environment secretary, Owen Paterson, was viewed as a climate change sceptic.  The report will be followed by another in 2018 in which the government will outline the specific measures that will be needed to protect the nation against the dangers it has outlined."
"If 2016 was the year facts didn’t matter, when Oxford Dictionaries declared we went “post-truth”, it makes sense that conspiracy theories flourished. These are some of the most outlandish (and, we feel fairly confident in saying, all untrue).  The cities in the background are approx. 16miles apart... where is the curve ? please explain this pic.twitter.com/YCJVBdOWX7 You might think that this one was put pretty conclusively to bed around 330BC, but it persists into 2016, championed by the radio-friendly rapper B.o.B. The Atlanta musician resurrected the argument that the Earth may, in fact, be flat with a storm of tweets in January that seemed to lean heavily on the fact the horizon appears straight in photos (“where is the curve? please explain this”). Neil deGrasse Tyson’s public putdown prompted B.o.B. to release a diss track, which was not very good, but did show how far the bar has fallen when it comes to prompting diss tracks these days. That was about the last time anyone spoke of B.o.B. in 2016. Taylor Swift’s similarity to the daughter of Anton Lavey, the founder of the Church of Satan, delighted social media this year, coinciding as it did with the pop star’s “downfall”. Taylor Swift is probably NOT the secret scion of America's foremost Satanist family but like how can we be sure pic.twitter.com/R6mJ1004K1 This theory dates back to 2014 but resurfaced this year alongside a CBS documentary about the girl’s murder. In a video posted to YouTube, a truther refers persistently to “the Katy Perry character” (“You can see that that’s just an older JonBenét Ramsey, right? You can see that”) and puts forward the physical similarity between the two sets of parents as evidence (“same people”). He then laboriously – and not entirely successfully, on a technical level – morphs Perry’s face with Ramsey’s. Never mind that Perry, born in 1984, would have been 12 when Ramsey died aged six in 1996. Other YouTubers taking up the theory have pointed out that, in photos, their eyebrows look similar.  Perry has done nothing to address the rumours but did go paddle boarding with her new boyfriend, Orlando Bloom.      Wake up America #ZodiacTed pic.twitter.com/l7qqqXpDQk The traction this got evokes a simpler time in the 2016 US election campaign. Remember when we would say Ted Cruz was the Zodiac killer and laugh and laugh? Remember laughing? The theory – meme, joke, whatever – that the aspiring Republican presidential candidate was, in fact, the unknown killer operating in northern California in the late 1960s and early 1970s was inescapable on social media earlier this year, and eventually made its way into the real world.  #zodiacted pic.twitter.com/fTKOoLbyzX In February a poll of 1,012 registered voters found 38% of Florida voters thought it was possible Cruz was the Zodiac killer. From the press release: “10% say he for sure is, and another 28% say that they are just not sure. Cruz is exonerated from being a toddler serial killer by 62% of the Sunshine State populace.” @pattymo @tedcruz This is pretty damning pic.twitter.com/ghagKA9iJO “But not all of the evidence adds up,” BuzzFeed noted astutely: Cruz was born in Canada in 1970. The earliest confirmed victims of the Zodiac killer were murdered in 1968.  The singer of the US pop trio Terror Jr is known only by the alias Lisa Terror, and hides her face behind her hair in promotional images. The only account the band follows on Twitter is that of Kylie Jenner: the teenage socialite/makeup mogul, a Kardashian by any other name. So close pic.twitter.com/j1cVUrxpfM In March, Jenner featured a song by Terror Jr in a promotional video for her lip glosses; that same day, Terror Jr launched its social media presences. (As far as conspiracy theories go, this one is admittedly low stakes.) Jenner has denied being Lisa Terror on Snapchat, but then came the smoking gun: a Twitter user apparently found her listed as a performer on the track 3 Strikes by a music licensing organisation.  The entry has since been amended, and when Teen Vogue put the theory to the band, it replied only with its trademark grape emoji. But let’s be honest, it’s not like a Kardashian to shy from the spotlight. u kno wat it iz pic.twitter.com/1JedjNPcGr Forget pizzaghazi, the best conspiracy theory going is that Justin Trudeau is Fidel Castro's biological son. pic.twitter.com/HxYC5lWH5C This theory emerged on Reddit after the Canadian prime minister raised eyebrows with his obituary for the “remarkable leader” on Twitter. User George_Rockwell said Trudeau’s parents had visited Cuba “on several occasions”, pointing to a photograph of Margaret Trudeau “happily allowing the tyrant to hold her four-month-old baby” as evidence. (The baby was, in fact, Justin’s late brother Michel. Details, details.) HOW DID I NOT KNOW OF THIS EARLIER. This is my fav conspiracy theory atm, justin trudeau is fidel castro's son. Face swap: pic.twitter.com/NP5Pgb4zGy The Redditer also remarked on the “similar appearance” between the Canadian prime minister and the now-deceased Cuban leader, with a photograph morphing their two faces presented as “DAMNING EVIDENCE”. Trudeau subsequently defended his initial remarks on the “passing of a former head of state” but did not say whether or not he was his father.     The theory that Hillary Clinton had died was the logical extension of rumours of her ill health, and beloved by her detractors during the US election campaign. YouTube user “Confederate Marshell” presented “100% PROOF” that Clinton had been dead since at least 11 September this year and replaced by CGI and multiple body doubles. You might want to be sitting down for this one: the Democratic presidential candidate and her campaign chief John Podesta are running a child sex ring from the backroom of the Comet Ping Pong restaurant in Washington.  A dinner party – or a possibly satanic ritual, depending on who you believe – thrown by the performance artist Marina Abramović and a napkin with a “pizza-related” map on it are also involved. @johnpodesta this Russia conspiracy ain't gonna get you out of explaining your ""map that seems pizza related"" on a handkerchief. #PizzaGate Given that the fact the restaurant has the same initials as “child pornography” is put forward as evidence by believers, the truly shocking detail of this completely baseless conspiracy theory is that even one person believed it. Yet in early December, a 28-year-old man was driven to “self-investigate” the reports, wielding an assault rifle at a employee and firing it inside the restaurant. After his arrest Edgar Welch said he “wanted to do some good and went about it the wrong way”. “I regret how I handled the situation,” he added. That outlandish allegations posted to the online message board 4Chan and Reddit’s “The Donald” thread for Trump supporters could translate into real-world aggression exacerbated anxiety over the impact of fake news. The medias reaction to #PizzaGate made me believe it 10x more Certainly there’s no subject it’s more vital that you “self-investigate” only on trusted news networks. Google “Pizzagate” and you’ll find websites such as “Truthlibrary.Info” that promise “all the facts in one spot” with the user-friendly advice: “WARNING: Turn away now if you do not want to be incredibly disturbed. This is real. Pay attention to ‘pizza’ and ‘cheese’ references throughout, as these are highly likely to be code.” (No, I’m not linking to it.) If you feel strong enough to venture further down this rabbit hole, the Reply All podcast’s summary is excellent. The same people that call #PizzaGate fake news sure seem to push the #RussianHackers conspiracy. The former actually has more evidence. The president-elect of the US seems to subscribe to this one. In 2012 Donald Trump tweeted that global warming “was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive”. The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. He later said this was a “joke”. If so, China didn’t seem to think it very funny. In Australia Senator Malcolm Roberts has suggested that climate change is in fact the work of the United Nations and called for an “Aus-exit”. This one, at least, we can safely disprove."
"What an extraordinary capitulation. Just 24 hours of controversy from entirely predictable quarters and a carefully calibrated process to try to engineer a truce in Australia’s utterly wretched climate politics has been all but abandoned by its architects. Josh Frydenberg has gone in the space of 24 hours from saying quite clearly the government would consider an emissions intensity trading scheme for the electricity sector to trying to pretend he said no such thing. The retreat is, frankly, unseemly. Actually, the retreat is more than unseemly, it’s pathetic – and the consequences of it stretch far beyond yet another apparent failure to do what needs to be done to ensure our economy makes an orderly transition to the carbon-constrained world that the Turnbull government willingly accepted when it signed Australia up to the Paris international climate agreement this time 12 months ago. Forget the intricacies of the climate policy debate – the government through this botched process has again revealed its true nature to the public. Yet again the Turnbull government has shown the voting public that it is a divided, roiling, rudderless, chaotic and gutless political outfit, locked into a cycle of chasing its own tail, jumping nervously at shadows. It doesn’t matter whether or not you are intrinsically a fan of governments embarking on rational policy solutions to vexed public policy problems, whether you accept the science of climate change or whether you don’t, this particular episode chalks up yet another episode in government as chaos theory. The government now presents to the public as an outfit completely devoid of organising principle, careening to try to stay ahead of the next imbroglio, not because of any external pressure, or ferocious rent seeking by powerful special interests, or slick politics by the opposition – but because everything is about the metastasizing internals. At the end of the political year, the government looks like a bunch of people clinging to their jobs, and doing whatever it takes to keep clinging to them – or if they are not doing that, they are trying to engineer the downfall of others, week after week, issue after issue. Sensible people in the government would of course tell you this process of reviewing the manifestly inadequate Direct Action policy was doomed from the start – that it would be impossible to engineer a rational climate policy, one which reduced emissions at the least cost to taxpayers, and steer it successfully through this particular Coalition party room. Sensible people would say this process was always going to degenerate into a battle of straw men and a proxy war about leadership. They are doubtless correct in that assessment. This is, after all, the group of people who elevated something as inoffensive as a market-based mechanism to the status of mass moral panic and a national thought crime. That’s a collective trance of pure stupid that is very hard to break out of. Sensible government people would also tell you that the review of Direct Action is still afoot, and it will hear a bunch of arguments in favour of evidence-based policy from business, from the energy sector, from environment groups – arguments that might be able to carry some weight over the next 12 months. Right now, that’s a very big might. Right now, the conclusion looks inescapable. On climate policy the Coalition has backed itself into a tight corner of its own making – and it shows no sign of finding the courage, the steadiness or the integrity to try to manage its way out."
"A blanket of snow on Christmas Day might be the stuff of childhood memories, but how often does it actually happen in the UK? It all depends on where you live. In Scotland, snowflakes have fallen on Christmas Day 37 times since 1960. This compares to 16 times in Northern Ireland and 16 in Wales. In England, it’s a matter of the north-south divide: northern England has had 26 white Christmases in that period, compared with 10 in the balmy south. Snow would have been more likely several centuries ago. Between around1300 and 1850, the UK endured a “little ice age” that brought harsh winters. Dickens’s 1843 portrayal of a snowy London in A Christmas Carol was well within reasonable expectations at the time. Fans of snowy winters have been reasonably well served in the last two decades. Climate change and increases in average temperatures have lowered the chance of snow, but the weather remains variable and, while there was widespread snow only once between 1971 and 1992, there have been six such occasions between 1993 and 2004."
"States could go it alone on a carbon scheme for the electricity sector after the federal government ruled one out, South Australia’s premier says. A report by the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, to be presented at Friday’s Council of Australian Governments meeting in Canberra, is expected to recommend an emissions intensity scheme.  Jay Weatherill told ABC radio on Thursday he would be pressing for states to team up on their own scheme “in the absence of national leadership”. Weatherill would be discussing the idea with his counterparts before Friday’s formal meeting with the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull. “Our first instinct is of course to seek a national scheme,” he said, but advice suggests it could be done without federal government support. Turnbull ruled out his government imposing an emissions intensity scheme following a backbench revolt over a review of climate change policy. He also left his environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, to explain why he said on Monday such a scheme would be looked at as part of the inquiry, only to deny mentioning it on Tuesday. On Wednesday, Frydenberg joined the prime minister in insisting one would not be introduced. Weatherill said power prices in his state would go down if an emissions intensity scheme was adopted. “It would clean up our energy system,” he said. Such a scheme would also encourage more base-load gas generation and increase competition. Finkel will brief premiers and Turnbull at the Coag meeting on Friday, after being commissioned to put together a national blueprint on energy security and reliability after blackouts across South Australia. The deputy Liberal leader, Julie Bishop, said energy needed to be as affordable as possible for families and communities. “The prime minister has laid out the parameters of the review and it must be in accordance with our energy policy,” she said. Bishop insisted the emissions reduction fund was working well and Australia was meeting its global climate targets."
"Energy suppliers, business groups and consumers have joined in an unlikely coalition to warn that a failure to provide climate policy certainty would cost all Australians and lead to higher costs. Eighteen organisations as diverse as the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Conservation Foundation, the Australian Aluminium Council, Energy Networks Australia and St Vincent de Paul called on the Turnbull government to ensure energy markets remained reliable and affordable during decarbonisation.   “All sides of politics and all levels of government share responsibility for the current state of our energy systems – and for taking action with the energy industry and its customers to improve it,” the statement said. “A collective failure to act would come at a cost to all Australians.” One week after the energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, ruled out an emissions intensity scheme due to pressure from the backbench, the joint statement calls on the Turnbull government to assess all policy options during its 2017 climate policy review. “The status quo of policy uncertainty, lack of coordination and unreformed markets is increasing costs, undermining investment and worsening reliability risks,” the joint statement said. “This impacts all Australians, including vulnerable low-income households, workers, regional communities and trade-exposed industries.” Consensus is building outside the government for a no-holds barred review of climate policy to move the country on from Tony Abbott’s climate policy of Direct Action. “Energy has been a source of advantage for our industries and prosperity for our household,” the statement says. “It should become so again even as Australian governments, businesses and communities deliver our national contribution to the global net zero emissions goal of the Paris climate agreement.  “Much depends on the success of two closely connected policy processes. The 2017 climate change review should assess all policy options and provide advice to government.”  The joint statement comes on the eve of an energy ministers meeting in Melbourne on Wednesday – the final meeting for the year.  While the Frydenberg last week said an emissions intensity scheme for the electricity sector was under consideration, he subsequently backtracked after pushback from Tony Abbott, defence industry minister Christopher Pyne, backbench environment committee chair Craig Kelly and Cory Bernardi.  The prime minister backed in his energy minister, suggesting the Coalition would not increase a carbon tax or emissions trading scheme – support for which led him to lose the Liberal leadership in 2009 to Tony Abbott. But later in the week, a report by Australia’s chief scientist, Alan Finkel said that investment in the electricity sector had stalled because of “policy instability and uncertainty”. Finkel warned that current federal climate policy would not allow Australia to meet its emissions reduction targets under the Paris agreement. The chief scientist will update the energy ministers’ meeting on Wednesday. “An update from Australia’s chief scientist Dr Alan Finkel will provide ministers with an insight into some of the challenges and possible solutions he has gained on his recent work on the issues of energy security,” Frydenberg said. “Ministers will also discuss the outcomes of two reviews designed to streamline the approval process for new interconnectors and to ensure consumers aren’t paying more than necessary for their network costs as a result of the limited merits review process.” The signatories to the statement said Finkel’s preliminary report correctly noted that many of the technological, economic and consumer trends transforming our energy systems were irreversible.  “Policy and market designs need to evolve if investors are to deliver the energy services Australians require at a price they can afford,” the statement says. “A raft of reforms are needed to encourage and support flexibility throughout the system.”  But Frydenberg said Australians expected access to reliable and affordable electricity.   “We are working through Coag to ensure the lights stay on and that power prices remain low,” he said. “This task, however, is being made more difficult by states putting in place unrealistic renewable energy targets which will inevitably put energy security at risk and drive up power prices.” The federal Coalition has been critical of South Australia’s renewable energy targets after the statewide blackouts. Last week, the South Australian premier Jay Weatherill said the states could go it alone on a carbon trading scheme if the federal government failed to show leadership. The signatories to the statement are: the Australian Aluminium Council, the Australian Conservation Foundation, the Australian Council of Social Services, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Australian Energy Council, The Australian Industry Group, the Australian Steel Institute, the Business Council of Australia, the Cement Industry Federation, the Clean Energy Council, Energy Consumers Australia, the Energy Efficiency Council, Energy Networks Australia, Energy Users Association of Australia, the Investor Group on Climate Change, the St Vincent de Paul Society National Council, The Climate Institute and the World Wildlife Fund Australia."
"More than 100 climate and development organisations, along with 70,000 people, have called on Barack Obama to help secure the future of the Paris agreement by transferring the remaining $2.5bn committed by the US. The Green Climate Fund was a key aspect of the historic Paris agreement signed in 2015, which aims to keep global warming “well below” 2C and aspires to keep warming to 1.5C.  The fund, established in 2010, is financed by wealthy countries and used to assist developing countries with adaptation and mitigation. It was widely seen as a key measure to bring both rich and poor countries to the negotiating table. The US pledged $3bn towards the fund, making up nearly a third of the $10.3bn pledged in total. But so far, it has only transferred $500m. “This is one of the only things Obama can do now that Trump can’t undo,” said Jesse Bragg from Corporate Accountability International, the group that organised the petitions. “Once those funds are transferred, Trump won’t be able to take them back.” As of today, 117 organisations including 350.org, Friends of the Earth and the League of Conservation Voters have joined with Corporate Accountability International to deliver a petition signed by more than 70,000 to the Obama administration. The organisations signed a letter saying: “The world cannot afford Donald Trump’s steps backward on climate. Right now, people around the world are mobilising to counter Trump’s anticipated actions. You can help us protect your climate legacy by fulfilling your pledge to contribute $3bn to fund climate justice measures in the Global South.” The petition those organisations delivered said: “Donald Trump plans to do everything he can to reverse progress on climate change. His policies threaten disaster for people and the planet. But there’s one thing President Obama can do before he leaves office that Trump cannot undo.” Trump has nominated a series of climate deniers to his cabinet, including Rex Tillerson, the chief executive of Exxon Mobil, as secretary of state. He has also nominated Scott Pruitt, who is known for suing the Environmental Protection Agency, to direct that agency. Tamar Lawrence-Samuel, associate research director at Corporate Accountability International, said: “Donald Trump’s administration will be of, by and for the fossil fuel industry and if we don’t act now, millions will suffer.” “President Obama must do whatever it takes to fulfil the US’s commitment to the Green Climate Fund before Donald Trump and his Big Oil cabinet take over,” she said. 350.org’s founder, Bill McKibben, said: “The debt for the damage inflicted on the global climate by American carbon will never be fully repaid – and the Trump administration can be counted on to do nothing for the most vulnerable people on the planet … so this call makes both practical and moral sense.” The first $500m was transferred through a State Department fund, which Obama could use without congressional support. Corporate Accountability International argues that Obama could draw from several relevant funds to fulfill his pledge, including those within the State Department, Treasury Department, Defense Department and other agencies."
"Major flooding in the UK is now likely to happen every year but ministers still have no coherent long-term plan to deal with it, the government’s leading adviser on the impacts of climate change has warned. Boxing Day in 2015 saw severe floods sweep Lancashire and Yorkshire, just weeks after Storm Desmond swamped Cumbria and parts of Scotland and Wales. The flooding, which caused billions of pounds of damage, led to the government publishing a review in September which anticipates 20-30% more extreme rainfall than before.  But Prof John Krebs, who leads the work on adapting to global warming for the government’s official advisers, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), told the Guardian: “We are still a long way from where we need to be, in that there is still not a coherent long-term view.” Lord Krebs said it was important for both government and households to learn from the run of floods that have affected many parts of the country in recent years. “Almost every year there has been some more or less major flooding event and that is a key message,” he said. “We have to now get it embedded that this is something that will happen somewhere most years.” Increased flooding is the biggest impact of climate change for the UK, but the CCC has also warned that the nation is poorly prepared for deadly annual heatwaves, water shortages and difficulties in producing food. However, Krebs, who is stepping down from his CCC role after eight years in January, said: “There is still hope this country will make the progress it needs to make.” Pressure to act now must continue from the CCC in its watchdog role and from the public, he said: “This is not something in the long-term future, this is something here and now. But it will also be worse for your children and grandchildren than it is for us, unless we do something about it. “At the extreme end, parts of the world could become uninhabitable and there could be mass migration,” Krebs said. “At the more modest end, we are likely to experience more extreme weather events in this country and we need to prepare for that.” Krebs also said ministers would regret cutting flood protection measures for new homes. New laws passed earlier in 2016 aim to drive the building of 1m new homes but Krebs, an independent member of the House of Lords, said he was disappointed ministers had rejected proposals to cut the risk of the homes flooding and make them cheap to heat. “The imperative to build more homes was overriding anything that might get in the way and I think the housebuilders got at the Department for Communities and Local Government to say all of this is going to be costly and difficult,” he said.  “It isn’t [costly] really, but they just want to get on and build homes according to the bog-standard, simple template and not have to worry about whether the development is sustainable in terms of carbon footprint and flood risk. In 20 years time, people will look back and say, ‘What were they thinking?’” The CCC has also warned the government that there are no plans to deliver half of the cuts in carbon emissions needed in the 2020s, a caution Krebs likened to a yellow card. On the third runway at Heathrow, Krebs said the government had not been clear whether the plan meant carbon emissions from planes would remain under the limit recommended by the CCC. “Is it crazy [to build it]? We don’t know yet,” he said.  But if the new Heathrow runway were built and the government stuck to the CCC limit, growth at other airports would be severely constrained, he said: “The big concern will be for the regional airports where there will be very little room for growth. So if Manchester, Birmingham, Edinburgh have aspirations, they may be dashed.” Krebs said rejection of human-caused climate change and its great risks – which he calls denial – is a “fringe discourse”, with 114 of the world’s nations already having ratified the global climate deal signed by 194 countries in Paris a year ago.  But he said: “We shouldn’t be complacent because those dissenting voices are well-organised, funded and persistent. One has to be strong in the message that the risks are so great that taking out insurance [by acting] now is well worth it.”"
"Temperatures in the Arctic in the last two months have hit more than 20C above normal for the time of year. Temperatures that unusual in the UK and Europe would produce 45C summers. As a result, sea ice has shrunk to levels that scientists describe as “off the scale”. Mapping the changes to the extent of sea ice over the last 40 years confirms that: on a graph, the lines are clustered together like threads in a hank of silk, warming and cooling in line with each other – until this year. This year’s line drops down like a thin thread dangling into the void. Extrapolating data from a single year must be done with caution. When El Niño boosted global temperatures to make 1998 the hottest year on record, a position it held until 2014, deniers claimed that this showed that global warming had “paused”. In fact, several years after 1998 came within 0.3C of the record. The rise of a huge 20C over normal in the Arctic, the region that acts as one of the most important regulators in the global climate system, means that all expectations must now be rewritten. Arctic snow and ice reflect heat back into space – the albedo effect. When there is less ice, less sunlight is reflected and the sea, newly exposed, absorbs more heat, which melts more ice, and so on in a cycle. This is of vital importance: it could represent a tipping point, beyond which the Arctic ice cap, by some projections, might soon disappear altogether in summer. This is not the only crucial climate role the Arctic plays. Sea and air currents swirling over and under the ice cool the globe and affect weather systems on the other side of the world, sometimes in ways that are still not fully understood. Arctic sea ice has recovered in extent from previous lows. But that does not tell the whole story. When temperatures are less volatile, sea ice forms in layers over multiple years to a thick and solid mass. Ice that forms under this year’s conditions is likely to be thinner and less stable than what it replaces, more vulnerable to another year’s warming and less effective as a temperature regulator. For these reasons, the current drastic melting of the Arctic cannot be regarded merely as an outlier. While the effects of an ice-free Arctic on global weather systems are still in the realm of known unknowns, it is a known known that they will be disruptive. The current Arctic temperature and sea ice charts look like the beginning of a whole new trend, one that could change the global climate system for ever. The imperative for action is therefore overwhelming. Reducing carbon dioxide is vital, and it is encouraging that annual emissions have been flat for three years. But now it is necessary to move further, faster. Some experts advocate cutting the amount of black, unburnt carbon – soot – as a matter of urgency. Much of this soot is borne by air currents to the Arctic, depositing it on pristine snow that turns black, and so more heat-absorbent. Some measures to stop soot, like capping coal-fired power stations and banning agricultural burning, are relatively easy. Others – cleaner vehicles and spreading the use of solar cookers in developing countries – might take longer. Getting rid of potent hydrofluorocarbon gases, commonly used in refrigeration, has the broad backing of governments and industry, and will buy time. Methane, often a byproduct of fossil fuel exploration, should be used as an energy source, or at least flared, which is less harmful. Cutting these “short-lived climate pollutants” could prevent 0.5C of warming over the next 30 years, the research suggests. These are opportunities that must be taken; they are necessary, though not sufficient. So governments should also convene an Arctic council to explore other ways of protecting the region. Driving progress demands just the kind of leadership that looks very much to have disappeared from the global scene. Vladimir Putin’s Russia has been laying claim to vast Arctic areas, anticipating the realms of new possibility for commerce – new shipping lanes, cutting thousands of miles from current journeys – as well as oil and gas exploration that an ice-free Arctic would open up. For Donald Trump, such an unfrozen Arctic might allow the US to control key shipping routes, and find new oilfields and gas fields. Mr Trump’s choice of Rex Tillerson, former head of Exxon Mobil and cheerleader for Mr Putin, as secretary of state is deeply worrying. Two friendly world leaders facing one an other across a vanishing Arctic ice cap. The thawing of the cold war is no longer a metaphor."
"This year winter arrived early in the UK, with temperatures plunging well below freezing before November was even out. So is an extra cold winter on the cards?  Forecasting months ahead is fraught with difficulty, but some scientists believe that the warm autumn in the Arctic may portend a cold winter for North America and northern Europe.  As summer came to a close, Arctic sea-ice melted to its second lowest extent on record, allowing ocean waters to release more heat to the atmosphere. By November temperatures in the Arctic had rocketed to a staggering 20 degrees higher than average.  Much of that heat has raised temperatures in the stratosphere, and this is likely to weaken the Arctic polar vortex – the large low pressure region over the north pole. Research by climate scientists Judah Cohen from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Jennifer Francis from Rutgers University, indicate that a weakened polar vortex leads to a weakened jet stream – the fast, high-level westerly winds that bring storms to the UK. And when the jet stream weakens it becomes more wavy, and prone to getting stuck in position, bringing long periods of similar weather. Already we’ve started off with unusually cold temperatures and heavy snowfall over Eurasia, and weirdly warm temperatures over north America. Previously Cohen has shown that heavy Siberian snowfall in October is often linked to colder than normal winters in Europe and the northeastern US.  This year there is the exceptional 2016 El Nino to add to the mix, but Cohen is tentatively forecasting something similar to the severe winter of 2009/10.  "
"Wind power plays a key role in curbing greenhouse emissions from other energy sources such as coal and gas, a new study has shown. Energy from windfarms in the UK prevented almost 36m tonnes of harmful carbon emissions in six years, equivalent to taking 2.3m cars off the road, the analysis found.  Edinburgh University researchers studied National Grid figures for power generated by sources including wind, coal and gas between 2008 and 2014. They said the study is the “most accurate of its kind to date” as it uses real, rather than estimated, energy output figures, detailing figures for every half hour. The university claimed the study suggests UK government figures “underestimate” carbon savings from wind turbines by 3.4m tonnes. The study also claims the method used by the Scottish government “overestimates” the savings. Researchers said their findings support building more windfarms in the UK to help cut carbon emissions and reduce climate-change impact. They said the study suggests wind power could play a key role in meeting the UK’s future energy needs and the methodology used could be applied to give accurate estimates of possible future emissions savings. The study’s leader, Camilla Thomson, said: “Until now, the impact of clean energy from windfarms was unclear. “Our findings show that wind plays an effective role in curbing emissions that would otherwise be generated from conventional sources, and it has a key role to play in helping to meet Britain’s need for power in future.” The analysis, published in Energy Policy and supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, was welcomed by WWF Scotland. WWF Scotland’s director, Lang Banks, said: “It’s great to finally have an independent and authoritative study that puts a more accurate figure on the massive amounts of climate-damaging carbon emissions being avoided thanks to wind power. “We’ve long known that wind power and other renewables were making a major contribution to reducing carbon pollution, but it’s fantastic to learn more clearly just how huge that contribution is.” A Scottish government spokesman said: “With 34% of the UK’s wind power generated in Scotland, this [study] reinforces the crucial role of both on and offshore wind in meeting our international climate change obligations. “It is particularly significant that the study is reported to suggest that a greater investment in wind energy could help meet Scottish and UK government targets for carbon emissions reduction. “This is a key message we have also been directing to UK ministers and one that they should heed, especially in the context of wind energy being amongst the cheapest electricity sources available.” A spokesman for the UK government’s Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, said: “We have made a firm commitment to a low-carbon future, and our recent ratification of the historic Paris agreement shows we are serious about global action on climate change. “Nearly £52bn has been invested in renewables in the UK since 2010, and just last month we reiterated our commitment to spend a further £730m per year supporting new renewable projects over the course of this parliament.”"
"Britain could be facing nationwide festive blackouts next winter unless radical changes are made to the UK’s electricity network, a report has said. Electric Shock: Will The Christmas Lights Go Out Next Winter? has been published by the British Infrastructure Group (BIG) of MPs, chaired by Grant Shapps, who was the only MP to back the study.  It claims that government targets for closing coal power stations and expanding renewable sources to hit climate change goals have rapidly reduced the UK’s generating output. This, it says, has allowed prices to shoot upwards and slashed capacity margins, which are “so tight that National Grid’s emergency power deals have become the norm”. Shapps said the report focuses on the “dangerously small electricity capacity margins” that have been “left in the wake of a decade of target-led, interventionist energy policy”. “While nobody questions the noble intentions behind these interventions, it is clear that a perfect coincidence of numerous policies designed to reduce Britain’s carbon dioxide emissions has had the unintended effect of hollowing out the reliability of the electricity generating sector,” he added. Findings within the report claim that in recent winters the country’s spare electricity margin has fallen from around 17% during the winter of 2011-12 to around 1% this winter. The report says “there is a sustained danger of intermittent blackouts for the foreseeable future”, and that this is down to “dwindling base capacity and freak weather events”. In order to plug the capacity gap, household bills by 2020 could increase by as much as £30 a year – nearly double government estimates. The report also states that the National Grid has been given the go-ahead by the government to pursue emergency measures to cover peak demand and prevent blackouts. Measures to stop the country’s lights going out during peak periods include restarting old coal power stations, according to the report. Power-intensive businesses such as factories are also paid to “detach” from the grid and run from their own energy sources such as emergency diesel generators. The procurement of contracts with power stations not trading in the normal energy market, who are paid an “exorbitant sum” to be kept in standby mode over winter, is also a measure. Last winter National Grid paid £33.9m for this emergency power, with £122.4m set to be spent during the cold months of 2016-2017. The BIG report says these costs are “spread across the network and picked up by consumers in the form of higher bills”. “Consumers, both domestic and business, having once reaped the benefits of tumbling prices after the 1990s market reforms, are now resigned to paying ever-higher electricity bills,” the report adds. Shapps said: “A radical rehabilitation of electricity markets is required to bring both consumer prices and capacity concerns under control in the short term.” In the longer term he said the government should “work to make it profitable for private companies to invest and innovate in our electricity markets once again”. The report states that if Britain is to “make the shift to the cleaner, electrically powered economy of the future, its electricity generating sector must be able to provide cheap electricity in abundance, respond rapidly to new demands and shoulder its own risks and rewards”. Daniel Mahoney, head of economic research at the Centre for Policy Studies, said: “Mismanagement of energy policy – both from the European Union and the UK government – has left the UK with desperately narrow capacity margins. “In her first major campaign speech, Theresa May made a welcome declaration that she wanted to see an energy policy that promotes the reliability of supply and lower costs for users. “This report re-emphasises the need for this commitment to be delivered.”"
"Reindeer are shrinking on an Arctic island near the north pole as a result of climate change that has curbed the amount of winter food available to the animals, scientists said on Monday.  The average weight of adult reindeer on Svalbard, a chain of islands north of Norway, fell from 55kg (121lb) to 48kg (106lb) in the 1990s as part of sweeping changes to Arctic life while temperatures rose, they said.  “Warmer summers are great for reindeer but winters are getting increasingly tough,” Professor Steve Albon, an ecologist at the James Hutton Institute in Scotland who led the study with Norwegian researchers, said.  Less-chilly winters mean that once-reliable snows fall more often as rain that can freeze into a sheet of ice, making it harder for the herbivores to reach plant food. Some reindeer starve and females often give birth to stunted young.  In summer, however, plants flourish in a food bonanza that ensures healthy females more likely to conceive in autumn. The wild herd studied had expanded to about 1,400 animals from 800 since the 1990s.  “So far we have more but smaller reindeer,” Albon said of the animals on Svalbard, about 1,300km (800 miles) from the north pole. The rising population also means more competition for scarce food in winter.  Arctic temperatures are rising faster than the world average amid a build-up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.  Most studies of global warming around Svalbard have focused on polar bears that hunt seals at sea, rather than year-round land residents such as reindeer, Arctic foxes and Svalbard rock ptarmigan birds.  Arctic fox numbers have risen slightly because they thrive in severe ice winters by scavenging dead reindeer, said Eva Fuglei, a researcher at the Norwegian Polar Institute and the Fram Centre who was not involved in the reindeer study.  “All the weak reindeer die – the sick, the elderly and calves,” she said. But that meant foxes struggled to feed the next winter because only the fittest adult reindeer have survived. "
"Environmental groups have called Donald Trump’s choice of Rex Tillerson as secretary of state “unfathomable” and “an epic mistake” and accused the president-elect of creating “a government of, by, and for the oil and gas industry”. Trump announced his nomination of the 64-year-old outgoing ExxonMobil CEO on Tuesday. If confirmed as the nation’s top diplomat, Tillerson would have a key role in international climate talks, and his ties to the oil industry and his work with oil giant ExxonMobil over the past 41 years have left environmentalists worried.  “As a leader of an environmental organization I’m concerned about someone with Rex Tillerson’s record being put in charge of our foreign policy,” Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, said in a phone interview. “A thorough review of ExxonMobil’s operations in Indonesia to the United States shows that the company’s drilling and fracking and refining operations have had a very serious impact on the environmental health, on local populations, and in many cases their human rights as well,” he claimed. The company’s security forces were accused by villagers in Indonesia of murder and torture between 1999 and 2001, a period when Tillerson held senior positions at Exxon but before he became CEO. In 2011, Exxon called the accusations “baseless”. Ken Kimmell, the president of Union of Concerned Scientists, said in a statement that the choice of Tillerson was analogous to choosing the CEO of a tobacco company for surgeon general because of his conflicts of interest. “Why would you pick the leader of an oil and gas corporation to spearhead a position tasked with national security and global climate action?” he asked. Abigail Dillen, vice-president of litigation for climate & energy at Earthjustice, an environmental law nonprofit, was also worried about Tillerson’s conflicts of interest as secretary of state, as he spent decades making deals for ExxonMobil. Tillerson, she said, is “not just linked to the industry, he is the industry”. “Handing over US global policy to Big Oil is an epic mistake,” Rhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a statement. “This industry has been near the center of more conflict than any other in modern time; tapping its chief oilman as the nation’s top diplomat sends the wrong message at home and abroad.” The climate group 350.org called the choice of Tillerson “unfathomable”. 350.org is one of the organizations behind the #ExxonKnew campaign relating to the company’s history of concealing the full impact of climate change – something Brune and other environmentalists also expressed concerns over. (Exxon has said climate science in the early 1980s was at a preliminary stage, but that the company now sees climate change as a risk.) “Tillerson deserves a federal investigation, not federal office,” 350.org executive director May Boeve said.  ExxonMobil is currently under investigation for misleading investors about what it knew about climate change.  Tillerson has acknowledged that climate change is real and caused by human activity in 2012, but he said society would be able to adapt to it. During his time as chief executive of ExxonMobil, the company endorsed a carbon tax and stated its support for the Paris climate agreement. But Tillerson has said that until there are major breakthroughs in green technologies “the world is going to have to continue using fossil fuels, whether they like it or not”. Trip Van Noppen, president of Earthjustice, said in a statement that these actions make Tillerson appear “somewhat responsible in comparison to the rest of the incoming Trump administration – a sign of just how abysmally low the bar has been set by the president-elect and his cabinet.”   Brune expressed concern that the US would give up its leadership role on climate change under Tillerson, and although he said he was not sure what Tillerson’s appointment meant for the Paris climate agreement, he said he believed in “the track record of the people they [the Trump team] are putting into power, which means they will try to undermine progress any chance they get.”  Trump has said he has an “open mind” about the Paris deal, but has pledged to withdraw from it it in the past. He infamously called climate change a hoax “created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive”. 350.org pledged to put pressure on senators to “to turn the confirmation process into a hearing on ExxonMobil’s history of climate deception”, and Dillen of Earthjustice said that her group would be one of the many calling for the senate to reject Tillerson’s nomination. Brune said Sierra Club members would be mobilized in states across the country to contact their senators. “His appointment is anything but a sure thing both because of his ties to Russia and his ties to climate denialism,” Brune said. The nomination of Tillerson as secretary of state comes within a week of Trump choosing Scott Pruitt, attorney general of Oklahoma, to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. Pruitt has sued the EPA and has claimed that scientists “continue to disagree” about the causes and extent of global warming. In fact, the overwhelming majority of scientists agree climate change is happening and caused by humans.  The heads of Trump’s transition teams for Nasa, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of the Interior and the Department of Energy also all question the science of human-caused climate change. Trump also selected Rick Perry as the secretary of energy, another oil-drilling advocate, although he also backed wind power as governor of Texas.  Kimmell of the Union of Concerned Scientists said that the selections of Tillerson and Pruitt show that “President-elect Trump is creating a government of, by, and for the oil and gas industry”. For Brune, the cabinet appointments and transition leadership decisions sent a clear message. “We are right at a time when businesses and cities and many states and most countries around the world are going full speed ahead in replacing fossil fuels with clean energy,” Brune said. “The federal government of the United States will be reversing course and trying to lead us in the opposite direction.”"
"Emergency services in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory have predicted a worse than usual bushfire season, as this week’s heatwave breaks December records in south-eastern Australia.  The NSW Rural Fire Service warned that drier than average conditions made NSW “extremely vulnerable” to bushfires this summer, while fire bans were declared in parts of NSW, Victoria and South Australia for Tuesday and Wednesday.  On Tuesday afternoon residents in Neath and Abermain, near Cessnock in the NSW Hunter Valley, were warned to take shelter as 80 firefighters assisted by water-dropping aircraft fought two fires in the area.  Residents in several streets were told it was too late to leave their homes. Others were advised it might not be safe to return home. #Abermain / #Neath Fire: It is too late to leave for residents in Carrs Rd, Charles Rd & York St. Seek shelter as the fire approaches. #Abermain / #Neath Fire: This video footage was taken about an hour ago by a #NSWRFS chopper fighting the fire. #nswfires pic.twitter.com/Fb4fiYLkxA Temperatures were expected to exceed 33C in Sydney, Canberra, Melbourne and Adelaide concurrently, which has not occurred in December since 1965. Tuesday was forecast to be Sydney’s hottest December night since 1972. The deputy commissioner of the NSW Rural Fire Service, Rob Rogers, said he was concerned about the December to February period. “We’ve had some really significant rainfall west of the ranges over winter which has caused a huge amount of grass growth west of the Great Dividing Range. This is quite concerning for us regarding the potential for significant grass fires over the summer,” he said. The RFS has extended the lease of one of its 44,000 capacity fire-fighting air tankers as an extra precaution. “It only takes a day or two of warm weather,” Rogers said.  His concerns echoed  a recent report from the Australian Climate Council which predicted “tinderbox conditions” for NSW and the ACT and “above average” bushfire potential for parts of Western Australia and Queensland. “The trend of warmer and drier than average weather conditions mean both NSW and the ACT are extremely vulnerable to bushfires this summer,” it said.  “We had one of the wettest springs on record and then one of the driest Octobers on record, so we’ve got a lot of grass there that is very, very dry. That provides a very dangerous level of fuel,” Prof Lesley Hughes said.  She linked the report’s findings to climate change and urged the government to take immediate local action as well as working globally to curb emissions.  “The most important message to get across is that climate change is with us now. We’re already getting more extreme hot weather and we will continue to see this risk of bushfires increasing”, she said. “We need to make sure our emergency services are adequately resourced, and that that increases as the risk from climate change increases. Long term, we fundamentally have to control our emissions and work with the rest of the world to do that. Australia is widely recognised as lagging sadly behind.”  The chief officer of the Victorian Country Fire Association, Steve Warrington, also noted concern over grass fires, but said the summer was otherwise “looking like a traditional fire season”.  “We think it will be short and sharp”, he said. “The focus this year will be on the grasslands and the scrub coastal areas around Victoria”. But he said homeowners and municipalities should take extra precautions due to recent weather fluctuations.  “Normally we would have a lead-in time – but we’ve almost turned the tap on overnight, we’ve gone from rain and cold and floods to heat and fire almost within a week,” he said. “The time that people normally have to clean up their property isn’t there.” Fire services advised vulnerable homeowners to prepare a bushfire survival plan, clean out gutters and remove combustibles such as wood piles from around their homes.  In NSW, with temperatures nudging 40C in some areas, severe fire warnings were in place in the north, south and eastern Riverina and the lower Central West Plains, with total fire bans in seven districts.  A Total Fire Ban is now in place for many parts of NSW.Report all unattended fires to Triple Zero. #NSWRFS pic.twitter.com/uAXNSOvMlR The RFS put out isolated spot fires throughout the day and instructed farmers in several regions to cease harvesting.

The RPSCA warned pet owners against a potential “epidemic of heat stress-related injuries and possible death” for dogs during the hot spell. “It only takes six minutes for an animal to die from heat stroke,” said RSPCA NSW chief inspector David OShannessy. He urged dog owners not to leave their pets unattended in cars and to take extra precautions in providing water and shade. "
"While the separation of church and state is enshrined in the Australian constitution, the presence of religion has never been far beneath the surface of our political system. The Australian Labor party is in many ways a creature of the Catholic church, emerging as it did from the devout Irish working classes of the 1850s; the internal split that fractured the party through the 1950s and 1960s driven by a determination to fight the godless communist insurgency. On the other side, a conservative party built on the Protestant work ethic and increasingly influenced by a God-fearing fundamentalist flank inspired by the Pentecostal fervour that created the religious right in the United States. On issues as diverse as marriage equality and IVF, euthanasia and the treatment of refugees, articles of faith have been both an anchor point and an organising tool for contentious political debates. But as we have pointed out recently, with traditional membership of churches on the decline the impact of organised religion on the body politics is waning. This week’s Essential Report attacks the faith issue from an alternate angle by asking people: what happens to us when we die? After all, the post-life condition is a fundamental marker of faith or its absence. What we find is a strong atheist contingent who see nothing at the end of their mortal coil. A further 25% in the agnostic camp are unable to commit. This leaves the largest cohort – 43% – heading to a range of spiritual destinations such as an afterlife (27%), coming back for another crack (9%) and shuffling off somewhere else (7%). As is our habit, we couldn’t help ourselves checking on voter profile – where the most striking finding is the consistency of belief across political affiliation. While Greens are significantly more likely to see no future destination, major party voters match each other tightly on their beliefs.  Turning our attention to specific issues and the spiritual crosstabs yields a little extra data. If you are agnostic about where you are headed you are less likely to blame climate change on human activity. Unsurprisingly perhaps, you are also more likely to answer don’t know. In contrast, if you have a definite view of your future post-expiration, you are more likely to also have a definite view on our changing climate. On a more immediately relevant issue to the hereafter the insights are less intuitive.  While agnostics again are overrepresented in the “don’t know” camp, it is the strong overrepresentation of atheists among supporters of voluntary euthanasia that bears scrutiny. On one level these people are free from the religious dogma that reifies the sanctity of life. On the other, they are more likely to embrace a fast-track to the ultimate destination, even though they don’t expect much of a view. So is there a point to this exercise other than to prove that this time of year I have too much time on my hands? Like any research, look hard enough and it gives you a few things to chew on. First, despite the deviations, on issues that really go to the core of who we are, the differences in political worldview of the spiritual and atheist only exist at the margins. On its surface this suggests we have succeeded in our federation’s founders aspiration of separating church and state; our political identities are not rooted to our spiritual personas. I would contend that this represents a change from the politics of the 20th century, where church commitment was stronger, as were debates about the fundamentals of our political system while the battle between capitalism and communism played out. Yes there has been a particular focus on modern political debates about the impact of Islam on politics since 9/11, but this is engaged with as an issue of national security, not as one of faith. But if the fading away of a spiritual frame to our politics has been partly caused by the decline of the traditional religious institutions, it has also been fuelled by the silence of our political participants. With rare exceptions, Australian politicians do not link their own sense of spirituality to the issues they advocate for or oppose: instead they tend to oscillate between dead managerialism of technocratic jargon and the overwrought hyperbole of populism.  Rare is the contribution that grounds politics and policy into the more fundamental aspects of our human condition. I find this particularly missing in our discussions about the existential threat of climate change. We give lip service to the need to leave the planet to our children, but we shy from a deeper engagement with our own raison d’être. Likewise with debates around health and aging; we fall into the problem-solution, budget-burden, don’t-touch-Medicare mode without giving voice to the inevitability of death. This is not a call for the privileging of certain spiritual views above others or, God forbid, trying to convert atheists or agnostics (or vice versa). It is simply an observation that much that dulls the passion in our discourse starts with our tendency to shy from the existential. Something about our political culture means our leaders don’t feel compelled to intone “God Bless Australia” when addressing the masses, and that’s a good thing. But it would be refreshing to hear our leaders grappling with these deeper issues, if only to assist us build a stronger bridge between our own inner worlds and the one we share."
"The closure of Victoria’s Hazelwood coal-fired power station will add an average of $78 a year to energy bills around the country, a new analysis claims. South Australians will have $150 a year added to household bills, Victorian power bills will rise by $99, a typical New South Wales consumer will pay an extra $74 a year for their electricity, while Queenslanders will pay an extra $28, due to to the upcoming closure of Australia’s cheapest – and most polluting – power generator.   The Australian Energy Market Commission 2016 residential electricity price trends report found wholesale energy prices would jump 36% with the planned shutdown of Hazelwood in March. “Across the national electricity market the generation mix is changing – with the large-scale renewable energy target leading to substantial investment in wind generation,” the commission’s chairman, John Pierce, said on Tuesday. “This is contributing to the closure of coal-fired plants and increasing wholesale and retail prices.” The federal energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, said the government was trying to keep prices down while maintaining energy security. Frydenberg said an increase in coal royalties in Victoria and an increased renewable energy target had forced Hazelwood’s French owners Engie to shut the plant down. But the Victorian minister for energy and climate change, Lily D’Ambrosio, said the federal government’s lack of leadership on energy policy was to blame for the price rises. “Everybody is sick of the lack of leadership and silly political games being played by the commonwealth, let’s get on with it and do what we were elected to do,” D’Ambrosio said.  D’Ambrosio told ABC News 24 that while the report showed there would be initial price rises with the closure of Hazelwood, it also showed prices would moderate as more renewable energy came online. “More renewable energy actually puts downwards pressure on power prices for families and businesses,” she said. In November, the chief executive of Engie Australia, Alex Keisser, said the 50-year-old Hazelwood plant was “no longer economic to operate”. “Engie in Australia would need to invest many hundreds of millions of dollars to ensure viable and, most importantly, continued safe operation,” Kesser said at the time. “Given current and forecast market conditions, that level of investment cannot be justified.” The AEMC report also noted that electricity prices would be affected by the price for gas through gas-fired power stations, and was expected to play a larger role in the market in the future. “Any future increase in the price of gas will result in higher input costs for generators, flowing through to higher costs in the wholesale electricity market,” Pierce said. For 2016-17, the total average bill for the year is estimated to be $1,353 — a 4.4% increase from the year before.  The Council of Australian Governments energy council will meet in Melbourne on Wednesday to look at regulations around new interconnectors, and efforts to ensure cheaper gas supplies. • Australian Associated Press contributed to this report"
"The Turnbull government has been an utter disappointment on so many things but nowhere as much as on the biggest issue of our time: climate change.  Unable to shrug off the legacy of the climate-denying Abbott government, it has been bullied out of any climate change ambition by science-denying fringe elements on the right.  The list of dishonourable mentions are long. Despite signing the Paris agreement last year, the Australian government has consistently undermined any efforts to keep the world below the safe level of 2C. Last week’s backflip on the idea of a carbon-intensity emissions trading scheme – supported by most of the banks and the energy sector as the best way to reduce emissions and provide a level-playing field – is just the latest in a long line. But the biggest worry is seeing Turnbull’s coal-loving ministers push through the Adani mega coalmine in Queensland, replete with the offer of a $1bn taxpayer-funded loan to build a railway line through rich farmland to a coal terminal on the Great Barrier Reef. If constructed, the Adani mine will almost certainly condemn the Great Barrier Reef to the annals of history, not to mention blowing almost any chance of us living in a safe climate future. But while climate change is mired in partisanship and cheap political point-scoring on a federal level, Australian organisations, driven by a strong market shift away from polluting fossil fuels, particularly coal, are leading the way towards the clean economy. On Tuesday a report by global financial outfit Arabella shows that fossil fuel divestment is now worth an astounding A$7tn globally. It spans almost 700 organisations as diverse as the Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund, the City of Newcastle and the Australian National University. This $7tn that is not invested in coal, oil and gas provides a significant financial indicator to back up what we already know: fossil fuels are on the nose. While Australia may be lagging on a government level, many of our businesses are leading the world in waking up to the risks posed by fossil fuels and the opportunities of the new clean economy. The Arabella report highlights that Australia has the most divestments per capita of any developed nation. And these organisations that have divested are by no means radical. It is groups such as the Australian Capital Territory’s government, Australian Academy of Science, the Royal Australasian College of Physicians and the National Tertiary Education Union. Add to the mix almost 30 local government councils, 10 super funds, a handful of our top universities and you get the picture. There is even a chance you live in a fossil-free council considering that more than one in 10 Australians now live in a council area that has sworn off fossil fuels. In 350.org’s work, we deal closely with banks, energy companies and organisations that are constantly weighing up the risks associated with fossil fuel investments. All of them have told us just how quickly things are changing. The recently released Melbourne University sustainability plan acknowledges the changing market dynamics: Companies which effectively manage environmental, social and governance responsibilities should yield better risk-adjusted returns over the long term. And as coal enters structural decline, clean energy is booming. Consumers and local government are bypassing government barriers and again leading the way. Local governments, such as the City of Melbourne and others such as the ACT are teaming up to source their energy from renewables – thus providing security for investors to build more clean energy infrastructure. The Renewable Energy Benefits: Measuring the Economics report that came out earlier this year showed that doubling renewable energy’s current share of the global energy mix to 36% by 2030 would create 24 million jobs and deliver about half of the emissions reduction necessary under the Paris agreement. For Australia this would boost our economy by 1.7%. The clean energy rush would create a swathe of new jobs in regional areas to meet the demand to transition from our dirty grid to the new renewable one. Already we are seeing a transition that is well under way. Just last week Energy Australia announced an investment of $1.5bn into new wind and solar projects to meet its renewable energy target. It also announced support for a price on carbon – the same day the Turnbull government backflipped and said a carbon price was now off the table. Something is seriously wrong when the country’s biggest climate polluters are calling for a tax on their operations and the government refuses to consider it. Energy Australia’s announcement is one of many from around the country: Eco Energy is building a new solar plant in regional Queensland; AGL is building solar plants across regional New South Wales, including a new one near Broken Hill; and Origin Energy is seeking to divest much of its oil and conventional gas assets to focus more on renewables. The key now is to ensure our big three energy companies collectively push beyond our rudderless federal government, not fall into the idea that gas is the answer over coal, and quicken the pace to clean energy. It helps that at this point in time, both large-scale wind and solar projects are now cheaper than fossil-fuel energy sources. Over the past few years, leadership from business has been the main driver in Australia’s route to decarbonisation. But businesses can’t bear the load alone and they have recognised this. In November, Andrew Vesey, the chief executive of AGL, was one of 17 eminent Australians who called on the government to stop blocking the transition, “facilitate and accelerate the inevitable closure of coal plants” and “create an attractive sustainable investment environment for clean energy”. If we are to benefit from the jobs of the new economy and ensure a safe future for the planet, Malcolm Turnbull and the energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, must stop listening to the science-denying members of their party and instead start making some real decisions about what our energy and economic future will look like."
"Tackling climate change is the “biggest economic opportunity” in the history of the US no matter who holds political office, the Hollywood star and environmental activist Leonardo DiCaprio said on Friday.   “There are a few very prominent people that still deny the overwhelming conclusions of the world’s scientists that climate change is largely human-caused and needs immediate urgent attention,” he told a United Nations awards ceremony.  But “the truth” about climate change has spread like “wildfire”, he said.  DiCaprio’s comments, as he received a prize for his work as a global citizen, did not refer to the US president-elect, Donald Trump, by name but were a thinly-veiled reference to his views and nominations of climate sceptics with oil industry ties for cabinet posts.  Earlier this month, 42-year-old DiCaprio and the head of his foundation met Trump and his team, reportedly arguing that support for renewable energy could create millions of jobs.  Trump has suggested climate change is a hoax and raised the possibility of withdrawing US support for a new global accord to reduce greenhouse gas emissions which most scientists believe are driving up sea levels and causing more droughts and violent storms.  “In less than 100 years of our pollution-based prosperity, we humans have put our entire existence in jeopardy,” said DiCaprio, who released his own documentary, Before the Flood, on the impacts of global warming two months ago.  DiCaprio, who won an Oscar this year for playing a fur trapper battling nature in The Revenant, said his documentary was the most viewed “in history ... [showing] just how much the world cares about the issue of climate change”.  But he said the battle to address it was far from over, calling on the world to implement the Paris agreement on climate change, which came into effect in November, and to “go further”. People everywhere are acting to curb the damage to humans, nature and wildlife from a warming planet, DiCaprio said – from putting a price on carbon emissions to buying cleaner cars, eating less meat, and businesses vowing to be carbon-neutral.  “To those who may be discouraged by naysayers, let me remind you, the environmental awakening is all over the world and the progress we have made so far … has always been because of people, not governments,” DiCaprio told the United Nations correspondents association event in downtown New York.  DiCaprio, who has worked closely with outgoing UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, on climate action, congratulated him for “elevating the significance of climate change to one of fundamental global sustainability and peace”.  Without Ban’s persistence, the world would never have made so much progress on climate change, culminating in the Paris agreement sealed in December 2015, DiCaprio said.  Earlier on Friday, Ban said acting on climate change meant “jobs, growth, cleaner air and better health”, adding that leaders of top companies, governors and mayors understood this.  The Paris agreement was “a precious achievement that we must support and nurture”, he told his final press conference at the United Nations. “There is no turning back.” "
"The rogue practice of removing vital pollution filters from the exhausts of diesel vehicles has suffered a blow with the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) for the first time banning an advert for the service. However the number of filterless cars on UK roads, pumping out high levels of toxic particles, remains unknown and air pollution campaigners say the government must investigate and then crack down on the shady practice. Particulate pollution causes almost 29,000 early deaths each year, costing £15bn in health costs. Diesel particulate filters (DPFs) have been compulsory in new diesel cars since 2009 but can become clogged and cause breakdowns, particularly for city drivers. Replacing DPFs usually costs more than a £1,000 and, as a result, many garages across the country offer to remove the filter completely for a few hundred pounds. They exploit a legal loophole which means removing a DPF is not an offence, only driving the car afterwards on a public road. Without the filter, particulate emissions are likely to soar fivefold. Friends of the Earth complained to the ASA about an online advert from a garage in Bristol which offered to remove DPFs. The advert said: “The only MOT regulation regarding the DPF is a simple visual inspection. As long as the DPF still appears to be fitted, the vehicle will pass the MOT visual inspection. Therefore we only remove the internal core, leaving the outer casing in place. The vehicle will appear to have a DPF fitted and will appear unmodified.” A qualification was included at the bottom of the advert which stated “*Our DPF Removal service is sold for off-road use only”. However, the ASA concluded on Wednesday that this “was not sufficiently prominent to counter the overall impression that vehicles which had their DPF removed could be used on public roads” and banned the advert as misleading.  Any future adverts must make “immediately clear with sufficient prominence that it is illegal to drive such vehicles on a public road”, the watchdog said. In 2014, ministers said the “unacceptable” practice of removing the filters was “clearly detrimental to people’s health” and introduced a visual check into the MOT. The Guardian revealed in May this had caught 1,188 vehicles. But with some garages promising “invisible” DPF removal to beat the MOT test, as in the case of the banned advert, the true number of filterless vehicles is likely to be much higher. “The more we uncover about diesel vehicles, the dodgier they seem,” said Aaron Kiely, at Friends of the Earth. “Removal of pollution filters – which are designed to reduce dangerous emissions and protect people’s health – should clearly be illegal. The Department for Transport must also investigate the full scale of this problem and clamp down on those who are putting people’s lives at risk.” A spokesman for the Department for Transport (DfT) said: “The government is firmly committed to improving the UK’s air quality and cutting harmful emissions. Changes to the MOT test were implemented in 2014 to ensure that particulate filters are fitted where necessary and if not then the vehicle would fail the test.” “Alternative methods of detecting the removal or effectiveness of particulate filters are under development and we are examining their suitability for use in an MOT,” said DfT spokesman: “Further research is required to ensure potential methods accurately determine a pass or fail.” Almost all diesel cars have also been revealed as emitting far higher levels of nitrogen dioxide than official limits. NO2 levels are illegally high in most of the UK’s air quality zones and calls are rising to ban dirty diesel vehicles from British city centres, as Paris, Madrid, Athens and Mexico City have already pledged. In May, the Guardian also revealed that Google, eBay and Gumtree had refused to ban adverts offering to remove DPFs."
"The Turnbull government signed an agreement to make a $640,000 grant to Bjørn Lomborg’s Copenhagen Consensus Centre nine months after plans to establish the centre had been abandoned.  The education department may have been under no legal obligation to make the grant, documents suggest.  The funding was used to support the centre’s post-2015 UN development goals project that found limiting global temperature rises to 2C was a poor investment. A breakdown of costs released on Thursday shows that $482,000 of the Australian funding was spent on professional fees and services including research, “outreach” and forums.  About $146,000 was spent on travel in an ambitious global project convening seminars to discuss the UN development goals in Bangladesh, Brazil, Colombia, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria, South Africa and New York. The project formed the basis of Lomborg’s book The Nobel Laureates’ Guide to the Smartest Targets for the World, which is not widely available in Australian shops. Documents released under freedom of information show the department only entered a formal agreement to fund the project as late as 21 March 2016. Based on those documents and answers provided by the education department it appears the government did not have any ongoing commitment to the project when the Australian Consensus Centre was canned in June 2015. The government’s plan to establish the Australian Consensus Centre was put into effect in an agreement with the University of Western Australia (UWA) dated 24 March 2015. But on 26 June 2015 the government and UWA terminated the agreement by consent because the university rejected the funds after a public backlash. The agreement created an obligation for the government to pay UWA’s reasonable costs, but did not create obligations to the CCC. An education department spokeswoman told Guardian Australia no payments were made to UWA under the agreement. The $640,000 grant is disclosed in a log of education grants dated 2 July 2015 but the spokeswoman said it was only added after the grant agreement was signed with the CCC on 21 March 2016.  In September 2015 it was referred to in an incoming ministerial brief to Turnbull’s pick for education minister, Simon Birmingham. “The department has negotiated a funding agreement which will provide a one-off payment to the CCC for a total of $640,000 to cover costs incurred in relation to the establishment of the Australian Consensus Centre prior to the decision to cancel this project,” it said. When Guardian Australia asked for a copy of the “funding agreement” with the CCC referred to in the briefing, the education department provided the 21 March 2016 agreement. An education department spokeswoman said “payments were undertaken in accordance with the government’s funding agreement with UWA and the memorandum of understanding between UWA and the CCC”.  The department did not directly respond to questions about how an agreement between the government and UWA and a the memorandum between UWA and the CCC could create legal obligations between the department and the CCC. If there was another legal obligation to pay the CCC, such as an equitable duty, the education department did not identify it after detailed questions, nor identify its source. Neither the education department nor Birmingham explained why a new grant agreement was struck on 21 March 2016 if all or part of the $640,000 was owed by the commonwealth for some pre-existing legal obligation. Asked if the $640,000 was to pay for costs incurred, as described in the brief, the education department spokeswoman said: “The government’s decision to pay the grant was based on the merits of supporting further work to complete the project. “Costs for the project had been incurred. However, under the funding agreement, the department required additional work to be undertaken.” Labor’s innovation, industry, science and research shadow minister, Kim Carr, called on the government to provide a full explanation of the grant. “The government must explain how and why this grant was still awarded, even after it had terminated the agreement with the university for the Australian Consensus Centre following pressure from the opposition and the research community,” Carr said. “Malcolm Turnbull cannot hide behind a prior deal made by Tony Abbott – his government signed a fresh contract on 21 March 2016.” “This use of taxpayers’ money to promote an anti-science conservative agenda shows that Malcolm Turnbull is still beholden to the right wing of the Liberal party.”  At Senate estimates on 20 October, Birmingham said the government had made a “special purpose” decision to allocate funding to the consensus centre, a process that was “terminated”. “Special purpose funding was allocated prior to [Christopher] Pyne deciding to terminate the process … It was commenced under Pyne’s tenure as well,” he said. “The decision to initiate it and also the decision to terminate it occurred prior to my appointment as minister. So you are trawling over some ancient history really.” Asked at estimates what the “special purpose” for the grant was, Birmingham said “obviously the government honoured the contractual obligations insofar as it was obliged to” at the time the centre was cancelled. A spokesman for Birmingham told Guardian Australia his answers to estimates were factual and not misleading but refused to explain what “contractual obligations” the commonwealth had to the CCC before striking the new agreement on 21 March 2016. A spokesman for the CCC referred Guardian Australia to the education department. UWA refused to comment."

"Walk round many suburbs on a winter’s night and your nose will tell you that wood burning is being used for home heating. A recent UK government survey found that 7.5% of UK homes now burn wood. The vast majority use it for supplementary heating or decoration. Wood burning is most popular in the south-east where it is used by around 16% of households and it is least popular in northern England and Scotland where it is used by less than 5%.  We think of wood burning as being natural and therefore less harmful to the environment when compared with fossil fuels. However, particle pollution from UK wood burning is now estimated to be more than double diesel exhaust.  Swiss scientists have been investigating what happens to wood smoke once it leaves your chimney. They burnt logs in a stove and collected the smoke in a chamber. UV lights were used to simulate sunlight and they waited. Slowly the particle pollution in the chamber increased, in some cases by up to three times. If this laboratory experiment reflects what happens in our cities; then pollution from wood burning is even greater than we thought. Setting aside the machinery used in forestry and deliveries, wood burning could be carbon neutral. But carbon dioxide is not the only pollutant that affects our climate. Diesel and coal smoke are well known sources of black carbon that absorbs heat adding to climate change. The smoke and the extra particles that form from wood smoke is brown, which also adds to climate warming."
"Emissions of the powerful greenhouse gas methane have surged in the past decade, threatening to thwart global attempts to combat climate change. Scientists have been surprised by the surge, which began just over 10 years ago in 2007 and then was boosted even further in 2014 and 2015. Concentrations of methane in the atmosphere over those two years alone rose by more than 20 parts per billion, bringing the total to 1,830ppb.  This is a cause for alarm among global warming scientists because emissions of the gas warm the planet by more than 20 times as much as similar volumes of carbon dioxide. In the meantime, emissions of carbon dioxide – the main component of manmade greenhouse gases in the atmosphere – have been levelling off. The new research, published in the peer-review journal Environmental Research Letters, suggests that the world’s attempts to control greenhouse gases have failed to take account of the startling rises in methane. The authors of the 2016 Global Methane Budget report found that in the early years of this century, concentrations of methane rose by only about 0.5ppb each year, compared with 10ppb in 2014 and 2015. The scientists speculate that agriculture may be the main source of the additional methane that has been recorded. However, they cannot be sure of all the sources, owing to a lack of monitoring. At least a third of methane comes from the exploitation of fossil fuels, including fracking and oil drilling and some coal mining, where methane is viewed as a waste gas and is frequently allowed to escape or, in some cases, flared off, which is less harmful. Unlike carbon dioxide emissions, however, which have been tracked in various ways since the 1950s, emissions of methane are poorly understood and could represent a threat that scientists have still not accounted for.  For instance, the melting of the Arctic tundra releases methane as the vegetation underneath is gradually and sometimes suddenly exposed. This has been regarded by scientists as a potential “tipping point” whereby warming of the Arctic leads to greater releases of methane, therefore greater warming, in a runaway and uncontrollable cycle. Although the world’s governments pledged at Paris last year to hold global warming to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, few have yet explained in detail how their intentions will be worked out. The president-elect of the US, Donald Trump, has also cast doubt on the US’s future participation in the emissions cuts required. Robert Jackson, professor of earth system science at Stanford University, and a co-author of the paper, warned that methane should also be a key focus of attempts to control climate change.  “The levelling off we’ve seen in the last three years for carbon dioxide emissions is strikingly different from the recent rapid increase in methane. Unlike CO2, where we have well-described power plants, almost everything in the global methane budget is diffuse. From cows to wetlands to rice paddies [as well as other sources], the methane cycle is harder.” “Why this change has happened is still not well understood,” added Marielle Saunois, assistant professor at the University of Versailles Saint Quentin, and a lead author of the paper. “For the last two years especially, the growth rate has been faster for the years before. It’s really intriguing.” As well as measures that can be quickly implemented to prevent methane emissions from the fossil fuel industry, ways to cut emissions from agriculture are also being developed and implemented. New breeds of rice require less flooding in paddy fields, new feeds can cut down on emissions from cows, and there are methods of capturing methane from large agricultural barns where livestock are intensively reared. However, few of these are yet widely in operation."

"The dramatic melting of Arctic ice is already driving extreme weather that affects hundreds of millions of people across North America, Europe and Asia, leading climate scientists have told the Guardian. Severe “snowmageddon” winters are now strongly linked to soaring polar temperatures, say researchers, with deadly summer heatwaves and torrential floods also probably linked. The scientists now fear the Arctic meltdown has kickstarted abrupt changes in the planet’s swirling atmosphere, bringing extreme weather in heavily populated areas to the boil. The northern ice cap has been shrinking since the 1970s, with global warming driving the loss of about three-quarters of its volume so far. But the recent heat in the Arctic has shocked scientists, with temperatures 33C above average in parts of the Russian Arctic and 20C higher in some other places. In November, ice levels hit a record low, and we are now in “uncharted territory”, said Prof Jennifer Francis, an Arctic climate expert at Rutgers University in the US, who first became interested in the region when she sailed through it on a round-the-world trip in the 1980s. “These rapid changes in the Arctic are affecting weather patterns where you live right now,” she said. “In the past you have had natural variations like El Niño, but they have never happened before in combination with this very warm Arctic, so it is a whole new ball game. “It is inconceivable that this ridiculously warm Arctic would not have an impact on weather patterns in the middle latitudes further south, where so many people live. “It’s safe to say [the hot Arctic] is going to have a big impact, but it’s hard to say exactly how big right now. But we are going to have a lot of very interesting weather – we’re not going to get around that one.” The chain of events that links the melting Arctic with weather to the south begins with rising global temperatures causing more sea ice to melt. Unlike on the Antarctic continent, melting ice here exposes dark ocean beneath, which absorbs more sunlight than ice and warms further. This feedback loop is why the Arctic is heating up much faster than the rest of the planet. This in turn narrows the temperature difference between the Arctic and lower latitudes, which is crucial because it is the temperature gradient between them that drives the jet stream wind, which streaks around the pole at up to 250mph and about 8km above the surface. The jet stream forms a boundary between the cold north and the warmer south, but the lower temperature difference means the winds are now weaker. This means the jet stream meanders more, with big loops bringing warm air to the frozen north and cold air into warmer southern climes.  Furthermore, researchers say, the changes mean the loops can remain stuck over regions for weeks, rather than being blown westwards as in the past. This “blocking” effect means extreme events can unfold. “There have been recent studies showing very plausible physical mechanisms of how rapid warming in the Arctic can influence weather in the mid latitudes, both in summer and winter,” said Dim Coumou at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. Coumou is a former offshore industry geophysicist who has studied the link between extreme weather events and global warming since 2010.  “A couple of years ago this was the main criticism on any such links, that the physics was not well understood,” he said. “But the big question [now] is, how important are these mechanisms?”  The other main influence on the jet stream is sea surface temperature in the tropics, which waxes and wanes with El Niño, while solar cycles and even volcanic eruptions have smaller effects.  The clearest connection so far between the melting Arctic and weather is for extreme winter conditions, such as the intense winters that hit parts of North America and northern Europe in 2009-10, 2010-11 and 2013-14, causing record snowfalls and billions of dollars of damage.  In those years, the jet stream deviated deeply southwards over those regions, pulling down savagely cold air. Prof Adam Scaife, a climate modelling expert at the UK’s Met Office, said the evidence for a link to shrinking Arctic ice was now good: “The consensus points towards that being a real effect.” While downswings of the jet stream can bring freezing winters, the accompanying upswings have been linked to worsening the drought in California. “These northward jet stream swings are of course the reason California is having such a terrible drought,” said Francis. This effect was in fact predicted back in 2004, with those researchers now saying: “Reality is moving faster than we thought or hoped it would.” But the winter extremes can also swing the other way and bring mild but torrential weather, as seen in the past two winters in the UK, leading to severe flooding, said Prof Edward Hanna, at the University of Sheffield in the UK.  He pointed to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), a cyclic variation in air pressure that may be affected by the fast melting of Arctic ice. The variability of the NOA has doubled in the last century, he said: “Within the last decade, there have been wild swings in the NAO values in December.” The connection between the vanishing Arctic ice and extreme summer weather in the northern hemisphere is probable, according to scientists, but not yet as certain as the winter link.  Blocking patterns caused by slow-moving meanders of the jet stream have been firmly linked to some devastating events, including the 2010 summer floods in Pakistan, which killed 2,000 people and affected 20 million, and also the searing heatwave in Russia in the same year, which killed 50,000 people and wiped out $15bn (£12bn) of crops. “We also see such summer events more often in recent years,” said Coumou.  Blocking events have also been linked to summer deluges in the UK, leading to disastrous flooding in 2007 and 2012 which caused billions of pounds in damage.  The year 2012 was also an extreme year for Greenland, with record melting across its entire surface flushing water into the ocean and accelerating sea level rise. The hot loop of air that sat on Greenland that year may also be linked to one of the biggest weather disasters of recent years: Hurricane Sandy, which killed 233 people and cost $75bn in damages. Scientists suspect that the blocking event over Greenland, potentially linked to the record low Arctic ice that summer, prevented the hurricane veering north-east out into the Atlantic like most storms. Instead, blocked by the high pressure, Sandy swung left over the most populated area of the east coast of the US. Another consequence of the fast melting Arctic raises the possibility that there may be even worse extreme weather to come, according to a few scientists: titanic Atlantic superstorms and hurricanes barreling across Europe.  The melting of Greenland ice is pouring about 250bn tonnes a year of fresh water, which is less dense than salty sea water, into the ocean. As a result, the water mass sinks less and the current that drags warm water up the Atlantic is weakened – scientists have already found that the current is at its weakest for a millennium. This means a region of the north Atlantic is becoming relatively cool and this exaggerates the contrast with tropical waters to the south, which is the driver for storms. In the worst case scenario, said the renowned climate scientist Prof James Hansen, this “will drive superstorms, stronger than any in modern times – all hell will break loose in the north Atlantic and neighbouring lands”. Hansen– who was one of the first scientists to alert the world to the dangers of climate change in 1988 and has been arrested more than once outside the White House while protesting against fossil fuel developments – pointed to the historical record as a precedent: 118,000 years ago a superstorm tossed 1,000-tonne mega boulders on to the shores of the Bahamas. “I would certainly not call such [superstorm] scenarios ridiculous,” said Coumou. “But it is speculative – we don’t have the hard evidence.”  But even with what is known so far, there is cause for concern that the complex interactions are turning the slow burn of global temperature rise into sudden weather disasters. “The worrying aspect is that such dynamical changes can occur more abruptly than simple background warming of the climate,” said Coumou. “Dynamical changes can change more rapidly and can therefore lead to surprises and I think there are many such possibilities in the system.” Amid the gloomy prospects, there is some cause for hope however.  “A large fraction of the US public still doesn’t believe that it is humans that are affecting the climate system,” said Francis. “But one of the silver linings of this pretty dark cloud is that the Arctic is such an obvious and conspicuous change, that anybody can see them happening. There is no ambiguity whatsoever.” But this changing of minds needs to happen quickly, said Hansen: “If we wait for the natural world to reveal itself clearly, it may be too late.”"
"They argued about moon-plasma interactions, joked about polar bears, and waxed nostalgic for sturdy sea ice.  But few of the 20,000 Earth and climate scientists meeting in San Francisco this week had much to say about the president-elect, Donald Trump – though his incoming administration loomed over much of the conference. For some, the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) – the largest Earth and space science gathering in the world – was a call to action. California’s governor, Jerry Brown, addressed the scientists on Wednesday morning, telling them, “the time has never been more urgent or your work ever more important. The danger is definitely rising.” Citing financial inequality, the risks of nuclear arms and the mounting effects of climate change, Brown said, “we’re facing far more than one or two or even thousands of politicians.  “We’re facing big oil, we’re facing big financial structures that are at odds with the survivability of our world. It’s up to you as truth tellers, truth seekers, to mobilize all your efforts to fight back.” Brown compared the struggle to the campaigns waged by the tobacco industry, noting that health science and the law eventually curtailed its power. “Some people need a heart attack to stop smoking,” he said. “Maybe we just got our heart attack.” “This is not a battle of one day or one election,” he added, calling scientists “foot soldiers” for truth. The governor promised to help lead the campaign, daring Trump to shut down climate science satellites and mocking Rick Perry, his pick for secretary of energy. “If Trump turns off the satellites, California will launch its own damn satellites,” Brown said. “Rick, I’ve got some news for you: California’s growing a hell of a lot faster than Texas. And we’ve got more sun than you’ve got oil.” Not far away, a team of lawyers with the Climate Science Legal Defense Fund met with scientists to discuss the threats ahead. The group helps defend scientists from harassment and suits over climate change research, most prominently a case brought by a climate change-denying organization to obtain emails and research of scientist Michael Mann. At the AGU table, attorneys handed out guides to “handling political harassment and legal intimidation”. Some scientists are taking action on their own, including Eric Holthaus, a meteorologist who has started one of several “guerrilla archiving” efforts to preserve public climate data on non-government servers. Holthaus and others fear that a Trump administration could take down the data, as former Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper tried to silence scientists. Sally Jewell, the outgoing secretary of the interior, tried to reassure scientists that the Trump administration could not quickly gut federal research. Science would be “foundational” to government, she told attendees: “We have a president-elect that likes to win, and we can’t win without science.”  A worst case scenario would be 'an effort to undermine the scientific infrastructure of the country' Jewell argued that scientists should stress the benefits of science to industry, saying they should start speaking “in the language of business, perhaps, to translate” for the Trump administration. Many federal researchers had already begun to speak in those terms. Scott Hagen, presenting on the dangers of rising tides to Louisiana, said the state could face losses of up to $280m in agricultural lands. Jennifer Francis, a Rutgers professor, said the extreme heat in the Arctic would almost certainly contribute to extreme weather around the world next year. Marco Tedesco, presenting on the “Arctic report card 2016” – a year of record lows – noted that changes in snowfall patterns would affect hydropower and freshwater resources. “Snow melting sooner and faster is leaving a drier soil exposed to a drier summer,” he said. “You might have more drought, might have more forest fires, ramifications for economy, population.” Thomas Zurbuchen, the head of Nasa’s science mission directorate, stressed that scientists should “behave like scientists” and “focus on the data that we get and not amplify the noise”. He too drew a link between science and business: “What you’re carrying around in your pocket is a lot of space data that’s doing work for you.” Jewell urged scientists to “speak up for scientific integrity”, and tried to assure them that pro-science policies “are not going to be easy to undo”. But uncertainty and anxiety reigned, for the future of research and the planet.  “Trump’s leadership will have a chilling effect on environmental and science policy no matter what,” said one climate scientist, who asked for anonymity for fear of work being politicized. “What worries me most is that this administration might launch a fundamental attack on the scientific process.” The best-case scenario, the scientist said, would resemble the Bush administration, in which “leadership doesn’t care much about what the climate scientists say, but they continue to support funding for research”. A worst-case scenario would be “an effort to undermine the scientific infrastructure of the country”. Agencies could radically restructure their staff, for instance, shuffling scientists to unappealing projects while Republicans in Congress slash budgets and Trump reneges on world climate talks. Charles Kennel, a former Nasa official, said that the US’s withdrawal for several years would be “serious but not fatal”.  Other scientists stressed that the world is already changing in dramatic, unpredictable ways. Donald Perovich, a professor at Dartmouth University, said that the Arctic in 2016 looked “as though part of the United States has melted”, a region comparable to all the states east of the Mississippi plus the midwest and North Dakota. When the researchers began doing a yearly report card in the mid-2000s, Perovich said, “you kind of had to listen closely, because the Arctic was whispering change.” “Now it’s not whispering anymore,” he said. “It’s shouting.” "
"There are signs that a war may be brewing over President-elect Donald Trump’s climate legacy, and the bad guys are winning.  His daughter Ivanka appears to be establishing a role as the one person who might prevent the Trump administration from undoing all of the progress made by the Obama administration in cutting US carbon pollution, and instead establishing policies that will maximize the country’s burning of fossil fuels. According to Politico, Ivanka Trump wants to make climate change one of her signature issues. She recently coordinated meetings between the president-elect and Al Gore and Leonardo DiCaprio. DiCaprio in particular wisely focused his presentation on the fact that a shift to clean renewable energy would create millions of jobs. The best way to help a businessman like Donald Trump appreciate the importance and benefits of cutting carbon pollution is to focus on the economic opportunities presented by the coming green technology revolution. It’s an opportunity that China is poised to seize upon, as UCLA Law School’s Alex Wang noted: Climate change regulation is seen as an economic tool aimed at moving China’s economy toward the low-carbon, high-tech, and clean energy industries of the future. China would like nothing more than to have the U.S. retreat from clean energy innovation and allow it to step into the breach. The New York Times also reports that Trump plans to turn over operational control of the family business to his two sons, while Ivanka would take a leave of absence and is considering moving to Washington DC. By distancing herself from the business to avoid conflicts of interest, Ivanka may be positioning herself to become the most powerful first daughter in US history; potentially the first to serve as an influential presidential policy advisor. However, even if her desire to spur action on climate change is sincere, Ivanka Trump faces a veritable army of opposition among those already nominated and appointed to work in the Trump administration. For those concerned about the tremendous threats posed by climate change, Trump’s nominations and appointments to date have been a nightmare. Trump selected long-time climate denier and oil industry spokesman Myron Ebell to head his EPA transition team, and as a result, predictably nominated oil industry puppet Scott Pruitt as EPA administrator. Pruitt is among the Republican attorneys general who, after receiving substantial political donations to meet with fossil fuel companies, sued the EPA to stop its Clean Power Plan. Pruitt quite literally does the fossil fuel industry’s bidding: A 2014 investigation by The Times found that energy lobbyists drafted letters for Mr. Pruitt to send, on state stationery, to the E.P.A., the Interior Department, the Office of Management and Budget and even President Obama, outlining the economic hardship of the environmental rules. If confirmed (which Senate Democrats are poised to fight), Pruitt will do everything in his power to eliminate the EPA’s efforts to cut carbon pollution. He’s joined by the leader of Trump’s Energy Department transition team, Thomas Pyle. Pyle is a former lobbyist for Koch Industries and other fossil fuel companies. He recently released a memo outlining “The Trump Administration’s Energy Plan” that’s been described as reading like a fossil fuel industry wish list, including these policy proposals: For example, Pyle claims that the EPA finding that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare, which was based on the best available science and mandates that the EPA regulate carbon pollution, “will be reconsidered and possibly revoked, marking a major blow to underpinning for many climate regulations.” The memo also states that the increased fuel efficiency standards passed by the Obama administration “will either be completely withdrawn or revised and phased out to be closer to the current levels of fuel economy.”  In short, the Trump Administration’s energy plan focuses on undermining every effort the USA has made to cut its carbon pollution from cars and power plants. The Energy Department transition team is also asking for lists of government employees who have worked on climate issues, which would lay the foundation for efforts to eliminating all government efforts to cut carbon pollution, and potentially launching witch hunts against scientists. Pruitt and Pyle represent the tip of the fossil fuel industry’s total control over Trump’s incoming administration. George Monbiot listed a number of his staffers who come from fossil fuel industry lobbying or think tanks. Trump’s space policy advisor wants to kneecap Nasa’s critical climate research. His nomination for Secretary of Interior Cathy McMorris has voted against 96% of the environmental legislation that’s come before her in the House of Representatives, including voting to bar the EPA from regulating greenhouse gases and voting against enforcing limits on carbon pollution. She’s a big proponent of increased drilling for oil and gas.  His EPA landing team is full of science deniers and EPA critics who have harassed climate scientists. His chief strategist Steven Bannon used to run Breitbart, which publishes some of the worst climate denial imaginable (sometimes combined with blatant misogyny for good measure). And to top it all off, Trump’s choice for Secretary of State is the CEO of the world’s largest oil company, which also is historically the biggest funder of climate misinformation and denial and continues to fund climate denial groups. On the issue of climate change, Trump resembles a character with an angel on one shoulder and a devil on the other. Except in this case, the devil also has a horde of demons beside him. Trump has filled every position of power with fossil fuel industry allies who have years of experience in undermining government efforts to slow human-caused global warming. Trump certainly listens to and trusts his daughter Ivanka, who in Gore and DiCaprio, has wisely invited the counsel of high-profile individuals that are well-informed about the subject of climate change. However, it’s difficult to imagine that Ivanka’s influence on the president can outweigh the direct actions of the climate foes who he has appointed to powerful government positions, especially since she’s new to government and policy debates. Obviously her counsel to date hasn’t stopped Trump from continuing to make these nightmarish appointments. To apply another metaphor, the farmer’s daughter is warning him that he needs to protect the egg supply, but the farmer has put a pack of foxes in charge of guarding the henhouse. If she’s sincere about wanting to preserve a safe climate, Ivanka Trump faces a tremendous challenge. We can only hope that somehow, against all odds, she’s equal to the task.  The winner of this battle will determine whether the Trump name forever becomes synonymous with climate heroism or villainy. So far, the villains are winning bigly."
"The UK has cut the number of Foreign Office staff working on climate change, despite ministers arguing the issue should be a top foreign policy priority. The Liberal Democrats said it was “appalling” and sent “the wrong signals” to the world, after a minister revealed the figures in a recent parliamentary answer.  Experts said that with Donald Trump promising to roll back international climate efforts and with 2016 set to be the hottest on record, it was a bad time to cut back. In London, the number of staff working full time on climate change is down by more than two thirds, from 26 in July 2013 to eight now. Overseas, the figure is down from 177 in March 2013 to 149 today. The UK’s climate change diplomacy is respected internationally, and was seen as playing an important role in the run-up to the Paris agreement, which was agreed in France last year and recently came into force.  Baroness Anelay of St Johns, minister of state for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), said last year: “Climate change is not only a threat to the environment but to global security and economic prosperity. That therefore makes it a top priority not only for environment ministers but foreign ministers too.” Questions were raised by former ministers about the UK’s commitment to leadership on climate change when the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) was abolished and merged into the business department in the summer, a move former Labour leader Ed Miliband branded “plain stupid”. Lynne Featherstone, the Lib Dem environment spokesperson, said: “It’s appalling that the number of people working on climate change in the Foreign Office has been substantially reduced, especially now that the Decc has been disbanded. “It sends all the wrong signals about this government’s commitment to tackling our biggest global threat, and undermines the work being done to encourage other nations to take action.” British diplomatic efforts on climate change have in the past included trying to influence macro economic policy in China to encourage its economy to cut carbon, and pressing the US intelligence community on the risk global warming poses to security. But the Foreign Office’s prioritisation of climate change has been “chipped away” in recent years, say observers. “This is not a good time to be cutting back on Foreign Office staff working on climate change,” said Tom Burke of thinktank E3G, who was adviser to the FCO’s top climate envoy until 2012. “At a recent private meeting in the state department, the US climate envoy again emphasised how important Britain’s climate diplomacy was in driving forward ambition on climate change. As Trump turns the US back into a climate laggard, rather than the leader it has become, our role in building on Paris becomes essential.” He said the UK’s leverage in international climate negotiations was a result of the Foreign Office’s capability to shape conversations on climate change in capitalcities around the world. A government spokeswoman said: “The UK’s commitment and leadership on climate action, internationally and domestically, is as strong as ever and we are recognised as the second best country in the world for tackling climate change. “We take a whole of government approach to our climate change ambitions so that we can benefit from the low carbon transition in our industrial strategy as we deliver an economy that works for all.”"
"The ability of the global insurance industry to manage society’s risks is being threatened by climate change, according to a new report. The report finds that more frequent extreme weather events are driving up uninsured losses and making some assets uninsurable.   The analysis, by a coalition of the world’s biggest insurers, concluded that the “protection gap” – the difference between the costs of natural disasters and the amount insured – has quadrupled to $100bn (£79bn) a year since the 1980s. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, warns in the new report that: “Over time, the adverse effects of climate change could threaten economic resilience and financial stability [and] insurers are currently at the forefront.” The ClimateWise coalition of 29 insurers, including Allianz, Aon, Aviva, Lloyd’s, Prudential, Swiss Re and Zurich, conclude that the industry must use more of its $30tn of investments to help fund increased resilience of society to floods, storms and heatwaves.  The Bank of England warned in 2015 that insurance companies could suffer a “huge hit” if their investments in fossil fuel companies were rendered worthless by action on climate change and some insurers have already shed investments in coal. The ClimateWise report, published on Wednesday, also says the industry must also use its risk management expertise to convince policymakers in both the public and private sector of the urgent need for climate action.  The industry’s traditional response to rising insurance risks – raising premiums or withdrawing cover – would not help deal with the rising risks of global warming, it said. “The insurance industry’s role as society’s risk manager is under threat,” said Maurice Tulloch, chairman of global general insurance at Aviva and chair of ClimateWise. “Our sector will struggle to reduce this protection gap if our response is limited to avoiding, rather than managing, society’s exposure to climate risk.” The report said that, since the 1950s, the frequency of weather-related catastrophes has increased sixfold. As climate-related risks occur more often and more predictably, previously insurable assets are becoming uninsurable, or those already underinsured are further compromised, it said. The economic impact of these natural catastrophes is growing quickly, according to Swiss Re, with total losses increasing fivefold since the 1980s to about $170bn today. This increase is partly due to an increase in extreme weather but also due to an increase in assets as cities and towns have grown, especially in vulnerable locations such as on coasts. “Insurance provides a very important role in providing support for people in their time of need,” said John Scott, chief risk officer at the Zurich Insurance Group and chair of ClimateWise’s “Investing for Resilience” programme. “Finding viable ways to help society adapt and become more resilient to the inevitable changes related to ongoing climate change is vital. It is very clear that as carbon dioxide concentrations increase, we should expect to see more patterns of severe weather disruption. “We understand climate change as underwriters, because we are trying to manage the physical consequences of the severe weather we get from climate change, so we can be a really important industry in terms of informing policy makers, either in the public or private sectors, about the pace at which we should make the change from a high-carbon to low-carbon economy.” Other actions insurance companies can take are to work with their customers to make them more resilient to extreme weather and encourage the development of insurance markets in poorer nations that are growing rapidly, the report said.  Carney, who has warned repeatedly of the serious risks posed by climate change, said: “Insurers, including those who are members of ClimateWise, have unique risk-management expertise to help address the protection gap among those who are most exposed to climate risk.”"
"Donald Trump named Rex Tillerson as his choice for the next secretary of state on Tuesday, potentially elevating an individual with no experience in public office to the position of America’s top diplomat for the first time in modern history. But beyond Tillerson’s role as the chief executive officer of oil giant ExxonMobil, a post he has held since 2006, little is known about the man poised to succeed John Kerry if confirmed by the US Senate early next year. A native of Wichita Falls, Texas, Tillerson was born to parents who met as teenagers at a Boy Scout camp. The meeting foreshadowed how the Boy Scouts of America, one of the largest youth organizations in the US, would shape Tillerson’s mindset. “To understand Rex Tillerson, you need to understand scouting,” Ray L Hunt, a close friend of Trump’s nominee, told the Dallas News in a 2014 profile centering on Tillerson’s longtime dedication to the Boy Scouts.  His father, the article noted, worked at the organization for four decades. As a young boy, Tillerson was an Eagle Scout and went on to serve as the president of the Boy Scouts of America in 2010. During his two-year tenure, the group continued to draw controversy for holding a ban on openly gay scout leaders and members. But Tillerson advocated acceptance toward gay scouts and, as a member of the Boy Scouts executive board, voted in favor of changing the policy in 2013. Tillerson’s associates, according to the Dallas News profile, framed him as adhering to the Boy Scout code that values attributes such as dependability, loyalty and trustworthiness. As a business leader, the 64-year-old has cut a more shrewd figure – negotiating deals with Russian oligarchs and Arab sheikhs at the world’s largest publicly traded oil company. He joined ExxonMobil in 1975 after obtaining a degree in civil engineering at the University of Texas. Throughout his career, Tillerson has maintained his Texas roots. He and his wife, Renda St Clair, reside in Irving and have four children. The latest in a string of millionaires and billionaires selected by Trump for his incoming cabinet, Tillerson was paid $27.3m in 2015 and is just shy of Exxon’s mandatory retirement age of 65. His dealings with Russia, and closeness with President Vladimir Putin, are already the subject of bipartisan ire that could threaten his prospects of being confirmed even by the Republican-led Senate. Tillerson openly backed the lifting of US sanctions on Russia, which reportedly cost Exxon $1bn, according to a company filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Environmentalists have also sounded the alarm over Tillerson’s position on climate change.  Addressing an event hosted by the Council of Foreign Relations in 2012, Tillerson downplayed the threat posed by global warming. “It’s an engineering problem, and it has engineering solutions,” he said. “The fear factor that people want to throw out there to say we just have to stop this, I do not accept.” Kathy Mulvey, the accountability campaign manager and advocate for the Climate & Energy team at the Union of Concerned Scientists, responded this week to reports of Tillerson’s nomination: “Coupled with the nomination of Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt for EPA administration, there’s a real concern that President-elect Trump is creating a government of, by, and for the oil and gas industry. “The analogy of the nomination of Rex Tillerson for secretary of state would be akin to nominating a tobacco CEO as surgeon general.” At a surface level, Tillerson’s backing of a carbon tax in 2009 has been cited by Exxon as evidence of its efforts to join the fight against climate change. The company also signalled its support for the Paris climate accord signed by the Obama administration, which Trump has vowed to repeal as president. But attorney generals in several states are investigating whether Exxon withheld research from its shareholders and the public while denying the risks associated with climate change. Tillerson, like Trump, is a political outsider whose policy views have largely been informed through decades spent in the private sector. And while he has required diplomatic skills to bolster an international business career, his preparedness for one of the most consequential posts in the world also, as with Trump, remains an open question."
" 1 February In global health, 2016 will be remembered as the year a little known virus made a major impact. It felt strangely familiar, but this time it wasn’t Ebola making headlines around the world, it was Zika – a mosquito-borne virus being linked to a huge spike in the number of babies in Brazil born with brain defects. When the World Health Organisation declared that the cluster of microcephaly cases and other neurological disorders were a public health emergency of international concern, it was a rallying cry for the international community to respond. The announcement triggered investment in mosquito control efforts and vital funding for research into the virus and its devastating health consequences. This allowed for the scale-up of initial efforts already under way by institutions including the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. For me, this response also showed that the international community had learned important lessons from the Ebola crisis, and was determined to act more rapidly before the situation spiralled out of control. As 2016 draws to a close, our knowledge of the virus has increased and potential vaccines are in the pipeline. But Zika transmission by mosquitoes has now been reported in 75 countries and we are still a long way from fully understanding and controlling this virus.Professor Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine 8 April It was an incredible achievement for SpaceX. The first stage rocket of one of its Falcon 9 launchers, having successfully lofted cargo to the International Space Station, managed to turn itself around, bleed off the enormous kinetic energy it had acquired while its main engines were burning, fly back down to Earth and land vertically – with balletic precision – on a rather tiny looking robotic barge floating somewhere in the Atlantic. There are many reasons to love this moment. For the sheer audacity of it; for the uncontrollable roar of celebration that erupted in the control room at the moment of touchdown; for the promise that it might prove a game changer in the world of space exploration; for the fact that they named the drone ship on which the landing happened Of Course I Still Love You after a sentient AI spacecraft that featured in one of the late great Iain M Banks’s sci-fi novels. But most of all because Arthur C Clarke once said that any sufficiently advanced technology would be indistinguishable from magic and on 8 April the successful touchdown of Flight 23’s first stage looked a lot to me like magic. Kevin Fong, clinical lead at the Centre for Altitude Space and Extreme Environment Medicine  7-11 May The high point for me this year from an engineering perspective was the announcement by Portugal that the entire country’s electric usage had been provided by renewables for four consecutive days in early May. Moving away from fossil fuels to renewable energy is surely the most important engineering and scientific challenge of our age. The shift to coal in the 19th century and then to oil in the 20th century gave us the modern world of cheap energy, plentiful food, consumer goods and sunny holidays. If we want to prevent climate change while allowing our children to have these things too, then we must wean ourselves off fossil fuels. It seems unthinkable, it seems impossible, but impossible is what engineering does best. Portugal’s achievement gives governments and energy companies a tangible example of how it can and does work, and why they should be investing in solar, wind, wave and other renewable technologies now.Mark Miodownik, professor of materials and society, UCL 28 June  It might seem odd to get excited by a new supply of the second most abundant element in the universe. But in June this year, a collaboration between universities and industry announced that it had discovered a huge reserve of helium gas in Tanzania, using a new exploration technique. Helium is a very small unreactive atom, which makes it spectacularly useful for cooling magnets (in MRI scanners, for example) and as an inert atmosphere for manufacturing semiconductor chips. It’s an essential tool for our modern world. But that tiny size means that it’s easily lost from the atmosphere, and we are reliant on finding trapped pockets of it buried deep underground. The known reserves are limited, and this discovery is huge news. It means that as amazing new ideas come along and our society pushes to make use of them, we won’t be limited by lack of this tiny workhorse.Helen Czerski, research fellow in the department of mechanical engineering at UCL 24 August We’ve discovered in recent years that many stars – perhaps even most of them – are orbited by retinues of planets, like the sun is. The night sky has become hugely more interesting. We’re specially interested in possible “twins” of our Earth – planets the same size as ours, on orbits with temperatures such that water neither boils nor stays frozen – the so-called “habitable zone” . It’s estimated that our Milky Way galaxy contains billions of such planets. This year there’s been further excitement. It’s been realised that even more planets may be orbiting very small faint stars. The nearest star, Proxima Centauri, has a planet orbiting it not much bigger than Earth. Its “year” is only 11 days. But it’s in the habitable zone because Proxima Centauri is a red dwarf star about 100 times fainter than the sun. And there’s hot news that a similar star, 40 light years away, may have three planets in its habitable zone. These planets are “habitable” – but that of course doesn’t mean they are inhabited. We eagerly await telescopes that can analyse the faint light from these planets, seeking evidence for a biosphere. And these discoveries are stimulating searches for advanced (even intelligent) life – though this remains a long shot.Martin Rees, astronomer royal 25 July The Tree of Life was redefined in April, now looking like a jagged explosion, its central node representing a thing we call Luca – the last universal common ancestor. Our presence in this grand view of life is not significant enough to warrant a label, as almost every bough of this tree is a type of bacteria. Amazingly, many of these cells are yet undiscovered, but known only by our finding their DNA, and it being different from all others. Luca is not the origin of life, but the thing from which all life is derived. Luca also got a makeover in July with a dazzling new portrait by Düsseldorf-based biochemist Bill Martin. By tracking back DNA in branches of other single-celled creatures, he drew up a list of 355 genes that tell us how Luca made its living – deep in the metal-rich gassy hydrothermal vents of an ancient ocean floor, the root of life on Earth.Adam Rutherford, geneticist and presenter of Radio 4’s Inside Science 9 August In 1953, Patient HM had experimental brain surgery that left him with striking amnesia. Decades of subsequent research with HM by neuropsychologist Suzanne Corkin made a major contribution to our understanding of memory. Corkin died this year but shortly after, journalist Luke Dittrich published a book claiming Corkin buried inconvenient findings, shredded files, and acted unethically in gaining HM’s consent. Subsequently, 200 neuroscientists wrote to the New York Times to protest at a “biased and unfair attack”. Corkin’s institution, MIT, stated nothing was shredded, and claims of “burying findings” turned out to be indistinguishable from a typical scientific spat. But Dittrich then released audio of Corkin saying she had shredded files and the ethical issues remain unresolved. In many ways, this has been a standard debate about a scientist’s legacy but, so soon after Corkin’s death, passions have run too high for a cool consideration. Undoubtedly, it will come in time.Vaughan Bell, clinical senior lecturer, Faculty of Brain Sciences, UCL 11 August  On our increasingly human-dominated planet we can still learn much from the lives of other species. The discovery this year that the Greenland shark lives for 400 years, making it the longest-living vertebrate, puts our hectic lives into perspective. Perhaps we could pick up some tricks from the frigate birds that were found to sleep for only about 40 minutes a day while on their 10-day nonstop flights across oceans. But all this is put into a stark perspective by the latest readout from the WWF Living Planet Report. This records that over just the past 40 years, a timescale that represents the kindergarten years of a Greenland shark, the number of wild vertebrates on Earth has been reduced by 58%, surely putting the future of many of these species into question.Georgina Mace, professor of biodiversity and ecosystems, UCL 28 September In climate science, we work in 30-year averages, so 30 years is one data point. Four data points ago, in 1896, atmospheric CO2 concentrations were 295 parts per million (ppm). Svante Arrhenius made the first global warming predictions, looking forward to a gentle heating of his chilly homeland Sweden. Two data points ago, in 1957, Charles Keeling began measuring CO2 concentrations and discovered a rapid rise, by 20ppm. In 2016, CO2 levels had risen a further 85ppm over the same time period and were officially announced as 400ppm: the highest in 3m years. Back then, in the Pliocene era, the world was warmer and sea levels were much higher. We don’t know how fast the planet changed, but we know we don’t want to risk seeing it again in future. One data point from now, in 2046, we’re on track to have burned more than a trillion tonnes of carbon and to have reached last year’s Paris agreement target: 1.5C-2C warming. What future do we want to see after that? Tamsin Edwards, lecturer in environmental sciences, Open University 1 October Next time you’re on the verge of picking a fight with your partner, pause and consider the findings of a study published in October. This research involves a large longitudinal study of emotion in interactions within married couples. They get couples into the lab and looking at their stress levels while they have “difficult” conversations, finding that couples that deal with stress with positive emotions like laughter become less stressed, and tend to stay together for longer. This year they looked at the use of negative strategies such as anger or stonewalling responses to conflict, and found that these predicted health-related changes over time in specific ways. The use of anger predicted cardiovascular problems, and “stonewalling” musculoskeletal problems such as bad backs. These relationships were found even after lifestyle factors were controlled for, and were more pronounced in men. Most strikingly, these physical effects were not there at the start of the study, but developed over 20 years. This is an extraordinary demonstration of the health effects of negative emotions.Sophie Scott, professor of cognitive neuroscience, UCL 17 November This year saw the arrival of the long-awaited El Niño, the periodic shift in warm water across the Pacific that brings torrential rain to Central and Latin America and drought to parts of Asia and Africa. Planetary temperatures spiked, putting an end to talk of a “pause”. Yet summer melting of Arctic ice broke no records. But in October, unprecedented weather patterns drove icy winds across Siberia, pushing Arctic temperatures up to 20C above normal and parts of the Arctic Ocean failed to refreeze; in the Antarctic, sea ice thawed faster than usual. For me the bombshell came from a Dutch blogger in late November: a plot of the Arctic plus Antarctic showed sea ice this autumn to be tracking 4m km2 (the size of western Europe) below the normal average. This is a 7-sigma event – with a chance of about one in a hundred billion of being random. The ice doesn’t lie. If we don’t take this seriously now, our children will ask us why.Andrea Sella, professor of materials and inorganic chemistry, UCL 18 November Producing enough food for a growing population in the face of extreme weather associated with climate change without using environmentally damaging methods is a trickier balancing act than the Brexit negotiations! But last month scientists at Illinois University made a breakthrough that could herald a second green revolution for world agriculture – they improved the efficiency of photosynthesis, the process by which plants turn sunlight into the biomass that is the source of all our food. The team used mathematical models to show that increasing the speed at which leaves adapt to shade could potentially raise crop yields. They turned this theory into reality by boosting the expression of the genes responsible and crucially showed this worked in agricultural fields, with a 15% increase in productivity. The work, published in Science, is the culmination of decades of effort to understand the 140 processes underpinning photosynthesis. It demonstrates the value of long-term interdisciplinary collaboration and offers proof of concept for a new approach to environmentally sustainable increases in crop productivity, something that could improve the lives of millions. So it’s my pick for science moment of the year, if not the decade.Prof Sue Hartley, director, York Environmental Sustainability Institute, University of York"
"From rising sea levels to more severe storms and more intense droughts, climate change will present serious risks to, and create major opportunities for, nearly every industry. Citizens, consumers, businesses, governments, and international organisations are all taking action. And entrepreneurs are developing disruptive technologies that will create and destroy value.  The challenge is that investors currently don’t have the information they need to respond to these developments. This must change if financial markets are going to do what they do best: allocate capital to manage risks and seize new opportunities. Without the necessary information, market adjustments to climate change will be incomplete, late and potentially destabilising. Public policy, consumer demand and technological innovation are driving a shift towards a low-carbon economy. Which companies and industries are most, and least, dependent on fossil fuels? And who stands ready to provide resilient and sustainable infrastructure? Which financial institutions are best positioned to gain and which to lose? In every case, which firms have the governance, resources and the strategy to manage, and profit from, these major shifts? We believe that financial disclosure is essential to a market-based solution to climate change. A properly functioning market will price in the risks associated with climate change and reward firms that mitigate them. As its impact becomes more commonplace and public policy responses more active, climate change has become a material risk that isn’t properly disclosed. In response to a G20 request to consider the financial stability risks, the Financial Stability Board created a taskforce on climate-related financial disclosures. Its purpose is to develop voluntary, consistent disclosures to help investors, lenders and insurance underwriters manage material climate risks. As befits a solution by the market for the market, the taskforce is led by members of the private sector from across the G20, including major companies, large investors, global banks and insurers. After a year of intensive work and widespread consultation its recommendations are now publicly available. They concentrate on the practical, material disclosures most relevant to investors and creditors and which can be compiled by all companies that raise capital as well as financial institutions. We are pleased that all taskforce members, companies with market capitalisation of $1.5tn and financial institutions responsible for assets of $20tn, have announced their support for the disclosure recommendations. We encourage others to participate in the consultation, to become early adopters thereafter, and to encourage the companies in which they invest to also make the disclosures. A year ago in Paris, 195 countries committed to limit the rise in global average temperatures to less than 2C. With better disclosure, a market in the transition to that world can be built. That market will expose the likely future cost of doing business, of paying for emissions, and of changing processes to avoid both those charges and tighter regulation. And it will help smooth price adjustments as opinions change, rather than concentrating them in a short, dangerous space of time. Of course, given the uncertainties around climate, not everyone will agree on the timing or scale of adjustments required to achieve this goal. But the right information will allow optimists and pessimists, sceptics and evangelists, to back their convictions with their capital. Early disclosure rules allowed 20th-century financial markets to grow our economies by pricing risks more accurately. The spread of such standards internationally has helped lift more than a billion people out of poverty. Climate-related disclosures could be as transformative for 21st-century markets.  • Catch up on the discussion about this article in our Your Opinions thread."
"The heads of Donald Trump’s transition teams for Nasa, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of the Interior and the Department of Energy, as well as his nominees to lead the EPA and the Department of the Interior, all question the science of human-caused climate change, in a signal of the president-elect’s determination to embark upon an aggressively pro-fossil fuels agenda. Trump has assembled a transition team in which at least nine senior members deny basic scientific understanding that the planet is warming due to the burning of carbon and other human activity. These include the transition heads of all the key agencies responsible for either monitoring or dealing with climate change. None of these transition heads have any background in climate science.  Trump has also nominated Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt to lead the EPA and is expected to pick congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers to head the interior department. Pruitt has claimed that scientists “continue to disagree” about the causes and extent of global warming while McMorris Rodgers has said that former vice-president Al Gore, who has championed climate action, “deserves an ‘F’ in science.”  The president-elect has vowed to pursue an “America first” energy policy that will open up a new frontier in domestic coal, oil and gas extraction while eviscerating the effort to combat climate change, which Trump has previously called a “hoax”. Trump is personally invested in this agenda. According to his latest financial disclosure records, Trump held investments in the fossil fuel companies Shell, Halliburton, Total and Chevron. His largest energy investment was in BHP Billiton, with the documents showing a stake worth up to $1.015m.  Trump also had interests in Energy Transfer Partners and Phillips 66, which are behind the controversial Dakota Access pipeline that Trump wants to see completed. Jason Miller, a Trump spokesman, has said that Trump sold all of his shares in June but has produced no evidence to prove this. Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, said of Trump’s choices: “These are people that had slipped out of the conversation, we haven’t been even debating them in years because they were so out of step with where the American public and business is going on climate change. “Now they’ve leapfrogged into the White House. The world has been turned upside down and it feels like basic science is up for debate. Will we now have to debate whether gravity exists too?” Myron Ebell, head of the EPA transition team, is director of energy and environment at the libertarian thinktank the Competitive Enterprise Institute and chairman of the Cooler Heads Coalition, a group that opposes “global warming alarmism”. Ebell has said that the scientific consensus on climate change is “phoney” and that scientists are part of an effort to spread falsehoods that will result in millions of people being “further impoverished by the higher energy prices resulting from the alarmists’ policy agenda”. He has suggested that “alarmists could also be prosecuted for denying or grossly underestimating the deleterious effects of their energy-rationing policies on human flourishing”.  Other members of the EPA transition team have been plucked from rightwing thinktanks with fossil fuel funding. Amy Oliver Cooke, of the Independence Institute, has said she is an “energy feminist because I’m pro-choice in energy sources”. She has lashed out at “global warming alarmism” on Twitter and claimed falsely in 2014 that there had been 16 years without any global warming.  David Kruetzer, of the conservative Heritage Foundation, has erroneously claimed there has been “global cooling” in recent years while David Schnare, a former EPA lawyer, said last year that “for the last 18 years, the global temperature has been level”. Schnare’s statement is incorrect.  Doug Domenech, head of the interior department transition team, has said carbon dioxide is a “trace greenhouse gas” and has railed against “climate alarmists”.  Domenech is a former Virginia secretary of resources and is now part of the Texas Public Policy Foundation, which states the “forgotten moral case for fossil fuels” as its mission. Trump’s plan to open up more land for drilling will “reinvigorate communities across the nation, especially those most seriously impacted by the current restrictive energy policies”, Domenech wrote in November. Chris Shank, deputy chief of staff to the Republican congressman Lamar Smith, is leading Trump’s landing team at Nasa. Last year, Shank said: “The rhetoric that’s coming out, the hottest year in history, actually is not backed up by the science – or that the droughts, the fires, the hurricanes, etc, are caused by climate change, but it’s just weather.”   Nasa has an internationally venerated climate research operation that may be winnowed away under a Trump administration. Bob Walker, a Trump adviser and climate sceptic, has suggested completely removing Nasa’s $1.9bn Earth sciences budget and focusing instead on deep space exploration.   Thomas Pyle, who is leading the Department of Energy transition team, is president of the American Energy Alliance, a group that advocates for fossil fuel development. Pyle, a former lobbyist for Koch Industries, has opposed the deployment of electric vehicles and said that human influence on the climate has “yet to be determined”.  Trump’s shortlist for cabinet positions also contains climate change deniers and pro-drilling advocates.  Rick Perry, the former Texas governor and climate sceptic, is being considered for secretary of energy, reports say. He would lead a department he was unable to name in a 2011 presidential debate when listing government bodies he would scrap. Kevin Cramer, a congressman and potential energy secretary, said in 2012 that “we know the global climate is cooling. Number one, we know that. So the idea that CO2 is somehow causing global warming is on its face fraudulent.”   Rex Tillerson, chief executive of Exxon Mobil, is reportedly a top contender for secretary of state, a year after it emerged that Exxon spent years covering up and denying climate science despite being well aware of the science of global warming. Steve Bannon, who will be one of Trump’s closest advisers in the White House, has given a platform, via his rightwing website Breitbart, to climate change conspiracy theorists such as the British writer James Delingpole, who has called climate activists “scum” guilty of trying to “advance the cause of global governance”.  Bannon also has a little-known link to environmental work via his involvement in Biosphere 2, a $200m research facility in the mountains outside Tucson, Arizona. As chief executive of the project in the early 1990s, Bannon oversaw experiments that attempted to simulate how the world, represented by thousands of plants and animals housed within a giant glass dome, would cope with air pollution and climate change.  Two disgruntled colleagues, Abigail Alling and Mark Van Thillo, were fired in 1994 after breaking into Biosphere 2 to warn other members of Bannon’s management style. During court proceedings against the duo, Bannon admitted to calling Alling a “bimbo” and threatening to kick her “ass”. He managed the project until it was transferred to Columbia University in 1996.  Trump has threatened to withdraw the US from international climate agreements, cut clean energy spending and loosen regulations for fossil fuel companies. He received $700,000 from oil and gas interests during his election campaign – a sizable amount but still $100,000 less than Hillary Clinton and nowhere near the $10.4m raised by Trump’s Republican primary opponent Jeb Bush.  Robert and Rebekah Mercer, two prominent Republican donors, supported Trump and their financing of climate science denial will likely reverberate at the White House.   The Mercers have backed the Heartland Institute and Heritage Foundation, conservative groups that have tried to discredit climate scientists, and via their foundation bankrolled initiatives such as the Berkeley Earth and Oregon Petition projects. Both endeavors attempted to reveal flaws in mainstream climate science, only to validate scientists’ findings and mislead the public, respectively.   The Koch brothers, who have previously bankrolled candidates who promised to water down environmental protections, largely sat out of the 2016 presidential election but their influence on Trump is now coming to bear through the many groups they fund.   Koch-backed groups supply a number of advisers and transition staff that Trump now relies upon and the conservative network is now sounding upbeat about the new president. Green groups, which were briefly cheered when they saw Al Gore march into Trump Tower for a meeting on Monday, now bitterly complain that this was a smokescreen for Trump’s nakedly anti-environment agenda. “We are seeing the wholesale move of people associated with climate misinformation campaigns into Trump’s administration in a big way,” said Robert Brulle, a sociology and environmental scientist at Drexel University. “Myron Ebell, for example, is the leader of the climate counter-movement that opposes any restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions.  “Trump is getting two pushes – one from the conservative movement and another from fossil fuel interests. If it was one or the other, it wouldn’t be so strong, but they are combined. It’s pretty clear that his administration will be sympathetic to fossil fuel interests. Whether they achieve that is another matter because there will be stiff resistance from the environmental movement and also there will be international concern. We’ll soon see how influential that concern is.”  While Trump can certainly hamper the effort to avoid dangerous climate change, there will be limits to his reach. The plummeting cost of solar and wind energy and the woes of the coal industry can’t be reversed by a president. Cities and certain states, most notably New York and California, have vowed to forge ahead with emission cuts, vehicle electrification and energy efficiency measures.  Federal agencies do have undeniable clout. The EPA oversees clean air and water standards, the Department of the Interior is responsible for millions of acres of public land, including prized sites such as Yellowstone national park and the Everglades. Fossil fuel interests may have deep roots in the Trump administration but it’s unlikely that the American public will tolerate the dissolution of popular protections that have been in place for the past 40 years.  “I think it’s likely there will be a quick failure followed by a correction,” said Bob Inglis, a former Republican congressman for South Carolina. “You get found out at the EPA pretty quickly. It’s not like Fema, where there is a hurricane only once in a while. There will be plenty of opportunities to display incompetence and there won’t be the scapegoat of Barack Obama to blame anymore.   “Donald Trump has made promises to coal and also to natural gas. The problem is that these promises are inconsistent with each other and that will be revealed. The question is how quickly coal miners, and others, will realize that they have been had.”"
"Australia’s chief scientist, Alan Finkel, has tried to stay out of the fresh political row over emissions trading but says his review of the energy market will continue to analyse all the options to ensure future security of power supply and compliance with climate obligations. Finkel’s comments follow a briefing he gave on Friday to the prime minister and state and territory leaders about his preliminary report about the state of Australia’s energy market. He warned that investment had stalled because of national policy uncertainty, and concluded current federal climate policy settings would not allow Australia to meet its emissions reduction targets under the Paris agreement. The Finkel report has generated fresh embarrassment for the Turnbull government because it implicitly endorses an emissions intensity trading scheme for the electricity industry to help manage the necessary transition from high-emission energy sources to lower-emission technologies at least cost to households. The energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, signalled at the start of this week a review of the government’s Direct Action policy would consider whether an intensity scheme for electricity was an option – but the signal stirred a hornets’ nest inside the Coalition. After a brief but noisy outbreak by backbench conservatives declaring the Coalition was, and would remain, fundamentally opposed to carbon pricing, Frydenberg folded, saying the government would not contemplate either a carbon tax or carbon trading. His declaration pre-empted the findings of both the independent Finkel review and his own Direct Action review. The South Australian premier, Jay Weatherill, who supports an emissions intensity scheme for the electricity market, used the opportunity of Friday’s Coag meeting in Canberra to publicly rebuke the prime minister for preemptively killing off the debate. With Turnbull sitting at the table beside him at the post-Coag press conference, Weatherill quoted the prime minister’s comments when he took office that leaders should conduct policy debates that were evidence-based. “That’s simply all we’re asking for here. This is complex public policy. It is easy to scare people,” Weatherill said Friday. “But fundamentally I believe in the intelligence of the Australian community to actually grapple with these complex public policy issues and come up with good solutions.” Turnbull was also peppered with questions from journalists about the government’s backdown at the Coag press conference on Friday. The prime minister was asked about a number of credible studies that have found an intensity trading scheme would allow Australia to conform with our international emissions reduction commitments with the least impact on household power bills, including a study this week which found power bills could be $200 a year less than under the government’s existing policy. The prime minister, in essence, dismissed the findings of a study that had been signed off by the CSIRO – which mirrors analysis from the Climate Change Authority and the Australian Energy Market Commission – claiming there were other studies available with different conclusions. Turnbull said he was committed to reducing power prices. Asked whether he would change his mind if the Finkel review and the Direct Action review produced yet more credible evidence that an emissions intensity scheme would produce abatement at least cost to households, Turnbull said emissions trading schemes increase the cost of electricity to households and businesses. “We want to put downward pressure on, do all we can – and, of course, we have limited means to do so – but do all we can to ensure that this constant rise in the cost of energy for Australian households and Australian businesses that is so damaging to our international competitiveness, stops,” the prime minister said. Finkel told Guardian Australia in an interview on Friday he would not comment on the political row but he said was pressing forward with the task he had been given by Frydenberg and the energy minister’s council. “My commitment is to thoroughly analyse all the options,” he said. The chief scientist noted there was now “broad willingness for change” across the energy sector when it came to climate policy and energy regulation, and “the potential for change is huge”. “The enthusiasm we’ve come across for constructive change is a wonderful thing to see,” he said. Finkel said he expected through the course of the review that alternatives to an emissions intensity scheme may be brought forward by people making submissions to his inquiry, which will deliver a final report in 2017. He said his review would make a priority of analysing why power prices had risen substantially in recent years."
"Alice Bell is right that we need to talk about climate change (Opinion, 6 December). However, when we do, people often say there is no point in cutting one’s own emissions (by not flying, for example) because hardly anyone else is; and they say there is no point in the UK doing anything, because other countries aren’t. Sadly, people in other countries are probably using the same arguments and so, in a self-fulfilling way, it could be argued that they are all correct. Certainly there is no evidence that nations or individuals are actually going to make the changes needed to cut greenhouse gas emissions adequately, whatever pledges may have been made at international conferences. Clearly, we need a new approach: to invest in a combination of carbon scrubbing, geoengineering, third-way solutions, forest protection and reforestation. These can be funded by an international financial transactions tax, and they don’t involve lifestyle changes people won’t accept. We need to start now.Richard MountfordHildenborough, Kent  • There is much wringing of hands when you do talk about climate change in my experience. But, however blandly you suggest you don’t have to fly so often (most flights are holidays), or take the car to the supermarket, there is resistance, even antagonism. It seems that if an action interferes with our pleasure or convenience, it is not worthy enough.Val MainwoodWivenhoe, Essex • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters"
"I just want to be very, very clear that energy prices are too high already. We will do everything that we can to put downward pressure on energy prices. We will not impose a carbon tax, or an emissions trading scheme – that is our position. This is the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, talking to the Melbourne radio host, Neil Mitchell, on Thursday, talking nonsense as it turned out – which is what the government has been doing all week on the subject of climate change.  How do I know he was talking nonsense? There are any number of reports we can draw on to call out what can only be described as unmitigated, lowest common denominator, political crap emanating from the mouth of the prime minister – but I’ll just pick a couple. Let me share with you the findings of a report that lobbed into the public domain at the start of the week, sandwiched between the government opening what could have been a rational and productive conversation about climate change and energy policy, and the government melting in a small puddle of panic. A firm called Jacobs was commissioned by the energy networks industry, in cooperation with the CSIRO, to look very carefully at Australia’s climate policy options. Jacobs is the same economic modelling firm used by the Climate Change Authority to analyse the impact of various policies. The CSIRO signed off on the report. The firm looked at which policy would allow Australia to meet the emissions reduction obligations the Turnbull government signed up to when it ratified the Paris international climate agreement with the least impact on households. The answer was very clear. It was an emissions intensity trading scheme. That would be the scheme the energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, very sensibly floated, after he cleverly and carefully set up the Direct Action review with sufficient breadth to be able to consider it – before he ran a mile when Cory Bernardi, Tony Abbott and Craig Kelly started stamping their feet and flaring their nostrils like a triumvirate of bulls in a paddock. For readers who want more fine print, I’ll quote Jacobs: “The lowest electricity residential bills occur when the existing set of technology-specific policies are extended to all low-emission options and where trading within the generation sector is allowed. “This is mainly because of the depressing effect on wholesale prices of bringing in and subsidising the dispatch cost of low-emission generation, with the depressing effect of wholesale prices outweighing the scheme liabilities.” What this means in English is if you set up a technology-neutral emissions trading scheme in the electricity industry, and allow trading to happen, there’s an implicit subsidy for low-emission power generation, and that delivers lower prices for consumers than some of the alternatives. You might be interested to know that the emissions intensity scheme (now scorned by the Turnbull government as being a source of upward pressure on household energy bills) would deliver an average saving of $216 a year on household electricity bills compared with business as usual. Let me say that again lest your eyes have glazed over. A saving. Lower power bills. Now what is the “business as usual” example in the Jacob scenario? That’s the existing policy mix. That would be the Direct Action policy framework, with tighter baselines to drive the reductions required to meet Australia’s Paris commitments of reducing emissions 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2030, plus the existing state-based renewable energy targets, which the government in Canberra claims not to like. The status quo with the tweaks required to hit the Paris target are not the magic formula to lower power prices, they are the opposite. It’s the most expensive option Jacob looked at. So ruling out carbon pricing is not, to quote Turnbull, doing “everything that we can to put downward pressure on energy prices” – it’s a recipe for keeping power prices higher than they would otherwise be. And failing the test he’s set for himself is not the only problem Turnbull faces. Lacking the bottle to have a serious conversation about a rational, long-term energy policy framework to govern the electricity industry, and other high emissions players, is a recipe not only for higher power prices, but also for more energy insecurity. More blackouts. A less efficient grid. Now how do I know that? Because the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, has produced a report saying so in no uncertain terms. Finkel has said people can’t invest in new electricity infrastructure in the absence of regulatory certainty, and when investment doesn’t happen, we have a second-rate grid. So, to recap this tale of woe, Turnbull’s two key political messages since Frydenberg’s unseemly capitulation to conservatives earlier in the week – that we won’t do carbon pricing lest it inflate power bills, and that governments have a fundamental obligation to keep the lights on – are entirely inconsistent with the actions the government is taking. Let’s cut to the chase. The government, by digging in, is inflicting a 10th-rate policy on households, on the institutional investors who fund our grid, on the energy industry, on businesses who rely on power supply to generate economic activity. Voters are being taken for a monumental ride. The government is acting like an outfit that thinks voters are stupid. Perhaps this is considered smart strategising in our noxious post-truth political times. Perhaps there’s a gamble here that everything will be fine, because voters have had a gutful of experts and their studies, and journalists and their annoying fact-checking and relentless nit-picking. It’s all about the vibe. Well here’s some vibe in return. Treating voters with contempt isn’t smart. It isn’t clever. It isn’t in the national interest. It’s just wrong. For Malcolm Turnbull, who knows better, and has been better, braver, stronger, more committed to evidence and logic and reason, the wrong is magnified. Over 20 years of political reporting I have applied a consistent test to the governments I’ve watched: are they trying to do some good in the world? Are they trying to make Australia a better place? On climate policy, apart from pushing through the ratification of the Paris agreement, which was a laudable gesture, and a difficult one to execute given the government’s poisonous internals, the Turnbull government is not trying to do some good in the world. Right now, it is failing my fundamental test. It’s trying to skate through, and hope no one notices."
"Humanity has been trying to cut down on the estimated 40bn metric tons of carbon dioxide produced each year for decades. Some countries have imposed carbon taxes. Many businesses are looking at using alternatives to fossil fuels to make their products. For example, Coca-Cola invested millions of dollars in creating its PlantBottle, which gets its plastic from plants instead of petroleum, and saved 315,000 metric tons of CO2 between 2009 and 2015.  But both public and private efforts haven’t stopped global temperatures from rising. Now, a growing number of scientists and innovators are arguing that we need to look at new ways to prevent more manmade CO2 from escaping into the atmosphere. Brent Constantz, CEO of building materials company Blue Planet, says he has a good solution: sequestering waste carbon dioxide into manmade limestone. BluePlanet, which was founded in 2006, collects carbon dioxide from California’s largest power plant, at Moss Landing, by bubbling the plant’s waste gases through seawater. The process removes about 90% of the carbon dioxide and combines it with minerals in the water, resulting in the creation of limestone that is composed of about 50% waste carbon dioxide. Given that the Moss Landing plant produces more than 2m tons of carbon dioxide per year, this one plant could mitigate more than six times the carbon saved by Coca-Cola’s PlantBottle. Cutting carbon out of cement production makes sense: cement manufacturing is responsible for an estimated 5% of global CO2. Adding to the problem, countries around the world mine and ship billions of tons of rock every year; in the US alone, 1.32bn metric tons of crushed rock were mined in 2015. If the carbon produced by those processes could be cut, it could result in a significant improvement. This year, Earth hit a major milestone: for the first time in recorded history, September readings of atmospheric carbon dioxide, which are always the lowest of the year, didn’t drop below 400 parts per million. James Hansen, the former head of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies and one of the world’s foremost climatologists, has argued that the reading needs to get below 350 parts per million, if, as he put it, we wish to “preserve a planet similar to that on which civilization developed and to which life on Earth is adapted”. “It was a real crossing the Rubicon moment,” says Jamie Henn, co-founder of global warming activism group 350.org. “Nobody knows where the real tipping points are – the specific points at which global warming will become irreversible or will fundamentally change the Earth’s ability to support human life. But this September’s 400 parts per million moment is a real warning call that we’re crossing it.” There’s no lack of interventions to lower carbon: last year’s Paris climate agreement, ratified by 112 countries, committed the world to keeping global warming to under 2C. Another solution popular among activists and politicians is a tax on carbon production. But some critics argue that this solution is untenable. Even beyond the common argument that it will weaken economic growth, there’s the fact that carbon taxes like the one levied in British Columbia, Canada have had a negligible effect in lowering CO2 emissions. Even carbon tax advocates are beginning to admit that it is only one of many carbon reduction policies that need to be implemented immediately. Blue Planet has already begun branching out. It is currently working with cement manufacturers in Mexico and Canada, steel mills in Mexico, aluminum plants in Canada and coal-fired power plants in Wyoming to collect flue gases and use them to produce limestone. Constantz estimates that initially, each plant will produce between 50,000 and 100,000 tons of aggregate per year. It’s not the only company working on finding ways to use waste CO2. Companies such as AirCarbon and Novomer use waste carbon to make plastic and textiles. Mineral Carbonation, an Australian company, is working on producing limestone from waste carbon, and Solidia, a US company, is also sequestering carbon in building materials. Changes in government policy could make a huge difference when it comes to increasing the effectiveness of the carbon sequestration technologies being developed by Blue Planet, Mineral Carbonation and others. Constantz cites California’s waste tire rubber initiative as an example of how policy can supercharge change. California requires that contractors add ground up waste tires to the asphalt mix on every road project. “It’s been 100% effective: there are no tires in California. We’re importing tires,” Constantz says. In that vein Blue Planet is working with the state – as well as Ottawa, in Canada – to pass legislation that would require highway contractors to use carbon recycled rock in their projects. It helps that highway construction is already one of the biggest markets for cement and rock. Construction of a two-lane highway uses about 25,000 tons of crushed stone per mile, and almost 66% of that stone is limestone. “California uses 400m tons of rock every year,” says Constantz, noting that much of this material is paid for by the federal gasoline tax, which helps cover road upkeep. “We get $11bn dollars per year to buy rock and we import it from Canada and Mexico.” If Blue Planet and its competitors can make artificial limestone at a competitive price, then they have the potential to become a major force for CO2 sequestration and reduction. And this is a place where carbon taxes can help. Blue Planet receives a “royalty” of $10 for every ton of waste CO2 it collects in California, and Constantz estimates that, when Canada enacts its expected $30 carbon royalty fee and California raises its fee to $50 per ton, the economics of his limestone production will become even more attractive. With a combination of price supports and market supports, countries have the potential to significantly advance carbon reduction. Discussing the use of manmade limestone, Constantz is even more effusive: “That one move could solve climate change in the world,” he says.                     "
"After five years of false starts and delays, 2017 will see exploratory fracking for shale gas begin in earnest in England. The first wells will likely be drilled in Lancashire and Yorkshire by the summer, and Cuadrilla, Third Energy and other companies will hope to confirm commercially viable quantities of the gas by the end of the year. With only 17% of people in Britain in favour of fracking, local and national protests are certain. Brexit negotiations will affect farming subsidies and possibly all European nature protection laws, including those for birds and habitats, air and water pollution, GM foods and animal welfare. If ministers attempt to roll back or trade off decades of environmental regulation, as some have threatened, they are likely to meet the most intense opposition.   Air pollution, now known to kill nearly 40-50,000 people a year in Britain, will be high on the political agenda in the spring with the government under court orders to publish a new plan to meet EU legal limits. The draft, to be published in April, is almost certain to propose more fully funded clean-air zones in major cities, tighter restrictions on some vehicles and fuels, and further measures to encourage walking and cycling.  London will also come under pressure to join Paris, Madrid, Athens, and Mexico City in pledging to ban diesel vehicles in the city centre within a few years. The movement of world cities signing up to be fossil-free within 30 years is expected to grow too.  The global climate debate will be dominated by whether the president-elect Donald Trump withdraws the US from the Paris global agreement to reduce emissions.  He has appointed climate sceptics to head all the key agencies responsible for either monitoring or dealing with climate change and is known to want to increase oil, gas and coal production. If he pulls the US out of the Paris deal, it would gift China climate leadership, set back efforts to brake emissions and do untold diplomatic damage with hundreds of countries who followed Obama’s leadership in 2015. Insiders expect him to ignore the voluntary commitments the US has made and to increase fossil fuel emissions. Many US climate scientists expect to lose research grants in what some expect to become a witch-hunt.  2016 saw the tail end of El Niño, a naturally occurring warming of the Pacific, bring droughts, searing temperatures and food shortages to much of Africa, Latin America and south-east Asia. In 2017, we can expect a weak La Niña, a natural cooling of Pacific Ocean waters. This is likely to bring above average rainfall and cooler temperatures across much of the globe.    Wildlife losses are expected to continue through 2017, despite more and more animals having been put on the IUCN’s red list of threatened species and action to tackle the illegal trade. Candidates for effective extinction in 2017 include the Bornean orangutan, the South China tiger, the giant otter, the Amur leopard, the black-footed ferret and Darwin’s fox. The Eurasian lynx could be reintroduced in small numbers to the Kielder forest in Northumberland, and to remote areas of southern Scotland. The last time this wild cat was seen in what is now the UK was in about AD700. Other provisional sites have been selected including Cumbria, Aberdeenshire, the Kintyre pensinsula and Thetford forest in Norfolk.  Marine protection will be raised up the political agenda with the first UN oceans conference in June. This will focus on the increasing quantities of plastics polluting the oceans, overfishing, the effects of climate change, and the need for more marine national parks."

"Malcolm Turnbull has said he will not impose a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme. The prime minister said he would not do anything that increased electricity costs for consumers, especially when households were struggling to pay their bills.  His comments came a day after Australia’s electricity and gas transmission industry called on the government to implement a form of carbon trading in the national electricity market by 2022. The report, which was backed by Csiro, said adopting an emissions intensity scheme was the least costly way of reducing emissions and could actually save customers $200 a year by 2030. But the government is reeling from an embarrassing policy backdown by the environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, who said on Monday that the looming review of the government’s Direct Action climate policy would consider the desirability of an emissions intensity trading scheme. He has now disavowed the comment – after Coalition backbenchers warned the government should expect hostility if it attempted to adopt carbon trading. On Wednesday morning Frydenberg told reporters: “I have a position which is very clear, that we will not be adopting an emissions intensity scheme. We won’t adopt an ETS. We won’t adopt a carbon tax. Whatever way you like to call it.  “What I am focused on is getting this review to look at how we meet our 2030 targets and we have a range of mechanisms in place.” His media conference came less than 20 minutes after Turnbull said the minister had to explain himself. “I have just spoken to the prime minister and I saw that press conference,” Frydenberg said. “It was very clear what the government’s position is, and was, namely, that we wouldn’t be putting in place a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme.” Tony Wood, the director of the Grattan Institute’s energy program, told ABC radio that Frydenberg’s backdown illustrated how the government had painted itself into a corner with its policy on climate change. There was no way the government could reach its emissions reduction target, set in place by Tony Abbott and pursued by Turnbull, without putting some kind of price on carbon, he said. An emissions intensity scheme, or a trading scheme of some kind, would help to reduce emissions cheaply.  “An emissions intensity scheme is not a tax,” Wood said. “The basic idea is that you will reduce emissions, and in the case of an emissions intensity scheme, if people don’t produce emissions above their baseline, which is the way the scheme’s designed, they don’t have to pay for it.  “So there’s no revenue there to be secured by the government if people don’t do what they have to do. So it’s not a revenue-raising scheme like a tax is. “It’s somewhat ironic that the outcome [of this policy backdown] could be that we end up with a third- or fourth-best policy, and we end up with exactly the opposite of what those who are opposing these schemes would like to achieve – which is we end up with more uncertainty and even higher prices. “I think what’s happened now is 2017 just became a lot harder for minister Frydenberg.”"
"Both the Arctic and Antarctic experienced record lows in sea ice extent in November, with scientists astonished to see Arctic ice actually retreating at a time when the region enters the cold darkness of winter.  Warm temperatures and winds drove record declines in sea ice at both polar regions in November compared to the 38-year satellite record of ice extent for the month. Arctic sea ice extent averaged 9.08m sq km (3.51m sq miles) for November, which is 1.95m sq km (or 753,000 sq miles) below the long-term average from 1981 to 2010 for the month. Scientists at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) said that Arctic sea ice extent dipped for a short time in mid-November, an “almost unprecedented” event. Sea ice shrank by around 50,000 sq km (19,300 sq miles) in this period, mainly in the Barents Sea.  This decline, which also occurred to a smaller degree in November 2013, removed an area of ice larger than Denmark from the Arctic at a time when sea ice is usually growing.  “It looks like a triple whammy – a warm ocean, a warm atmosphere, and a wind pattern all working against the ice in the Arctic,” said NSIDC director Mark Serreze. In Antarctica, the average extent of sea ice in November was 14.54m sq km (5.61m sq miles), which is 1.81m sq km (699,000 sq miles) below the 1981 to 2010 average. This more than doubles the previous record low for the month of November. Ted Scambos, the lead scientist at NSIDC, said: “Antarctic sea ice really went down the rabbit hole this time.” His colleague Walt Meier, who also works at Nasa, added: “The Arctic has typically been where the most interest lies, but this month, the Antarctic has flipped the script and it is southern sea ice that is surprising us.” The Arctic’s record low, beating a mark set in 2012, was driven by unusually high temperatures over the Arctic Ocean, persistent winds that pushed ice north and a warm ocean. Areas of the Arctic have reached more than 20C (36F) warmer than usual, with an area of Russian Arctic forecast to be 33C (59F) warmer than normal on Thursday. 2016 is on track to be the warmest year on record globally.  Arctic sea ice usually grows over winter until it hits its maximum annual extent in March. However, this year has been notable for the lack of ice. “Typically sea ice begins to form in the fjords at the beginning of November, but this year there was no ice to be found,” said NSIDC scientist Julienne Stroeve, who assessed ice cover in Svalbard during November.  In the Antarctic air temperatures were 2-4C (3.6-7.2F) warmer than normal in November, with strong westerly winds helping disperse the sea ice pack. Several large bodies of open water have opened up within the sea ice formations around the Amundsen Sea and Ross Sea coasts. The slump in November sea ice follows a persistent trend in the Arctic, where warming temperatures are causing problems for indigenous communities and wildlife including polar bears and walruses. This summer saw the second smallest ice extent on record, with the Arctic expected to be ice-free during summer within decades. The loss of reflective sea ice amplifies the warming process by exposing the dark sea, which soaks up more heat which in turn helps melt more ice. The extra heat is also winnowing away the world’s glaciers, leading to sea level rise that places many of the world’s major cities at risk of flooding."
"As Donald Trump assembles his cabinet, one consistent theme has emerged: many of his nominees have expressed doubt about the science of human-caused climate change. “We’re seeing an unprecedented amount of influence from the fossil fuel industry in Trump’s cabinet,” Jeremy Symons, who works on climate politics for the Environmental Defense Fund, said. “What’s missing from this cabinet is the balance one would expect to bring the other side to the equation and it really leaves us wondering: who is looking out for us? Clearly the oil companies are well attended, but who’s looking out for us?”  Here is where Trump’s cabinet nominees stand on climate change. The Oklahoma attorney general has been a longtime adversary of the EPA and a close friend to the fossil fuels industry. He helped lead a lawsuit from 28 states against the agency’s clean power plan, an Obama administration initiative to cut carbon pollution from coal power plants. He has also accepted more than $250,000 in donations from the oil and gas industry over the course of four campaigns for attorney general, lieutenant governor and state senator. In a joint op-ed in the National Review, Pruitt wrote that the debate on climate change is “far from settled”, adding: “Scientists continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global warming and its connection to the actions of mankind.” In fact, the overwhelming majority of scientists agree climate change is happening and caused by humans.  Zinke is a Montana congressman, former Navy Seal commander and Iraq war veteran who has consistently voted in favor of oil and gas drilling projects on federal lands. As interior secretary he will have oversight over the use of federal lands and controversial pipeline and drilling projects. The congressman supports the Keystone XL pipeline and and supported measures to remove protections of endangered species, while opposing legislation to regulate fracking. The League of Conservation Voters gave him a lifetime voting scorecard of 3%. While previously acknowledging the science behind climate change, Zinke said in 2014 that it “is not proven”. The former Texas governor will be nominated to take over the agency he famously wanted to abolish but could not name during his presidential bid in 2012. In 2011, Perry said that global warming was an unproven scientific theory.  The former chairman and CEO of ExxonMobil was nominated to be the country’s top diplomat. Much has been made of his ties to Russia and how that may affect his role, while Tillerson’s position on climate change has been less of a focus. On the surface, Tillerson acknowledges the science of human-caused climate change and supported a carbon tax in 2009; ExxonMobil issued a statement of support for the Paris agreement while he was at the helm. However, Exxon is currently under investigation by New York’s attorney general for misleading investors on the risks of climate change. The company has also consistently lobbied against climate change proposals. Exxon has also pushed to open the Arctic up for drilling. Mattis would be taking over a defense department that has identified climate change as a national security “threat multiplier”. He has made few public statements on climate change, but according to a 2010 report on the military’s energy policy the former Marine general asked to “unleash us from the tether of fuel” during the drive into Baghdad. His longtime colleague, retired Marine Corps Brig Gen Stephen Cheney, told Climate Change News that Mattis “gets climate change”. Carson has said that he is not convinced by the science behind human-caused climate change. “I know there are a lot of people who say ‘overwhelming science’, but then when you ask them to show the overwhelming science they never can show it,” Carson told the San Francisco Chronicle. In multiple exchanges, he acknowledged that the climate was changing before asserting that the climate has always changed, but “when things stop changing, then we’re dead”. He told a crowd at a campaign event in New Hampshire last year that he believes in taking care of the environment but does not think the issue should be politicized. Pompeo is among the most the outspoken critics of climate change legislation. He has expressed skepticism over the science that climate change is caused by humans, saying in 2013: “Look, I think the science needs to continue to develop. There are scientists who think lots of different things about climate change. There’s some who think we’re warming, there’s some who think we’re cooling, there’s some who think that the last 16 years have shown a pretty stable climate environment.” He derided Barack Obama last year for describing climate change as a national security threat. Pompeo referred to the Paris agreement as a “radical climate change deal”.  The former general does not view climate change as a priority. He slammed President Obama on Fox News for discussing climate change after a terrorist attack. Speaking on Fox News in June, he said: “Here we have the president of the United States up in Canada talking about climate change. I mean, God, we just had the largest attack, as you just said, on our own soil in Orlando. Why are we talking about that? Who is talking about that? You know, I mean, Fort Hood, Chattanooga, Boston. People forget about 9/11.” Throughout his time in the US Senate, Sessions has consistently voted against climate action, with the League of Conservation Voters giving him a scorecard of 7%. He said on the Senate floor in 2003: “I believe there are legitimate disputes about the validity and extent of global warming … Carbon dioxide does not hurt you. We have to have it in the atmosphere. It is what plants breathe. In fact, the more carbon dioxide that exists, the faster plants grow.” Sessions reportedly said last year that the fight against climate change hurts poor people. In 2015, he reiterated his claim that increased carbon dioxide was not bad for you: “Carbon pollution is CO2, and that’s really not a pollutant; that’s a plant food, and it doesn’t harm anybody except that it might include temperature increases.” Kelly has made few public statements on climate change but told the Senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs: “As with the campaign today to raise awareness of climate change – whether one agrees or disagrees with the cause-and-effect claims – all are at least fully aware of the issue. Even those who reject the science have reduced their energy consumption and know it is good for the environment.” Tom Price is a noted climate change skeptic. In a statement supporting a bill to fight EPA regulations on carbon dioxide, Price said: “This decision goes against all common sense, especially considering the many recent revelations of errors and obfuscation in the allegedly ‘settled science’ of global warming.” He has consistently voted against incentivizing renewable energy sources with tax credits and in favor of increased oil exploration. He signed a pledge created by Americans for Prosperity, a conservative thinktank funded by the Koch brothers, to oppose climate legislation. The commerce department encompasses the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which has a key role in monitoring the effects of climate change. Ross’s views on the issue are not clear. In his career of buying distressed companies, he has invested hundreds of millions into oil and gas businesses. Trump’s financier during this campaign and a former Goldman Sachs executive, Mnuchin has made little public comment on climate change. Having never held public office, his views on the issue have not been interrogated. DeVos is the chairman of the Windquest Group, an investment company she founded with her husband in 1989 that invests in clean energy technology. She may have the most measured views on climate change in the administration. Chao was previously a fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative thinktank that opposes policies to fight climate change. “Chao’s connection to institutions that manufacture climate denial, like the Heritage Foundation, requires the public demand she prioritize both public health and the impacts of climate change when managing our transportation infrastructure,” said Greenpeace USA spokeswoman Cassady Craighill. She wrote a blogpost in 2009 for the foundation in which she derided a proposed cap-and-trade system, a market-based approach to reducing pollution by providing incentives to reduce emissions. "
"It wasn’t supposed to play out this way. At 5.05pm in Augusta, Georgia, on Sunday 10 April, there was no indication that it would. No Englishman had won the Masters, arguably golf’s most coveted individual event, since 1996. The American Jordan Spieth, who held a five-stroke lead, was in the midst of an extraordinary run, spanning 12 months. Step forward Danny Willett, who seized an opportunity in the most emphatic way. Then 28, Willett had enjoyed a decent professional career without scaling great heights. The Yorkshireman had played in the Masters only once before, when he tied in 38th place out of 97. But as Spieth stumbled, it was Willett who breezed to the summit of the leaderboard, with a closing round of 67 that took the title by the relatively comfortable margin of three shots. Just 12 days earlier, Willett’s wife had given birth to the couple’s first child, Zach. “I always said I wouldn’t come here if Zach wasn’t born by now,” Willett said. “Fortunately, he listened to my prayers and came early. It’s just been the most ridiculously awesome 12 days.” Ewan Murray New rule: from 2017 onwards, no referendums. Because it always ends in misery. Brexit proved that, but the ballad of Boaty McBoatface proved it harder. The Natural Environment Research Council was about to unveil a new £200m polar research vessel, and asked the public to name it. The public – or at least the LOLsy, internet-dwelling slice of the population that Instagrams coffeeshop blackboards – decided to name it Boaty McBoatface. In the end, Boaty McBoatface gained 124,000 votes, four times as many as its nearest rival, and the vessel’s fate looked set. But then it didn’t, because science minister Jo Johnson decided the whole thing was silly. He named it the RSS Sir David Attenborough, hoping that aligning the craft with our greatest national treasure would calm everyone down. When that didn’t work, he promised to name one of the ship’s remotely controlled submersibles Boaty McBoatface instead, but it was too little too late. Still, this wasn’t the end. Boaty McBoatface is a folk hero now. He is Robin Hood. He is Wat Tyler. Whenever there’s an injustice in the world, we will point our ears towards the wind and hear the words “Boaty McBoatface”. Stuart Heritage When the pope visited Lesbos in April, he returned with three families. At first they lived in a refuge run by the Sant’Egidio charity; now the three families have paperwork, a titolo di viaggio allowing free travel in Europe, and homes of their own. “It’s what I dreamed of,” says Nour Essa, 31, who lives with her husband Hasan and son Riad in a two-room flat in Rome’s city centre. Bringing up a two-year-old in shared quarters had been a strain, and made Nour feel she couldn’t parent as she chose. Today, Riad attends nursery and is starting to talk. “We speak only Arabic to him,” Nour says. “He replies to us only in Italian.” A new life comes more easily to children. Are they happier now? “We are better, but we feel homeless,” Nour says. “Your studies, all your efforts, are thrown away because you must initiate a new life. You are like a child.” She studied microbiology for five years in Damascus and two years postgraduate in France; in Italy she must start again from the third year of an undergraduate degree. Hasan, a garden designer, must study architecture before he can practise in Italy; he attends university in Rome. The second family, Suhila Ayiad and Ramy Alshakarji, live alongside a community of nuns. Suhila is learning Italian; their 16-year-old son thrives and wants to study dentistry, while their 18-year-old is “living the teenage years he couldn’t live in Syria”, a Sant’Egidio spokesperson says diplomatically. Little Quds, Ramy and Suhila’s youngest, is at school. The third family, Osama Qawqaji and Wafa Eid, live a long way south of the charity’s language school. If they integrate, it will be through their children, the spokesperson says. “Probably they are planning to go back to Syria when they can.” Paula Cocozza To the terrible date of 15 April 1989, when 96 people died and hundreds more were injured and traumatised at an FA Cup semi-final, the bereaved Hillsborough families finally succeeded in adding 26 April 2016 as a historic landmark: the day the truth about the disaster was finally, legally established. Fully 27 years from the day their loved ones died, they crowded into the converted courtroom on a Warrington business park, all that suffering compressed into an awful wait for a jury to answer yes, or no, to 14 questions. Questions six and seven were the heart of the matter, deciders in the families’ and survivors’ implacable struggle against the lies of South Yorkshire police, whose officers had organised a campaign to blame the victims, even as people were dying at the football ground. In 1991, South Yorkshire police made that case relentlessly at the first inquest, claiming the people who had paid to attend the event in an expectation of safety had drunk too much and somehow been recklessly too eager to watch the match. The families had to pay for their own legal representation; they could collectively afford £142,000 for a single barrister, pitted against the battery of publicly funded police lawyers, and the jury verdict was accidental death. This time, Theresa May’s Home Office provided funding for two rows of forensic and persistently combative lawyers to oppose the same allegations made again by the police. This adversarial rerun of the old, already discredited police stories stretched the new inquests to two years, the longest case ever heard by a jury in British history. It had been agony for the families, forced to revisit every detail of the day their lives were devastated. Finally, verdict day arrived. The forewoman of the jury answered questions one to five as expected, agreeing that there were appalling safety deficiencies in Sheffield Wednesday’s squalid Leppings Lane away end. Then came question six: were the 96 people unlawfully killed due to criminal gross negligence by the police officer in charge, Ch Supt David Duckenfield? “Yes,” the forewoman agreed, calmly, and the families’ years of struggle came to be vindicated. Next, question seven, key to whether this day would deliver justice or be another terrible chapter: did the behaviour of Liverpool supporters contribute to the dangerous situation? “No,” the forewoman said, with a kind note in her voice. The reaction was a gleeful outpouring of relief. People cheered, wept, hugged each other. For so many bleak years, this had been unthinkable, and now it really had come to pass: the lies had been overhauled by the truth.Outside, blinking, disbelieving, with film crews and photographers in front of them, a group of family members instinctively started to sing the Liverpool club anthem, You’ll Never Walk Alone. Ian Burke was 17 when his father, Henry, a builder, was among the 96 who died so needlessly, leaving bereft another son, daughter and a grief-stricken wife. Ian had taken time off work to sit through almost every day of the inquests; quiet, racked with stress. Just days before the verdicts, aged only 44, he had a heart attack.He is still suffering heart-related health problems, yet look at the film or photographs of the group outside the court on 26 April 2016, and there he is in the middle, with his suit and tie on, arm aloft, singing the beloved song, and smiling. David Conn You wouldn’t have dared suggest it as a Hollywood script: too unlikely. The unfashionable football, a toe-poke from relegation the previous season, 5,000-1 outsiders to win it this time round, goes on to beat the moneyed glory boys to the Premier League title. Impossible. You’d have got better odds on Piers Morgan being named Arsenal manager (2,500-1, since you asked). Yet it did happen. Leicester City’s the name, romance is the game. And not just any old romance. Romance in the most cynical, spendthrift league in the world, where Manchester City regularly spend £40m on defenders who can’t defend, Manchester United sell Paul Pogba for nothing (and later resign him for £89m without a blink), and Chelsea sack two managers a week for fun. And here was little Leicester City, a raggle-taggle army of rejects, has-beens and unknowns, managed by an elderly Italian nicknamed the Tinkerman because he was so indecisive, winning the league title. They didn’t even inch their way to the premiership, they blew their rivals away, winning 23 games, losing only three and finishing 10 points clear of their closest rivals, Arsenal. Jamie Vardy, who had been playing non-league football for Fleetwood Town three years earlier, scored 24 goals and won a place in the England team; little known Riyad Mahrez won player of the year; thirtysomething has-been Robert Huth (long since rejected by Chelsea) forged a mighty partnership with thirtysomething never-been Wes Morgan (who had spent 10 years at Nottingham Forest and ran tattoo parlours on the side). To say Leicester were penniless is untrue; all Premier League teams have money. But to put it in context, their squad cost £52.8m, just over one 10th of Manchester City’s. After Christmas 2015, the impossible became ever more probable. By March, it was a likelihood, by April an inevitability, and on 2 May they were crowned champions. The city was painted blue: foreign film crews embedded themselves in the East Midlands and taught themselves how to pronounce Leicester; literary bigwigs such as Julian Barnes waxed poetic about their favourite club; and Gary Lineker promised to present Match Of The Day in his smalls (he did). Order has been restored since those heady days. As I write, Leicester (with virtually the same team) are 14th in the league, four points off the relegation zone, with three wins and seven defeats. But it was wonderful while it lasted. Simon Hattenstone  “This is our Obama moment,” said Aisha from Tooting the day after the capital elected Sadiq Khan as mayor. For many other Londoners, it was the triumph of hope over fear, following an ugly campaign waged by Khan’s chief rival, Zac Goldsmith. In a year characterised by the electoral gains of people and parties associated with the right, racism, xenophobia and nationalism, Khan’s decisive victory in May was a sweet, bright moment for those on the flipside of an increasingly binary political landscape. The contest was principally between Khan, the Muslim son of a bus driver and seamstress who grew up on a council estate with seven siblings, and Goldsmith, the son of a billionaire businessman and Eton alumnus. On the advice of Conservative strategists, Goldsmith sought to portray Khan as a friend of Islamic extremists. The Tory candidate said Khan had “given platforms and oxygen and cover and excuses” to extremists. “London would be safer if I’m mayor,” he told voters. Khan, meanwhile, celebrated the capital’s diversity. “I am a Londoner, I am European, I am British, I am English, I am of Islamic faith, of Asian origin, of Pakistani heritage, a dad, a husband,” he told voters, adding: “We do not just tolerate each other in London; we respect each other.” When the votes were counted, Khan had the support of 57% of Londoners, compared with 43% who voted for Goldsmith. With around 1.3m votes, Khan also had the biggest personal mandate of any politician in UK history. Harriet Sherwood  At 10pm on a Sunday in May, Jacob Husley was setting up at London nightclub Fabric for his weekly house and techno night WetYourSelf! when he passed an elderly couple on the stairs: “They were walking down slowly and she was on crutches. I asked, ‘Are you OK?’ but they just smiled and kept going.” Husley, 36, who has DJed at Fabric for eight years, checked with security, who said the couple had turned up with tickets. Husley went back in to find them at the bar. They were Polish and didn’t speak English. “I wanted to offer them a drink,” he says. “They had tequila shots and I thought, ‘This couple are wicked!’ But I still had a feeling there was a mistake.” As the club filled up, Husley took them to the VIP lounge and when a Polish friend arrived, he had him translate. “They said they’d always dreamed of going to one of the big, great nightclubs in London.” They’d bought tickets online in Poland and were staying with their niece in London. Husley offered them another drink and when they asked for tea, fetched some from a cafe down the street. Other guests embraced the first-time visitors. “They didn’t stay in the VIP area. He kept venturing out to the dancefloor and everyone was giving him lots of attention. She sat by the bar and couldn’t dance, but people were saying hello. They definitely enjoyed themselves.” At 5am, they took Husley up on his offer of a taxi home. The next day, Husley put a photo of the couple on Facebook. It went viral. “I think it inspired people,” he says. “They posted to their friends, ‘This is us when we’re old.’” The story got international coverage, but Husley didn’t know the couple’s names and had no way of contacting them. Then, a few weeks later, he received a letter from pensioners Wladyslaw Nykiel, 82, and Stanislawa Zapasnik, 79. Nykiel wrote: “We had a wonderful time dancing with young Londoners who welcomed us very warmly. There are no words to describe the atmosphere and great fun [of Fabric].” When Islington council closed Fabric in September, Husley got back in touch. Nykiel sent a picture of him and Zapasnik holding a #savefabric placard. Fabric will now reopen on 6 January – and Husley has made sure the couple have tickets. Candice Pires Two years ago, most of England was asleep, something that hit me every time I travelled there from Scotland. In the summer of 2014, people north of the border were in the midst of their referendum, and life was full of talk about what was at stake. I’d immerse myself in the hurly-burly, then fly home to a country that felt sedated, where politicians still spoke in lukewarm platitudes. Now look. In the wake of the EU referendum, politics in England and Wales is crackling with life. I travel around the country for the Guardian, and getting people to talk used to be like pulling teeth. Now, I mention the EU, Theresa May or Trump and off the conversation goes: people are awake. This is not all on the pro-Brexit side, by any means. Remainers are starting to find their voices, too. New cross-party “progressive” groups have sprung up in Brighton, London and East Anglia, set on opposing the vision shared by the Tories and Ukip. In November, the Green party had the sense to stand down in the Richmond Park byelection, with the aim of kicking out the pro-Brexit Tory “independent” Zac Goldsmith, thereby playing its part in his defeat. A new group, More United, is raising money for candidates from “the progressive centre”, pledged to a pro-European, egalitarian future. Meanwhile, the pressure group Compass, which began inside the Labour party, then reached beyond it, is to start making the case against old-fashioned party divides and in favour of what it calls progressive alliances. As well as the Greens’ co-leader Caroline Lucas, a handful of the most forward-thinking Labour MPs are giving it quiet support. If the next few years are going to see a big thrashing out of what England is, the process will not be the preserve of the right. Old politics (the endless talk of “hard-working families”, “going forward” and the rest) is pretty much finished. That’s a good thing. And if what has replaced it is proving visceral and primary-coloured, there are voices on the left who can meet that challenge. Of course it will be difficult; the word “struggle” is part of the progressive vocabulary for a reason. But isn’t it better to be awake than complacently snoozing? John Harris On 15 January, Peake performed the first British spacewalk outside the International Space Station, an event that took a dramatic turn when his colleague Tim Kopra’s helmet began to fill with water. Peake had to take the lead and bring the other astronaut back to safety from the outer panels of the space station. He did this with the calmness they seem to breed in the bones of astronauts; they appear to be chosen these days not just for their ability to perform in ludicrously demanding environments, but to smile and enthusiastically explain things to awestruck children while doing it. For six months, until he came back down to Earth in June, Peake did just that, his heavily scheduled days split between experiments and outreach. He sent videos to schools; ran a London Marathon in orbit; he got people in Britain excited. And that, in the end, was the point. Peake was not the first British astronaut in space; that honour belongs to Helen Sharman, who spent a week on the Mir space station in 1991, and there have been five Britons on space shuttle missions (though they had to take US citizenship). But Peake was the first astronaut whose trip was directly funded by the British government, through the European Space Agency. Where our financial commitment to a pan-European body lies now, post-Brexit, remains to be seen. But for a few months there was a man from Chichester in space, and you just ask a nearby eight-year-old how cool that is. Dara Ó Briain As the world contemplates the calamitous prospect of Donald Trump unravelling the landmark Paris climate agreement, we should take comfort in the fact that another international accord has begun remedying one of our biggest environmental messes. Scientists reported this year that the ozone hole above Antarctica, ripped open by our use of a group of chemical compounds, has started healing – good news that is the fruit of the 1987 Montreal Protocol. This was when countries agreed the deal to first freeze and later phase out chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), mostly in aerosols and refrigeration. Because the ozone layer protects us from ultraviolet light, the UN estimates the CFC phase-out has avoided 2m annual cases of skin cancer. The hole has not vanished: it still opens from September to November, only more slowly. Experts believe there is still a way to go. But “by 2060 you’ll have almost no years with an ozone hole”, said Susan Solomon, who led the study published in Science magazine. “Maybe one in every 15 years, but it won’t be every year – bang, bang, bang – like it has been since the mid-80s.” For Solomon, the healing of the hole is proof that the world can come together to tackle big environmental problems. “We made a mistake, and countries were willing to put their shoulders to the wheel and figure out how to fix it, and we did.” The Montreal Protocol did have unintended consequences: the hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) that largely replaced CFCs contribute to climate change, too. In October, 170 countries met in Uganda and reached a deal to fix that. Under the Kigali amendment to the Montreal Protocol, HFCs will also ultimately be phased out, which some estimates say could avoid up to 0.5C of global warming. US secretary of state John Kerry hailed the deal as “a monumental step forward”. Adam Vaughan • Where did it all go right?

"World leaders should redouble efforts to cut soot emissions because it is the cheapest and fastest way to combat climate change, climate scientists and advocates have told the Guardian. Deposits of soot – unburned carbon particles – have stained parts of the Arctic black, changing the ice from a reflector of sunlight to an absorber of heat, and accelerating the melting of ice and snow, which itself is starting to alter global weather patterns.  Some scientists believe reducing the concentration of soot particles and other so-called “short-lived climate pollutants” entering the atmosphere may be easier in the short term than bringing down carbon dioxide emissions.  Such a “quick win” would be important to provide breathing space while world populations reduce their use of fossil fuels, scientists say. Paul Bledsoe, a former White House adviser who has worked on climate science issues for a decade, said: “Limiting short-lived climate pollutants is the cheapest, fastest way to prevent ice melt globally, particularly in the Arctic.” Durwood Zaelke, president of the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development, said: “You can’t solve a fast-moving problem like Arctic warming without fast-moving solutions. Cutting the short lived-climate pollutants is the fastest solution we’ve got. “Cutting these super climate pollutants can cut Arctic warming by two-thirds in the near term.” The vast expanse of ice and snow covering the Arctic may look startlingly white from a distance, but on closer examination the glaciers and snow cover are patched by dark streaks of inky black and dusty grey and brown. Some are small and self-contained; others are miles long. All are the mark of man. Hailong Wang, an atmospheric scientist at the US Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, said that both observational and modelling evidence showed that soot was warming the Arctic.  “The warming effect could be through the direct heating to the air, snow and sea ice by absorbing sunlight, and then accelerating the melting of snow and sea ice,” Wang said. “When the melting starts, there are positive feedback processes that can lead to even faster melting.” Work by Piers Forster, a professor of physical climate change at the University of Leeds, and Maria Sands, a researcher at Norway’s Cicero institute, and their colleagues, has established that reducing soot emissions could lower Arctic temperatures by 0.2C within a few decades – a valuable contribution, considering that the commitment made in the Paris agreement was to hold temperature rises to no more than 1.5C or 2C.  The Arctic bears what could be considered more than its fair share of the world’s pollution. Industry and tourism in the region are tiny, though mining and oil companies continue to eye-up potential sites as the permafrost retreats. The dirt that scars the Arctic landscape is not local: rather, ocean and air currents carry substances – soot, heavy metals, plastic particles, and more – fromacross the globe to deposit them in this pristine environment. Chemical pollution has even been found to cause brain damage in polar bears. Soot in the atmosphere has been calculated to be capable of causing warming of about 0.5C in the Arctic, from heating of the atmosphere and melting of snow. This amounts to about a quarter of the observed warming since pre-industrial times.  However, the picture is more complicated than these raw figures might suggest. Unburned carbon particles and gases, such as sulphur dioxide, which often accompany soot production, can have an aerosol cooling effect, because in the atmosphere they can deflect heat from the sun back into space. This process, sometimes called global dimming, makes it hard to estimate the final effects of the pollution. While mercury, PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyl) and other pollutants persist for decades, soot is a less permanent problem. “Unlike greenhouse gases, soot particles are relatively short-lived in the atmosphere. The average lifetime is around a week or two,” says Wang. “New snowfall [can also] cover them [the soot particles] pretty quickly.” And this, according to Zaelke, is what makes soot so important. “Speed is the key metric here, that we haven’t paid enough attention to [in discussions over climate change],” he said. “We have been looking at slow-moving solutions [such as reducing greenhouse gases] and we need to catch up. We need to do something about near-term warming if we are going to stabilise the climate.” Greenhouse gases are produced by a wide range of human industries: generating electricity, driving, flying, raising cattle, making cement, agricultural fertilisers, and many more. Soot comes from a smaller subset of these activities. Coal-fired power stations are a leading source, as are dirty vehicle engines, and industrial chimneys, but even in developing countries where people have little access to electricity and powered transport, soot is produced by indoor fires used for cooking and heating. Global warming is not the only impact. Soot is behind human health problems from Beijing to Burundi, as the particles are breathed into lungs where they remain, causing and exacerbating respiratory diseases. Smoky fuels kill more than 4 million people a year, according to the World Health Organisation – a disproportionate number of them women and children, from dirty cooking fires. Dealing with soot, therefore, is not only a win for the climate, but for people’s health. Forster and Sand have identified three measures as potentially the most effective: reducing the domestic burning of wood in Asia, cutting the flaring of gas in Russia, and reducing emissions from diesel vehicles globally. The technology to do all of these is available. Gas flaring is not only unnecessary but inefficient, as captured waste gases can be used for fuel. Scrubbers can also be fitted to the chimneys of fossil fuel power stations. Car engines can be fitted with filters, as they are in many developed countries, to remove the dirt from exhausts. Cooking fires are individually harder to reach, but in many areas of the world simple solar cookers could be used that would not only reduce deaths from pollution but ease the lives of women and girls for whom the drudgery of finding fuel each day can be physically demanding, and put a brake on education and development. History shows that while these measures can involve some upfront costs, these are quickly repaid in quality of life. Londoners, for example, took pea-soupers as a fact of life before clean air legislation was passed following the deadly smogs of the early 1950s. With the right regulation and political will, soot could be made a historical curiosity across the globe. Forster said: “The measures [to reduce soot] would also help by reducing carbon dioxide emissions. They would also kick in faster – within 10 years of the emissions reduction – whereas CO2 emissions reductions just slow the rate of warming. You need negative [CO2] emissions for a CO2 cooling effect.” Mike Childs, head of policy at Friends of the Earth, said: “With scientists recognising that soot ranks second only behind carbon dioxide in terms of global warming, it’s crucial that this pollution is cut to help avoid the worst impacts of climate change. Tackling soot would be a win-win, because it will bring enormous health benefits by cutting air pollution too. Governments must act now, and act fast.” These actions will only be effective as part of a broader push to tackle carbon emissions. Although dealing with soot could be an important way of heading off one of the threats to the Arctic and the world, it cannot be a substitute for acting on warming gases more widely. “Greenhouse gases are still the major player in causing the overall melting of the Arctic,” said Wang. Stopping soot pollution could give us a vital breathing space, but an effective end to global warming – and Arctic melting – will require much more."
"Desperate times call for desperate measures, and for scientists, these are desperate measures. Tuesday in San Francisco’s Jessie Square, approximately 500 people gathered for a ‘rally to stand up for science.’ Many of the attendees were scientists who had migrated to the rally from the nearby Moscone Center, where some 26,000 Earth scientists are attending the annual American Geophysical Union (AGU) conference this week.  This was an unusual activity for scientists to participate in; after all, they’re often accused of remaining isolated in the ivory towers of academia. Scientists generally prefer to focus on their scientific research, use their findings to inform the public and policymakers, and leave it to us to decide what actions we should take in response. In fact, one of the keynote speakers at the rally, Harvard science historian Naomi Oreskes made that exact point: We don’t want to be here. We want to be doing the work we were trained and educated to do, which is science ... but we are at a moment in history where we have to stand up. As Georgia Tech climate scientist Kim Cobb noted, with the appointments made thus far by the incoming Trump administration, science is under attack and scientists feel compelled to protect their research, and their ability to keep doing it. Cobb also called on more of her scientific colleagues to step outside their comfort zones and engage in activism: The rally followed other recent efforts by scientists to advise the Trump administration and reassure the public. For example, over 800 Earth scientists and energy experts signed a letter urging the President-elect to take six key steps to address climate change: 1) Make America a clean energy leader; 2) Reduce carbon pollution and America’s dependence on fossil fuels; 3) Enhance America’s climate preparedness and resilience; 4) Publicly acknowledge that climate change is a real, human-caused, and urgent threat; 5) Protect scientific integrity in policymaking; and 6) Uphold America’s commitment to the Paris Climate Agreement. Over 11,000 women scientists also signed a pledge committing “to build a more inclusive society and scientific enterprise.” The leaders of 29 scientific societies signed a letter encouraging Trump to appoint a “nationally respected” science advisor with sufficient expertise.  And more than 2,300 scientists, including 22 Nobel Prize recipients, published an open letter with the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) urging the Trump administration and Congress to set a high bar for integrity, transparency, and independence in using science to inform federal policies. UCS plans to act as a watchdog protecting science and scientists during the Trump Administration, as it did during the Bush administration. These scientists have been motivated by concern stemming from President-elect Trump’s decision to fill the key powerful positions in his administration with an oil industry dream team of climate deniers.  Some of those selections include individuals who have harassed and intimidated climate scientists, like David Schnare and Chris Horner, whose tactics forced the creation of the Climate Science Legal Defense Fund (CSLDF) five years ago. The CSLDF began in an effort to assist Michael Mann with the legal attacks documented in his book The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars (Mann also has an excellent new book co-authored with cartoonist Tom Toles, The Madhouse Effect). Over the past five years, CSLDF has provided legal assistance to over 100 scientists, and has helped coordinate counsel for approximately 20 scientists facing litigation. The Legal Defense Fund has had a significant presence at the AGU conference, assuring scientists that their organization can answer basic legal questions, or help with potentially costly legal attacks and litigation. Adding to scientists’ alarm, the Trump Department of Energy transition team submitted a questionnaire that raised serious concerns about the incoming administration’s plans to influence or curtail DOE’s research, potentially engage in a witch-hunt, and perhaps even tamper with or destroy scientific data. After much public and media backlash, the Trump team now denies that the questionnaire was authorized. This retreat was the first victory for science in an impending battle with the incoming administration. Scientists also have any ally in California Governor Jerry Brown, who spoke at the AGU conference and promised: If Trump turns off the satellites, California will launch its own damn satellite. On the issue of climate change, it’s been decades since scientific research first identified the threats and dangers resulting from human-caused global warming. A growing number of climate scientists had already begun to speak out about the need for much more aggressive global efforts to cut carbon pollution if we’re to avoid its worst impacts.  Finally, nearly all of the world’s countries signed last year’s agreement in Paris, creating a framework to limit global warming below the dangerous level of 2°C hotter than pre-industrial temperatures. Less than a year later, the world’s largest cumulative carbon polluter elected a president who promised to do what he can to reverse that landmark Paris agreement.  Trump's 100-day action plan for energy #climate #cop22 ""cancel Paris Climate Agreement"" and stop payments ""to U.N. global warming programs."" pic.twitter.com/p0BvVXzyrf Though he has since claimed he will keep an “open mind” about climate change and the Paris agreement, at every opportunity Trump has hired individuals who deny climate science, work for the oil industry, and/or have spent years harassing and attacking climate scientists. As author Robert Fulghum once wrote: It doesn’t matter what you say you believe - it only matters what you do. In the AGU conference, many scientists have voiced their grave concerns about these events, about the relevance of science in a post-truth world, and about the attacks they seem to be facing from the incoming government. Scientists have expressed emotions ranging from bewilderment and fear, to the defiance exemplified in their rally. In order to protect science, more such defiance will likely be needed, and scientists will also need public support to help protect their critically important research."
"Here we go again. Just like last year’s sorry excuse for a debate on taxation reform, where nation building policy ideas were knocked off the table one by one, we find our federal government again unable to act in the national interest when it comes to energy policy.  Unlike the tax debate, there is at least a broad acknowledgement of a problem. Across the nation we are witnessing coal mines close, power bills increase and a collapse in investment for new energy generation. With that in mind, you would think even the biggest supporters of the coal industry, the Turnbull government, could not accept the status quo. The national energy market is failing and now, when a credible solution is put forward the discussion is shut down by the prime minister. In the absence of a coherent national policy on low carbon energy, state governments including South Australia are being blamed for pursuing ambitious renewable energy targets. What South Australia has done over the last decade is take advantage of its natural advantages to secure investment in cheap clean renewable energy. This leadership has received accolades from clean energy pioneers including Al Gore and Malcolm Turnbull. My state has been described as the “canary in the coal mine” on energy policy – an ironic description when you consider the fact that our state’s last coal-fired power station shut its doors earlier this year. September’s statewide blackout, which was caused by tornados ripping transmission lines out of the ground, was falsely blamed on renewable energy by those in the pockets of the coal lobby. What these anti-renewable opportunists did achieve was to put the issue of a failing national energy market on the agenda. A national emissions intensity trading scheme has now been proposed as a mechanism to stimulate investment in our energy market. It provides the transition plan that is needed towards the lowest cost, most reliable and cleanest energy system. The CSIRO, Australian Energy Market Commission, business groups and the government’s own chief scientist believe this is an idea worthy of consideration at the very least. But before Alan Finkel’s report had even been delivered to Coag, the prime minister dropped the idea like a piping hot double espresso. A national energy market needs a national solution. That is something we can all agree on. But if, like the tax debate, we are left with nothing on the table then the states will be forced consider their options. If this means designing and implementing our own scheme, then this should also be considered. Many Australians were optimistic that Malcolm Turnbull’s leadership would provide us with sensible policy debate and action in the national interest. After this week’s events, any remaining optimism has now evaporated. Jay Weatherill is the premier of South Australia. "
"Jorge Cruz has just finished his overnight shift stacking shelves at Whole Foods in Los Altos, California, and is waiting at the bus stop outside. Like much of Silicon Valley, there’s a regular flow of Tesla, BMW, Nissan and Google electric cars that cruise past from their nearby headquarters, and Cruz rather likes them. “I really wouldn’t mind having an electric car,” he says, though his first choice is probably a Honda or an Acura. Regardless, for now, he rides the bus. “I need to save up for a car,” he explains. As Cruz waits, a newly purchased Tesla zips by, advertising “ZERO EMISSIONS” on its license plate. Electric cars have never been closer to the mainstream, the market pushed ahead by California subsidies for electric car buyers, and a wide array of new models from established car firms such as Toyota and Chevy. Tesla’s focus on luxury, high-performance vehicles has also broadened their appeal; electric cars are no longer purely an environmental statement, but a tech status symbol too. Yet the “zero emissions” claim grates on some experts, who have continued to argue over whether electric cars are really more environmentally friendly than gas guzzlers, once the manufacturing process for the vehicles and their batteries are taken into account. Electric cars rely on regular charging from the local electricity network. The power plants providing that energy aren’t emission-free; even in California, 60% of electricity came from burning fossil fuels in 2015, while solar and wind together made up less than 14%.  “I couldn’t bear to hear them say the words ‘zero emissions vehicle’ one more time,” says Joshua Graff Zivin, who advised one of California’s three main utilities, San Diego Gas & Electric, on electric cars. Graff Zivin is a professor of economics and public policy at the University of California, San Diego. “How you incentivize them to charge could really matter,” Zivin says about electric vehicle owners. “Utilities haven’t thought through it.” More than 1.2m electric vehicles were sold in 2015, the intergovernmental group International Energy Agency estimates, while campaign group Transport & Environment expects 2m electric vehicles to be on the road by the end of 2016. The world’s biggest markets for electric cars are the United States and China, though electric vehicles have a larger market share in some European countries such as the Netherlands and Norway.  California’s electric vehicles can plug into a greener grid than most regions of the world – especially China, where coal generated 72% of all power in 2014 according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). The US gets about a third of its electricity from coal-fired power, IEA says, and more than 40% of total electricity worldwide comes from burning coal. In the US, the Union of Concerned Scientists – which works to raise awareness of climate change – believes that despite a fossil-fuel-dependent grid, electric cars are, on balance, better for the environment.  “There are no areas of the country where electric vehicles have higher global warming emissions than the average new gasoline vehicle,” the campaign group claims in its paper, State of Charge, which calculates the emissions equivalent of an electric vehicle using the makeup of the local energy supply. Using UCS’s formula, a Tesla Model X charging in the Los Altos Whole Foods garage achieves a fuel efficiency equivalent to 81 miles per gallon – far higher than a gas-powered car. Yet not all scientists agree with that approach. “All of the action is in the hourly,” says Graff Zivin. It’s not only the region that an electric vehicle plugs into that matters. The hour of the day is equally critical. “The cheapest power is not the greenest power.” In California, the cheapest power is produced at night, mostly from natural gas, hydroelectric dams and nuclear. Night is when many people will charge their electric cars. However, the greenest power gets generated during the day, when solar power can feed the grid; solar doesn’t work in the dark, windmills stop spinning if there’s no wind and, in today’s grid, there is almost no capacity to store solar and wind-generated electricity to use later. Grid storage is slowly expanding, but most electricity has to be used as it is produced. Units of electricity also can’t be tagged according to where and how they were generated, so nobody can verify whether the electricity they use is from a sustainable source – unless they plug directly into their own solar panel or windmill. Graff Zivin, along with economics researchers Matthew Kotchen and Erin Mansur, waded into this contentious territory in a 2014 paper. Zivin concluded that a plug-in electric vehicle, such as the Nissan Leaf, always produces less carbon dioxide emissions than a hybrid electric- and gas-powered car – but only in selected regions that rely on less coal, like the western United States and Texas. Charging from the coal-dependent grid in the upper midwest of the US at night could generate more emissions than an average gasoline car. And, in some US regions, plugging in at different times of day could even double an electric car’s emissions impact. Charging an electric car for 100 miles of travel could use about 30kwh – roughly the same amount of energy an average US home uses in just over a day. “Since we wrote this paper we have seen more and more coal going out [of use],” Zivin says. Natural gas-fired power plants emit less greenhouse gas per unit of energy produced than coal-fired power stations. As more coal plants are mothballed – partly in response to cheaper natural gas prices – so the electricity powering electric cars emits less carbon dioxide. “But the counter to that is that because of [Barack] Obama’s Cafe standards, we now have much cleaner gasoline cars.”  Nobody knows what President-elect Donald Trump will do with Cafe, the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, which regulate fuel economy and emissions on new US vehicles. Yet whatever happens in the US probably won’t hold back the adoption of electric vehicles worldwide, because apart from limiting carbon dioxide emissions, electric cars can also improve the local air quality in cities by moving emissions from cars to power plants. “Even conservative people in Los Angeles are interested in air quality,” says Thomas Turrentine, director of the Plug-in Hybrid & Electric Vehicle Research Center at the University of California, Davis. He has surveyed electric vehicle owners worldwide about why they like their electric cars. “Climate change was not on the top of the list.”  While carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, it isn’t toxic to human health and does not contribute to smoggy skies. However, gasoline and diesel cars also emit nitrogen and sulfur compounds that contribute to acid rain and form tiny airborne particles that spoil air quality and contribute to strokes, heart disease, lung cancer and respiratory diseases, including asthma. Air pollution is one of the world’s most urgent environmental hazards, causing more than 3m premature deaths annually, according to the World Health Organization. The Chinese government has repeatedly announced its commitment to develop electric vehicles, partly because of air pollution concerns.  Spurred by Volkswagen’s 2015 emissions scandal, in which the company falsified its diesel emissions levels during testing, Germany passed a resolution in October banning combustion engine cars by 2030. It’s a largely symbolic regulation, designed to spur action in the European Union, but the Netherlands and Norway are also discussing bans, and 20% of new car sales in Norway are already electric. For some people, though, giving up gasoline will be hard. “If the whole world started going to electric vehicles, and the demand for gasoline substantially dropped, the price of oil would plummet,” says Severin Borenstein, professor of business administration and public policy at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley. If oil demand drops by 10%-20%, Borenstein says, the price would “almost certainly collapse” to $20 per barrel or lower, or $1 per gallon gasoline before taxes. “That would make it much less economic to use electric vehicles – that would be where we really run into the real question: are we willing to stick to this?” Another challenge is the material used in electric cars’ lithium batteries. “The positive side is they’re not particularly toxic,” Turrentine explains, unlike lead or nickel-based batteries, but they can still be difficult to recycle. Batteries can also use rare elements such as cobalt, the mining of which has raised some serious environmental and ethical issues in countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo. Battery technology may become less dependent on such elements, Turrentine believes, though it is still some way off. But in California, the government is pushing ahead with the electric vehicle revolution. Consumers have been offered generous clean air incentives of up to $2,500 per vehicle, and the US government also offers a $7,500 tax credit on electric cars.  While Silicon Valley’s technology companies are pioneering electric cars as part of their self-driving car vision, the California Energy Commission has handed out $150m in grants for building out electric charging infrastructure, and another $10m grant went to Tesla for its development of the Model X. Back at Whole Foods – where an $88,000 Tesla is charging up – even the charging stations were paid for with public money. When Cruz hears that, he’s a little less enthusiastic about the electric car future. “If I would have known that, it’s like, well, what do I get?” he says. “I’d rather use the money for those who commute from here to there on the bus.”"
"Planet Earth II has been a triumph. More people tuned in to last night’s sixth and last episode than watched the X Factor final on ITV an hour later. Occasionally, the series strayed into the anthropomorphic, but it was endlessly surprising, often astonishing, as technological advance brought intimacy to the struggle for life. Heartstopping sequences were cut as drama. Viewers wept for the iguana that lost against the racer snakes and the turtle hatchlings misled by artificial light into a busy Barbados road. The last episode revealed how in some of the world’s busiest urban areas the relationship between man and nature is being reversed. City life hones wits and the most successful animals – like the Hanuman langurs in Jodhpur in northern India – that have migrated from their remote jungles are exploiting man as a wasteful consumer, thieving and charming their way to unprecedented levels of fertility. But what really marked out this series was the great Sir David Attenborough’s willingness to remind the viewers of the consequences of our greed and selfishness for the rest of our planet’s life. If only he had been more confrontational. We are wrecking the planet, and as Sir David said as he wrapped what must be almost his last television series, it is up to us, and only us, to stop it."

"It’s noon in Murmansk, but the sky is dark. Chunky silhouettes can just be made out scurrying along Lenin Street, swaddled in furs. This is a polar night, and it will be more than a month before anyone here sees the sun again. When the Soviet Union collapsed, this city – by far the world’s largest settlement within the Arctic Circle – went into steep decline, its population tumbling from nearly half a million to barely 300,000. Now, however, many here are anticipating a renaissance, driven by the Kremlin’s belief in the strategic importance of the Arctic, and melting Arctic ice caused by global warming. The principal hope revolves around the northern sea route, a passage through the Russian Arctic from Murmansk in the west to Kamchatka in the east. West to east journeys are one-third shorter via this transit route than through the Suez Canal. It will also be used to transport the vast oil and gas resources in the Russian Arctic to internal and international markets. Currently a nuclear icebreaker is needed to accompany vessels travelling along the route, but as the ice melts – and it’s melting fast – that could change. “We have all the conditions here to become a major international hub,” said Vasily Osin, the region’s acting transport minister. He said a major project to renovate Murmansk’s port would be completed in the coming years, and Moscow has announced a programme to construct or renovate 10 ports in the Russian Arctic in order to facilitate a revival of the northern sea route. Murmansk was founded in 1916 in the twilight of the tsarist empire, and was developed as the Soviet gateway to the Arctic, mainly due to the year-round ice-free port. The frigid temperatures that would be expected at this latitude are tempered somewhat by the last whispers of the Gulf Stream, and the city has always experienced unpredictable weather – it can rain in January and snow in July. This had led many locals to be sceptical of global warming as a phenomenon – indeed many dismiss it as a western myth. But there is no doubt that something is changing. Satellite pictures show record low ice levels, and navigation is becoming possible for longer periods.  “Three years ago boats could only go out into the Kara Sea in the end of July, but this year it was in the middle of July,” said Maxim Belov, a member of the regional parliament and the chair of its economics committee. Belov, 35, is a fourth-generation Murmansk resident, innately hardy to the conditions dictated by the latitude. He dreams of a time when an Arctic region of newly built ports might assure easy passage for thousands of transit ships. “Of course, it’s a matter of 10 to 15 years away, but the more shipping companies realise that there are these big savings to be made, maybe they’ll think it doesn’t cost that much more to equip their vessels to make them ice-class.” For now, traffic on the route is a trickle – a fraction of the levels at the end of the Soviet Union. In 2011, Putin gave the northern sea route his backing, predicting that with time it would become “an international transport artery that will rival traditional trade lanes in service fees, security and quality”.  Putin has also stepped up Russian military activity in the Arctic, renovating a series of Soviet-era military bases in the region.  Now Russia is building new icebreakers, the first of which, the Arktika, will come online next year and at 173 metres long will be the biggest in the world and capable of tackling ice up to three metres thick. The warming Arctic should also theoretically improve conditions for oil and gas exploration, though here both the economics and ethics are on shakier ground.  In the short term, with falling oil prices and US sanctions on Russia, many of the difficult-to-access Arctic resources have begun to look less attractive in the past few years. For years, the Shtokman gas field, one of the world’s biggest, was seen as the potential future driver of the region’s growth. Norway’s Statoil dropped out of the project in 2013 and French Total followed suit last year. Shtokman is one of the largest gas deposits in the world, but accessing it in Arctic conditions requires technological breakthroughs and appears unlikely to be profitable any time in the near future. Currently the largest scale natural resource project in the Russian Arctic is a liquefied natural gas plant at Sabetta, in the estuary of the Ob river. It is due to come online next year, with gas shipments going along the northern route to Europe. But ice melt has prompted warnings from environmentalists about the perils of prospecting for hydrocarbons in the Arctic. Vadim Krasnopolsky, oil and gas projects coordinator at WWF, says that global warming and reduced polar ice may not be entirely positive news for shipping in the area. “For the next decades, there’ll definitely be ice in the Arctic, and even if the ice melts more, this can lead to moving ice sheets, and icebergs. Also, in the last decade, the number of dangerous weather situations doubled. Even if the temperatures warm up, it’s still the Arctic,” he said. Life in Murmansk is not easy. In common with the Soviet-subsidised economy, Russian law provides benefits for those people who live in the far north, to compensate for the hardships of climate and latitude. State workers are paid significantly more than their counterparts in other parts of Russia. Statutory holiday days are also higher, and every resident receives a free return plane ticket once every two years to take a holiday somewhere warmer within Russia’s borders. In summer, the town experiences a polar day of nearly two months, during which the sun never sets, while in winter, a polar night lasts 40 days. On clear days at both ends of the 40-day polar night, there is at least a three-hour period when the sun lurks just below the horizon, in which orange streaks light up the sky and the snowy cityscape gently glows with an ethereal pinkish hue. On overcast days closer to the winter solstice, there is merely an hour or two of grimy twilight around one in the afternoon. Some in Murmansk say polar nights are a breeze compared with a polar day, when the round-the-clock sunshine leads the body to produce endless stocks of serotonin, leading to insomnia and burnout. But for all the climatic difficulties, Murmansk is a place to which its residents grow strangely attached, and as in other parts of the extreme Russian north, people display a warmth and friendliness not always seen in other parts of the country. “We don’t have sunshine, so we have to warm each other up with smiles,” said Irina Ryabakova, a teacher. During the oil boom of the first Putin decade wealthtrickled down to cities such as Murmansk. While much of the city’s housing stock has been battered by time and climate, there are new shopping malls and multiplex cinemas, and a brand new philharmonic hall opened in November. High-concept restaurants serve Arctic treats including grilled reindeer tongue and ice-cream made with local seaweed. And while many people are keen to leave Murmansk, they often end up returning. “I wanted to leave, I even bought a flat in Voronezh [in central Russia], but then I spent some time there, and realised the people are so different, and decided I couldn’t leave here,” said Marina Myzheritskaya, a Murmansk-based psychologist.  The odds might be stacked against Murmansk, but Russia has an almost visceral attraction to the Arctic and a desire to resurrect the area economically and militarily, whatever the costs. A monument to “the conquerors of the Arctic” in central Murmansk takes in a range of dates, from Vitus Bering’s great northern expedition from 1733-1742, through Valery Chkalov’s solo flight over the north pole in 1937, to Artur Chilingarov’s 2007 north pole mission, during which the Russian flag was demonstratively placed on the seabed under the pole. “I love the Arctic and I believe in the Arctic,” said Belov. “We have to make sure life in Murmansk flourishes.”"
"In September 1989, Guardian editor Peter Preston took me to one side. “Environment? Your idea. You do it,” he said. I was on the arts desk and had quite forgotten that, two years earlier, I had proposed that we cover this fast-emerging issue in more depth and with new pages. We had a great correspondent in Paul Brown, but no single journalist could keep up with events. This was the height of Thatcherism, the old Soviet Union was collapsing in ecological ruin, and there had been serious nuclear accidents at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl. That year, more than two million people in Britain had voted Green in the European parliament elections.  If that wasn’t enough, the Great Storm had just blown down 15m trees in southern England, the Exxon Valdez had spilt 11m gallons of crude oil off Alaska, and the French government had blown up Greenpeace’s Rainbow Warrior in a New Zealand harbour. In such tumultuous times, few people paid much attention to Nasa scientist James Hansen when he warned the US Congress, in that same year, about the consequences of something called global warming. Instead, the debate was about nuclear power, population, EU butter mountains, the limits to growth, lead in petrol and the car economy. I suggested to Preston that I was ill-equipped to cover this vast, contentious area and was quite happy to continue covering the arts. No chance. “Four pages. Starting in two weeks,” he said. With hindsight, the Guardian had accurately foreseen a shift of the global, social and scientific tectonic plates, and the arrival of an era of ecological politics. The lids on those boxes that had long separated human rights, science, nature, economics, politics and rich and poor countries had been blown off. The debate was now both global and local, personal and corporate, and it questioned the tarnished dreams of both capitalism and socialism. This was theatre on the world stage. In those early days, two very different women and two giant corporations came to define the frontlines of the battle for the natural world. Melanie Phillips was a senior Guardian editor and in charge of the new environment section when, around 1990, at the paper’s morning conference meeting, she questioned a major scientific report that suggested that mankind was partly responsible for global warming. Phillips was adamant that warming was neither happening nor possible, and that this study showed the descent of science from the pursuit of truth into politicised propaganda. Most of the journalists present were surprised at her disavowal of science, but the Guardian’s science editor was called in to offer another view. Phillips left soon after that, and became a leading climate sceptic. It was an early warning that the “culture wars” , or the polarisation of conservative and liberal values, had begun in earnest. Within a decade, the US neocons had identified environmentalism as the leading intellectual opposition to conservatism, and were trashing climate science, Europe, the precautionary principle and anyone they thought stood for regulation or against the free market. The second woman was Wangari Maathai, a young Kenyan scientist and political dissident who, in the early 1990s, was planting trees with some of Africa’s poorest communities. She came to Britain to talk to activists after being arrested for trying to stop the destruction of Nairobi’s largest park. Within half an hour she had probably changed the agenda for a generation of people who, until then, had barely considered human rights or the poor to be part of the environmental debate. Maathai was an emissary of the developing world, and spoke in horror about how western consumerism was devastating the world’s remotest areas and poorest people. Those at the top of the pyramid, she said, were being blinded “by the need to acquire, accumulate and over-consume”. I remember her saying: “They do not understand the limits to growth and they do not appreciate that they jeopardise the capacity of future generations to meet their own needs.” The message she brought was that any debate about the natural world should not just be about science and parts-per-billion of obscure gases, or about genes or kilowatts, but must include developing countries and be rooted in justice, equity and the situation of the least advantaged. She went on to win the Nobel peace prize, and the planting of trees became a worldwide symbol of political hope and community regeneration. Into this febrile 1990s mix came two giant corporations, both of which epitomised the times and which had both greatly benefitted from the globalisation of trade and the “liberalisation” of poor countries’ economies under the World Bank and the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Representing the old oil age was Shell. This pillar of the global corporate establishment was, for the first time, being held to account by the likes of Ogoni writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, who objected to the devastating human impact of the pollution it caused in places such as Nigeria; and by a new generation of activists angry about oil’s effect on the global atmosphere. Both paid the price of dissent. Saro-Wiwa and others were judicially murdered by the Nigerian government in 1995, and the activists were increasingly hounded and treated as criminals by the US and British authorities. Monsanto was different. Representatives from the old American chemical company, which had a dark history of making Agent Orange and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), came to the Guardian offices in 1997 claiming that Monsanto was the leader of the new “biological” age, having re-invented itself as a global seed company and world saviour. Five directors sat down in new editor Alan Rusbridger’s office, and within minutes were literally thumping the table, saying that we had misunderstood their intention to feed the world with GM food. But we understood very well at that moment that GM farming was not just about science, genes and the promise of greater yields, but also about the intensification of power, the control of food and the gigantic profits that all large corporations could make at the expense of nature. True to form, the British government sided with Monsanto. Most of the rest of the world said: no, thanks. By the late 1990s, with the prospect of water wars, climate change and pollution all growing, and the global NGO movement in full cry at nature’s losses, governments responded with a slew of conventions and treaties to protect the natural world. The Montreal Protocol slowed the growth of the hole in the ozone layer; the Convention on Biological Diversity tried to put a lid on the mounting loss of nature; the Earth Summit had introduced the idea of sustainable development; the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change aimed to brake greenhouse gas-emissions. Fat chance. Most were compromises, signed up to by cynical governments after long and bitter rows between rich and poor. Looking back, they had a common theme: the US, backed by its industries and Britain, invariably bullied the rest of the world into watering down any proposal that appeared to compromise the western way of life. But the worldwide reaction to continuing ecological devastation was sharp. Large anti-globalisation protests led by the left had flared up as trade unionists, environmentalists, debt campaigners and the public united to march against bodies such as the WTO in Seattle, Genoa, Florence and elsewhere. I breathed teargas in five countries (Italian is the sweetest, American the worst). Tactics were swapped between US and British activists as people took to trees and tunnels in protest at the trashing of the countryside, the laying of pipelines, the growth of the car economy and the loss of forests to roads. I recall going to the Newbury road protests with an Amazonian chief, and trying to explain that hundreds of young people were living up trees to protect them. “Ah, they are crazy!”, he responded, with a smile. Ten years later I travelled with ice scientists and Greenpeace to the high Arctic. We reached 82.30 N, just a few hundred miles from the pole, and could have continued north but for a fuel shortage. The vast ice cap that regulates the Earth’s temperature had in 2011 retreated further and faster than anyone could have imagined just 20 years before. Satellite images showed the ice had reduced by nearly 50% compared to just 40 years ago. Climate science was by now pretty conclusive, with UN assessments increasingly pointing the finger at mankind. All over the Arctic, the Andes, the Himalayas and the world’s high places, the effects of accelerating ice loss and a warming atmosphere were being seen. But even at temperate European latitudes, scientists were finding plants moving north, new insects arriving and previously unseen diseases. Nepalese farmers told how raindrops were getting bigger, and in Malawi and Tanzania they spoke of how the seasons were shifting. Empirical scientific research caught up with their observations. But the political chaos around climate change was growing, too, reaching a peak in Copenhagen at the UN’s 2009 climate summit. With 186 countries present, the US spying on delegations, and with Obama, Arnold Schwarzenegger and various rock stars in town, a secret agreement forged by the US, Britain and others to stem emissions by stitching up poor countries spectacularly blew up after a leak. It was clear that climate-change diplomacy had little to do with climate, and everything to do with global power politics and rich countries trying to prevent developing countries growing too much. The meeting fell apart and the Guardian, which received the leak, was accused of near-treason for siding with the poor. “You can’t have people going around getting leaked stuff from other powers who are more powerful than Britain, and printing them and not thinking that’s not going to have an appalling effect,” fumed one affronted senior British mandarin, his efforts to pull a fast one on developing countries in vain. To this day, the UK government believes China leaked that document. Wrong. It was the political mice. Today, 27 years after Peter Preston bolstered the Guardian’s environment coverage, the world has inexorably changed. In this blink of a geological eye, the human population had exploded, adding an extra 2.25 billion people, the equivalent of another China and another India, or 10 more Americas. From being a predominantly rural species, human beings had become urban. Since 1990, the number of mega-cities of more than 10 million people has tripled. By 2030, there will be 10 more. In those years, humans moved around like never before. In 1990, air passengers flew approximately 1bn miles. Today it is 3.5bn. In 1989, there were nearly 700m vehicles on the world’s roads. Today there are 1.25bn, and air pollution has become a bigger killer than Aids and malaria combined. Vehicle numbers are expected to double again in the next 30 years. The world, too, is undeniably hotter than it was in 1989. Sixteen of the 17 warmest years on record have been since 2000, and in that time, the Arctic summer ice has dramatically declined while carbon-dioxide levels have increased from 375 to more than 400-parts-per-million. Most worryingly, in a short quarter century we have been in biological meltdown. Since 1990 we have trashed one tenth of the world’s wilderness areas and lost perhaps 40% of the world’s animals. According to some scientists, one third of the world’s arable land has been lost to soil erosion or pollution in the past 40 years. There may never have been a time when so much has changed so fast. Virtually all of the planet’s ecosystems have continued to be transformed by human actions; extinction rates of organisms are high and increasing; genetic diversity has declined globally; Europe’s common bird populations have declined by 12% since 1990; tropical forests have been falling at a rate of nearly 1% a year; marine fisheries are collapsing. We have greatly diminished the world, but there has been a fightback. In the rich north, we undoubtedly protect more land and sea than we did; we recycle more; our water, air and beaches are generally cleaner, and our homes and machines are more energy-efficient. There are signs that we are slowly weaning ourselves off fossil fuels. We waste less, we buy more ethically, and we can measure our impact on the natural world far better. Across the world, the increase in the rate of population growth, forest loss and greenhouse-gas emissions is slowing; there are hundreds of millions fewer hungry people and more people with access to fresh water and sanitation. We have legal agreements to burn less fossil fuel, to pollute the air less, and to protect more animals. We understand ecological problems better. Many environmental issues fought in 1989 are within sight of being solved. We know what needs to be done. Above all, there has been an energy revolution. In 1989, coal in Britain was in decline after the miners’ strike and gas was taking over. But renewable energy, apart from hydro-power, was considered eccentric and unlikely to grow. In a remarkably short time, it has become mainstream and popular. Wind power is now part of the land and seascape; on one day last week it supplied more than 10,000MW, or 23% of Britain’s entire electricity demand. More than 1m homes and businesses generate electricity from solar power, and just one nuclear plant, Sizewell B, was commissioned in 27 years. Government has been blind to the fact that this has been a cultural revolution, too, with the old, centralised power sources now largely unloved and seen as relics. People today aspire to renewable energy, electric cars and passive houses. Battery developments might revolutionise power again in the next 20 years. There have been other upsides. Britain now leads the world in reducing CO2 emissions, albeit largely by outsourcing its manufacturing and closing its coalfields. Last year, emissions fell to 31% below 1990 levels, with UK coal use down 41% in just three years and at its lowest level of use since the industrial revolution. Sustainable development may be the stated aim of all countries, but looking ahead, it is impossible to be ecologically or socially optimistic. Earth’s inhabitable spaces have dramatically shrunk, its resources have become scarcer, and the intergenerational injustices are mounting. Nature is resilient, but it is clear that, as the natural world is pushed to its limits, we increase chaos, conflict, natural disaster and tensions. And as the neocons, the rightwingers and Brexiteers achieve power, so the environmental protections so laboriously won by NGOs and social activists in the 1980s and 90s are in real danger of being wiped out. The next 27 years can only be fraught. Human population will, inevitably, grow by a further 2 billion people by 2050, cities will burgeon and developing countries will be stretched to their limits. If the gaining of universal wealth follows the lines countries have taken these past 27 years, then the early destruction of more vast swathes of the natural world and its inhabitants seems certain. The great fear is that the transformation to a low-carbon world will take too long, that an addiction to oil and fossil fuels will not stop, and that we will undermine that web of life that sustains us all. The twin hopes must be that we see the end of the oil age and we stop the loss of wildlife. We can see now from space what we have done to forests, soils, and oceans and fresh water in just a few years. We now know the disastrous health effects of air pollution, and of a warming world. We understand that we can grow more food without polluting water, or resorting to gene manipulation. We have proved we can heal nature. Above all, countries and people now have options to transform the way we live. In the words of Preston: “Environment? Your idea. You do it.” • This article was amended on 28 December 2016. Carbon-dioxide levels have increased from 375 to more than 400-parts-per-million, not parts-per-billion as an earlier version said. It was further amended on 2 January to make clear that Melanie Phillips edited the Guardian’s environment section when it was introduced in 1989."
"If you can hear what sounds like a faint drumroll coming from across the Pacific then it’s the sound of millions of jaws dropping on hard surfaces.  President-elect Donald Trump is a phrase journalists are regularly typing into their keyboards. That was jaw dropping enough, even for some Republicans.   But, adding to that drumroll has been the climate science community, the renewable energy industry, the conservation movement, federal environment regulators and climate change campaigners.  Trump has been nominating positions to the Environmental Protection Agency and other key government agencies and departments. To a man (because they’re almost all men), Trump’s picks are climate science deniers. His choice for secretary of state and lead diplomat is ExxonMobil boss Rex Tillerson. Jaws have been dropping all over the place. In the US, there is a large and well-funded network of so called “free market” thinktanks that pumps out manufactured doubt on climate change science with the help of funding from the fossil fuel industry. Trump has been picking many his advisers from these groups, sending in climate science deniers to key agencies to prepare the ground for his administration.  Many, such as Trump’s pick to lead the EPA, the Oklahoma attorney general, Scott Pruitt, have launched multiple lawsuits against the agency they’re going to soon be working for. Trump also refuses to accept the thousands and thousands of scientific papers going back decades showing how burning fossil fuels is changing the climate.  He recently said he had an “open mind” on the issue – a position that’s about as intellectually redundant as having an open mind on heliocentrism. Sometimes minds are so open that the brain is in danger of falling out. Trump’s chief strategist, Steve Bannon, ran the hyper-partisan Breitbart website that runs stories claiming climate change is a hoax and the “biggest scam in the history of the world” while denouncing people who accept the science as “pure scum”. Trump has also appointed a team to prepare the ground in the EPA for the incoming administration.  Leading that group is Myron Ebell, of the Competitive Enterprise Agency, alongside lawyers such as David Schnare and Christopher Horner – two individuals who have used the courts and FOIA laws to try and get access to the inboxes of climate scientists and, yes, administrators at the EPA.  Viewing this part-reality show, part-Shakespearean tragedy from Australia, some might think our own climate debate looks relatively sane. It’s not and it hasn’t been for a long time.  For well over a decade now, Australia’s climate policy has been battered, torn and held back by climate science denial and a broader antipathy towards environmentalism. The same interests and ideologies that have worked for decades to reach the current crescendo in the US have been doing the same thing here. Neatly connecting Australia and the US is the One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts, who earlier this week met with a who’s who of the climate science denial industry in Washington DC, including Ebell. Think we’re immune to the Trump denialism? You haven’t been paying attention.  When Malcolm Turnbull lost the Liberal party leadership to Tony Abbott in 2009, it was Turnbull’s then refusal to back away from pricing greenhouse gas emissions that turned the party room against him. From that point onward, pricing carbon became a no-go zone for the Liberal party. A chief architect of that leadership coup was the then South Australian senator Nick Minchin, who, a month earlier, told ABC’s Four Corners he didn’t accept that humans caused climate change. Rather, Minchin considered the issue a plot by the “extreme left” to “deindustrialise the world”. After the ABC program aired, the journalist Sarah Ferguson said Turnbull had refused interview requests because he “didn’t want to face the sceptics”. You might think Turnbull would have learned his lesson. But, from his latest meek surrender to the deniers in his party, it seems not. He still won’t take them on. Earlier this month, the energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, said a review of Australia’s climate change policy would include a look at an emissions trading scheme for the electricity sector – the biggest single source of greenhouse gas emissions in the Australia.  Within 24 hours, Frydenberg backed down and, soon after, Turnbull said carbon pricing was not party policy and this would not be considered – even though all the expert advice tells him that it would be the cheapest way to cut emissions and would likely deliver billions of dollars in savings on power prices in coming years.  That capitulation was another example of Turnbull giving in to the deniers in the right of the party – in particular, another South Australian senator in the form of Cory Bernardi. Bernardi, too, refuses to accept the mountains of evidence that burning fossil fuels is causing climate change.  The recently appointed chairman of the Coalition’s backbench environment committee is the Liberal MP Craig Kelly – another climate science denier. Going further back, Abbott’s position on climate science was heavily influenced by the mining industry figure and geologist Ian Plimer’s book Heaven and Earth – a tome packed with contradictory arguments, dodgy citations and errors too numerous to count (actually, celebrated mathematical physicist Dr Ian Enting did count them and found at least 126).  Cardinal George Pell, Australia’s most senior Roman Catholic, also took his lead from Plimer’s book. And who can forget Abbott’s business adviser Maurice Newman and his claims that climate science is fraudulent and acting as cover for the UN to install a one-world government – the exact same position taken by Roberts and other fake freedom fighters.  Another Coalition MP seen as influential is the Queensland Nationals MP George Christensen.  Like Roberts and Bernardi before him, Christensen has attended US conferences of anti-climate science activists hosted by the Heartland Institute (that group has been heavily funded by the family foundation of Robert Mercer, the ultrarich conservative hedge fund manager whose millions helped get Trump elected and whose daughter Rebekah is a pivotal member of Trump’s transition team).  Just like the US, Australia too has its own “free market” conservative groups pushing climate science denial. Look no further than Melbourne’s Institute of Public Affairs (which only last year was called in to “balance” a climate science briefing to Kelly’s committee). How about the media? Rupert Murdoch’s outlets the Wall Street Journal and Fox News help to push themes that climate scientists are frauds, that action to cut greenhouse gas emissions will wreck the economy and that renewable energy can’t keep the lights on.  The stable of flagship commentators working on Murdoch’s News Corp Australia, led by the likes of Andrew Bolt, Miranda Devine, Chris Kenny and Terry McCrann, are all happy to repeat and embellish those same talking points.  On the radio, the US has popular conservatives such as Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh pushing climate science denial. In Australia, we have Alan Jones and his stable of shouty Macquarie Radio colleagues.  At this point, some will argue Australia and the rest of the world is investing heavily in renewables. The US, like Australia, is seeing strong growth in the renewable energy sector. That’s all true.  Also true is the progress made through the international agreements made in Paris, even though the climate pledges that make up the deal still fall well short of averting dangerous climate change.  But there’s little doubt that climate science denial is on the march, backed by a conspiracy culture that’s rapidly gaining audiences online.  Trump is climate science denial’s greatest propaganda victory so far. Australia is not immune. "
"A follow-up to An Inconvenient Truth, the Oscar-winning documentary about climate change, will be among the opening night films at the forthcoming Sundance film festival. Like its predecessor, the film will follow Al Gore as the former vice-president continues to make his case around the world that the world most wake up to the imminent threat of climate change.  “Now more than ever we must rededicate ourselves to solving the climate crisis. But we have reason to be hopeful; the solutions to the crisis are at hand,” Gore said in a statement released on Friday. Rumors of a follow-up film have circulated since 2014, but on Friday it was confirmed that the film will be part of the festival’s The New Climate section, which features films that all have the climate or the environment at their core. The spiritual sequel comes 10 years after the original film debuted at Sundance and went on to win two Oscars, including best documentary. It’s expected the film will be released in 2017 by Paramount. The company’s CEO Brad Grey said: “Al’s tireless efforts to bring about change continues to inspire all of us as we fight for the health of our world for future generations.” Gore recently met with president-elect Donald Trump for a series of meetings, after which the former vice-president said he was hopeful that Trump, who has falsely claimed climate change was a Chinese hoax, would reverse his position. “My message would be that despair is just another form of denial,” he said after the meeting. “There is no time to despair. We don’t have time to lick our wounds, to hope for a different election outcome.” Gore also fronts the Climate Reality Project advocacy group, which recently hosted its sixth annual 24 Hours of Reality, a 24-hour live event which focused on he 24 largest national emitters of carbon dioxide in the world."
"British Gas’s parent company, Centrica, has given tens of thousands of dollars to a US thinktank that denies climate change and is backed by Donald Trump’s energy secretary. Direct Energy, a US energy company wholly owned by Centrica, donated $20,000 to the Texas Public Policy Foundation (TPPF) in 2010, according to tax filings.  The Austin-based thinktank has rubbished climate change science, argued the Paris climate deal would “wreak havoc” in the US economy and said the idea of keeping fossil fuels in the ground was a “ridiculous construct”.  Rick Perry, who was picked by Trump for energy secretary on Wednesday, wrote a book in 2010 that praised the thinktank for opposing “environmental policy based on the hysteria of global warming”. The TPPF also has relationships with other top Republicans, including former presidential candidate Ted Cruz. Centrica told the Guardian it did not share the thinktank’s views on climate change, but confirmed it was still donating via its subsidiary and had no plans to stop. Greenpeace, which first spotted the Centrica link to the TPPF, urged the company to “rethink who they give money to” and rule out donating to “climate sceptic outfits”. Hannah Martin, energy campaigner at the group, said: “Centrica claims to be ‘a world leader for action on climate change’ but has been donating thousands of dollars to a climate sceptic thinktank with links to Trump’s new energy secretary, Rick Perry, and Ted Cruz.  “Perhaps it’s just a case of the right hand not knowing what the left is doing, but this can only undermine Centrica’s credibility on tackling climate change.” In total, $4.7m was donated by 129 individuals, corporations and foundations to the TPPF in 2010, tax documents inadvertently published online show. The Koch brothers, who have bankrolled opposition to climate change action across the US, were among the biggest donors, and the list includes oil companies ExxonMobil and Chevron. In addition to Perry, the TPPF has links to Trump’s team through Doug Domenech, head of the president-elect’s interior department transition team, who has called carbon dioxide a “trace greenhouse gas”. Domenech is director of the thinktank’s Fuelling Freedom project, for which he has penned numerous articles attacking action on climate change. “Under the Clean Power Plan more people will suffer – and for no benefit to our climate,” he wrote of Barack Obama’s flagship energy plan to move away from fossil fuels. Writing about a recent conference of climate change sceptics in Washington, organised by the TPPF, he said: “Is climate change real? Yes, it has happened in the past and will happen in the future. Is man making an impact on the climate? Perhaps but in very small ways. But the overarching consensus remains the climate change we are experiencing is by no means catastrophic.” Centrica said its donations to the thinktank were entirely unrelated to its stance on the environment.  “We have a very clear position on climate change and we believe in the need to take material action to reduce the effect of fossil fuels on climate change,” a spokesman said. “We do not make contributions to any organisation to advocate specifically for a position on the environment and the Texas Public Policy Foundation is no exception.” Centrica acquired the Houston-headquartered Direct Energy in 2000 for £406m. The company is the biggest residential energy supplier in North America, serving nearly 5m households and businesses.  Centrica said it donated to the TPPF because it shared some of its views on a “well-structured” retail electricity market. It is not clear exactly how much the company has donated in total to the thinktank but the Guardian understands the most recent donation was of the same order of magnitude as the $20,000 given in 2010. On Thursday, Centrica upgraded its annual profit forecast, partly due to a stronger-than-expected performance by its north American businesses. Earnings per share are up 6.5% to 16.5p, and the company’s adjusted operating cash flow is to be £2.4bn to £2.6bn, up from more than £2bn previously."
"The Canadian government has agreed a deal with eight of the country’s 10 provinces to introduce its first national carbon price, Justin Trudeau has told reporters. The prime minister said the move would help Canada meet its international climate change obligations.  The agreement was struck on Friday only after heated talks. The energy-producing province of Saskatchewan did not sign up, saying the cost would be too great. Manitoba also declined to sign but officials said it might do so later.  Trudeau is promising to impose a carbon price on any province that refuses to sign on.  Under his plan, carbon pollution would cost C$10 (£6, US$7.60) a tonne in 2018, rising by C$10 a year until it reaches C$50 in 2022. The provinces can either implement a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade market. In November Canada announced it would phase out the use of coal-fired electricity by 2030. “Taking traditional coal power out of our energy mix and replacing it with cleaner technologies will significantly reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, improve the health of Canadians, and benefit generations for years to come,” the environment minister, Catherine McKenna, said.  Trudeau is broadly aligned politically with The US president, Barack Obama, who has pushed hard to cut emissions of greenhouse gases. The US vice-president, Joe Biden, told the meeting he doubted the president-elect, Donald Trump, could undo much of the administration’s policies since many of them had taken firm hold. The premier of Saskatchewan, Brad Wall, said the carbon price would make Canadian firms less competitive at a time when Trump looked likely to adopt policies cutting energy costs. Four of Canada’s 10 provinces still use coal-based electricity. Alberta has been working toward phasing out coal-fired electricity by 2030. • This article was amended on 13 December 2016 to correct the first name of the Canadian environment minister."
"Leonardo DiCaprio and the head of his foundation met on Wednesday with US president-elect Donald Trump to discuss how jobs centring on preserving the environment can boost the economy, hours after Trump announced a climate science sceptic to head the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  In a statement to the Associated Press, Terry Tamminen, the CEO of the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation (LDF), confirmed the meeting at Trump Tower in New York. Tamminen said the pair gave a presentation to Trump, daughter Ivanka, and other members of Trump’s team on how focusing on renewable, clean energy could create millions of jobs. It came as Trump chose Scott Pruitt, attorney general of Oklahoma and a sceptic of climate science, as the next EPA administrator, in what was widely viewed as a signal of Republicans’ desire to dismantle Obama’s climate legacy. Pruitt has called the EPA’s rule “unlawful and overreaching” and has cast doubt on the overwhelming scientific evidence that human activity is causing the planet to warm. “That debate is far from settled,” he said in May. “Scientists continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global warming and its connection to the actions of mankind.” Pruitt is also part of legal action waged by 28 states against the EPA to halt the Clean Power Plan, an effort by Barack Obama’s administration to curb greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants.  Environmental groups said that Pruitt was a “puppet” of the fossil fuel industry, pointing to his intervention in 2014 to push back against air pollution standards by using a three-page letter penned by Devon Energy, one of Oklahoma’s largest oil and gas companies. “Having Scott Pruitt in charge of the US Environmental Protection Agency is like putting an arsonist in charge of fighting fires,” said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club. “He is a climate science denier who, as attorney general for the state of Oklahoma, regularly conspired with the fossil fuel industry to attack EPA regulations. Nothing less than our children’s health is at stake.” Trip Van Noppen, president of Earthjustice, which has joined in defence of the Clean Power Plan in court, said “every American should be appalled” by Pruitt’s nomination. “The head of the Environmental Protection Agency should be making sure that our air is clean to breathe and our water is safe to drink, not working to make sure polluters make more money,” he said. His appointment comes hot on the heels of claims by Trump that global warming was a hoax masterminded by China and his promise to pull the US out of the Paris climate agreement. The DiCaprio meeting focused on the economic benefits of renewable energy, Tamminen said. “Today, we presented the president-elect and his advisors with a framework – which LDF developed in consultation with leading voices in the fields of economics and environmentalism – that details how to unleash a major economic revival across the United States that is centred on investments in sustainable infrastructure. “Our conversation focused on how to create millions of secure, American jobs in the construction and operation of commercial and residential clean, renewable energy generation.” The Oscar-winning actor has been a strong advocate of fighting climate change and preserving wildlife, and his recent documentary Before the Flood addresses the peril the world faces because of climate change. DiCaprio met with Ivanka Trump a few days ago and presented her with a copy of the film. On Monday, former vice-president turned environmental campaigner Al Gore met with the president-elect and Ivanka Trump, who reportedly plans to speak out on climate change despite her father’s scepticism. “I had a lengthy and very productive session with the president-elect,” Gore said after the meeting. “It was a sincere search for areas of common ground.” He said the conversation between them was “to be continued”. Tamminen, who was secretary of California’s Environmental Protection Agency under former governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, also said Trump was receptive and suggested they meet again next month. “The president-elect expressed his desire for a follow-up meeting in January, and we look forward to continuing the conversation with the incoming administration as we work to stop the dangerous march of climate change, while putting millions of people to work at the same time,” said Tamminen. If confirmed, Pruitt will probably aid the effort to demolish the Clean Power Plan, although this will not be a simple task as it is underpinned by the Clean Air Act of 1970. Pruitt could choose to not defend it in court or fail to implement its rules, however. The plan is currently on hold pending the legal action. This year is set to be the warmest on record, following a trend of rising temperates over the past century. Scientists have warned that the US faces unprecedented coastline inundation, extreme weather events, drought and displacement of people should climate change not be addressed."
"Australia’s emissions are rising and projected to keep doing so to 2030, meaning the country will fail to meet its 2030 emissions targets, according to government figures. The official quarterly figures, showing growth in year-on-year emisssions, confirms independent projections from Ndevr Environmental, released earlier this month by Guardian Australia, which predicted Australia’s emissions would be rising. The government figures also confirm emissions are predicted to rise to 2030. Emissions that year are projected to be 10% higher than the year to June 2016. By 2030, the report estimates Australia will have emitted 1bn tonnes more than it is allowed to, according to its 2030 commitments. The figures were released on Thursday, just days before Christmas, despite the results being finalised in September, according to documents released on Wednesday night to the Australian Conservation Foundation under freedom of information laws. The report from the Department of Environment and Energy clearly indicated that current policies would not allow Australia to meet its 2030 emissions targets. “These results reflect the fact that the government’s policies are primarily geared towards the 2020 target at this stage,” the report said. Australia’s 2020 targets allow its total emissions to rise. The report notes the projections do not take account of policies that might emerge from the government’s 2017 review of climate policy – a review the government has now said will not include discussion of any form of carbon price, including an emissions intensity scheme. The Climate Institute’s chief executive, John Connor, said if the government continued with its current policy of paying polluters to lower emissions it would cost the taxpayer dearly. “With the government ruling out a policy option that would make companies take responsibility for their own emissions, this billion-tonne gap could see taxpayers slugged for $12bn to $55bn if the Emissions Reduction Fund remains the government’s principal policy tool,” Connor said. “These results are a national embarrassment, so it’s not surprising that the government has released this data as close as possible to Christmas. Despite having committed through the Paris agreement to reduce our emissions to net zero, our emissions are still going up, not down – and it is because we don’t have effective policies to reduce them,” Connor said. The report already assumes 2,000 megawatts of coal power will be retired after 2020 and a doubling of electricity generated from rooftop solar between 2020 and 2030. The figures are an improvement over projections made in 2015, when the government expected 2030 emissions to be almost double what it now expects them to be.  The report said the change in the projected emissions is a result of Hazelwood –Australia’s dirtiest coal power station – closing; projected increases in energy efficiency; lower emissions from land clearing; and changes in the way emissions are counted. “This is an improvement of 187% since we last updated our emissions projections,” said Josh Frydenberg, the minister for the environment and energy. Australian Conservation Foundation economist Matthew Rose said: “Transition for the electricity sector is a crucial environment and economic reform that today’s data shows is being neglected. It is also disappointing the government has decided to release such critical data so close to Christmas in what one can only assume is a tactic to avoid scrutiny.”  The pre-Christmas release of two quarters worth of data, plus emissions projections, mirrors the government’s actions last year, when it released data on Christmas Eve showing emissions were rising. Documents released to the Australian Conservation Foundation show a final version of the March quarterly results was circulated as long ago as September. On 10 September 2016, an email from a senior Department of Environment and Energy bureaucrat to a recipient whose name was redacted, said: “Attached is the department’s final version of the quarterly update. I will give you a call on Monday to discuss.” Another email between bureaucrats in the department, dated 3 November said: “I am just following up last night’s email on the quarterly update and to note that we are expecting some agitation on the delay in the release to the quarterly update soon.” It is unclear from the correspondence if any significant revisions were made between September and Thursday’s release. According to the new figures, Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions rose 0.8% in the year to June 2016. And in the year to March 2016, emissions were up 1.3%. The results are even worse than those predicted by Ndevr Environmental, which earlier projected emissions would be up by 0.4% in the year to June 2016. But comparisons have been made difficult since the government changed its methodology in the most recent figures. The Labor spokesperson for climate change and energy, Mark Butler, said: “These results under Malcolm Turnbull are worse than anything Australia experienced under the known climate sceptic Tony Abbott.” “The rise is startling, even more than projected by independent analysis,” Butler said. The Greens climate change and energy spokesman, Adam Bandt, said: “Malcolm Turnbull once said ‘we must make a dramatic reduction in the world’s greenhouse gas emissions’, yet Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions are actually rising under his leadership.  “Malcolm Turnbull is now the king of pollution.” In a statement, Frydenberg chose to focus on the government’s 2020 target, which will be met using “carry over” from Australia beating it’s Kyoto protocol target. The Kyoto target allowed for Australia to continue increasing emissions. But Australia beat that target by increasing emissions by less than it was allowed to. The amount that it beat that target by was allowed to be “carried over” and counted as abatement towards its 2020 target. That again allowed Australia to potentially meet its 2020 target without actually reducing emissions. “Official figures show Australia beat its first Kyoto protocol emissions target and is now on target to beat its 2020 emissions reduction target by 224m tonnes,” Frydenberg said. “This is an improvement of 187% since we last updated our emissions projections.” Frydenberg also took aim at Labor’s carbon tax. “Our policies like the Emissions Reduction Fund are working to reduce Australia’s emissions at low cost, without driving up the price of electricity like Labor’s carbon tax did,” he said. “What this shows is that the government’s policies are working to reduce emissions without lobbing a $15.4bn carbon tax on households and businesses.”"
"Business and environment groups have expressed dismay at the federal government for scrapping consideration of an emissions intensity trading scheme in the electricity sector as part of its 2017 review of climate change policies, just a day after floating the possibility. On Wednesday a range of experts said the abrupt backflip by the environment and energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, on Tuesday night would create further regulatory uncertainty, which was a recipe for higher power prices down the track.   But despite chalking up an internal victory by seeing off a carbon price for the electricity sector, conservatives within the Turnbull government are doubling down on efforts to limit future ambition in climate change policy. The South Australian Liberal Cory Bernardi declared Australia should pull out of the Paris international climate agreement, which require it to reduce emissions by between 26% and 28% on 2005 levels by 2030. The Paris agreement is the underlying architecture that locks Australia into pursuing emissions reductions, but Bernardi declared “we don’t need to be part of an international agreement that actually impedes us from making determinations in our own best interest – particularly an agreement that won’t include the world’s largest economy.”  Bernardi said Donald Trump’s campaign promise to withdraw from the Paris climate accord “should be the catalyst for Australia to do the same.” The government’s decision to rule out emissions trading came a day after Australia’s electricity and gas transmission industry called on the government to implement a form of carbon trading in the national electricity market by 2022. The report, which was backed by the Csiro, said adopting an emissions intensity scheme for electricity would be the least costly way of reducing emissions and could actually save customers $200 a year by 2030. Matthew Warren, the chief executive of the Australian Energy Council – representing 21 electricity and gas businesses – was scathing about the government’s decision. “Doing nothing is not an option any more,” he said. “We are seeing in realistic terms the warning signs about the degrading state of the electricity grid and that says everything about why we have to have this review process to deliver substantial and meaningful outcomes, because if we don’t the system starts to disintegrate. “Old assets are reaching the end of their lives and there is nothing coming in to replace them. South Australia is already facing that now and it’ll happen across Australia if we don’t do something. “We’re seeing the effects of do-nothing for a long time. It doesn’t make sense to limit the scope before it has begun. We need to use this opportunity to reset.” A spokeswoman for AGL said an emissions intensity scheme would be a cost-effective way to achieve an energy transition, but it would not be enough on its own. “It is important that the Australian energy sector has clear policy settings that are agreed by Coag and consistently implemented across states,” she said. “The results of the AEMC and Finkel reviews and Coag processes will be important to help define future policy settings and AGL Energy encourages governments to move quickly to provide the certainty needed to give confidence to the industry to make significant investments which will improve outcomes for consumers.” The Climate Institute’s chief executive, John Connor, said the developments this week added to the “policy chaos of the last decade” on climate change mitigation.   “Ruling out options before this review even begins is irresponsible,” he said. “It will heighten, not decrease, risks to energy security and electricity prices, because it adds further uncertainty to a sector which has already been described by the Australian Energy Council as ‘almost unbankable’ and ‘visibly deteriorating’.” The chief executive of the Business Council of Australia, Jennifer Westacott, stopped short of directly criticising the government but stated support for bespoke emissions reduction policies per sector.  Tom Quinn, the executive director of the Future Business Council, described government’s updated position as a “big blow” to its members. “It throws certainly for the entire future business sector under the bus, especially the booming renewables sector and the entire low-emissions sector, so this is a real blow,” he said. “The future is low-carbon, the future is renewables, and the longer Australia delays the more we miss out on economic opportunities and the more we undermine business confidence. “Once again it means we are propping up the businesses of last century at the expense of this century’s growth stories.” Tony Wood, energy director of the Grattan Institute thinktank, said that ignoring the sector-specific scheme would result in higher costs for end users. “The worst of this is that the people who caused the minister to do this are going to get almost exactly the outcome they’re trying to prevent,” he said, citing less certainty in investment with knock-on effects for business confidence. Retailer Energy Australia said it supported a national approach to cleaner energy sources with consumers in mind but resisted the move to rule out policy solutions before the review. “We encourage everyone involved in energy policy to focus on understanding the problems we face in that transition,” it said. Australian Conservation Foundation’s Victoria McKenzie-McHarg said the new position from the government was a “startling” following a statement from the prime minister that heartened her organisation the previous day. “By knocking out policy options this early in the review, the government is just making their task much harder, and the confidence in that process is significantly reduced,” she said. Australian National University economist Frank Jotzo said an emissions intensity scheme for the power sector wouldn’t be perfect, but would be effective. “It is second-best to a standard emissions trading scheme,” he noted. “But limiting the impact on electricity prices is precisely why an emissions intensity scheme has been in the discussion.” The Minerals Council of Australia, which represent the interests of coalmining giants, was contacted by Guardian Australia but declined to comment, as did the Australian Bankers Association, which speaks for nation’s biggest banks.
