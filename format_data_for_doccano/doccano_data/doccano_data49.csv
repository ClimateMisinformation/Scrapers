The stated mission of the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS) is to put “ideas into action for peace, justice, and the environment“. These are noble aims, but can be achieved only by finding good solutions, solutions that can be reached only through open, honest discussion. 
I was interested in getting reaction from other leading scientists, journalists and academics on the matter, and so I sent e-mails asking them to comment. Much to my satisfaction, most of them replied. Their comments on the Rossiter fellowship termination follow.

“For any objective reader and citizen of the world, this sort of bullying ought to inform everyone that science and its practice are now no longer free and willing. In fact, we are constantly being terrorized and threatened by the research funding gravy trains and large resources needed for science to progress and prosper. This is a scientific dark age we are living in because no more scientists of Professor Rossiter’s caliber are speaking out and telling the whole truth on any matters scientific. The idea of atmospheric CO2 being the one sure control knob for climate and future disasters is profoundly wrong – not only on scientific grounds but also on the moral and ethical grounds that Professor Rossiter’s op-ed in WSJ has exemplified. Thank God that the United Nations and various scientific institutions will not be able to silence us because we will never let them do that.”
Lennart Bengtsson (Sweden)
Professor of Meteorology, climate scientist
“As I myself have experienced recently, the ceiling of tolerance in climate change has become depressingly low, I might say almost non-existent. This is most worrisome for the health of science. I find Prof. Rossiter’s comments highly reasonable and it is obvious that without a healthy economical development of Africa along the lines we have seen in China, there is neither much hope for the people of Africa nor is there much hope that humankind will ultimately solve its environmental problems. The directors of the Institute for Policy Studies should ask themselves how life in Europe and United States would have been today without access to inexpensive energy in the form of coal during the last 250 years. I find the treatment of Prof. Rossiter in all respect both unintelligent and disgraceful.”
Fritz Vahrenholt (Germany)
Professor of Chemistry, co-author of The Neglected Sun
“The right to free expression and the freedom of science are the very foundation of democratic societies. When it comes to the ideology of climate alarmism, this obviously does not count for institutions like the IPS. This is regrettable. Caleb Rossiter is right: International climate policy has so far produced more damage than good for the people of the world.”
Judith Curry (USA)
Professor of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences
Georgia Tech
“Wikipedia describes IPS as a left-wing think tank.  It is not clear whether Rossiter had a paid position there or not?  It isn’t surprising to me that a think tank with a clear agenda would want to get rid of someone who ran counter to that agenda.  If Rossiter lost a government funded position because of his views, well that would be a different story.”
S. Fred Singer (USA)
Professor of Atmospheric Physics
“I know Prof. Rossiter. Several years ago he invited me to deliver a talk on climate science to his students at American University. I got the impression that he had an open mind on the issue — and simply wanted to know the evidence, both pro and con, about human influence on climate change. I enjoyed meeting him. I had been meaning to contact him to bring him up to date. I also know the IPS; like many left-wing groups, it has a rigid position on issues and enforces orthodoxy. So I am not surprised — even though climate has nothing to do with war in Viet Nam.”

Professor of Physics
“As in so many cases, I am troubled to hear such news about scholars who are fired for their opinions. But in this case, I am not surprised or impressed because it’s some left-wing think tank – really an intellectually flavored organization of activists of a sort – so of course that they don’t tolerate someone who disagrees with some basic orthodoxy of a similar ideological color. This think tank is, hopefully, not pretending to be any open general public organization enjoying a monopoly over something that should be open to all people with some abilities and contributions above a certain threshold. It’s been cherry-picked, much like a political party, to contain people of certain opinions. I am not too troubled or shocked by that.”
Klaus-Eckart Puls (Germany)
Veteran meterologist, European Institute for Climate and Energy
“His fellowship was terminated because he had a diverging view. They said it themselves. That’s dogmatism, and not science or solution finding. This leads us to question if the IPS is a serious organization at all.”
Dr. Sebastian Lüning (Germany)
Specialist for Geology of Africa
Co-author of The Neglected Sun
“The ‘Institute for Policy Studies’ should change its name to ‘Church for Policy Studies’ if the directors restrict freedom of opinions to its scientists. Prof. Rossiter addresses a very valid point in his commentary that deserves detailed discussion. Africa suffers from a great number of current problems among which climate change is only near the end of the list.”
Tim Ball (Canada)
Professor of Geology
“I have no sympathy for Caleb Rossiter. He is not a victim. He got thrown into a small club of people who have been demonized for daring to question, for daring to practice skeptical science, for daring to speak out by default. The sad part is we wouldn’t be hearing about him now if it wasn’t for the termination of his fellowship.
 Where was he when Rachel Carson condemned at least 90 million Africans to death because she falsely accused DDT of causing cancer and her husbands death? Where was he when I and Paul Driessen (EcoImperialism) were writing about thousands of Africans dying because of high food prices caused by US farmers growing corn with government subsidies to drive American cars?
Now we read about his concerns as if he is the first to discover what has been going on for years. The situation in Africa and around the world is a result of the leftist policies he supported and no doubt taught his students. Face the reality that you not only wasted your life, but did so in a way like Rachel Carson.
 It is far too late to come with a mea culpa or even a mea maxima culpa. It is likely he would still be pushing his leftist agenda if the fellowship wasn’t terminated. Is he going to expose what is wrong with the message of the Institute for Policy Studies from now on?”
Nicola Scafetta (Italy)
Professor of Physics, Duke University
“In science issues are solved by applying the scientific method. Those who believe that a proposed theory is wrong, present their arguments and a discussion follows. The scientific method is structured in such a way that science can fix itself of the wrong theories.  Therefore, the promoters of the anthropogenic global warming theory have nothing to worry if they are interested in science and are on  ‘Nature’s side’, as they claim to be. They just need to practice their patience and the scientific method to rebut the critiques.
 On the contrary, the campaign to silence dissent to the anthropogenic global warming theory has nothing to do with science. It is just a political plot finalized to intimidate scientists with the goal to prevent them from doing their job. The only  positive aspects of this sad situation is that politics cannot substitute the scientific method nor stop it. At most politics can slow down the scientific progress with some damage to society, but it cannot really stop it.
 Since 2009 I have published more than 20 papers further developing the study on natural climatic variability and its possible physical causes.  The latest update is here
 Today, many papers are being published on related topics and an increasing number of them are reaching my same 2009 conclusion that at least half of the observed warming since 1950 is naturally caused by climatic oscillations (e.g. by a 60 year plus other oscillations). To me it seems evident that the anthropogenic global warming theory as proposed by the IPCC does not have a future.
 Understanding how climate truly works will be beneficial for everybody. So, I cannot but hope that scientists will have the full freedom to investigate climate change without the inappropriate political interference and that they get the deserved recognition for their truly scientific work and accomplishments.”
Hans Labohm (Holland)
Economist/publicist
“This is the umpteenth example of a scientist being excommunicated by his colleagues because he refuses to ignore facts and is not willing to toe the party line. Throughout the years I have witnessed many similar cases in my own country, The Netherlands, and have been familiar with many other cases abroad. It is part of a hideous tendency of Lysenkoism in the field of climate science. It is inconsistent with the spirit of truth-seeking which should be the main driving force behind science. Every scientist, whether he or she is a climatologist or not, whether he or she is pro AGW or not, should speak up loudly against these kind of practices and should condemn them unequivocally.”
Dirk Maxeiner (Germany)
Veteran science journalist/publicist
“The handling of Caleb S. Rossiter is an expression of a peculiar new worship of stars that stops at nothing. […] Attention is being shifted from the concrete problems of today’s living people and over to future generations. Many people in Africa are suffering from horrendous conditions, dirty water, and polluted air.  These are among the leading causes of death for children. They could be helped today. But the public is more concerned about the Africans as possible climate victims 100 years in the future. The simplest rules for sustainable action seems to have been forgotten. It is called: Whoever wants to survive tomorrow must first survive today.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe print edition of the Swiss Die WeltWoche has a story on the IPCC and accusations that climate scientists have misled policymakers: The Silence of the Climate Scientists, authored by Markus Schär.
In it Schär claims that “the IPCC lead by Thomas Stocker concealed good news in its report” and that “a new report shows that the warnings of climate change have to be called off.” 
Weltwoche writes that in view of the record Antarctic sea ice, 17 years of no global warming and cold records peppering the globe, it is obvious that “the climate models of climate scientists can’t be right“.
The Swiss news weekly cites a recent report by Nicholas ­Lewis and science journalist Marcel Crok that was recently released by the British think tank Global Warming Policy Foundation. In it Lewis and Crok claim the IPCC kept silent about important findings because “they contradicted their warnings of a climate catastrophe“.
Weltwoche describes Lewis and Crok as persons who don’t let themselves be labeled deniers and that the report’s foreword was written by renowned Georgia Tech Professor Judith Curry, “a leading atmospheric physicist who as a critic of climate science has advised the US Congress over the last weeks. For this reason the report stimulated attention worldwide, even if not in the media, who still prefer to warn of catastrophes“.
In the report’s foreword, Curry calls the GWPF report “technically sound, well-organized and readily comprehensible”.

Weltwoche writes how Lewis und Crok pointed to a number of recent studies indicating that CO2 climate sensitivity has “a far lesser value of between 1.5 and 2°C” and that “there is no reason for warnings of catastrophe.”
Weltwoche writes:
For this reason the IPCC people are silent about the recent papers in their summary for policymakers, refrain from providing the most probable values and instead spread the message that despite all the uncertainty, their certainty is greater than ever.”
According to Weltwoche IPCC lead author Thomas Stocker was rankled by claims in the GWPF report, accused them of cherry-picking and that he had no intention of responding to a “non-peer-reviewed paper published by a think tank.”
WeltWoche appears somewhat surprised by Stocker’s irritability, concluding:
­Lewis and Crok actually only did what the IPCC should have done: that is to look at the important studies and to draw the obvious conclusions from them. The lessons of their report are recommended for Stocker to consider.”

"As a child in the 1970s and 1980s Sir David Attenborough’s series were my most eagerly-awaited TV programmes. At school my friends and I discussed Life on Earth and The Trials of Life the way kids today discuss soap operas. We marvelled at the images, but we were hooked by the stories.  The art of a brilliant wildlife documentary is in the storytelling, and Attenborough is the supreme narrator. When I was a child, his wildlife documentaries had more than 20m British viewers, figures Simon Cowell can only dream of. His shows were broadcast in the USSR and China, even during the cold war. At the time, he may have been the most recognised person in the world. Of course, as a young undergraduate biologist he was my idol. I remember once filling in a competition form that asked which living person would you most to like have dinner with. I answered Sir David. I didn’t win that competition, but I did have dinner with him many years later, when I worked on the filming of the Life of Mammals in Brazil. The three days I spent with Sir David showed him to be a humble, empathetic and educated person. The overriding memory I have is of him sitting reading scientific papers in a deckchair, in the field, waiting to film. Mistakenly I believed that the great Sir David Attenborough had research assistants who wrote his script and provided him with information. But then he is not really a presenter acting on camera, but rather a wildlife enthusiast sharing his authentic wonderment with the viewing public. In modern, celebrity-driven TV, image is everything. Presenters parade in front of the cameras like gaudy peacocks: all show and no substance. They may not be reading from a teleprompter, but the lack of spontaneity in their words makes many of them sound as sincere as a second-hand car salesman. Then there is Sir David, he looks unremarkable, like everyone’s favourite old uncle or grandfather, but his talent is extraordinary. It is easy to tell a story about the rock stars of the animal world: tigers, polar bears or giant pandas. But what makes Sir David a great storyteller is his ability to make the humble British dormouse as interesting as a mountain gorilla. It may not come and sit on him, but it nonetheless has a life less ordinary. Conveying the magic in the lives of apparently mundane creatures is a rare gift. But not one without precedent in UK television. Think about Britain’s most famous soap operas: Coronation Street and Eastenders – they succeed by using storylines that show the fascinating lives of ordinary people. I suspect the global appeal of wildlife TV is that all humans share with animals the struggles to find shelter, food, a mate and to rear their offspring. In documentaries of the animal world we see that our everyday existence is worthy of attention, even if we are only celebrities in the eyes of those who know the tale of our existence. Thus, the chronicling of animal lives is very much like the soap opera of our own existence. But animal lives are more timeless, free from fashion, which as I tell my students means Sir David’s back catalogue will always be interesting unlike old episodes of soap operas. If it were not for Sir David’s mesmeric storytelling I would probably have become an accountant. I am sure that people from all walks of life around our planet will join me in wishing him a very a happy birthday."

“You need to get scientists that are not paid by the drug companies to determine what the cholesterol guidelines should be”.

Not long ago I did a report on a study showing that meat-eaters are much healthier than vegetarians – coming from the University of Graz in Austria. I didn’t expect the story to attract so much attention. So far it has been shared over 8000 times and may reach 10,000 shares.

I used to have a lot of respect for the scientific community. But the more I look into things like climate, and now nutrition and medicine, the more I’m realizing that much of it is rotten to the core and has long been overrun by greedy, swindling bastards who crave money and/or power.
My advice: Don’t trust any of today’s “renowned scientists” claiming the science is settled. Chances are they are profiting at the expense of others.

This short illustrated essay questions government efforts to combat global warming and climate change from three points of view:
1. The influence of CO2 on temperature
2. Decarbonisation outcomes
3. Politics
This essay examines quantifiable and hopefully non-contentious aspects of the question.
1. Influence of carbon dioxide CO2 on temperature
The temperature-increasing capacity of atmospheric CO2 is known and widely accepted to diminish as its concentration increases.
Global warming advocates and climate change skeptics both agree on this. IPCC published reports acknowledge that the effective temperature increase caused by growing concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere radically diminishes with increasing concentrations. This information has been presented in the IPCC reports, yet it is well disguised for any lay reader, (TAR3, Chapter 6. Radiative Forcing of Climate Change: section 6.3.4 Total Well-Mixed Greenhouse Gas Forcing Estimate) . It is not acknowledged in their Summary For Policymakers.

Figure 1: Logarithmic warming diminution of CO2.
The rapid diminution effect is an inconvenient fact for global warming advocates, nonetheless it is well understood within the climate science community, but it is certainly not much discussed. This logarithmic diminution effect is probably the reason why there was no runaway greenhouse warming caused by CO2 in earlier eons when CO2 levels were known to be at levels of several thousands ppmv.
– Up to 200 ppmv, the equivalent to about 82% of the temperature increasing effectiveness of CO2, is essential to sustain photosynthesis in plant life and thus the viability of all life on earth.
– A further 100 ppmv was the level prior to any industrialisation, this atmospheric CO2 made the survival of the biosphere possible. It was responsible for a further 5% of the CO2 greenhouse effect.
– Following that, a further 100 ppmv, (certainly man-made in part), adding 4.1% of the CO2 effectiveness brings to the current level 400 ppmv.
– CO2 at 400 pmmv is already committed and immutable. So CO2 has already reached about 90+% of its potential warming effect in the atmosphere.
Only 10% of the effectiveness of CO2 as a warming greenhouse gas now remains:
400-500 ppmv 3.25%
500-600 ppmv 2.65%
600-700 ppmv 2.05%
700-800 ppmv 1.44%
800-900 ppmv 0.84%
900-1000 ppmv 0.24%    Total 400-1000 ppmv 9.63%
Both skeptics and the IPCC publish different views of the reduced effect on temperature of as  CO2 concentration rises.  Theses alternates are closely equivalent proportionally but vary in the degree of warming that is attributable to CO2. The range is from 3.13°C to 14.55°C.  The graphics showing IPCC published views on the diminution below:

Figure 2: Temperature as a function of Co2 concentration.
A comparison between all four estimates are set out below in the context of the whole approx. 33°C greenhouse effect.  This graphic shows the remaining temperature effect of CO2 in orange that could be affected by global decarbonisation policies.

Figure 3: Greenhouse gas
It is anachronistic that some of the IPCC data sets shows very large proportions of the temperature effect attributable to CO2. The concomitant effect of those higher levels of CO2 warming is that the proportion of the total approx. 33°C then attributable the water vapour and clouds in the atmosphere is reduced so as to be unrealistically low.
Is it plausible that CO2, a minor trace gas in the atmosphere, currently at the level of ~400 ppm (0.04%) achieves such radical control of global temperature when compared to the substantial and powerful Greenhouse Effect of water vapour and clouds in the atmosphere?
Global warming advocates stipulate that all increases in the concentration of CO2 are solely man-made. This is not necessarily the case, as the biosphere and slightly warming oceans will outgas CO2. The man-made CO2 contribution at maximum is only a minor part of the CO2 transport within the atmosphere, at ~3% of the total [i]. The recent IPCC report now admits that probably increasing CO2 levels are only approx. 50% man-made.
There are the clearly divergent views of the amount of warming that can result from additional CO2 in future, but even in a worst case scenario whatever change that may happen in future can only ever have a marginal effect on global temperature.  
So any de-carbonization policy, however widely applied, trying to control CO2 emissions can only ever achieve a minor future temperature reduction.
Whatever political efforts are made to de-carbonize economies or to reduce man-made CO2 emissions, (and to be effective at temperature control those efforts would have to be universal and worldwide), those efforts can only now affect at most ~10-11% of the future warming potential of CO2.
So increasing CO2 in the atmosphere can not now inevitably lead directly to much more warming.  Increased CO2 levels in the atmosphere cannot give rise to any dangerous temperature increase.  
Decarbonization policies could never have any useful impact to realistically control any rising world temperatures and the future world climate.
As the future temperature effect of increasing CO2 emissions is now so minor, there is no possibility of ever attaining the much vaunted political target of less than +2.0°C by the control of CO2 emissions.
It is likely that any current global warming is largely a natural process, is within normal limits and is probably beneficial.
The probability is that any current global warming is not man-made and, in any case, it could be not be influenced by any remedial action, however drastic, taken by a minority of nations.
In a rational world, that prospect should be greeted with unmitigated joy.
If it is so:

All concern over CO2 as a man-made pollutant can be entirely discounted.
It is not essential to disrupt the western world’s economy.
The cost to the European economy alone is considered to be approx. £165 billion per annum until the end of the century, not including the diversion of employment and industries to elsewhere.
This deliberate economic self harm can be avoided and the vast resources could be spent on much more worthwhile endeavours.
If warming is happening, it provides a more benign climate for the biosphere and mankind.
Any extra CO2 has already increased the fertility of all plant life on the planet.
If warming is occurring at all, a warmer climate within natural variation would provide a future of greater opportunity and prosperity for human development, especially so for the third world.

2 Decarbonisation Outcomes

To quantify what may be achieved by political action for de-carbonization by Western economies, this comparative table below shows the remaining effectiveness of each 100 ppm increment up to 1000 ppmv, with the total global warming in each of the four diminution assessments.

Figure 4: Little impact for  trillions of dollars in cost.
The table below shows the likely range of warming arising from these divergent (sceptical and IPCC) views, (without feedbacks), that would be averted with an increase of CO2 for the full increase from 400 ppm to 1000 ppm. This table assumes that the amount of CO2 released by each of the world’s nations or regions is reduced universally by some 20%: this is a radical reduction level but conceivable.

Figure 5: Temperature reduction by nations, regions.
The results above for countries and country groups show a range for whichever scenario of only a matter of a few thousandths to a few hundredths of a degree centigrade. However it is extremely unlikely that the developing world is going to submit to non-development on the grounds of reducing CO2 emissions. So it is very likely that the developing world’s CO2 emissions are going to escalate no matter what is undertaken by developed nations.
These figures show that whatever the developing world does in terms of increasing CO2 emissions, the outcome is likely to be non-beneficial.
The extreme, economically destructive and immensely costly efforts by participating nations to reduce temperature by de-carbonization should be seen in context:

The changing global temperature patterns, the current pause and probable impending cooling.
The rapidly growing CO2 emissions from the bulk of the world’s most populous nations as they continue their development.
The diminishing impact of any extra CO2 emissions on any temperature increase.
Normal daily temperature variations at any a single location range from 10°C to 20°C.
Normal annual variations value can be as much as 40°C to 50°C.
Europe as a whole only accounts for approx. 11% of world CO2 emissions.
The UK itself is now only about approx. 1.5% of world CO2 emissions.

As the margin of error for temperature measurements is about 1.0°C, the miniscule temperature effects shown above arise from the extreme economic efforts of those participating nations attempting to control their CO2 emissions.  Thus the outcomes in terms of controlling temperature can only be marginal, difficult to detect and thus irrelevant.
The committed nations by their actions alone, whatever the costs they have incurred themselves, may only have virtually an undetectable reduction on world temperature.  So it is clear that all the minor but extremely expensive attempts to limit CO2 emissions undertaken by a few convinced western nations will in the end be inconsequential.
Professor Judith Curry’s congressional testimony 14/1/2014 [i]:
Motivated by the precautionary principle to avoid dangerous anthropogenic climate change, attempts to modify the climate through reducing CO2 emissions may turn out to be futile.  The stagnation in greenhouse warming observed over the past 15+ years demonstrates that CO2 is not a control knob on climate variability on decadal time scales.”
Professor Richard Lindzen UK parliament committee testimony 28/1/2014 on IPCC AR5 [ii]:
Whatever the UK decides to do will have no impact on your climate, but will have a profound impact on your economy.  (You are) Trying to solve a problem that may not be a problem by taking actions that you know will hurt your economy.”
and paraphrased “doing nothing for fifty years is a much better option than any active political measures to control climate.”
It remains absolutely clear that our planet is vastly damaged by many human activities such as:

Truly toxic environmental pollution, (whatever is asserted CO2 is neither toxic nor a pollutant).
Over fishing.
Rain forest clearance, especially for the production of biofuels [iii][iv].
Biosphere destructive industrial farming at all levels.
Wild habitat destruction throughout the biosphere.
Many green and renewable energy activities actually detrimental to the environment, etc.

The world indeed should be strenuously finding ways to improve these situations.
But the unwarranted concentration on reducing CO2 emissions has deflected even well-meaning green activists and green-indoctrinated politicians from these more immediate and more worthwhile objectives.
As global temperatures have already been showing stagnation or cooling [v] over the last seventeen years, the world should fear the real and detrimental effects of global cooling [vi] rather than being hysterical about limited, beneficial or now non-existent warming [vii].
3 The Politics
It is clear that all the minor but extremely expensive attempts by the few convinced western nations at the limitation of their own CO2 emissions are inconsequential.
The IPCC acknowledges that the diminution effect with increasing CO2 concentrations exists, but it does not explain its consequences. Like the Medieval Warm Period that the IPCC attempted to eliminate with the hockey stick graph in 2001, the IPCC knows that wide public knowledge of the diminution effect with increasing CO2 concentration would be entirely detrimental to their primary message.
It is increasingly clear that policymakers and global warming advocates have long been headed down the wrong path.
Matt Ridley has a clear opinion on this:
So we are doing real harm now to impede a change that will not produce net benefits for 70 years. That’s like having radiotherapy because you are feeling too well.”
Richard Lindzen, the Alfred P. Sloan Professor of Meteorology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said it all [xv]:
Future generations will wonder in bemused amazement that the early twenty-first century’s developed world went into hysterical panic over a globally averaged temperature increase of a few tenths of a degree, and, on the basis of gross exaggerations of highly uncertain computer projections combined into implausible chains of inference, proceeded to contemplate a roll-back of the industrial age.”
On the other hand, a cooling world as both Hemispheres have seen in the years since the turn of the millennium leads to much more dire consequences for the biosphere and mankind, than any realistic amount of warming that could arise from man-made CO2 emissions. The damage can be seen from the current 2014 winter weather in North America, Asia and Siberia and the significant cooling winters across Europe up to 2013.
Cold is a much greater threat than any moderate amount of additional warmth that would ever result from the release of Man-made CO2. National policy makers and the United Nations are neither recognizing nor are they preparing for a cooling eventuality.
With a quietening sun, changing ocean circulation patterns and the growing evidence of much colder winter weather in both Hemispheres, that cooling could already be upon us [xvi]. The cooling climate could well last for many decades or even centuries.

"A controversial hydroelectric dam project in sub-Arctic Canada relies on local Innu people giving up their own lands. Nalcor Energy, the firm building two dams to produce the Muskrat Falls hydroelectric project in Labrador, along Canada’s north-eastern coast, talks enthusiastically about “boundless energy”. And why not? Hydroelectric power is seen as a renewable and relatively benign way to meet the ever-growing energy needs of industrialised societies. Nalcor, owned by its provincial government, says that its project will “significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions – equivalent to taking 3.2m vehicles off the road each year”. This sounds great. Yet beyond the impressive feats of engineering and the CAN$11 billion cost (£6.5 billion), what will it take to accomplish what is being imagined here?  Across the world, many areas sacrificed for hydroelectric generation belong to indigenous or land-based peoples who either have to be moved or live with drastic changes. The Three Gorges dam in China displaced 1.2m people and the Belo Monte dam in Brazil could displace up to 40,000. And back in the 1950s the Kariba dam project on the Zambesi river in Zambia precipitated an involuntary resettlement of some 57,000 people, including the Gwembe Tonga farmers and hunters, whose homes, gardens, burial and spiritual sites were flooded with virtually no consideration from the British colonial authorities. Opposition to “progress” may lead to imprisonment and in the case of Honduras and Guatemala, even to the suspected murder of indigenous opposition leaders and protesters.  Canada is a supposed world leader on human rights. Yet any country staking its economy upon energy production on the lands of indigenous peoples is likely at some level to disregard their rights. I have researched this over the past 20 years. Muskrat Falls is being constructed on the culturally important Mishta-shipu (“Big River”) on lands where there has been no treaty and which remain under unextinguished Aboriginal Title. The lands belong to the Innu peoples of the Labrador-Quebec peninsula. Yet Canadian authorities are proceeding with the project as they anticipate the Innu electorate will at some time in the future vote to extinguish ownership of their own land.  Contrary to standards in the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples on free, prior and informed consent, the Innu are given few meaningful choices other than to relinquish their lands.  Under the current land claims process they must either extinguish their aboriginal and land rights or, under the notorious certainty provision, agree not to exercise those rights. In the short-term, many Innu may enjoy some extra cash, self-government rights and business opportunities, but they will have to accept having most of their collective lands privatised. It’s not just me saying this: even the UN has been concerned for some time about the ease with which indigenous lands in Canada have been usurped. As recently as last year the Human Rights Council urged Canada to reconsider its process for consultation and consent. “Consent” in Canada is based on the mind-numbingly complex New Dawn Land Claims Agreement-in-Principle. Although the Innu Nation negotiating team contests the agreement, many Innu do not know its contents. On a recent visit earlier this year to the Innu villages, I found that only four of the 30 Innu adults I consulted had read any of the text. Previous trips also revealed little knowledge of the important provisions in the agreement. But the agreement to extinguish their ownership rights doesn’t really matter because the mega-project is a fait accompli. An environmental study commissioned by Nalcor downplayed the negative environmental effects of Muskrat Falls. The company admits that the dam will increase levels of toxic methylmercury in water and plankton but claims it will remain “in the natural ranges observed for lakes and rivers”. A subsequent modelling study by Harvard researchers predicted much higher concentrations of methylmercury in the waters surrounding Innu and neighbouring Inuit communities and predicted that “increases in methylmercury concentrations resulting from flooding associated with hydroelectric development will be greater than those expected from climate change”.  For people who continue to rely on fishing, this is shattering. A number of Innu and their supporters, alarmed by the likely impact, have now called for a complete rethink. They have organised protests at the site, where five Innu were dragged away, arrested and charged by police. Nalcor says the dam will bring stable electricity prices, clean energy and jobs. But though the jobs brought to the nearby Innu community of Sheshatshiu provided a quick injection of cash they also increased existing community problems. People there told me cocaine and alcohol abuse have increased because of the high pay and shift work patterns at Muskrat Falls, along with subsequent family destabilisation and child neglect. This adds to endemic health problems such as high diabetes and suicide rates that are 14 times higher than the Canadian average. Community infrastructure remains terrible – one village even lacks drinkable water.  The very high costs of living in Labrador have always been offset by subsistence hunting, fishing and gathering, but with Muskrat Falls now joining a network of other hydroelectric projects spanning Innu territories across the Labrador-Quebec peninsula, the continual violation of their rights is increasingly imperilling their ability to enjoy healthy and sustainable lifestyles. While international attention focuses on the trampling of indigenous rights in developing countries, we should not forget that Muskrat Falls joins a long history of dispossession in North America."

Share this...FacebookTwitterProducing alarmist scenarios and visions of climate horror are in vogue today at various weather and climate institutions. For example a recent study has just come out warning that Western Antarctic Ice Sheet is on the verge of a “chain reaction to collapse” – due to warming of course. (Never mind Antarctic sea ice is at a record high for the date). Things are no different at Germany’s national weather service; Deutsche Wetterdienst (DWD), who seem to have problems telling the truth.
======================================
Surprise! Original data refuses to back up DWD’s claims of wetter winters in Germany
By Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
A dew days ago D. E. Koelle expressed some outrage at questionable statements made by the Deutsche Wetterdienst (DWD German Weather Service) at a press conference in March 2014. The dubious statements were about Germany’s historical temperature development and came across as being alarmist (see “German Weather Service Uses Manipulative Statistical Sleights Of Hand To Craft Warming“). The DWD also looked at other weather parameters at the event, like precipitation. On page 2 of its press release the DWD writes:
Winter in Germany has gotten 30% wetter since 1881
Climate change in Germany can also be seen in precipitation data. The DWD experts calculated a 10% increase for annual mean precipitation since 1881. If one considers only winters, the increase nationwide is almost 30%. For spring and autumn the increases are almost 12% and 9% respectively. In the summer months the mean precipitation amounts since 1881 have decreased 1.2%.”
Winters are getting wetter, so salvage whatever you can.

But hold on a second. Let’s take a look to see if there is any truth behind the DWD’s claim of winter floods. To do this we use the online precipitation data that the DWD provide themselves. The result is depicted below. The surprise is great: Winter precipitation (December-January-February, DJF) is currently only about 4.5% higher than the period around 1918 and the 30-year smoothed curve always goes up and down. Climate alarm!

Figure: Precipitation in Germany over the last 125 years. Data source: DWD. Chart: DH7FB
 =========================
Moreover, the chart shows a downward trend, which happens to coincide with Germany’s temperature trend over the last 15 years. The DWD is misleading and abusing the public trust.
[Note: 30% is the relative increase and is thus circa 7 times more than 4.5%]

"The UK’s biggest fund manager has spent nearly £300m this year increasing its shareholdings in companies it named and shamed for dragging their heels on climate action. Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM), which has been one of the most outspoken fund managers over the climate crisis, announced in June it was cutting five more companies from its environmentally and socially conscious funds for not doing enough to mitigate the climate emergency. But figures compiled by the Guardian show that LGIM as a whole actually spent about $367m (£285m) since January increasing its stake in those companies – the oil corporation ExxonMobil, the insurer Metlife, the maker of Spam, Hormel Foods, the US retailer Kroger and Korean Electric Power Corporation (KEPC) – even when accounting for the divestments made by its Future Worlds Funds. LGIM, which manages more than £1tn in assets, openly admits that it continues to hold stakes in companies excluded from those environmentally and socially focused funds, saying it gives them the opportunity to engage with the board and ultimately influence company behaviour. But the boost to LGIM’s overall shareholdings in those firms raises questions over whether companies should take LGIM’s threats seriously, particularly when it is spending millions of pounds to increase its holdings. The investment firm defended its position, saying the increased investment is because it is managing more money for clients overall, and that those clients were putting the bulk of the cash into passive index tracker funds. Index tracker funds are not actively managed but use algorithms to follow major stock exchange indices such as the FTSE All-Share that include companies such as ExxonMobil. “It is index providers, not asset managers, which select companies that are included in mainstream indices. LGIM continues to engage with the large index providers on this issue,” the spokesman said. But John Hardy, an organiser with the divestment campaign group Fossil Free UK, said: “It’s disappointing that a firm like LGIM, which has been a leader on this issue, continues to invest and give a social license to fossil fuel companies and those driving climate change.” He added: “We need to get to a point where there isn’t a difference between ‘Future Worlds Funds’ and tracker funds, where the moral argument and the financial argument are both showing that investment in those kind of companies not feasible and not welcome.” LGIM’s Future Worlds Funds are governed by its Climate Impact Pledge, which means it can exclude companies over poor governance and weak climate disclosures, as well as lobbying politicians on policies that risk accelerating the climate crisis. It led to LGIM dumping stakes in China Construction Bank, Rosneft Oil, Japan Post Holdings, Subaru, Loblaw and Sysco Corporation last year. But in the months leading up to its 2019 divestments, LGIM actually increased its holdings in all five companies, which it would cut loose later from funds in its its Future Worlds Funds. In March, it spent almost $410m increasing its stake in all of ExxonMobil, Metlife, Hormel, Kroger and KEPC. That figure more than makes up for the $50m worth of shares it dumped as part of the climate divestments in June, and resulted in a net investment across all five worth a combined $367m. LGIM remains a top 30 shareholder in all but one of those five firms, having recently sold another chunk of KEPC shares that relegated the fund manager to the firm’s 78th largest investor. Catherine Howarth, the chief executive of investment campaign group ShareAction, said: “The analysis raises the issue of index funds which automatically channel capital into fossil fuels companies – this is far from a perfect model for socially conscious investors.” “What is crucial is that index fund managers use their voting rights as shareholders in fossil fuels companies to demand ambitious change from company boards and senior management, and to vote against the election of directors that fail to commit to transition. As ShareAction’s recent analysis of voting on climate-related resolutions shows, LGIM has indeed done this.” A recent report by ShareAction lauded LGIM for backing 82% of key shareholder climate votes, many of which were aimed at forcing world’s most polluting companies to cut their emissions. LGIM’s spokesman said: “Climate change is a very important topic for us and we have been working strenuously to bring about change in the companies in which we invest.” In line with its climate pledge, LGIM has used its shareholder powers to vote against corporate chairs of companies it believed failed to take adequate action on the climate crisis. Voting records seen by the Guardian show it voted against re-electing the top board members of companies including Volkswagen, Barrick Gold and Japan’s Tepco, which it believed were not doing enough to mitigate the climate emergency.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf you do an Internet search of “climate liability insurance“, you will quickly find that it is one of the latest schemes being promoted by insurance companies, banking and even fossil fuel companies to curb “dangerous climate change”. Here they stand to make huge piles of cash by claiming CO2 is causing bad weather. It’s the latest proposed scam to shake down hundreds of billions from consumers and the poor.
Switzerland’s Neue Züricher Zeitung NZZ (New Zurich Newspaper) has a commentary on the “merits” of climate liability insurance.
It works as follows: The “fact” that greenhouse gas CO2 is responsible for storms and thus the property damage they cause is pushed. Fossil fuel companies (at the start of the CO2 supply chain) are held liable for the resulting “climate damage”, and so are forced to buy climate liability insurance. In such a scheme the premiums are based on how much fossil fuel production each company is responsible for. Based on complex calculations, a figure of 15 dollars per tonne of CO2 would be payable by fossil fuel producing companies, in total 400 billion dollars annually. The huge costs added would then be passed along to the consumers and the poor, who find themselves at the bottom of the fossil fuel energy chain.
So what would happen to the 400 billion dollars in premiums that would be collected annually? The NZZ writes: “National, regional and local authorities would have the right to apply for compensatory damage payments because of storm damage to infrastructure” and “A part of the premiums would be invested in projects for the prevention of climate damage; financial instruments (e.g. catastrophe bonds and Green Climate Fund) are already available.” That means green energy companies.
In the end this all has the same effect as a hefty tax on the poor and middle class. Naturally big banks and insurance companies are salivating, as are green energy companies, governments and fossil fuel companies because they stand to profit handsomely.
The NZZ writes that climate liability insurance would be easier to implement because the scheme would not require any international treaty. Moreover, fossil fuel companies would have few qualms about playing along as they would have a good excuse to jack up energy prices. The NZZ:
Climate liability insurance functions when a number of relevant companies start using it. The pressure to play along would successively build up– through appropriate laws in individual countries and foremost because more and more companies, NGOs, and consumers would demand manufactured products be made with insured fossil fuels.”
In the end consumers would be willing to pay more because of having been tricked into believing they are improving the weather.
What would consumers really get in return? They’ll never see any perceptible changes in weather – perhaps a few hundredths of a degree less warming. Many consumers of course will complain about the dubious charging. But no problem, proponents will always be able to claim that the weather would have been worse had the consumers not paid the costs of climate liability insurance. Making tonnes of money with the weather has never been easier. The only thing that is needed are masses of gullible suckers who stand ready to believe anything.

"All life affects the environment. All organisms remove material they need, and they all release material that they do not need. During the evolution of life on Earth, the planet has been greatly modified by both non-biological factors and also by life itself.  The most dramatic event was the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and its replacement by oxygen. Driven by photosynthesis, it perpetrated for the original life forms – which evolved in strictly anaerobic conditions, with no oxygen – what could be viewed as the greatest environmental pollution event to affect Earth. The removal of carbon dioxide also decreased the levels of this greenhouse gas, which lowered the planet’s temperature.  Where did all that carbon go? One sink was into organic carbon that we now extract as gas and oil. Much of this material originated from the burial of microscopic photosynthetic organisms, the phytoplankton.  Phytoplankton form the base of the marine foodweb: they produce fatty acids, some of which, once they get transferred into fish, form an important part of the human diet. If they become buried for millions of years, the fatty acids are converted into oil. Millions of years of phytoplankton growth have produced the oil that humanity is so rapidly extracting and converting back to atmospheric carbon dioxide.  Most of this CO₂ is not in this form, however – most is phytoplankton buried as chalk, a form of limestone; think of the white cliffs of Dover. Perhaps fortunately for Earth, humans have no great need for chalk, so this reservoir of carbon dioxide remains safely locked up. But why did biology make limestone in the first place? Many organisms, including ourselves, use calcium carbonate for their skeletons. Even microscopic organisms make hard parts made of this material, and some of those structures could certainly be viewed as having a skeletal function, to protect the organism, or to hang components from. However, much of the limestone represents deposits made by phytoplankton that have no obvious need for a skeleton. So why did they go through the effort of making calcium carbonate; indeed why are they still doing it, and will climate change affect the process? Large growths of the phytoplankton that deposit calcium carbonate, called “coccolithophorids”, can be seen from space; their blooms are so large that the white chalky plates, the “coccoliths”, reflect light that is sensed by satellites. Why they make this material has baffled scientists for decades. Some have suggested that the plates help protect the organisms, which are only some five-millionth of a metre in diameter, from viruses or grazers. Others have suggested that making calcium carbonate may enhance the supply of carbon dioxide for photosynthesis by modifying seawater chemistry. Evidence for such explanations has been refuted or at is least not substantiated, however. But a new idea developed by our team lead by Swansea University provides an alternative explanation, which – even if it is not the basis for the evolution of coccolith production – must affect the ecology of these Earth-shaping organisms. During photosynthesis, phytoplankton remove carbon dioxide from the water and the acidity of the water then decreases. This decrease (an increase in pH) is basification, the opposite of acidification. Humans are causing ocean acidification through excess carbon dioxide from burning coal, oil and gas dissolving in the sea and volcanoes also contribute. Neither basification nor acidification is good for phytoplankton growth, but while ocean acidification is largely human-made, basification during phytoplankton growth is perfectly natural and is something that all phytoplankton must endure. Actually, this is not true: coccolithophorids do not have to endure it, and this is why. Calcification, such as the production of coccoliths, also removes carbon dioxide, as does photosynthesis. However, the chemistry behind calcification leads in total to a decrease in pH: it causes an acidification event. During our research, we used detailed mathematical models of the growth of coccolithophorids to test the theory that basification caused by photosynthesis would be matched by acidification caused by calcification. The result of such an event would be a stable pH that promoted coccolithophorid growth. The models demonstrated that the ratio of photosynthesis to calcification seen in the real organisms, and in the way that they respond to changing environmental conditions, matched predictions from the model. Coccolithophorids do not do what most other organisms do, take what they need and throw waste out that damages their environment for the next generation. These organisms can bioengineer their environment by mopping up the waste, here, by countering basification. They make the seawater in which they live a more stable environment.  Our research also considered the implications of ocean acidification for coccolithophorids, and the result is not such good news. To balance pH in the future ocean, less calcification is needed; this means they cannot help sink so much of the carbon dioxide humans pump to the atmosphere. So, we may have found the reason why coccolithophorids help make cliffs of chalk, but also why they won’t be doing it so much in the future."

Share this...FacebookTwitterVeteran meteorologist Joe Bastardi tweeted here a chart showing Detroit not only has been struggling with a brutal, cold and snowy winter this year, but has been doing so for the last decade. Soon people won’t know what bare ground in the springtime is!

Joe also adds that 6 of the top 15 snowy winters have occurred in the last 15 years.
No wonder the title of the fairy tale has been changed from global warming (a lie) to climate change. For meteorologist Joe Bastardi, it’s clear: “People around Detroit and everywhere (most snowy winters are also colder than normal) dont believe their lies.”

"There might be a place where “raving inner city lunatics” are the only people who are concerned about climate change but it is certainly not Michael McCormack’s electorate of Riverina. Here in south-western New South Wales, the effects of climate change could not be more keenly felt, as we continue to manage for an extended fire season, as we continue to sell down stock and towns actively deal with water shortages and quality issues for drinking and irrigation. They are just the headlines to our lives. Monday’s extraordinary interview is just more evidence of the tin ear on the national political party most often associated with country Australia. And more’s the pity. Those of us who live in the country need metropolitan Australians to understand our lives more than ever. Yet this sort of rubbish about ‘woke inner city greenies’ is exactly the sort of crap that divides the nation and takes the place of the more difficult policy work to address some of our challenges. It is cheap talk that kills farmers’ social licence at a time when we need cities to understand how important the job of food growing is for their own bellies and how important food production is to the economy of regional communities. As the dairy industry bleeds under crippling water prices, we need to have a serious conversation about the diversity of our food sector and its building blocks – soil, water and energy – and how they are impacted by climate change. We need the city to understand how important the growing renewables sector is to providing new jobs to our communities, while ensuring we take our own coal workers by the hand into new opportunities. In short, this is a story that swirls around McCormack’s head like winds fanning our latest tragic bushfires. It is a national story in a country he purports to help lead and it is a local story in his own backyard. Yet he averts his gaze. While the federal Nationals cannot utter the term climate change, their West Australian counterparts can and do. This is Mia Davies, the smart young leader of the WA Nationals when the state party passed a motion acknowledging climate change is resulting in more extreme and variable weather. “I talk to younger people and I say ‘would you engage with a political party that was perceived not to believe in climate change?’,” she said. “Their answer is universally ‘no’ and so from my perspective this is about saying we are a party that wants to be part of the conversation and work on things that, yes, are difficult, but our communities expect us to be a part of that.” It brought plaudits from WA farmers, such as the influential agribusiness woman Sue Middleton, who explicitly stated on Monday via Twitter that the bushfire events could be a “Port Arthur moment” for the National party, evoking past leadership of Tim Fischer during the gun debate. Importantly, the WA Nats’ acknowledgement has meant West Australian farmers have had the political cover to organise and aim for zero net emissions by 2030 so they are part of the solution. Those goals provide an important part of the answer for any metropolitan citizens who question the role of agriculture in climate change. These conversations are being held across the country. The industry’s thinktank, the Australian Farm Institute, earlier this year addressed the issue of global warming on the already risky business of farming. The AFI followed up, launching a report commissioned by Farmers for Climate Action at Parliament House, which was used to call for a national climate strategy. So scary were the political implications that the National party didn’t turn up to that launch by their own ministerial colleague, the environment minister, Sussan Ley. Once again they poked their own constituency in the eye in favour of inexplicable political priorities. Yet the agricultural industry must build trust with city voters if they are to convince them on their capacity to manage environmental services and improve soil carbon, both important future income streams that are already happening, paid for by corporations and governments. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning That’s just a few of the national issues McCormack ignores. At the same time, the main streets of the little towns and regional centres in his own electorate are hunkering down for a long drought. McCormack must have missed the protest of 1,000 people in his own electorate during the global strike for climate. Were they raving inner city lunatics? He must have missed the protests outside his office by concerned Riverina citizens Wagga Wagga Fridays for Future, some of whom are GPs and mental health clinicians in a group numbering 500. He must have missed his very own Wagga City council declaring a climate emergency, before the local politics of it got too much and it was rescinded. In the past few months I have attended agronomy meetings, working out the tricky juggling acts of making use of moisture stressed crops and feedlotting sheep. I have attended field days where land managers are looking for new ways to ensure that the land can recover after drought in a drier climate – including government-funded courses in the rising movement for regenerative farming. Hell, this week I will attend a renewables in agriculture conference in McCormack’s hometown to hear about the transformation of energy use and income streams on farms. But then I know McCormack understands the opportunities because he handed over $1m to the small town of Lockhart in the Riverina, which is one of a number of rural towns racing to be totally renewable in the very near future. As he told The Land, the project would be “transformational”. “This will re-energise, literally, Lockhart and this is a project almost the entire town, if not the entire community has gotten behind,” he said. People are already acknowledging and adapting. So by all means, throw red meat to what you think is your base. But don’t pretend your own voters aren’t concerned about climate change because they are already thinking about local solutions.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe news of distinguished Swedish meteorology professor and former director of the renowned Max Planck Institute of Meteorology, Lennart Bengtsson, resigning from the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF) advisory board just days after having joined it has spread through the blogosphere like wildfire.
Psychological torment seems to be at play.
His resignation in the face of intolerance will surely prompt harsh reactions from some elements of the mainstream media globally in the days ahead. Bengtsson cites “enormous world-wide pressure” and “enormous group pressure” that threaten his “health and safety“. His resignation further underscores a growing, closed-minded zealotry that is embedding itself within the climate science community which is resembling more and more a cult.
Warning signs of psychological aggression appeared early on. For example climate physicist and alarmist Georg Hoffmann paralleled the GWPF to the Ku Klux Klan, simply because they hold a skeptical view on global warming science rather than embracing it as a religion.
At Climate Audit Steve McIntyre writes of “more shameful conduct by the climate ‘community’“. McIntyre adds that scientists like Bengtsson are precisely the “people that the climate ‘community’ should be trying to persuade“, and not run out of town with hounds. He compares the action by the climate science community to a “fatwa“.
A number of readers at Klimazwiebel have reacted harshly as well.

"Love them or hate them, ring-necked parakeets have invaded Europe and they’re here to stay. Already a staple of many urban parks and gardens around the UK, some of these charismatic bright green birds are now so comfortable in their new surroundings that they will happily sit and feed from your hand.  Parakeets are Britain’s fastest growing bird population and are on a trajectory to global domination. Outside of their native southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, breeding populations are now established in at least 65 cities around Europe, and more than 30 countries across five continents. Such non-native, or “invasive” species are one of the biggest causes of biodiversity loss in the world today, and can cause severe economic damage. Understanding these species is incredibly useful for any attempt to design environment policy and prevent further invasions. Populations of invasive ring-necked parakeets (Psittacula krameri) provide an excellent case study, owing to their patterns of rapid growth and spread. These parakeets were introduced into the UK in the late 1960s and now number well over 32,000 birds. They were originally concentrated around Greater London and nearby Kent, but these areas are now saturated which has resulted in parakeets spreading around the country, reaching as far north as Inverness in Scotland. Many popular stories exist to explain how these exotic parakeets came to live in the UK, including their escape from the film set of the African Queen, and my personal favourite: their deliberate release by Jimi Hendrix to inject some psychedelic colour into the streets of London. More likely it is a result of the popularity of keeping ring-necked parakeets as pets. The global transportation of wild ring-necked parakeets in addition to in-country breeding, has led to their successful establishment outside their native range. Between 1984 and 2007 a staggering 146,539 ring-necked parakeets were imported to Europe, before an EU ban on the trade of wild birds. The UK alone imported more than 16,000. We know how they got to Europe’s cities, but what makes ring-necked parakeets so good at adapting to new environments? The climate is likely to play a strong role in their ability to survive outside of their native range. Despite their incredibly large native range, spanning two continents, the parakeets found across Britain and Europe originate predominately from across the colder foothills of the Himalayas, largely in Pakistan. The distinct lack of parakeets from warmer areas in Africa suggests similarities in temperature and rainfall between the native and invasive ranges made life easy for them. It seems the parakeets were already well adapted to survive in northern Europe. Interestingly, back in the late 1800s wild ring-necked parakeets were observed in the UK, but they failed to survive. So what’s different now? Perhaps warmer winters due to climate change, in combination with our love of feeding birds thus giving them a year-round supply of energy, have provided ideal conditions for parakeets to thrive around the country. Let’s also not overlook the lack of natural predators outside their native range. Unsurprisingly, Asian black eagles aren’t a concern in London’s parks. However, it seems Britain’s urban peregrines and sparrow hawks have now started to notice the exotic new meat on the menu. Yet despite native falcons’ success at preying on wild parakeets, they’re unlikely to make a dent on the growing numbers of invasive parakeets. Despite parakeets being well established in the UK, we still don’t fully understand their potential impact, good or bad. Do they affect native wildlife by competing for nest holes and food? Preliminary reports show some level of competition for nest sites with European native nuthatches, and that they displace garden birds from bird feeders. Back in Asia and Africa ring-necked parakeets are severe crop pests, but we don’t yet know if they’ll damage British fruit crops and cause economic damage. Many scientists are also curious about the impact they are having on people. Does living near large roosts cause noise pollution? Does seeing exotic parakeets in parks and gardens around the UK improve human wellbeing? These are just some of the questions we’re aiming to answer through ParrotNet, a pan-European group of researchers dedicated to understanding the challenge of invasive parrots (ring-necked parakeets are just one of 13 species of parrot established across Europe). Despite their abundance, surprisingly, many British people remain unaware that wild parakeets are living among them. As these vibrant birds are now spreading around the country, in time they will become commonplace in all the UK’s urban areas. While we may still regard these colourful and exotic parakeets as something of an exciting novelty, I suspect our children and their children may simply consider them no more exciting than a common pigeon."
"This week was a pretty big one for climate change, the drought and the ALP, and they were all somewhat intertwined. On Wednesday an article published in the journal BioScience, co-signed by 11,000 scientists, warned “clearly and unequivocally that planet Earth is facing a climate emergency”. The authors noted that, despite 40 years of solid scientific research pointing to the dangers of climate change, “greenhouse gas emissions are still rapidly rising, with increasingly damaging effects on the Earth’s climate”, and that “an immense increase of scale in endeavours to conserve our biosphere is needed to avoid untold suffering due to the climate crisis.” This of course is pretty horrific news but at least there was some good news here in Australia, because the next day, for the first time ever, the national energy market produced more than half of its electricity via renewable sources. Of course no one in the government thought it worthy of celebrating or even mentioning – mostly because it happened in spite of the government’s policies, not because of them. And it is possible to come up with effective national, bipartisan policy on climate change. We saw it this week when on Thursday  New Zealand passed legislation committing the nation to achieving zero net carbon emission by 2050. That same day our Department of Agriculture released a report into droughts by the coordinator-general for drought, Major General Stephen Day. It was pretty upfront about what is happening. The fourth paragraph of the forward stated: “As a consequence of climate change, drought is likely to be longer and more severe in some regions and over broader areas. It means that farmers and communities in some regions are likely to see drought more often”. And just in case you needed it underlined, it continued: “ultimately, the nation could see some areas of Australia become more marginal and/or unproductive”. That very same day (it really was a busy Thursday) the prime minister and the leader of the Nationals released the government’s drought package. At no stage during the press conference was climate change raised once. That was despite Day’s report finding “climate change, and the increased frequency and severity of drought in some regions, is considered the most serious threat to land management”. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning And just to top it all off, also released that same day was the ALP’s review into its election loss, in which the politics of climate-change policy was given a very strong focus. This in effect is politics in Australia – the LNP is at best expected to pretend to look like it cares, while receiving barely any heat for doing nothing, while the ALP is expected to actually come up with a real policy and at the same time receive all the heat for attempting to do something. Last week Katharine Murphy and Adam Morton revealed the government had quietly appointed an expert panel to come up with a climate change policy that will lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. It would be nice to have some hope that this might actually lead to a policy that does something substantial, but watching LNP climate change policy over the past 30 years forces one to assume the result will be a policy that looks like the government is doing something while in reality it is just another lie that somehow greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced without any economic pain to anyone. Meanwhile the ALP report noted that the Coalition sought to “assert Labor’s climate change policy was not costed”. And that “Labor’s inability to respond effectively played into the Coalition’s characterisation of Labor as a risk”. This is true to an extent. The assertion that it was not costed was false, but the reality was the media in large parts fell for the Liberal party line. And the reason they fell for it was an underlying assumption that we could (nay, should!) somehow compare the costs of a 45% cut in emissions as recommended by scientists with the cost of a 24% cut in emissions which once carryover credits were included was really closer to a 15% cut. It meant that the ALP needed (and as the report noted, largely failed) to “effectively discuss the cost of not acting on climate change.” This is hard enough to do alone, it is nigh on impossible when few in the media are bothering to challenge the LNP with those costs as well. Instead we remain trapped in a cycle where we find yet another drought assistance package presented all the while the government’s own documents state climate change will cause more of them. And it means we’re trapped in a cycle where effectively promising to keep doing the short-term response indefinitely is viewed as a long-term policy. Murphy was right to note that the crucial element of the ALP’s review is squaring the often countervailing forces of traditional blue-collar workers and wealthier inner-city-dwelling progressives. The answer is not to put up the white flag on climate change, and the report makes that clear, noting: “a modern Labor party cannot deny or neglect human-induced climate change. To do so would be wrong, it would cause enormous internal instability and it would be a massive electoral liability”. It also notes the need to focus on the employment and economic positives of the change. This is absolutely a must. The transition to zero emissions will be tough – if it wasn’t we would already have done it. But it needs to be enticing, exciting and desired. The US Democratic party has its Green New Deal, and the UK Labour under Corbyn has very much linked the switch to renewables with jobs. It really is a no-brainer for Australia to be a world leader in renewable production and technology. Anthony Albanese has rightly set off on this path – his speech in Perth a week ago made this a key issue. But it will need more than just a few speeches. It is going to need a policy and a campaign that inspires people, because that is what great progressive policy does. And as with other progressive policies such as Medicare it also shames the conservatives into supporting it. This will be tough because, as we have long seen, the conservatives in this country have no shame when it comes to ignoring climate change. But it needs to be done. • Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia"
"Callum Roberts is professor of marine conservation at York University and was chief scientific adviser on Blue Planet 2. His new book, Reef Life, details a life spent in the oceans studying the marine ecosystem. How was your first dive?It was in the north of Scotland, where I grew up. I dived out of Scrabster harbour near Thurso and I had no idea then just how bruised and trashed and scraped the whole sea had become, and how much life had been removed from it over the centuries. I was in a wetsuit that I’d glued together at home. A wetsuit should hug every curve, but this one didn’t. It was bloody cold.  Did you always want to study coral reefs?From early childhood I wanted to be an explorer and I held on to that desire for a long time. I realised, though, that at some point I had to earn a living. There were patches of the world that were still relatively unexplored, particularly the underwater environment. So I trained in biology and that enabled me to fulfil my childhood dream. You write that heaven is a dive on a coral reef. Why is that?The sheer exuberance of colour and form on a coral reef is unparalleled. It’s like an impressionist canvas where all the brush strokes have come to life. The corals themselves form a 3D architectural complexity with palaces and gardens. There’s the play of light on the seabed, the way the waves dapple the light across the animals. It’s invigorating in a way that’s hard to describe. Any hairy moments?My most dangerous dives have been when I’ve let my guard down and followed the wildlife into the danger zone. You can get into trouble much more easily on a coral reef than on a mountainside. From 40 metres to 60 metres you get nitrogen narcosis and from 80 metres and deeper you get oxygen poisoning. That’s what really kills people. On one dive, I foolhardily went down to 60 metres. I had lost the fear of it. I didn’t sense the danger. There can be very strong downcurrents that can suck you down 15 or 20 metres before you are able to inflate your jacket and counteract the pull. What about sharks?I grew up on a diet of Cousteau and others who milked sharks for all the terror they could. They wanted to show how daring they were. It coloured my view early on, but over the years I realised the sharks are not bothered by me. Sharks do bite people, they do kill people, but not very many, and it seems to be more error than intention. A student of mine was recently diving in the Maldives where here is an incredible abundance of tiger sharks there. She saw 23 on the same dive. The tiger sharks came up to them, and some of the divers were bumped, but other than that the sharks ignored them. I’m not bothered about sharks at all any more, there’s only excitement and the feeling of privilege at being with these creatures. How does climate change harm corals?What’s killing corals at the moment is mass bleaching. Corals have a 100m-year-old relationship with a microscopic alga that lives in their tissues. These seaweeds produce most of the coral’s food: it’s what makes them the reef builders they are. But when the water warms up, the relationship goes bad and the corals have to expel the seaweeds or they will die. The problem is that a bleached coral is a starving coral, so if the temperature stays high for a while, the coral starves to death. 5.4 metres: highest likely sea level rise by 2300, if global carbon emissions are not cut. 653bn tonnes: average ice melted in Greenland, Antarctica and mountain glaciers every year from 2006-2016, equivalent to 500 Olympic swimming pools every minute. 100-1,000 times: the increase in coastal flood damages expected in 2100 unless major adaptation efforts are made. 1.8 billion people: the number likely to be directly affected by sea level rise on low-lying coasts and melting glaciers in high mountain regions in 2050. 1,500bn tonnes: the carbon stored in permafrost, almost double all the carbon in the atmosphere. 7,000: the number of scientific articles considered by the 104 expert authors from 36 countries. Is bleaching the only impact of climate change?Acidification is also happening. Eventually, ocean acidity will reach levels that etch away exposed coral skeletons. They won’t be able to build strong skeletons, or won’t be able to calcify at all. How far and fast this will happen is one of the big unknowns. By 2100, it could cause massive disruption, not only to coral reefs, but to all sorts of creatures that make calcium carbonate shells: molluscs, crustaceans, plankton-like coccolithophores and foraminifera. These are prolific, widespread, economically important and ecologically crucial. What damage have you witnessed?In the Maldives, the mass coral bleaching and death in 2015/16 was brutal. With El Niňo, you see a wave of bleaching temperatures moving from east to west. You can see it coming and there is nothing you can do about it. It’s like a slow‑motion hurricane and you think oh my God, disaster is going to strike. When it hit the Maldives in 2016, it took out about two-thirds of the coral. On one beautiful reef where I dive, 99% of the coral died. That was so shocking, that it could be turned from this extraordinary vitality to something that looked like a concrete replica of a reef in a bad public aquarium in the space of a couple of months. We are now watching the reefs recover, but the problem for coral reefs is that the spaces between impacts are getting shorter and the extent and severity seems to be getting bigger. You say the Gulf states are locked in a “gigantic pissing contest” over coastal development…It’s horrible in the Gulf and has been for a long time. I fear there is no way of stopping it; there is too much money sloshing around. Every new development seems to want to thrust out further into the sea, but the nearest bit of shallow water habitat is the richest and it gets covered over. Along the Red Sea coast they have carved up the reef into marinas and filled it over to create new land. It’s a shocking and needless destruction of an immensely important asset, and nobody cares. The Great Barrier Reef is in bad shape too. What happened?The Australian government has walked away from its responsibility in tackling climate change. They are in thrall to the miners, particularly the coal miners. The government is in the pocket of industry, but so is the population. Many Australians have benefited from the mining industry. They’ve bought second homes on the coast and expensive boats, they can afford to take holidays overseas. It’s hard to rein that in. As people said in the election this year, climate change was on the ballot paper and climate change lost.  Some scientists experience “ecological grief” in their work. Have you?You feel it in your guts. It’s a visceral blow to your sense of where the world is going. You hope for the best, but when you see the worst happening it’s not easy. I’m a hardened optimist, but even cast-iron optimists cannot be optimistic about the future of corals. What keeps the despair at bay is seeing students going out into great positions, actively contributing to protecting the world and making it a better place. Have Greta Thunberg and Extinction Rebellion made a difference?She is motivating a huge number of people across the world to come together and tell their leaders that they need to act. We are seeing a willingness to take action on things like greenhouse gases that wasn’t there before and an urgency about it that is being thrust upon reluctant leaders. You can protest all you like without inconveniencing people and nothing happens, but when you start inconveniencing people the politicians wake up. What can we do for the reefs?There is no real possibility across much of the world of being able to maintain, restore, or recover the reefs to the condition they were in at the start of my career. But it is always worthwhile to protect them. A reef that has no living coral can still sustain a huge variety of other life. Climate change is the big unmanaged stress at the moment. To give reefs the best chance of survival, we need to alleviate all the stresses we can. We need to protect them from fishing, dredging and pollution, in particular nutrient and sediment pollution. And we need to prepare for the worst. That means thinking about global refuges where coral reefs may be able to re-establish themselves if the worst of the predictions come true. Ultimately, the only thing that will save coral reefs is greenhouse gas reductions. • Reef Life: An Underwater Memoir is published by Profile Books (£16.99).

"‘What is it about those melting glaciers and desperate polar bears that makes us want to look away?” the activist and author Naomi Klein asked in 2015. In her book This Changes Everything, she laid the blame on powerful global corporations and acquiescent governments, which both simultaneously underplay the scale of the climate emergency and exploit our collective sense of helplessness in the face of it. Since then, a new urgency has driven climate activism, most successfully in the disruptive protests of Extinction Rebellion. Can art, though, have a meaningful role in raising awareness of that urgency? A forthcoming exhibition, Meltdown: Visualising Climate Change, at the Horniman Museum in London sets out to answer that question in the affirmative. It focuses on the fate of the world’s glaciers through the prism of art, photography and film. “We are using art as a kind of seduction to draw people in, then shock them,” says photographer Simon Norfolk, one of the artists involved. Why glaciers, though? Norfolk points out that, while severe floods and forest fires are in some ways more dramatically visual, “they can leave you open to the charge of not being scientific”. Glaciers, on the other hand, are one of the key and irrefutable indicators of climate change. “Through photography and film, you can record over time the ways in which they are receding, and by how much,” he says. “Plus, they are just so visual.” The Lewis Glacier, Mt Kenya, 1963 (A), 2014. The image traces a line where the glacier’s front was in 1963 while showing where it is now. Using scientific maps and GPS, Norfolk marked out the older line using hidden flashlights. ‘I walked along the line dragging my burning stick, joining up the dots of the flashlights. It took about 20 minutes, which was hard work at altitude. The exposure for the mountain and the stars continues for the rest of the hour. I wanted it to be all in camera because climate change is surrounded by loons who will claim I faked it all.’ By way of illustration, his arresting image The Lewis Glacier, Mt Kenya, 1963 shows a line of fire snaking along the rocky slope of a once completely snow-covered mountain skirting close to some scattered wooden buildings. It is one of a series of photographs he made using long, slow exposures on a mounted camera to track him as he ran along a meandering line on the mountain holding a flaming torch. (You can see him collapse with altitude exhaustion in a short film documenting the making of the work shot by the Observer photographer Antonio Olmos.)  “I use old maps to trace the exact line where the front edge of the glacier existed in previous years,” he explains. “My starting point was 1963, the year I was born, and I have made similar images for selected years ever since. It is a way of photographing the absence of something, in this instance a few kilometres of ice that have disappeared in the intervening years.” The series won Norfolk a Sony World Photography award in 2015. Ice Cave, Vatnajökull, 2014. Richard Mosse used a large-format plate-film camera and infrared film to photograph the ice cave under the Vatnajökull glacier in Iceland. Glacier caves usually form when air enters where water flows underneath the ice, the warm air slowly creates melting and forms a cave from beneath. The dynamic process is becoming more unpredictable as the weather changes and cave access may become impossible in the future. Meltdown is curated by Project Pressure, an activist charity that, since 2008, has commissioned artists to work with climate scientists on often ambitious projects that highlight the earth’s increasingly unstable environment. Their partners and sponsors include Nasa, WGMS (World Glacier Monitoring Service), Hasselblad and the UN Climate Action Summit. “When we began in 2008, climate change was not high on the activist agenda in the way that it is now, but we understood the urgency,” says the founder of the project, Danish photographer Klaus Thymann. “For centuries, landscape has been one of the classic themes of great art, so it makes sense to use art as another means to make people aware of the climate emergency and hopefully help instigate institutional and behavioural changes.” From a purely artistic perspective, what is most interesting about the Meltdown exhibition is that, though it includes the work of a few documentary photographers, it is a reflection of the broad range of conceptual strategies being adopted by contemporary activist artists: from Richard Mosse, winner of last year’s prestigious Prix Pictet, to Noémie Goudal, a French artist whose photographic installations, a hybrid of the real and the created, are made in often elemental landscapes. Glacier 1, 2016, by Noemie Goudal. French conceptual artist Goudal is interested in the meeting of the organic and the manmade. This work was made on the Rhône glacier, where Goudal constructed a large-scale photographic installation printed on biodegradable paper that disintegrates in water. ‘All my work is about the fragility of the landscape,’ she says. For Meltdown, Mosse used a large-format plate camera to photograph an eerily beautiful ice cave underneath the Vatnajökull glacier in Iceland. It was formed by air entering beneath the ice cap, and, in Mosse’s blue-tinged prints, resembles a sci-fi landscape, all smooth curves and jagged icicles, made all the more unreal by his use of infrared film. Goudal specalises in elaborate interventions with the landscape. For this commission, she photographed the Rhône glacier in the Swiss Alps, before printing the results on large sheets of biodegradable paper. She then mounted the prints, which are 3.5 metres tall, on to plastic canvas using “a children’s glue that disintegrates on contact with water”. The prints were then suspended in front of the landscape she had photographed and, throughout a single day, she shot around a hundred frames of the disintegrating image. “I am primarily interested in the choreography of the landscape and how it moves and changes continually,” she says. “I want to alter our perception of it through images that show the organic and the artificial blending and clashing. In this instance, I kept on shooting until the scene reverted to the original landscape.” Mt Baker, 2014, by Peter Funch. Danish artist Funch uses old tourist postcards and historic photos as source material for his series Imperfect Atlas. In this case the images are re-creations of vintage postcards of Mount Baker [in Washington state, US] found on eBay ‘I located the positions from which the original postcard images had been made,’ he says, ‘and re-shot the glaciers from those positions to create comparative juxtapositions of then and now.’ I had assumed that Goudal’s disintegrating prints were a visual metaphor for the effects of global warming on the glacier, but she insists that her art “does not really fit into a discourse about environmental issues” and is more about the ways in which artists and scientists “observe and interpret” the environment. “Geology and astronomy are important elements in my work,” she says, “but, apart from this commission, there is really no big eco-subtext in the rest of my work.” Other artists have turned to the past to make sense of our present ecological dilemmas. Peter Funch uses vintage tourist postcards and historic images of Mount Rainier and Mount Baker in the North Cascades in Washington as raw material for his series Imperfect Atlas. Using maps and satellite images, he pinpointed the exact spot from which the original pictures were taken so that he could photograph today’s mountain glaciers from the same position. Funch also employed an old-fashioned technical process called RGB tricolour separation, in which red, green, and blue filters are used to create three separate monochrome images, which are then combined to make a single full-colour image. The process was invented in 1850, a decade after the first recorded evidence that the mountain glaciers were receding. As his work makes clear, even the earliest 19th-century photographs of glaciers were visual documents of their slow decline. Bone from 4000 BC, Switzerland, 2017: Adam Broomberg and Oliver Chanarin make photographic still lifes of the often perfectly preserved objects revealed by shrinking glaciers, such as this human bone which remained intact in the ice for thousands of years. “In the exhibition, we use glaciers as a symbol,” says Thymann. “But some of the work is about what makes a surprising story. The artists Broomberg and Chanarin photographed objects that were found inside the ice of melting glaciers. Simon and myself collaborated on Shroud, which uses photographs and film to portray the attempt to slow down the melting of the Rhône glacier by wrapping a vast section of it in a thermal blanket.” These images are desperate and deathly, like a Christo installation gone wrong. It turns out that the owners of a popular tourist attraction, an ice grotto, have spent 70,000 euros to try and preserve their site. These kinds of measures are symptomatic of what Thymann calls a kind of belated “adaptation anxiety” – “What are we going to do? How can we adapt to this?” Shroud, 2018, by Simon Norfolk and Klaus Thyman: in an attempt to arrest the melting of the ice at an ice-grotto tourist attraction at the Rhône Glacier, local Swiss entrepreneurs paid for it to be covered up with a thermal blanket. ‘We chose the title,’ says Norfolk, ‘because it looks like they have created a shroud for the glacier’s death.’ That, of course, is a crucial question at the heart of the exhibition – and our global climate emergency. As Norfolk points out: “It is the poorest, who caused the least amount of damage to the environment, that will suffer the most. The rich will build higher flood walls around the financial district in Manhattan, but what will happen to people in Bangladesh?” The point of Project Pressure is to create change though art. “This is not a time for helplessness or looking away,” says Thymann. “The mission is to use art to help accelerate change.” Norfolk nods his head in agreement. “It’s not about making another fancy photobook or beautiful exhibition, it’s about making trouble, starting arguments.” • Meltdown: Visualizing Climate Change is at the Horniman Museum, London, from 23 November to 12 January 2020"
"Cinemas around the world are now showing Finding Dory, the long awaited sequel to Disney and Pixar’s 2003 Finding Nemo. The film takes up the story of Dory, a much loved character from the first film, who embarks on a quest to be reunited with her family. We follow the animated blue tang as she leaps and flip flops from one watery environment to the next, apparently happy to be transported in a beaker of drinking water, a mop bucket or through connecting pipes in a public aquarium.  Along the way, Dory – who suffers from short term memory loss – manages to regain some of the lost memories of her past life with assistance from Nemo, his father Marlin and an octopus named Hank. In the run-up to the film’s opening in America, Finding Dory attracted media attention when questions were raised by conservationists, marine biologists and animal advocates about the potential for the film to trigger a craze for blue tang fish. The majority of marine aquarium species are still taken from the wild and, in the case of blue tang, the process of capture is harmful to both the fish and to coral reefs.  Finding Nemo led to a rapid growth in the trade of clownfish as pets which, in turn, contributed to the decline of wild populations. Reports suggested that the pet industry was expecting a similar growth in sales of blue tang and pet products following the release of Finding Dory. One response to concerns about the impacts of wild capture has been to initiate research into captive breeding programmes. For example, until very recently it was not thought possible to breed blue tang in captivity. But in late July 2016, an announcement from Rising Tide Conservation and University of Florida revealed that for the first time, blue tang had been successfully reared in captivity for 52 days. The press release noted that the six-year project to find an alternative to taking fish from the wild had backing from the SeaWorld-Busch Gardens Conservation Fund. Many will recall that SeaWorld’s profits and public image were irreparably damaged by the 2013 documentary film Blackfish; a story about an orca named Tilikum. SeaWorld’s investment in the Rising Tide initiative and involvement in the captive breeding of blue tang may be playing a role in the company’s efforts to rebrand itself as a conservation organisation rather than an entertainment corporation and theme park.  In this respect it is some years behind Disney, the company responsible for Finding Dory, under its subsidiary brand Pixar. Disney’s moves to reorient the brand’s green credentials involved the creation of DisneyNature in 2008, a semi-autonomous film unit dedicated to producing nature documentaries, which are usually slated for release on Earth Day, and a revised corporate sustainability strategy.  Disney’s efforts have been branded by some in the press as greenwashing. My own analysis of the release strategy of DisneyNature films is in accordance with this: the tensions between the company’s commitment to what it calls “environmentality”, its green rebranding and its drive for profits are untenable. For example, under pressure to address concerns about the impact of Finding Dory on blue tang, Disney Pixar released a downloadable guide to pet fish ownership. The guide is, however, difficult to find and the message that blue tang are not suited to life as a pet is completely overshadowed by the Disney marketing for the film and associated merchandise. Indeed, the messages reaching the public about blue tang are worrying. Media coverage of the breakthrough in raising this fish in captivity, even referring to them as “baby Dory”, celebrates the technological solution that will allow consumers to purchase a sustainable Dory. Consumer fears that they are contributing to destruction of blue tang populations and coral reef areas are appeased by the message that it’s business as usual in the pet trade when entertainment, science and commerce work together.  The fact that many blue tang had to die in the process of developing a captive bred fish, that blue tang are still unsuitable as pets, that once in captivity and even under good conditions their lifespans are shortened, and that far from being the cute memory-challenged character we see onscreen, blue tang have spines on their tails designed to inflict injuries on would-be attackers – all this is lost in the celebratory communication that sustainable Dorys are on their way. While we have yet to see if Finding Dory will have an impact on the trade in blue tang, the question over what degree of responsibility media companies should take for their representations of animals and their involvement in the promotion of animals as entertainment and pets remains. It has been surprisingly easy for media companies to continue to hide behind a thin veneer of greenwashing."
"When Market Forces, a small climate activist group, was singled out as the target of the government’s push to stop environmental campaigns that advocate boycotts of fossil-fuel companies, its leader was briefly taken aback but not disappointed. “You know you’re doing something right when the Morrison government tries to bring you down,” Julien Vincent, the group’s executive director and founder, says from its base in Melbourne. “It’s unpleasant, but it’s only happening because we are getting results.” From Vincent’s perspective, those results include the Commonwealth Bank and insurers QBE, Suncorp and IAG pledging they would soon no longer work with or underwrite developments that use thermal coal, and the group’s part in the campaign that frustrated attempts by Indian company Adani to find investors for its proposed Carmichael coalmine. In terms of winning the government’s attention, it is likely the results also included a recent profile in the Australian Financial Review, the newspaper of the business community. Under the headline “How activists pushed CBA out of coal in five years”, it talked up Market Forces’s successes and methods, including a deal-making meeting with the bank’s chairwoman, Catherine Livingstone. Coincidentally or not, the attorney general, Christian Porter, last week nominated Market Forces as a poster child “radical activist group” trying to impose its will on companies through coordinated harassment and threats of boycotts. Porter said it was “simply not OK” that mining and resources businesses were being targeted on ideological grounds by activists that wished them financial harm. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning It followed Scott Morrison telling the Queensland Resources Council that activists who campaigned for secondary boycotts against miners and small businesses that work with resources companies potentially posed a “more insidious threat” to jobs and the economy than street protests. How the government plans to deal with this remains unclear. Porter suggested the response would be urgent and broad, possibly including regulatory action aimed at investors who fund class actions. But in an interview with the ABC on Sunday, Matthew Canavan, the resources minister, suggested any change would be narrow, restricted to adjusting an existing competition law that outlaws secondary boycotts but exempts activities related to environmental and consumer protection. Canavan said there was a case for an environmental exemption, the question was whether it should be better defined. “All we are saying is ‘what are the appropriate exemptions to that law?’,” he said. Taking some of the power ... away from companies, governments and institutions and putting it back in the hands of individuals ... is tackling the inequity at the heart of the system. With the details in the wind, Morrison’s push has led to some confusion among Coalition MPs about what is proposed and how it will avoid impinging on freedom of expression, though none spoke publicly. The Business Council of Australia has backed the prime minister; legal academics have warned changes to reduce the influence of environmental campaigns could breach the constitution. Environmental and civil liberty groups noted the apparent hypocrisy in the government floating a secondary boycott ban given Canavan had urged his constituents to stop doing business with Westpac after it ruled out financing the Adani mine. On Sunday, Canavan said there was no hypocrisy – that the government was focused on actions targeting businesses in regional centres such as Mackay that supplied goods and services to mines. He said it was not interested in stopping campaigns against banks, which has been where Market Forces has done much of its work. As the Guardian revealed, global funds management giant Aberdeen Standard Investments, which controls assets worth more than £550bn, is among those that does not see a problem that needs addressing. It backed the role that groups such as Market Forces play. Bank bosses told a parliamentary inquiry they did not feel bullied by environment groups. In the case of the Commonwealth Bank, it believed engaging with activists had been to the institution’s benefit, helping to shape its thinking on environmental and social issues. All are considering the risk the climate crisis poses to financial security. While the Morrison government says little about climate risk, the country’s major financial institutions, including the Reserve Bank, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, have identified it as a clear and present threat. Market Forces sees itself in the same corner as those heavyweight bodies. Initially a one-man operation, it formed in 2013 as an offshoot of environment group Friends of the Earth. Having worked on a campaign at Greenpeace that helped stop the financing of a small brown coal plant in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley, Vincent saw potential in giving customers of banks, superannuation funds and other financial service providers information about how their money was being used. His message was not unique, but proved well-targeted: speak up about your concerns and, if you are not satisfied, take your money elsewhere. Adopting a mantra usually associated with groups from the right as a name was half-joke, half-serious point. As Vincent sees it, the role his organisation plays is a clearer expression of the free market at work than a government considering intervening to keep coal plants open longer. “The whole point of using the term Market Forces is recasting it and to say to people ‘you be the market force’,” the 38-year-old says. The group now employs 18 people, mostly at its Elizabeth Street headquarters in the Melbourne CBD but also in Sydney, Brisbane and, more recently, south-east Asia, where it sees a chance to build a foothold in markets still investing in coal-fired power. Friends of the Earth sits at the anti-capitalist end of the organised environment movement, but Vincent says Market Forces does not aim “to bring down capitalism or anything like that”. He says it is trying to combat what he believes are destructive and corrosive elements of capitalism. “I think taking some of the power and decision-making and influence away from companies, governments and institutions and putting it back in the hands of individuals whose capital is the reason banks can invest in the first place is tackling the inequity at the heart of the system,” he says. He claims it is having an impact. Nearly 90,000 people have this year visited a Market Forces webpage that compares different banks’ exposure to fossil fuels and encourages people to make an informed decision about where their money goes. “We can confidently say that it’s in the tens of thousands of people who have moved their accounts, but we long ago lost the ability to track that,” he says. The immediate backdrop to Morrison’s promised crackdown on environmental campaigns was the violent clash between police and protesters at an international mining and resources conference in Melbourne. Asked whether blockading a general interest mining conference risked damaging the movement’s anti-fossil fuel message and turning away potential supporters, Vincent is not critical of the protesters and says “we need Extinction Rebellion”. But he adds: “It’s essential that we are clear and focused on what the message is with any protest or campaign activity. The problem in this instance comes from coal, which needs to go.” He says it is too soon to say how the group will respond to the government, but emphasises that it is sometimes lost in political discussion that environment campaigns work only if they have public support. There is evidence that support for increased action to combat global heating may be strengthening, though the issue remains politically and culturally divisive. Hundreds of thousands of people marched in climate strikes in September and a recent Lowy Institute poll that found 64% of Australians rank climate change as the number one threat to the country’s national interest. Some support for change comes from within companies targeted by campaigners. Vincent points to the case of engineering firm GHD, where the ABC has reported there has been dissent from staff over the company’s work with Adani. He believes part of Market Forces’ role is to “give licence for that internal conversation”. “Ultimately, if we’re running campaigns that are not fair that will become obvious and they will fail,” Vincent says. “What we’ve often found is, when you give quiet Australians a voice, they tend to speak out against projects like the Adani mine.”"
"Each year, nearly 9,500 people die due to London’s air pollution. It’s one of the biggest challenges for the capital’s next mayor – literally a matter of life and death. The problem has been around for decades. In fact, this year marks the 60th anniversary of the Clean Air Act 1956, passed by parliament in response to London’s Great Smog of December 1952. London was well known for its “pea-souper” fogs, but when the “Great Smog” fell over the city the effects were unprecedented: 4,000 immediate deaths with a further 8,000 dying in the following weeks and months. The act aimed to control domestic sources of smoke pollution by introducing smokeless zones. In these areas, coal had to be ditched in favour of smokeless alternatives such as coke or charcoal, power stations were moved to rural areas and tall chimneys were built for industry to disperse pollutant at height. Air pollution in London is very different today, and yet the same health issues exist. Gone are the polluting factories and the coal burning and in its place are a newer breed of contaminants. One of the primary causes is the old favourite, the combustion engine. Diesel exhausts include carbon monoxide, nitrous oxides, and microscopic specs of “particulate matter”, the smaller fractions of which penetrate the deep lung and pass across into the blood stream.  All of the above are seriously bad for your health. Air pollution has been linked to cancer, asthma, stroke and heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and even dementia. The damage begins during a baby’s first weeks in the womb and continues across an entire lifetime through to old age.  Consequently, any air quality improvements made now will have long-lasting benefits. The effects aren’t distributed evenly, or randomly. Older people and adults with long-term conditions are particularly vulnerable, for instance, and improving air quality will help them to stay independent and well, easing the pressure on NHS and social services. Children are also particularly at risk, as their lungs are still developing. We know traffic-related air pollution causes asthma so, given London has more than a thousand schools close to busy roads it’s perhaps no surprise a recent poll found parents in the capital now see air pollution as the biggest health threat. It’s a social issue too, as pollution exacerbates inequality. Research shows exposure varies a great deal from place to place even within the city, and London’s low income households tend to be in more polluted areas while wealthier people live on leafy side streets. The capital’s next mayor will have the power to make dramatic improvements to London residents’ health. Looking over the manifestos of front runners Sadiq Khan (Labour) and Zac Goldsmith (Conservative), as well as Sian Berry (Green) and Caroline Pidgeon (Liberal Democrat), it’s clear there’s a lot of agreement.  Where they differ is in their methods of dealing with these important issues and the timing of their interventions.  The Greens would bring in a smart road-charging system, while the Lib Dems would ban diesel vehicles within the city centre by 2024. Goldsmith wants to retrofit all existing buses by 2020, while Berry wants to move the entire bus fleet to hybrid/electric by that year. Air pollution isn’t solely caused by transport, of course. Gas burning, often from domestic boilers, also adds to the problem and all candidates have ideas for reducing boiler emissions or boosting energy efficiency – Khan wants further investment in older homes, for instance.  Goldsmith’s pledge that all new homes will meet the zero carbon standard would actually revive a policy the current national government has scrapped.  Of course, you have to ask, are all these policies realistic? Will they be followed through? While air quality is only one of many issues in this election, it is an extremely important one. Five decades on from the Great Smog, we need another clean air revolution."

Share this...FacebookTwitterYesterday I wrote a post about the Rheinstetten weather station here.
At first I thought it was the one located at the local gliding airfield, but found it peculiar that siting was pretty bad – as Anthony Watts commented. This is not something that’s typical of Germans, who like to be precise with everything. But it was the only one I could find in the local area.
Moreover, the coordinates provided by the DWD German Weather Service placed the station several hundred meters away from the gliding airfield location. Something wasn’t adding up.
Then reader Tim Channon, who has a lot more experience using tools like Google Maps, Bing Maps and Google Earth than I do, pointed out that you have to be really careful using these tools because many of the images are old and outdated. It turned out that the station at the gliding field wasn’t the DWD station.
Thanks to Tim, who used Google Earth, we succeeded in finding the new, correct DWD Rheinstetten station. Here it is:

The new station location is indicated by the yellow thumb tack. The crappy glider airfield weather station, which I first thought was the DWD station, is to the right at the white building indicated by the white airplane symbol. Google Maps images are old and don’t show the new facility. But Google Earth does.
The photo below is a bird’s eye view of the new, correct station.

Image: Google Earth
I’m guessing the measurement station itself is located all the way on the bottom right corner of the photo, at the end of the footpath, which to me would make it quite well sited. Though I don’t know what kind of impact the agricultural activity could have on the readings.
In summary I learned a number of things in the search for the station. No. 1: Don’t expect Google maps to be up to date!
Now that this all straightened out, time to move on to other business. I’ll leave the weather station hunting to others.

"We very much welcome Bristol city council’s commitment to improving the city’s lethal air quality by banning all privately owned diesel vehicles from the inner city by 2021 (Bristol becomes first UK city to ban diesel cars to fight pollution, 6 November). Now local governments across the UK must follow suit and go one step further in a bid to tackle the impending climate emergency for current and future generations.  The climate crisis is the greatest environmental and health risk of the 21st century, and transport accounts for 26% of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions, with the main sources being petrol and diesel cars. Quick decarbonisation of the transport sector will require more than a ban on petrol and diesel vehicles, however. The upcoming general election provides political parties with an opportunity to develop ambitious plans to reduce car journeys, especially in cities, and curb polluting vehicles before 2040. Ahead of the election, we are asking the next government to commit to bold action on road transport emissions and to prioritise cleaner forms of travel, such as walking and cycling. This includes: sustained long-term investment in walking and cycling; a 20-minute neighbourhood planning principle for all cities and towns; helping more children walk, scoot and cycle for their school journey; and a UK-wide ban on pavement parking. Failure to do so will have dramatic implications on the health of our planet and future generations.James CleetonEngland director south at Sustrans, Bristol • Bristol wants to ban diesel cars from its centre.

"The private equity firm appointed by the government to manage as much as £400m in investment in electric car charging points has awarded millions of pounds to a company in which it holds a controlling financial interest. Zouk Capital is the largest shareholder in charge point builder Instavolt, having made an £18m investment in the company. Now Zouk has chosen Instavolt as the charge point fund’s first beneficiary, a decision criticised by the Labour party. The Conservative government announced its intention to establish a charging infrastructure investment fund in the autumn budget of 2017, amid plans to encourage drivers to choose electric cars, which emit lower or zero carbon dioxide . The £400m government-backed fund initially aims to deliver 3,000 additional rapid-charge points for electric cars, more than doubling the number of electric car charging points in the UK. However, the fund’s rollout, which hoped to match £200m in private-sector investment with public money, was delayed by almost two years, amid difficulties in recruiting an investment manager. The government finally awarded the mandate to manage the fund to Zouk Capitalin September. It also announced that the fund had raised the first £70m, with half provided by the government and half coming from Abu Dhabi-based renewables investor Masdar. Zouk declined to say exactly how much of the first £70m had gone to Instavolt. However, Samer Salty, Zouk’s founder and managing partner, said it was “less than 50%”. Salty expects to invest more of the fund into other companies by the end of the year. The government faced criticism from a Labour MP for allowing the arrangement. Rebecca Long-Bailey, Labour’s shadow business secretary, said the UK needed urgent and significant investment in charging infrastructure, rather than deals between private companies. She added that a future Labour government would invest £3.6bn in publicly owned charging infrastructure. The government said that Zouk’s choice of Instavolt allowed the fund to “put capital to work quickly”, and that an “independent fairness opinion” by accountancy firm PwC had been “positive”. The government and PwC declined to provide the opinion or its reasoning to the Guardian. A spokesperson for the The Infrastructure and Projects Authority, the government body in charge of major investments, said: “Instavolt has ambitious plans for rolling out well-needed rapid chargers across the UK, and has a strong track record in this. “The government has followed a transparent and due process in the selection of its fund manager for the charging infrastructure investment fund, and all investment decisions have been taken in line with industry best practice.” In payment for managing the fund, Zouk will receive a percentage of the assets under management, plus a significantly higher performance fee if the returns beat a benchmark. Salty declined to comment on the fees charged, but said it was lower than the “2% and 20%” model – 2% of the assets under management and 20% of the profits – common in the private equity and hedge fund industries. Zouk will wait for at least five years before trying to recoup its equity investment in Instavolt, either by finding a buyer or floating it on a stock market, Salty said. Salty said similar deals were common within private equity and there had been the “right transparency” throughout. The arrangement was made after “very extensive due diligence” by both Masdar and the government, he added. “There is a conflict of interest but conflicts are there to be managed,” Salty said. “They are constantly being managed across the board.” Zouk holds sole responsibility for deciding future investments from the fund, which could go to Instavolt or competitors. Instavolt was founded in November 2016 by energy industry executives Tim Payne and Adrian Pike with backing from Zouk. It has not yet made a profit. It lost £4.3m in the year to 31 March 2019, up from £3.2m the year before. Providing 3,000 charge points will represent a significant step up for Instavolt. The company only built its first charging station in September 2017, and has so far installed about 400."
"Eglwyswrw is a real place. This village in Wales is as long on rain as it is short on vowels. Last winter, it rained for 85 days in a row, just missing out on setting the British record.  There’s a reason why it is so wet: the prevailing winds carry moisture-laden air from the Atlantic onto the Welsh hills and as the air rises it cools, losing its ability to hold as much water vapour. The water vapour condenses and falls as sweet, refreshing rain – though I imagine the people of Eglwyswrw may have been employing somewhat different adjectives just recently. The point is that hills make rain – or to be more precise, hills can create the conditions which cause moisture in the air to condense and fall as rain. This insight has whetted the appetite of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Not content with the Burj Khalifa (the world’s tallest building) and the man-made islands of the Palm and the World, the UAE is now considering building its own mountain.  It’s seen as a way to provide the desert country with a steady supply of fresh water. The mountain would, in theory, force the region’s humid air to rise and cool, forming new clouds in an otherwise clear sky. Those clouds could be “seeded” with tiny particles around which water droplets would form and then fall as rain.  I was asked to comment on this development as I work on geoengineering – assessing proposed techniques to cool the climate by either removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere or reflecting a portion of the sun’s light back into space. Whether the UAE’s mountainous ambitions quite count as geoengineering is debatable – I would argue not (sorry, it’s too small-scale) – but the term is sufficiently recent to allow people to play Humpty Dumpty with it (“When I use a word,” Humpty Dumpty said, in rather a scornful tone, “it means just what I choose it to mean – neither more nor less.”) But even if the rainmaking mountain is not itself geoengineering, it still raises many of the same issues of ambition and hubris. To some people this proposal exemplifies the triumph of the human spirit over adverse environmental conditions, enabling the deserts to bloom. To others it is a manifestation of arrogance imposed on nature. Some will simply see the UAE proposal as a practical means to overcome climatic limitations. After all, central heating already enables people in cooler countries to live in far more comfort than their ancestors, even if the frugal option would be to pop on a few more layers instead. And there will be winners and losers. You’d hope that the winners would outnumber the losers, or the project wouldn’t go ahead. But even if the utilitarian calculus overall is positive, there will be some who don’t see the benefits of additional rainfall – and losers make more noise squealing than winners do in their contentment. The viewpoints you take are value judgements – and value judgements are not universally shared. Yet it may be possible to accommodate the differing viewpoints, provided the effects of the mountain are constrained within the territory of a nation. And even were the mountain to deprive a neighbouring country of its fair share of rain, some sort of compensation could be made to avert conflict. But the more transboundary the effects, the more complex the game of attribution and recompense becomes. A prolonged drought or a flash flood might be blamed on the mountain regardless of whether or not it is the cause. Could the UAE build such a mountain? The technical challenges would be daunting and the economic case may not stack up, but the key questions are around social acceptability. Do they have the right to so radically alter the landscape, or can such action be justified if that is what it takes to supply water to a parched land?  My guess is that Eglwyswrw will remain a real, really wet place and the UAE will remain a surreal, really dry place."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt the online Baseler Zeitung Swiss geologist Markus Häring writes that the claim “a drastic reduction in CO2 can prevent a warming of the climate has no scientific basis.”
Hat-tip DkS
Häring writes that he has a background in natural sciences and took it upon himself to examine the science that allegedly underpins the anthropogenic global warming theory. He finds that “CO2 has been unjustifiably vilinized“.
Upon analyzing the data, Häring concludes:
The statement made by the UN IPCC that an unstopped further development of man-made activities will lead with great certainty to a dangerous climate warming is a prognosis and not a substantiated fact. […] Whoever claims the opposite with sentences like ‘The science is settled’, puts his credibility as a scientist in doubt.”
Häring points out that too many of the conclusions made by climate science rely on prognoses for the future and not on actual observations. He writes:

Prognoses cannot be checked. Just how reliable prognoses are is demonstrated by the financial world, even though it works with more measureable facts and systems that can be better understood. Even more problematic is when prognoses are based on models that no longer agree with observations. The climate development of the last 15 years no longer agrees with the IPCC models. Here there is a need to explain why.”
Häring also describes how the bad climate science has led to foolish and destructive policy measures, such as biofuels, palm oil plantations and carbon sequestration. He writes, “The question of whether CO2 in the ground causes more damage than CO2 in the atmosphere needs to be asked.”
On blaming weather extremes on CO2-induced climate change, Häring says it’s cynical to even speculate on this. “Extreme events such as droughts and floods involving the deaths of thousands will continue with or without climate warming”.
He then explains that building infrastructure and taking measures to counter such events today makes much more sense than cutting back on CO2 in the hope that this will act as a solution 100 years down the road. In a nutshell he says that countries need development today, and not witchcraft to cure the possible ills of the year 2100.
It is not surprising that poor countries are hit harder by natural catastrophes than rich countries because they can’t afford any protective measures.”

"Algal biofuels are in trouble. This alternative fuel source could help reduce overall carbon emissions without taking land from food production, like many crop-based biofuels do. But several major companies including Shell and ExxonMobil are seemingly abandoning their investments in this environmentally friendly fuel. So why has this promising technology failed to deliver, and what could be done to save it? Algae are photosynthetic organisms related to plants that grow in water and produce energy from carbon dioxide and sunlight. Single-celled microalgae can be used to produce large amounts of fat, which can be converted into biodiesel, the most common form of biofuel. There are many possible ingredients for making biofuels, from corn to used cooking oil. But algae are particularly interesting because they can be grown rapidly and produce large amounts of fuel relative to the resources used to grow them (high productivity). In the last decade or so, vast amounts of money have been invested in the development of algae for biofuel production. This made sense because, ten years ago, there was a need to find alternatives to fossil fuels due to the high oil price and the increasing recognition that carbon emissions were causing climate change. Algal biofuels were touted as the answer to these twin problems, and huge investment followed. Unfortunately, things didn’t go quite to plan. Companies making algal biofuels struggled to retain their high productivity at a larger scale and found predators often contaminated their farms. They also found that the economics just didn’t make sense. Building the ponds in which to grow the algae and providing enough light and nutrients for them to grow proved too expensive, and to make matters worse the oil price has plummeted. But algae don’t just produce biofuels. In fact, algae are like microscopic factories producing all sorts of useful compounds that can be used to make an amazingly diverse range of products.  For example, algae can produce large amounts of omega-3 fatty acids, an important dietary supplement. This means it could be a sustainable, vegetarian source of omega-3, which is otherwise only available from eating fish or unappetising cod liver tablets. More generally, algae are excellent sources of vitamins, minerals and proteins, with species such as Chlorella and Spirulina commonly being consumed for their health benefits. Another useful product that can be made from algae is bioplastic. Regular plastic is a product of fossil fuels and takes an extremely long time to break down, which makes it very environmentally unfriendly. Bioplastic from algae can be produced with low carbon emissions, or even in a way that absorbs emissions. Their use could help prevent the build up of plastic in the environment. The diversity of these products may be the key to finally developing algal biofuels. Many are high-value chemicals, selling for a much higher price than biofuels. So by combining them with biodiesel production, we could subsidise the price of the fuel and offset the high costs of algal cultivation.  This concept, known as a “biorefinery”, is part of a new wave of algae research that aims to overcome the issues of the past decade or so. We already know that oil refineries produce plastics, fibres and lubricants as well as fuels. Now we are hoping to develop algal biorefineries in exactly the same way. To make this model cost-effective and sustainable, we would need to use waste sources of heat, carbon dioxide and nutrients to grow the algae. These are widely available from power plants, factories and water treatment plants and so could reduce some of the costs of growing algae. After making algal fuel, you’re left with lots of proteins, carbohydrates and other molecules. These can be converted into the kinds of products mentioned above, or used to produce biogas (another fuel source). This biogas can be sold or used at the biorefinery to produce heat for the algae, closing the loop and making the whole process more efficient. It’s easy to see how this process could be a way forward for sustainable, profitable biofuel from algae. In fact, there are companies already applying this concept to their work. In 2014 Sapphire Energy, one of the world’s largest algal biotechnology companies, announced that they were diversifying their work to include nutritional supplements as well as biofuels. This move towards biorefinery is becoming more common and many firms diversifying their product lines. Clearly, the algal biorefinery will not solve all the problems facing commercial algal cultivation today. There are still key issues facing the loss of yield at very large scales, and the contamination of algal cultures by predators that eat your crop of algae. These issues will only be solved by continued research efforts. However, biorefinery may well be the next step towards a future free from fossil fuels."
"Large parts of New South Wales have been in the grip of catastrophic fire weather this week as firefighters desperately work to save homes, properties and lives. But as firefighters try and beat back the bushfires, a familiar blame game began with critics pointing fingers at “greenies”, claiming they get in the way of hazard reduction efforts that might have reduced the size and scale of the disaster. “These are very tired and very old conspiracy theories that get a run after most major fires,” says Prof Ross Bradstock, the director of the centre for environmental risk management of bushfires at the University of Wollongong, who has been researching bushfires for 40 years. “They’ve been extensively dealt with in many inquiries.” The chief accuser is Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce who says “greens policy” gets in the way “of many of the practicalities of fighting a fire and managing it”. Among Joyce’s claims, made in several interviews this week, are that Greens policies have made hazard reduction activities more difficult. This claim, just to be clear, is about the policies of a party that has never been in government. Joyce also blamed the Greens for “paperwork” that made it harder to carry out hazard reduction activities. “It’s not burning because they burnt off, it’s burning because they didn’t burn off,” Joyce told SkyNews. According to Bradstock, Joyce’s claims are familiar but “without foundation.” “It’s simply conspiracy stuff. It’s an obvious attempt to deflect the conversation away from climate change.” A former NSW fire and rescue commissioner, Greg Mullins, has written this week that the hotter and drier conditions, and the higher fire danger ratings, were preventing agencies from carrying out prescribed burning. He said: “Blaming ‘greenies’ for stopping these important measures is a familiar, populist, but basically untrue claim.” Preparations for bushfire season are done outside the most dangerous periods using a suite of methods known as hazard reduction. “The fuel is the hazard, so it’s about reducing that fuel load to diminish the intensity of a subsequent wildfire,” Bradstock says. Methods include prescribed burning where authorities identify at-risk areas close to developments, or in areas known for being sites where large fires ignite, and “reduce the load” with controlled burning. In some areas, hazard reduction is carried out by removing trees and vegetation. Another method is to create fuel breaks, also known as fire breaks, where trees are cleared to prevent the spread of a fire to protect developments and infrastructure. This is also done routinely around power lines. It is activities like this which Joyce claims are being suppressed by bureaucracy. A spokesperson for the NSW Department of Planning, Industry and Environment has told Guardian Australia that the National Parks and Wildlife Service carried out hazard reduction activities across more than 139,000ha in 2018 and 2019. The NPWS had a hazard reduction target to treat 680,000ha of parks and reserves in the five years from 2011, which the spokesperson said it had exceeded. The spokesperson added: “Hazard reduction is just one way of preparing for bushfires – it doesn’t remove the threat of fire.” Bradstock says: “In New South Wales, hazard reduction work is governed by policies that are set by coordinating committee chaired by the Rural Fire Service. They bring together all players – with representatives from farmers, environment groups and governments. “Hazard reduction work has increased because of increased funding to the RFS and to national parks. There has been more carried out in recent years than in previous decades.” The Public Service Association has also attacked the NSW government for what it said was a “35% cut to fire-trained positions” in national parks. Its acting general secretary, Troy Wright, said on Tuesday: “It is the Nationals who hold the purse string. Rather than funding the NPWS properly so that they can undertake strategic reductions they have crippled them with massive budget cuts and devastating restructures.” The NSW environment minister, Matt Kean, told Guardian Australia that NPWS had 1,665 full time equivalent staff, a rise of 144 since 2017. Since 2011, Kean said the NSW government had increased the number of NPWS firefighters from 1,050 to 1,226. Some 400 NPWS staff were out fighting fires. He says: “They are risking their lives to keep the community safe. Many are fighting fires that are not on park, but to protect people and property.” He says NPWS undertakes 75% of all hazard reduction in the state, adding that last season, NPWS undertook 137,500 hectares of prescribed burns, which was above its target of 135,000 hectares. Bradstock says research “overwhelmingly” demonstrates that creating a 40- to 50-metre fuel break around a house can give it a much greater chance of surviving fires. He says property holders are largely free to carry out these activities themselves without needing to seek permits. “That vegetation clearance is one of the most effective things to do to mitigate risk.” Bradstock says there is often confusion around the term “backburning” which is only done while fires are burning and is not considered a hazard reduction activity. A separate fire is lit “back against the wind” to suppress the fuel load in the direction a bushfire is travelling, but firefighters are cautious as these fires can also get out of control when conditions are severe. There will always be trade-offs between budgets, the amount of hazard reduction that can be carried out, and the environmental and social impacts of burning or removing trees and vegetation. Bradstock says that no fire authority has an infinite budget and he says that in NSW, the hazard reduction work had reached “the limits of its practical capacity”. “Hazard reduction will play a role, but as the weather gets worse, our research shows its effectiveness diminishes and we will have to introduce other means – maybe more money to clear the edges around developments, but it comes back to return on investment.” He says authorities are also now having to contend with another reality – that prescribed burning creates smoke, “and we now know that bushfire smoke kills people”. He says hazard reduction burns close to major cities such as Sydney had limits because “we end up doing fuel reduction to save lives, but it can also be taking lives” though smoke inhalation. • Open thread: tell us how you’re affected by the fires"
"We’re taught that evolution is all about “survival of the fittest”. But that’s not always the case. In fact, sometimes evolution can be the result of a lucky animal finding “any port in a storm”. And the finding that Luzon, an island in the Philippines, has the greatest concentration of unique mammals in the world – even more than Madagascar – is the perfect example. Islands are often examples of an evolutionary free for all, where a newly-introduced species may find itself in the perfect situation, whether that’s a new and different type of habitat and resources or even a complete lack of competitors and predators. Being introduced to an island ecosystem can turn a rather mediocre mainland species into a weird and wonderful new creation.  Examples of species found on one island and nowhere else (known as island endemics) can be found almost anywhere we look. The lemurs on Madagascar are found nowhere else on Earth, the Galapagos islands are home to flightless cormorants and aquatic iguanas and there are even quirky examples of island species from across the British Isles such as the Scilly shrew or the Orkney vole.  However, islands are not just a melting pot for new species – they’re also responsible for some rather strange adaptations, often allowing species to develop physically in ways that we would never expect to see in their mainland counterparts. This is maybe best shown by the “island rule” which, when all the complicated bits are stripped away, means that small species become big and big species become small.  For proof of this, just look at the dwarf elephants which once lived in the Mediterranean or even dwarf humans in Indonesia. At the other end of the scale, consider how tortoises from Madagascar and Ecuador washed up in the Seychelles and the Galapagos respectively and thrived as giants. It seems islands are nature’s evolutionary laboratories, the places where natural selection runs wild. But even between islands, some are more spectacular than others. Scientists from the Field Museum in Chicago have just published a study where they looked for the world’s greatest concentration of unique mammal species. It turns out that Luzon, the largest island in the Philippines, holds this honourable prize. Their 15-year study concluded that out of 56 species of mammals (not including bats) on the island, a staggering 52 were found to be endemic. With 93% of its non-flying mammals found nowhere else on Earth, Luzon is a biological treasure trove. But if all islands are special for the development and emergence of new species, then what makes Luzon more special? The team puts it down to the island’s size – at more than 40,000 square miles, it’s larger than Cuba or Iceland – and because it has never been connected to the mainland.  With lots of space (in different habitats) and across lots of time, Luzon has given any colonising animals just the right ingredients to adapt and evolve into new species. For animals that swam across from other islands or were swept over on rafts of mangroves or palm trees, it was the perfect opportunity not only to adapt into new species themselves but then for these new species to diversify into yet more species.  Even within this one island, high, forest-covered mountains then acted as “sky islands” – separate ecosystems cut off from the land below, with different evolutionary pressures. This in turn increased the likelihood for even further species diversity. From unusual mice that mainly hunt and eat earthworms, to other rodents with long elegant whiskers stretching the entire length of their bodies, Luzon is an incredible example of island evolution. Sadly, the fragile nature of these ecosystems often means island species are often threatened with extinction. In the Galapagos, introduced goats outcompete tortoises for food, while snakes accidentally taken to Guam, where the birds had never seen a snake before, are destroying the fine balance of island ecosystems there. With pollution and hunting and the ever-increasing threat of climate change all also taking their toll, maybe nowhere are conservation efforts needed more than when dealing with unique island species."
"After 12 years of planning and testing, Solar Impulse has finally completed its epic voyage around the world. The solar-powered plane first set off from Abu Dhabi 16 months ago, and it has since travelled some 25,000 miles (40,000km) over 17 gruelling legs – all without using a single drop of fuel. Solar Impulse is no ordinary aircraft – it has the span of a Boeing 747 but weighs little more than a family car. Covering these huge carbon-fibre composite wings are more than 17,000 solar cells, which provide energy for its four propellers during the day, while also charging four lithium batteries which provide power during the night. To save weight, the unpressurised cabin has just enough room for one pilot, no bigger than the front of a typical car. For up to five days and nights the pilots, Andre Borschberg and Bertrand Piccard have to do everything in this confined space. Fly, eat, sleep (just 20 minutes at a time) and wash. In theory, Solar Impulse could fly continuously for many months, but the tiny cockpit means it must land to swap pilots after each leg. As part of their trip they have broken several world records including the longest continuous flight of any solo fixed wing aircraft – almost 118 hours. But after this epic voyage, the real question is what will be the legacy of Solar Impulse? Are we likely to see 747s with solar cells anytime soon? The short answer is unfortunately no.  Solar Impulse required all those solar cells and four batteries (weighing a quarter of the whole aircraft) just to power propellers that generate around 70 horsepower, similar to a family car. To put this in perspective, the engines on a Boeing 747 have the equivalent power of more than 1,000 cars. The number of solar cells and more importantly the number of batteries to generate and store this energy makes such a plane unfeasible with current technology. However, while a large-scale solar plane is unlikely to be seen, electric or hybrid electric planes have taken a step forward with the recent announcement of the NASA X-57 all-electric plane. Announced by NASA head Charles Bolden as the first of a new series of X-planes, this plane is powered by an array of 14 small propellers on the leading edge of the wing, promising a five-fold reduction in the energy required for a small plane to cruise at 175mph. Such a design would also mean significant reductions in the aircraft noise and pollution.  While the X-57 isn’t a large-scale commercial aircraft, the technology developed in the project could well make it into hybrid electric planes in the not too distant future, especially with the current rate of battery technology development. Solar Impulse’s most visible legacy is likely to be in the domestic power market, as any electric car or plane is only as clean as the power source that generates that electricity in the first place. Solar Impulse has helped to raise the profile of solar power and this is likely to make people consider how they can do their bit to use cleaner energy. This took a major step forward with the news that Tesla is soon to fully release its Powerwall rechargeable battery unit – a battery unit that charges using electricity generated from solar panels, which can then be used in the evening or when there has been too little sun. It has the potential to revolutionise both commercial and personal energy use. While there are other competitors the appeal of the Tesla brand is likely to take solar power to a level not seen before. The pioneering spirit of Borschberg and Piccard may see their legacy in electric planes or domestic solar energy, but perhaps its biggest influence will be on the minds of young people still unsure of their future. The world is crying out for more engineers and scientists, and projects such as Solar Impulse show how exciting science and engineering can be. In the same way that Apple’s iPad and Siri are a throw-back to the legacy of Star Trek, the planes we fly in 40 or 50 years may have their origin in projects like Solar Impulse."

"National Galleries Scotland (NGS) has become the latest arts organisation to end links to BP, citing its “responsibility to do all we can to address the climate emergency”. It said on Monday that the 2019 BP Portrait Award exhibition opening at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh on 7 December would be the last time it would take place there in its present form.  The announcement increases pressure on the National Portrait Gallery (NPG) in London to end one of the UK’s longest art prize sponsorships. NGS said in a statement: “At the National Galleries of Scotland we recognise that we have a responsibility to do all we can to address the climate emergency. For many people, the association of this competition with BP is seen as being at odds with that aim. “Therefore, after due consideration, the trustees of the National Galleries of Scotland have decided that this will be the last time that the galleries will host this exhibition in its present form.” The decision comes nearly four years after Tate and the Edinburgh international festival announced they were ending long-running sponsorship partnerships with the petroleum firm. Campaigners had hoped that would quickly lead to the termination of all BP’s arts sponsorship deals. That did not happen and regular protests continued at the big four recipients of BP money: the NPG, the British Museum, the Royal Opera House and the Royal Shakespeare Company. In October the RSC broke ranks and announced it was ending its deal with BP two years early, citing pressure from young people. BP expressed disappointment at that decision and said everyone needed to work together to achieve a low-carbon future. “Ironically, the increasing polarisation of debate, and attempts to exclude companies committed to making real progress, is exactly what is not needed,” it said. The NPG is due to host what would be the 31st BP Portrait Award next year, with the closing date for entries advertised as 11 December. It has been complicated because the NPG’s building will close for nearly three years from July, when it traditionally hosts the prize exhibition. Observers see that as an opportunity to end the sponsorship. The gallery said it was considering options for the prize."
"George Smiley finally gets his man at the end of John le Carré’s Karla trilogy, but is far from jubilant as the Soviet spymaster defects from East to West Berlin. Reminded by a colleague that he has won his cold war battle, Smiley replies: “Did I? Yes. Yes, well, I suppose I did.” Smiley’s world-weariness was notable by its absence when the west finally claimed victory in the cold war 30 years ago this week. The Berlin Wall was a symbol of oppression. Its demolition was a euphoric moment.  But everything was black and white back then. Freedom had triumphed over tyranny. Washington had defeated Moscow. The market would extend into parts of the world where it had been off limits. The power of a united Germany would be diluted by a new pan-European currency. Victory for a certain set of American-inspired principles meant ideological conflict was at an end. The demolition of the Berlin Wall marked not just the end of history, but the end of geography and the end of politics as well. That was the theory. But three decades on, Le Carré’s caution appears to be warranted.  Yes, there have been things to welcome. The liberation of eastern Europe is one. The lifting of well over a billion people out of abject poverty is another. New products that have enriched people’s lives, such as smartphones, are a third. The idea that everything about globalisation sucks simply replaces the fallacy that the market can solve everything with the fallacy that markets never work anywhere. That said, the key assumptions of late 1989 have been found wanting. To the extent that there was a golden age of globalisation, it lasted a mere dozen years, from the raising of the iron curtain to 2001, when China was admitted to the World Trade Organization. During that period, the former Soviet Union was given free-market shock treatment, India dialled back on protectionism, and Beijing put out the welcome mat for western multinationals. It seemed a win-win game: China attacked poverty by moving people from the country into better-paid jobs in the cities; consumers in the west found that imported TVs, clothes and toys became cheaper. What’s more, downward pressure on the cost of living meant interest rates fell as well, making it cheaper to get a mortgage. House prices spiralled, but inflation stayed low. Cracks eventually started to appear. For workers in the west, the cold war had offered two benefits. First, the existence of a rival to capitalism meant employers and governments had to offer higher wages and more generous welfare systems, or risk a popular backlash. Second, the fact that countries containing more than half the world’s population were off limits to the free market meant there was only limited scope for outsourcing jobs to countries where labour costs were considerably lower. These restraints were removed in the 1990s, with predictable results. A more aggressive approach was taken towards welfare, manufacturing jobs migrated from west to east, and any remaining controls on the movement of capital were removed. The 1990s saw the unlearning of the lessons of the 1930s, namely that uncaged finance was a dangerous beast, and that it was a good idea if workers could afford to buy the goods and services they were producing without sinking into debt. After a series of localised scares, the global financial system imploded in 2008. From the deep recession that followed there has been no meaningful recovery. Clearly, the world in 2019 is not the one envisaged in the heady days of 1989. For a start, it is not unipolar. Russia under Vladimir Putin is a more serious threat than the Soviet Union was in its dog days, under Mikhail Gorbachev. Most of the decline in poverty since 1990 has occurred in China, which operates a form of totalitarian capitalism to rival the free-market US model. Both variants seem to have lost their mojo: US-style capitalism cannot seem to tolerate even modest increases in interest rates; Chinese-style capitalism flounders in the absence of state investment and easy credit. Instead of the rugged free market, we have zombie capitalism. A decade of flatlining living standards has made voters far more questioning about the societies they live in. When they hear politicians say that globalisation is an irresistible force that cannot be reversed, they ask: why? When they are told that artificial intelligence will revolutionise the world of work, they ask: for whose benefit? Those who took the sledgehammers to the Berlin Wall believed that the future would be better than the past, and for them it was. There are plenty of people in developing countries – especially in Asia – who think the same way today. But in the west, faith in progress is far less evident than it was before 2008. The upshot of all this is that free-market capitalism again faces an ideological challenge, and one that was not envisaged 30 years ago. The cold war was won because western capitalism proved better than communism at delivering goods for consumers. The events of 30 years ago created an ideological vacuum that is being filled not by Chinese-style capitalism but by environmentalism, a creed that does not accept the basic “more is better” tenet of capitalism. On the contrary, it says that adherence to this belief is killing the planet. Which is why it poses more of a threat than the real Karlas ever did. • Larry Elliott is a Guardian columnist"

Share this...FacebookTwitterWikipedia editor William Connelley displayed his true colors and confirmed the reason why Wikipedia is an unreliable source of information when it comes to climate science: extreme bias by editors.
Ironically, Mr. Revisionist himself complained yesterday in a reader comment at NTZ about one of his other comments being delayed here at NTZ, demanding to know why his childish taunting of distinguished climate scientist Lennart Bengtsson was being held up (spam filter).
Sorry, but I need to sleep too, and so sometimes reader comments caught in the filter have to wait till morning.
Naturally, we do not want the king of climate science revisionism to get the feeling that he himself is being censored, and so I’ve decided to upgrade his comment to a post as a gesture of good will:

Mr. Connelly of course is just being plain childish on the current issue. Lennart Bengtsson, former director of the prestigious Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI-M) in Hamburg, is hardly a meek man who has a history of being “someone who fades easily”. Rather he is someone who has a way of always standing out:
1986: Julius von Hann Gold Medal of the Austrian Society for Meteorology
1990: Körber Prize for European Science (together with Bert Bolin and Klaus Ferdinand Hasselmann)
1996: Milutin Milanković Medal of the European Geophysical Society (EGU)
1998: Environmental Prize of the Bundesstiftung Umwelt as a member of the working group Climate Research of the MPI-M
2005: Descartes-Prize as a member of the CECA (climate and environmental change in the Arctic) working group (together with Leonid Bobylew and Ola M. Johannessen)
2006: International Meteorological Organization (IMO) Prize of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO)
2007: Rossby Prize of the Swedish Geophysical Society (SGS)
2009: Alfred Wegener Medal
I believe we haven’t heard the last of Bengtsson by any means.
Finally, I’d be the last to hold back such a comment as that made by Connelley above because it clearly reveals and confirms everything we’ve always suspected of many in the alarmist camp and what is really behind Bengtsson’s resignation. Draw your own conclusions.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Global Warming Policy Foundation recently announced that Professor Fritz Vahrenholt is joining its Academic Advisory Council. Early this year prominent meteorologist Prof. Lennart Bengtsson had also announced his membership, but later resigned amid a backlash from activist warmist scientists.
The Council is composed of scientists, economists and other experts who provide the GWPF with timely scientific, economic and policy advice. It reviews and evaluates new GWPF reports and papers, explores future research projects and makes recommendations on issues related to climate research and policy. Other distinguished scientist members of the GWPF Academic Advisory Council include Robert Carter, Freeman Dyson, Christopher Essex, William Happer, Richard Lindzen, Ross McKitrick, Ian Plimer, Paul Reiter, Nir Shaviv, Henrik Svensmark, Richard Tol and others.
Professor Fritz Vahrenholt was one of the founders of the environmental movement in Germany. In the 1980s his bestseller Seveso ist überall (Seveso is everywhere) triggered a nationwide debate which led to a fundamental reorientation of the chemical industry towards sustainable development.
NTZ inquired with Prof Vahrenholt, asking why he had joined the GWPF Council:
I very much appreciate Lord Lawson who in the GWPF has surrounded himself with scientists who are not prepared to alter scientific findings to suit the political mainstream.”
On the political and academic pressures being applied on dissenters, Prof Vahrenolt wrote in his e-mail response:

The socio-political pressure on those who refuse to hop onto the bandwagon of alarmism is immense. Scientists who reject the simplistic formula of Prof. Schellnhuber (there is a linear relationship between CO2 and temperature change) must create a platform to act as a counter-weight against faulty conclusions in science and politics.”
When asked about where he sees global warming science discussion is heading.
The real climate development over the coming years will unleash the discourse over the dead-ends of climate policy.”
As Vahrenholt shows, dissenting platforms are indeed forming while the real data trends act to rapidly undermine mainstream climate science and global warming policy. It’s only a matter of time.
Dr Vahrenholt holds a PhD in chemistry and is Honorary Professor at the Department of Chemistry at the University of Hamburg. Since 1969 he has been a member of the Social Democratic Party (SPD). From 1976 until 1997 he served in several public positions with environmental agencies such as the Federal Environment Agency, the Hessian Ministry of Environment and as Deputy Environment Minister and Senator of the City of Hamburg. He then held top management positions in the renewable energy industry. Vahrenholt is a member of the Germany Academy of Technical Sciences and the Senate of the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft. His 2012 book The Neglected Sun sparked a broad public discussion in Germany about the dogmatism in climate science. He is currently the Chairman of the German Wildlife Trust.

"If there is one lesson of British politics of recent years, it is that politicians underestimate the public’s appetite for change at their peril. So the Tories may yet come to regret dedicating the weekend to promoting a dodgy dossier from the Conservative research department that grossly overstated Labour’s spending plans. The Conservatives claim that Labour’s plans will cost the public purse an additional £1.2tn during the next parliament. It is designed to generate “sticker shock” – to be a number that fixes in the public consciousness as a sign that Labour cannot be trusted with the economy. The dossier is not a serious attempt at public policy analysis but a political hatchet job with a calculator. No matter that Labour is yet to agree or publish its 2019 manifesto. The Tories are always happy to speculate wildly – especially when a pliant rightwing press are unwilling to pick apart their claims.  Meanwhile, the chancellor has promised that under a Conservative government public investment will not exceed 3% of national income. That is the current average of OECD countries (the Paris-based club of developed states) and below the G7 average of 3.5%. But investment is a good thing – it is the engine of economic growth – and so it is utterly bizarre to promise to artificially limit it. Yet after a decade of austerity, perhaps it is little surprise that the summit of ambition for the Tories is to be no better than average. In fact, Britain has suffered from chronic under-investment for the past four decades. Since Thatcher came to power in 1979, public investment has never exceeded the OECD average and, taken together with private investment, we lag well behind other countries. According to the Bank of England, nine-tenths of Britain’s economic growth comes from consumption, rather than investment, which is financed by rising household borrowing against inflated house prices. It is as unsustainable as it sounds. What’s more, most people know from their own experiences that Britain does not invest enough. We see it in crumbling hospitals and in antiquated railways, in cramped classrooms and congested roads. So while a figure like £1.2tn is so unfathomably large as to be meaningless, what it does do is signal to the public that Labour represents a decisive break with the past. When the public are hungry for real change, it might just prove to be an electoral asset. By its very nature, investment is a commitment to the future – and that future is imperilled by climate breakdown. There surely cannot be a stronger case for investment than the survival of the planet. Given the unprecedented scale of the crisis, it is absurd to think that what the country needs is yet more of the same. Indeed, sustaining the broken status quo as we hurtle towards disaster is a peculiar form of nihilistic radicalism. As we enter the 2020s, it is well past time to abandon the discredited orthodoxy of the 1980s. As we have seen this year, a whole new generation has awoken to politics as a result of the climate crisis – from Extinction Rebellion to the student climate strikers. These young people are unlikely to be won over by arguments that originate from an era before they were born, having come of age in the wake of the financial crisis that showed the old economic order had collapsed in all but name. They won’t be persuaded that inaction on the climate crisis is preferable to modest increases in marginal tax rates for the already well-off of their parents’ generation. And after all the blows to trust in politics in the 21st century – from the Iraq war to MPs’ expenses to austerity to tuition fees to the Brexit campaign – they certainly won’t be persuaded by a dodgy dossier peddled by newspapers that a declining number of their parents read. • Tom Kibasi is a writer and researcher on politics and economics.

"Rip currents are found along most coastlines, and where they form near popular beaches they can be deadly. The journalist Decca Aitkenhead has written movingly about how quickly life can change after her husband was swept out to sea by a rip current while rescuing their son. A rip current (sometimes incorrectly referred to as a rip tide) is a strong, narrow, fast-flowing current directed toward the sea that travels up to one to two metres per second. Rip currents usually develop close to the shoreline in very shallow water around a metre deep – just where beach bathers are usually found. For rip currents to form, there must be areas close to the beach where some waves break and other areas where they do not. Usually this is caused by sandbars on the seabed that form from the sediment deposited by waves and tides. Waves are encouraged to break when travelling through the shallower water over the sandbars, but they don’t break when travelling through the regions of deeper water between them.  As waves enter the shallow water they “shoal” – increase in height – and through their momentum they begin to force water towards the shoreline. Once the waves begin to break – so decrease in height – this momentum is reduced, opposed by another force known as a pressure gradient. This opposing pressure gradient causes the sea surface level to rise up by a few centimetres where the waves are breaking. As the surface level of the sea where the waves are breaking over the sandbars is slightly higher than where the waves are not breaking, a current forms from water that is essentially flowing “downhill” from where it is higher to where it is lower. These are called feeder currents, and where they meet between sandbars their flow turns away from the shore and becomes the strong rip current that travels through the deeper water. Rip currents are dangerous because they carry anything in the water seawards to deeper waters, and are not easy for swimmers to detect. In fact most bathers are not aware of the hazard they represent. A bather in shallow water is likely to drift with the feeder currents along the shore without noticing, at which point they may be carried into the main rip current. Very quickly, they are carried out to sea and out to depths where waves may break over their heads. At this point bathers frequently panic, often with tragic results. Those attempting to swim back towards the shore against the rip current will quickly tire as the rip will generally be too strong even for the most competent swimmer. While rip currents are caused by the action of waves they are also affected by the tides. Whether the tide is in or out will vary the depth of water over sandbars, effectively becoming a switch that turns wave breaking on and off as water depth rises and falls. In Britain’s south-west, for example, sandbars are frequently found around the shoreline at low tide. For several hours low water waves break over these bars and cause rip currents, but as the tide rises the water depth over the bars increases, the wave breaking stops, and the rips become inactive. This repeats over the twice-daily tidal cycle, and is also regulated by the fortnightly cycle of spring tides and neap tides, which gives rip currents a semi-regular pattern. Rip currents can be identified using complicated instrumentation, GPS-equipped drifter floats, or even by releasing coloured dye into the waters around the surf zone. But a simple trick to spot rip currents is to watch for the patterns of wave breaking visible from the shore. Seen from a high vantage point such as a cliff above a beach, the contrast of intense white foam where waves are breaking versus the flat, dark waters of the rip current creates a characteristic pattern. In fact the same concept is used to identify rip currents using automated camera systems.  It’s worth remembering though that, somewhat counter-intuitively, bathers should head towards the surf, and stay clear of the dark, flat water under which the fast currents lurk – even though it looks more inviting. And the safest beaches for bathers are those with a lifeguard, who are trained to recognise safe regions – their flagged areas and advice should always be followed."
"John McDonnell has announced a radical Labour plan to commit £400bn of investment to what he called the twin crises of the climate emergency and social deprivation, saying “future generations would never forgive us” if rapid action was not taken. The shadow chancellor used an election campaign speech in Liverpool to outline the economic priorities of the party, and said a Labour government would change the fiscal rules so borrowing for investment would be excluded from borrowing targets. McDonnell, who said his programme was “in the best tradition of British socialism” in the footsteps of Hugh Dalton and Gordon Brown, also promised to shift significant political decision-making power from London to the north. He said much of the planning for investment would be devolved, that part of the Treasury would be moved to the north of England and that his ministerial meetings would be held in other places as well as London. “What does this mean?” he said. “It means that the centre of political gravity is shifting away from London. It’s coming back home to the north.” Speaking soon after the chancellor, Sajid Javid, had announced that the Conservatives would revise their own fiscal rules to be able to spend an extra £20bn a year on infrastructure, McDonnell said far greater ambition was needed. As well as £250bn in investment over 10 years for a green transformation fund to invest in areas such as clean energy and home insulation, Labour also pledged £150bn over five years for what it billed as a new social transformation fund. This would be spent on infrastructure projects, such as schools, hospitals and social housing, to “begin the urgent task of repairing our social fabric that has been torn apart by the Tories”, McDonnell said. McDonnell urged voters to ignore Conservative pledges of more spending. “They treat us all with contempt,” he said. “They think people are stupid. That with Brexit on the agenda, they think we’ll all forget about the past 10 years and the prospect of the next five years if they get back.” The election was “a once-in-a-generation chance to get back on track”, he said, with the focus on the climate emergency and crumbling social infrastructure. Asked after the speech whether the amount pledged could spook money markets and lead to interest rate rises, McDonnell said: “Our scale of investment matches the scale of those emergencies that we now face, on climate change and socially. I’ll tell you, if we didn’t set off on that march, future generations would never forgive us.” McDonnell insisted that any Brexit deal negotiated by Labour would not affect the spending plans if it was eventually endorsed by a second referendum: “Whatever deal we seal will enable us to go ahead with our programme.” He said fully costed spending and investment plans would be spelled out in Labour’s manifesto, and that cheap and plentiful government borrowing made the programme realistic. “There’s no shortage at the moment of demand for government bonds across the world,” he said. “Our aim as a Labour government is to achieve what past Labour governments have aspired to: an irreversible shift in the balance of power and wealth in favour of working people. “That means change, real change. It means investment on a scale never seen before in this country, and certainly never seen before in the north and outside of London and the south-east. “To achieve that objective also requires therefore an irreversible shift in the centre of gravity in political decision-making, as well as investment in this country, from its location solely in London, to be relocated to the north and regions and nations of our country.” Spending would be guided by a national investment bank, with a series of regional arms, he said, with “decision-making devolved down to local communities”."

Share this...FacebookTwitterUPDATE: As reader Harry points out, Rossiter’s last entry was made in May 2013, and not 2014, as I mistakenly believed. Therefore Rossiter’s Wall Street Journal op-ed is a actually a (welcome) breach of his promise of never to discuss climate.
The good side of this is that hopefully he will speak out more in the future as well.
The original post has been modified (17 June 2014, 14:37 CET).
=====================================
Obviously the searing heat felt in the climate science debate was just too much for Caleb S. Rossiter to take last year.
At his blog on climate science he made his last entry on May 13, 2013 where he seemed to throw in the towel for good.
The criticism and hatred fired his way for his refusal to believe the AGW science must have been horrendous: He announced he was quitting the climate debate, citing exaggerations in the science that “make my blood boil” and scientists behaving “like lawyers inflaming a jury“.
What follows are some excerpts of his last entry at his climate blog:

May 13, 2013: My Last Piece on “Climate Change”: The Debate is finally over on “Global Warming — Because Nobody will Debate.”
I am deserting from the Climate War.  I will never write another climate article or give another climate talk, …. when I hear or see the sort of exaggerations and certainties about the dangers of heat-trapping gasses that tend to make my blood boil at their absurdity. …
This is real.  There is simply too little room for true debate, because the policy space is dominated by people who approach this issue not like scholars weighing evidence, but like lawyers inflaming a jury with suspect data and illogical and emotional arguments. …
The believers in human–induced catastrophic climate change, strongly represented among the liberal and radical left of American and international politics, have won the mainstream media and government battle for the conventional wisdom, but lost the war for policy change.

Read Rossiter’s last post here (May 13).
Obviously he views the problems in the climate science debate in the gravest terms. So it’s good he broke his promise and decided to marshal his considerable influence to counter the problem, i.e. not to choose sides but to communicate the real facts to the public.
I hope he continues speaking out because I would think he has the potential to make a serious difference on the issue. Right or left, the truth needs all the help it can get.

"Date palms are an iconic feature of landscapes in the Middle East and North Africa. These graceful trees are one of the oldest known fruit crops and have been cultivated for well over 5,000 years, providing sustenance for generations. To this day, dates have been an important international crop, cultivated in a wide belt from Pakistan to Tunisia and exported to markets across the world. The crops were especially prized by the ancient Sumerian cultures of Mesopotamia between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Once one of the earliest cradles of human civilisation, this region is now home to the sadly war-torn countries of Iraq and Syria.  As anybody who has eaten dates will know, the succulent fruits contain a large pit which is normally discarded, though traditionally in the Middle East they were collected and used for feeding livestock or making decorative beads.  But what if, rather than throw these pits away, we could use them to address a very modern issue, solving a serious problem that plagues people around the world and especially those in countries ravaged by conflict such as Iraq and Syria? What if we could use them to remove toxins from the environment?  Date seeds contain small but significant amounts of oil, which can be extracted by pressing. This oil used to be processed to make soap and other beauty products. However, in a joint venture with colleagues in Syria, we have now found a way to use the oil to remove dangerous toxins from the environment.  This finding came about through a unique international scientific collaboration between Dr Abdulsamie Hanano in Damascus, colleagues in France, and our group at the University of South Wales. Dr Hanano was interested in the problem of how to remove toxins, known as dioxins, that can accumulate in watercourses and soils due to industrial contamination or warfare. Dioxins are byproducts of industrial processes, and perhaps best known from the Vietnam War in the 1960s, when the US military sprayed huge amounts of a herbicide called “Agent Orange” over the countryside in order to remove vegetation.  Tragically, the Agent Orange formulation contained dioxins and many thousands of Vietnamese people were exposed to the toxin, resulting in a huge toll of illness and birth defects that is still with us today.  More widely, industrially produced dioxins are present in many areas around the world and enter human food chains via livestock, fish or drinking water from contaminated areas. Dioxins accumulate in the human body eventually leading to reproductive and developmental problems, damage to the immune system and cancer.  One of the biggest problems in trying to remove dioxins from the environment is their extreme insolubility in water, which means that they cannot simply be washed away. This is where Dr Hanano spotted a possible opportunity to use date seeds: he realised that the seed oil was encapsulated in very stable structures called lipid droplets. And, as we had shown previously, such lipid droplets are covered by a layer of specialised proteins that enable them to form highly stable emulsions. We speculated that these oily emulsions might attract the dioxins and remove them from the environment – in effect acting as “molecular magnets”. The first challenge was to get the lipid droplets out of the hard date seeds. This required the seeds to be soaked in water for two weeks to soften them, before the droplets could be extracted as a creamy emulsion. The next stage was to add this emulsion to a water/solvent mixture that contained the most common and most toxic dioxin, TCDD. The results were dramatic and exceeded all of our expectations: within a minute, almost all of the dioxins had been removed from the solution and into the lipid droplets.  This was the start of several months of intensive research by our respective labs in Syria, France and the UK. Because of the ongoing conflict in Syria, we were unable to meet in person, and our colleagues in Damascus suffered from severe shortages of equipment and supplies – not to mention the very real dangers of living and working in a war zone. Having shown a preliminary “proof of concept” in our recently published paper, we are now interested in practical applications of this new form of environmental biotechnology. One of Dr Hanano’s ideas is to use it on fish farms where the higher levels of dioxins in coastal waters (compared to the open oceans) can result in significant accumulations in fish and shellfish. The water could be passed through cartridges containing date seed lipid droplet emulsions in order to remove the dioxins, which can them be incinerated. In the short term, we hope the technology will be used to help clean up the huge numbers of contaminated sites in Syria created during the present conflict. Longer term, we are also interested in using this sort of bio-remediation to tackle other toxins across the world, proving that date palms are even more useful than our ancestors imagined."
"Global funds management giant Aberdeen Standard Investments has rejected prime minister’s Scott Morrison’s call for companies to listen to “quiet shareholders” as part of a comprehensive rebuff of the government’s attack on activist investors and the environmental movement. The UK’s biggest listed fund manager, which controls assets worth more than £550bn, also defended the role of environmental groups including Market Forces, which has been accused by the attorney general, Christian Porter, of pressuring companies through “widespread, co-ordinated harassment and threats of boycotts”.  Aberdeen’s intervention in Australian politics comes after bank bosses on Friday told a parliamentary inquiry they did not feel bullied by environmental groups and rejected the need for changes to the law foreshadowed by the Morrison government. In a speech to the Queensland Resources Council last Friday, Morrison attacked “an escalating trend towards a new form of secondary boycotts in this country” in which environmental groups “are targeting businesses and firms who provide goods or services to firms they don’t like, especially in the resources sector”. “Some of Australia’s largest businesses are now refusing to provide banking, insurance and consulting services to an increasing number of firms who just support through contracted services to the mining sector and the coal sector in particular, which is the nation’s second-largest export sector,” Morrison said “I think some of our largest corporations should listen and engage with their quiet shareholders, not just the noisy ones.” An Aberdeen spokeswoman said the company had a “critical role to play in financing the transition to a low-carbon economy, and the adaptation to climate change impacts through our products and investment decision”. “We see environmental, and particularly climate, risks as financially material to the businesses that we invest our clients’ money in and that is why it is a strong focus of our analysis,” she said. The company is among shareholders in BHP who delivered large votes in favour of a resolution proposed by activist investor group the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility that, if passed, would have forced the mining giant to quit the Minerals Council of Australia and other lobby groups with a track record inconsistent with the company’s position on the climate crisis. “Like many large asset owners and asset managers, we actively engage with companies and much of this engagement is done ‘quietly’, in that it is conducted privately between ASI and the company,” the spokeswoman said. “We believe this is generally the most effective way to influence change. However, we strongly believe that there is also a place for ‘noisy’ action where other forms of engagement have been ineffective, and where the issue of concern is not aligned with the company’s broader strategy. “Shareholders, noisy or quiet, are not faceless institutions. As shareholders, it is our responsibility to represent the interests of our clients in generating sustainable long-term returns.” She said Morrison’s remarks would have no effect on the group’s strategy. “Our engagement and investment activities are informed by our disciplined investment approach, and we will continue to engage with companies, quietly or otherwise, where we believe that company strategy does not adequately address material environmental, social and governance issues – including climate change,” she said. Asked about the government’s attack on Market Forces, which is associated with environment group Friends of the Earth, she said that protesting was “an effective and vital part of a democracy”. “At the end of the day, companies are commercial organisations that will not be influenced by activist groups unless they can see a commercial benefit,” she said. Under questioning from Labor’s treasury spokesman, Andrew Leigh, and the Greens deputy leader, Adam Bandt, at a parliamentary hearing on Friday, the Westpac chief executive, Brian Hartzer, and his counterpart at the Commonwealth bank, Matt Comyn, both denied they felt bullied by climate activists. Leigh took Hartzer to Westpac’s climate commitments, asking: “Is it fair to say you made these decisions in your own business interests rather than being bullied into it?” “Yeah,” Hartzer replied. He said Westpac made its decisions after taking into consideration its role in society. “We do that independently,” he said. Asked if the law needed to be changed as foreshadowed by Morrison, he said: ‘No, but I’m not sure what’s specifically proposed there.” Bandt put it to Comyn that it didn’t sound like the CBA was being “bullied”. “Yes, that’s right,” Comyn said. He said that to his knowledge the bank had never asked the government to change the law because of campaigns people ran that affected its business. The Commonwealth Bank’s deputy chief executive, David Cohen, said that the bank’s “experience has been that engaging with some of the environmental groups has been to our benefit”. He said it had helped shape the bank’s thinking on environmental, social and governance issues. “I think that’s enriched our own thinking over time,” he said. Liberal backbencher Jason Falinski asked Comyn if the bank had been subjected to shareholder activism by groups that bought small parcels of shares in order to put motions or be disruptive. “One of the unique and positive features of the AGM is that people, regardless of their shareholding, are able to get up and ask questions of the chairman,” Comyn said. He said the number of questions on the environment had increased recently, mirroring wider debate in the community. “It’s not unreasonable and as I said in many ways positive that small shareholders are able to stand and ask questions of the board and management of their company,” he said."

 Part 3. Empires
 By Ed Caryl
After the cold snap of 8200 years ago, civilization really began to develop in the Middle East. Villages became towns. Towns developed into cities. Societies adopted formal rulers, religions, and the beginnings of social stratification. The first large temple structures date from much earlier, in eastern Turkey, even before the people building them had domesticated grain or animals, but there are no villages, towns, or cities associated with these structures.

Figure 1 is a diagram of the last 10,000 years. The graph resolution is 100 years. Many significant events are marked on the Greenland GISP2 Ice Core temperature plot. The Greenland and Antarctic ice core temperature records only indicate temperature trends in the surrounding seas, the sources of the snow-water. Global temperatures are represented more accurately by the sea level.
People and animals require fresh water, so the first villages began along the shorelines of the Persian Gulf, and the rivers and streams that ran into it, or at permanent springs. As the cooling at 8200 BP (Before Present) set in, it became dryer, and crops that depended on the monsoon rains began to fail. Irrigation became necessary. The development of irrigation required organization to build and maintain the infrastructure. Organization requires that someone be in charge. As more organization developed, more people could be fed, and more people were necessary to do the work. Villages became towns. Now, the towns were centered around temples. In Mesopotamia, each town had its own deity with its own temple, with dedicated attendants. Towns became cities. Town chiefs became Kings.
The period from 8200 BP to 5900 BP was the last period of the Neolithic, the last period before metal replaced stone for toolmaking. Pottery was in wide use.
In this period, beer was discovered. I say discovered, because beer happens naturally when bread is soaked in water and allowed to ferment. Good beer is just a refinement of that natural process. After a day working in the fields, liquid refreshment is a necessity. Drinking water can be easily contaminated and beer has advantages in that the alcohol kills off bacteria. Beer became a product of the temples. Beer became a civilizing influence.
As the population grew, cities became larger. Eridu was the first large city. Eventually, many cities grew along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. These are known now as the Sumerian civilization, named for the city of Sumer, but each of these cities had their own king, and there was no central ruler. This situation lasted through the period of the Holocene climate optimum, from 8400 years BP until 5900 years BP, a period of 2500 years. This time span is called the Ubaid period, named after one of the important cities.
The cooling and drying at 5900 years BP put an end to all this. The North African Pluvial ended. The Sahara and Arabian Deserts began to dry out. The drying was so sudden, it is now called the 5.9 KY event (kilo-years BP). In Saudi Arabia, settlements on the Persian Gulf coast died out and population dropped for a thousand years. In Egypt, people migrated from the Sahara into the Nile Valley. In Mesopotamia, this period is known as the Uruk period, again for an iconic city. Just before this period ended, during a warm peak, the first writing appeared as cuneiform pictographs. A bit later Egyptian hieroglyphics appeared. This was also the beginning of the Bronze age in the mid-east and the Mediterranean.
Sea levels had been falling for 500 years before the 5.9 KY event. At the low-stand in sea level, people in western England began populating the Somerset Levels. Islands emerged there that were easily defensible because of the surrounding swamps. These were connected to the mainland by some of the earliest “roads” or plank trackways. These were preserved because as the sea level rose again they were protected in oxygen-poor bogs.

The Uruk period ended with the Piora oscillation, 5200 years BP, another cold period, colder than the 5.9 KY event, but this time cold and wet. The Dead Sea rose 100 meters. There were floods on the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Cities were wiped out. This may also be the source of the Gilgamesh and Biblical flood stories. Other areas, like the Central Sahara, dried out even further. Climate change in Central Asia prompted a change in the domestic animal choice from cattle and sheep, to the horse, as a horse is better adapted to pawing away snow to get to forage in the winter. Glaciers in the alps advanced.
At this time upper and lower Egypt were two separate kingdoms. During the warm period of 5000 years BP, Egypt was unified by the first pharaoh of the First Dynasty. There is uncertainty about his name. It could have been Menes, or Narmer, or Hor-Aha. Confusing the issue, was the ancient practice of using a “Horus name” instead of a personal or nebty-name on monuments. Menes and Narmer, for instance, were likely the same person. This was the beginning of monument and temple building in Egypt.
In about 4700 BP, a cold period is recorded in the Greenland ice cores, and a seven-year drought and famine is recorded in Egypt in the reign of Djoser. Two hundred and fifty years later, as things warmed and improved, the great pyramids were constructed.
A cooling period and drought 4200 years ago lasted for two hundred years and the resulting series of famines pushed the Akkadian culture into collapse. This is known as the 4.2 KY event and it signaled the end of the Bronze Age in the Mediterranean. The Greek Dark Age followed. It was the end of the Old Kingdom in Egypt, and a period of major unrest throughout the region.
A warm period came after the 4.2 KY event 4000 years ago. Minoan civilization on Crete began to prosper. On Crete, the palace at Knossos was built 3900 years ago. By 3500 years ago, the Minoans were under pressure from the Mycenaean Greeks. Mycenae reached their height of power about 3200 years ago, their expansion was assisted by the destruction caused by the eruption of Thera/Santorini in 1628 BCE. The palace at Knossos was rebuilt after it was destroyed, not by Minoans, but by Mycenaean Greeks
There were four major volcanic events (VEI 7) in the Holocene that caused brief temperature drops that barely appear in the ice core records. I have used a one hundred year centered average on the available data, and the data itself barely resolves these events. The first was the collapse of Mount Mazama (Crater Lake) in what is now Oregon, USA, 7600 to 7900 years ago, just before Erdu was settled, the second was the collapse of Thera. Both events probably depressed global temperature by a degree or so for three to five years, the second causing recorded crop failures in China. The third was Mount Samalas (Lake Segara Anak) in Indonesia in 1257 AD. This collapse may have helped begin the Little Ice Age. The fourth was Tambora, also in Indonesia in 1815, following which we had the “year without a summer.
The generally warm period from 6000 years BP to 4200 years BP fostered the Bronze Age in the Fertile Crescent and the Mediterranean. This period saw the rise of empires in Mesopotamia and Egypt. When the tin required for making bronze ran low, the Iron Age began out of necessity. When this period came to a close, a reordering took place, driven by a cooling and arid climate.
History tells us that rainfall and water availability enables civilization, as well as warm temperatures. Warm temperatures and increased rainfall usually occur together. When it is cold, it is usually dry. Again, when it is warm we thrive, when it is cold we die.

"The email that appeared on Phil Jones’s computer screen in November 2009 was succinct. “Just a quick note to encourage you to shoot yourself in the head,” it said. “Don’t waste any more time. Do it today. It is truly the greatest contribution to mankind that you will ever make.” Nor was it very different from the other emails that were arriving in Jones’s inbox. Others described the climate scientist as the scum of the earth. Some authors promised to kill him themselves. Most of the messages were riddled with obscenities. All made troubling reading.  As to the cause of this outpouring of hatred, that was straightforward. Jones headed the University of East Anglia’s Climate Research Unit, from which a tranche of emails had just been hacked and made public. These, it was claimed, showed that he and fellow researchers were faking the evidence that suggested our planet was heating up dangerously. The affair was dubbed Climategate by those who deny the existence of global warming and it remains one of modern society’s most troubling affairs. Many observers believe it helped delay measures that might have slowed climate change and given humanity more time to cut atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, its key cause. Climategate marks its 10th anniversary this month – an opportune moment to reflect on just how serious was its impact on society, and to look at the effect it had on those who were trying to stop Earth from being ravaged by rising seas, spreading deserts, disappearing coral reefs and suffocating heat. At the time, climate-change deniers were desperate to find ways to undermine the idea that global warming was real, and as Jones’s unit had provided key data that supported this notion – by showing how land temperatures on Earth had been rising sharply in recent decades – his work was considered fair game. So they responded gleefully by ransacking his hacked emails for signs he may have been fiddling results and asserted, in blogs, they had found telltale signs. These claims were then picked up by media outlets hostile to global warming. “Scientist in climate cover-up told to quit” ran one headline. “Scientists broke law by hiding climate data”, claimed another. Jones was vilified. “Within a day or two reporters were outside my house, knocking on my neighbours’ doors, digging for dirt,” he recalls. “I got hundreds of abusive and threatening emails. I knew the accusations were nonsense. But as someone used to being in control I buckled at the loss of it. My health deteriorated. I found it difficult to sleep and eat. I was under intense, spiralling pressure and felt I was falling to pieces. Looking back I suppose I was having some kind of a nervous breakdown.” So what had Jones said in his emails to trigger these attacks? In one message Jones says he would be emailing a journal “to tell them I’m having nothing more to do with it until they rid themselves of this troublesome editor”. This was interpreted as being a bid to suppress academic criticism. “We’re choosing the periods to show warming,” he says in another email that seems to suggest he was fiddling his data. And then there was his remark that he was going to employ “Mike’s trick” to use data that would “hide the decline”. In other words, he was going to cover up data that showed the world was really cooling and was not warming, it was claimed. The Mike in question was Michael Mann, professor of atmospheric science at Penn State University, who had worked with Jones for years. His “trick” was no more than a simple technique to combine the records of temperatures measured directly by thermometer with estimates made from tree rings (which roughly reflect temperature variations). “In fact, the email was an entirely innocent and appropriate conversation between scientists,” Mann states in this week’s BBC Four documentary, Climategate: Science of a Scandal. He and Jones were merely trying to find appropriate ways of illustrating a graph of global temperature changes. This view was not shared by Sarah Palin: the former US vice-presidential candidate wrote a Washington Post op-ed article that claimed the emails “reveal that leading climate ‘experts’ … manipulated data to hide the decline in global temperatures”. Subsequent investigations by journalists showed these claims were unsupportable, however. Guardian writer Fred Pearce studied the leaked emails and produced a book, The Climate Files, from his research. “Have the Climategate revelations undermined the case that we are experiencing made-made climate change? Absolutely not,” says Pearce. “Nothing uncovered in the emails destroys the argument that humans are warming the planet.” Pearce was writing for the eco-friendly Guardian, but his views were supported by many others, such as Mike Hanlon, former science editor of the Daily Mail. “Scratch and sniff as we did, there was no smoking gun, no line that would show that there had been a conspiracy to fabricate a great untruth,” he said later. Thus, from the Guardian to the Daily Mail, the notion that Climategate represented “the worst scientific scandal of a generation” – as one UK newspaper had claimed – was found in the end to be unsupportable. This point is emphasised by Fiona Fox, head of the UK’s Science Media Centre. “British climate science was subjected to huge scrutiny by the world’s best journalists and it stood up to the test. If you look at where we are now in terms of public trust in climate science, it’s hard to sustain the argument that Climategate was fatally damaging to the field. “Climategate also tells us that front page rows about science are an opportunity as well as a threat and the scientists who stood up in that febrile environment and soundly defended science also did a great job. We need to remember that.” Several official UK reports on the affair also supported Jones. One inquiry – by Sir Muir Russell, a senior civil servant – specifically praised the “rigour and honesty” of Jones and his colleagues while another, chaired by Lord Oxburgh, found “no evidence of any deliberate scientific malpractice”. The only real criticism was the suggestion that the researchers had not always shown a “proper sense of openness” in dealing with data inquires. Jones and colleagues were also backed by the US Environmental Protection Agency which heavily criticised American politicians and energy groups who had tried to use the leaked emails to dismiss the risks facing our overheating world. These individuals had “routinely misunderstood or mis-characterised the scientific issues, drawn faulty conclusions, resorted to hyperbole, impugned the ethics of climate scientists in general and characterised actions as ‘falsifications’ and ‘manipulation’ with no basis or support,” said the agency. Other powerful support was provided by physicists at University of California, Berkeley, who decided to test if deniers had been right to question Jones’s temperature charts. Led by Professor Richard Muller and backed by funds that included a $150,000 grant from noted climate-crisis denial supporters, the Charles Koch Foundation – the team re-analysed more than 1.6bn land temperature measurements dating back to the 1800s – and came to exactly the same conclusions as Jones: the fairly level temperatures that had continued through the past few centuries began to spike sharply a few decades ago as atmosphere carbon levels rose. “Our biggest surprise was that the new results agreed so closely with warming values published previously,” said Muller. “This confirms these studies were done carefully and that potential biases identified by climate-change sceptics did not seriously affect their conclusions.” Such powerful endorsements might have been expected to end deniers’ claims about Climategate. However, they have continued since 2009 to accuse Jones and others of collusion and fraud. Former Times columnist and climate contrarian Matt Ridley is typical. The “scandal” showed scientists were “conspiring to ostracise sceptics, delete emails, game peer review and manipulate the presentation of data”, he wrote in 2017, ignoring the many reports and studies that in the interim have shown this was not the case. Note also that since Climategate we have had eight of the warmest years on record; carbon dioxide emissions have continued to rise inexorably; and Arctic sea ice levels in summer have reached record lows over the past decade. Occurrences of heavy rainfall and heatwaves have also increased dramatically. The world has continued to heat up dangerously. Yet humanity has done very little to tackle the crisis. And that raises a critical question: did Climategate play a role in this failure to act? Some observers believe it did and, as an illustration, point to the fate of the Copenhagen climate summit – organised under the UN framework convention on climate change – which took place only a few weeks after the leaking of the CRU’s emails. The Copenhagen summit is widely regarded as a failure. Instead of agreeing on a legally binding treaty to limit carbon emissions as hoped, delegates chose merely to “take note of” an accord drawn up by a core group of heads of state. So did the leaking of the Climategate emails have a pernicious influence there? Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, doubts it. “Essentially the conference was badly managed. Climategate had very little impact.” On the other hand, says Ward, climategate did damage public policy-making in the UK and in other western countries. “Rightwing politicians, allied with fossil fuel companies, used their influence to spread false claims about the emails and to argue against policies to cut fossil fuel use. That propaganda campaign still continues today.” The use of illegally hacked emails in Climategate also shows deniers will resort to all sorts of underhand methods to confuse the public, Ward added. “I am sure they would do the same again today – so scientists are going to have to remain vigilant and be ready to fight back at any time.” This point is backed by Mann, who has fought vociferously to defend climate science in the US. Although the past few years have seen a significant growth in the public’s belief that the world is heating dangerously, climate-change denial has not gone away. “Hard denial has evolved into something more pernicious,” he says. “Attention has been deflected from imposing policy solutions towards stressing that changes should be made in individual behaviour – people’s diet, methods of travel and other lifestyle choices. It is a classic industry manoeuvre: put the onus on individuals to change things and ignore the need to impose systemic solutions and make policy reforms. “Of course, individual action needs to be part of the battle, but not as a substitute for policy reform. It should be as an additional component. We must also be aware how the forces of denial are exploiting the lifestyle change movement to get supporters of action against climate change to argue with each other and engage in behavioural shaming. So yes, we will be vigilant in future.”"
"Australia’s response to climate change is one of the worst in the G20 with a lack of policy, reliance on fossil fuels and rising emissions leaving the country exposed “economically, politically and environmentally”, according to a new international report. Australia’s progress to meeting its already “unambitious” Paris climate targets was third worst, fossil fuel energy was on the rise and policies to tackle high transport emissions and deforestation were also among the worst across the G20 countries.  The Brown to Green report, now in its fifth year, takes stock of the performance of G20 countries on climate change adaptation and mitigation across key sectors, and in the finance sector. The chief executive of Climate Analytics, Bill Hare, an Australian co-author of the report, told Guardian Australia: “Australia is behind [on] climate action in nearly every dimension. Australia’s emissions are increasing and there’s virtually no policy in place to reduce them.” Some 14 non-governmental groups, thinktanks and research institutes compile the report, funded by the World Bank, the US-based ClimateWorks Foundation and Germany’s environment ministry. Across the G20, the report said, limiting global heating to 1.5C would cut negative impacts by 70%, compared with allowing global temperatures to rise by 3C. Currently, extreme weather events were costing G20 countries about US$142bn annually. While the report doesn’t provide an overall ranking, Australia appears consistently among the worst performers in the report’s analysis. India and Australia were the only two G20 countries that had not introduced, or were not considering, policies to price greenhouse gas emissions, the report said. Only South Korea and Canada were further away than Australia from meeting the pledges that formed their Paris climate commitments. On deforestation, the report said Australia was the only developed country that was a “deforestation hotspot”, but had no policies to tackle it. Australia was ranked third worst for transport emissions per capita, and the report found “Australia, in particular, lacking significant policy” in the transport sector. Per capita emissions from aviation were 53 times higher than India’s. Australia, along with Russia, had no policies to move away from petrol-powered cars, no policies to decarbonise the heavy-duty vehicle sector and no policies to shift people onto public transport, the report said. Australia, along with the US and Saudi Arabia, had high emissions from the building sector. Australia had no building codes covering renovation of older buildings. All this lack of action, Hare said, was leaving Australia and its people exposed on climate change “economically, politically and environmentally”. Hare told Guardian Australia: “The leadership of the country is effectively telling lies about their performance, and contradicting their own government’s information. “The country is led by politicians who in one way or another deny either the science or are de facto denying it, and actively and wilfully opposing or obstructing climate policies.” Referring to the current Liberal-led Coalition government, Hare said this was the same political party that had repealed climate legislation, such as the carbon pricing mechanism, and “since then has done all it can to undermine any level of action”. He said the country’s position was in contrast with its opportunities in renewable energy, which it had not exploited as fully as it could. “Australia has one of the best solar energy potential and wind potential in general of any of the G20 countries,” he said. “Australia is not transforming its energy system and is focused on building coal and gas, and has not paid any attention to the need to transition to a zero-carbon economy.”"
"This interesting film by the Australian environmentalist Damon Gameau is an optimistic guide to the workable “regenerative” community projects that can help combat climate change. He imagines the great things that could happen by 2040, when his daughter will be a young woman. Gameau is clearly concerned to move his rhetoric away from anything righteously angry or confrontational – he doesn’t, for example, insist on immediate veganism, just a progressive lessening of meat-eating – and gives us an easygoing can-do approach in which there is no great emphasis on sacrifice and not even any obvious sense of emergency.  Sometimes this gives the film a slightly naive apolitical flavour, with repeated, cutesy vox pops from kids about how they want the world to be a nicer place; and occasionally, the film itself treats its audiences like a class of primary schoolkids. But more often there is something likable and practical about what Gameau is proposing. He talks about solar power, and how it can enable householders and communities to donate or sell excess power to create micro-grids of electricity. He imagines a world in which car ownership will go the way of owning films on videocassette or DVD, and travel will be about leasing or using driverless electric cars and an expansion of public transport. He talks about new farming models that can capture or sequester carbon in the atmosphere and about new approaches to the cultivation of seaweed to promote marine biodiversity. In the larger sphere, he wonders aloud about greater education of women, which will mean their having fewer babies later, thus reducing pressure on resources. The focus on what individuals can do right now is attractive. • 2040 is released in the UK on 8 November."

"At this time of year in Europe, you may have noticed something in the air. 
Dust-laden winds blowing from the Sahara desert cause “seasonal haze episodes” that can even result in mud or “blood” rain.  In West Africa, which experiences haze episodes between November and March, the dust-laden trade wind is called the Harmattan and has important implications, not only for soil fertility but also radio communication, visibility at airports and in shipping lanes, and also on livelihoods – and health.  Dry skin and cracked lips are regular symptoms of exposure to the haze. But it presents more serious problems for asthmatics – and can lead to silicosis, a lung disease caused due to a high content of quartz in the dust. In some areas the dust blocks the sunlight enough to make temperatures drop significantly. Two regions have been identified as the sources of the Saharan dust: the Bodélé Depression in north-eastern Chad, which is part of the now dried up Lake Megachad – the most intense dust source in the world – and the Tibesti mountain region in northern Chad. Dust particles come from rocks in the Tibesti region and broken down by processes such as weathering, erosion and pulverisation. It has been estimated that 400m to 700m tons of dust is transported from the Sahara every year. And the north-easterly Harmattan wind carries this dust as far as Barbados and Miami between November and March. As much as 20% of it reaches the Amazon – and satellite data has been used to calculate that some 27.7m tons of dust are deposited over the Amazon basin, which plays a crucial role in fertilising the soil.  When the wind direction changes to south-westerly in early spring, the dust is carried across the Mediterranean as far as northern Europe and the UK. Natural mineral dust affects the climate, as well as fertilising aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Studies have shown that the dust is rich in phosphorus, which is the main source of nutrients for the Amazon. It also contains potassium and calcium. But to understand its full impact we also need to know the level of iron oxide minerals – and iron – within it.  Iron exists in two oxidation states in minerals: ferrous (Fe2+) and ferric (Fe3+). These are irons which have lost two or three electrons from their atoms. Ferrous iron is soluble and can be absorbed by plants whereas ferric iron is insoluble. Their relative abundance has implications for the fertility of the soils upon which the dust settles.  The bulk mineralogical composition of dust from the Bodélé Depression is quartz (around 75%). And using a Mössbauer spectrometer, the most powerful instrument for determining both ferric and ferrous irons and their ratios, I found that the Harmattan dust from the Bodélé basin contained three varieties of iron-bearing clay minerals that were all seriously deficient of the more desirable ferrous irons for healthy plant growth and had greater levels of highly-insoluble ferric irons.  The impact of this depends, of course, on the type of soil that the dust lands on. One study showed iron was helpful to maize farmers in northern Nigeria while a 2013 study showed that it was a threat to rice grown in several tropical savannah areas. But ultimately, a low ferrous content can still help fertilise soils because of its alkaline range – large amounts of Saharan dust on soils can improve more acidic soils whose pH is too low for plant growth, whereas more alkaline soils should benefit from the addition of iron. Depending on where they have come from, dust particles can range from as small as 0.7µm (microns) to 20µm. The ultra-fine nano-sized particles that are better absorbed by plants are blown further, across the Atlantic and particle sizes also decrease across the Mediterranean.  The Harmattan dust is blown over predominantly rural regions in West Africa, but the Saharan dust in Europe blows over regions of heavy industry and can mix with industrial pollutants. A particularly bad episode of pollution in the UK in 2014 was explained by other industrial and agricultural factors – not just the dust. And when the arrival of dust coincides with rainfall it can be deposited as mud, as happened in Istanbul, Turkey in 2010.  A report on the health effects of the Saharan dust in southern Europe showed that in Barcelona and Madrid, cardiac mortality during Sahara dust days was statistically significantly higher [pdf] compared with dust-free days. Similar trends were observed in Greece and Italy. The report called for further investigation into coarse particles and the mechanism by which Saharan dust increased mortality. Saharan dust that settles on the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean is also likely to be a significant contributor of iron to marine algae. When this algae sinks to the ocean floor, or is eaten by planktonic organisms, whose carbonate shells also sink, carbon dioxide is sequestered into sea floor sediments. The distribution of iron in the oceans is likely to be a way of trapping excess atmospheric CO2. 
On the one hand, global warming could increase winds and therefore dust production, but then more dust could enter the ocean, potentially providing a natural mitigator to those effects."

By Ed Caryl
Sea level data suffer from the same problem as temperature and other climate measures; there isn’t enough of it. Satellite sea level data only goes back twenty years, even less than the satellite temperature data. Fortunately, because the West was civilized by seafaring nations, we have some tide gauge records back into the 19th century for locations in Europe and a few locations around the world. These go back far enough that the chief source of error becomes not measurement accuracy or care in record keeping, but Post-Glacial Rebound (PGR) or Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA).
As described in Rebound, my last article, PGR for the Nordic countries, and other ports around the Baltic Sea, make sea level measurements in those ports a measure of PGR, not sea level. Fortunately, accurate GPS PGR measurements have been made for nearly all the tide gauges in the world, and these measurements can be used to correct the tide gauge sea level measurements.
Fifteen tide gauge records from around the world were downloaded from PSMSL Explorer, and one record from Amsterdam NAP. These were selected based on quality: (no quality red flags), length (over 100 years preferred), good continuity, low PGR, and low tectonic activity in the area. These were normalized to their average level in the period from 1960 to 1980, then corrected for PGR. The result is Figure 1.

Figure 1 is the normalized data from 16 quality long record tide gauges.
Figure 2 below is the average of the tide gauge data in Figure 1.

This is the average of 15 Mean Sea Level (MSL) records since 1958, 11 from 1948 to 1958, at least 10 since 1900, at least 7 from 1885, at least 5 since 1864, 4 since 1849, and 2 for most of the period since 1807.

Figure 3 is a chart from climatedata.info. This is presented as a validation of figure 2.
We see an indication here that sea level has been rising since about 1855 to 1860. Before that, sea level was flat or falling. Here is a chart showing trends in thirty-year intervals.

Figure 4 is chart of sea level trends since 1810 using the averaged data from figure 2.
The sea level trend was nearly flat in the whole of the 1800’s, trending up 0.4 mm/year in the first half of the century, then up by 0.9 mm/year in the last half, as the Little Ice Age ended in mid-century. In the whole of the 20th century the trend was up by less than 1.7 mm/year. All together, there has been a sea level rise of about 25 cm in the last 150 years, or about 10 inches. There the trend slowed during the cool 1950 to 1980 period, then increased to 2.25 mm/year in the warming years late in the century. The satellite record begins in the bottom of the cooling years of the Pinatubo volcanic eruption. That is why that record, combined with the artificial GIA/PGA 0.3 mm/year “correction” is listed in U of Colorado satellite data as having a 3.2 ± 0.4 mm/year trend.

Figure 5a, the sea level trend since 1890. Figure 5b, the sea level rise in the last 33 years.
The recent upward tick in 2012 and 2013 due to rebound from the 2011 La Niña is just two years long, and is not nearly as dramatic as several previous short increases and decreases in the record. These are all due to short periods of warming and cooling associated with El Niños, La Niñas, and volcanic events. The 1983 and 1992 El Chichon and Pinatubo volcanic cooling events are particularly obvious in Figure 5b.
We do have one good sea level record from before 1800. The Dutch have been very concerned about sea level for a very long time, as a third of their country is below it.

Figure 6 is a Huddestenen, named for Amsterdam Mayor Hudde, a marble block set in 1684, 2.67 meters above Amsterdam level.
After a severe flood in 1675, the mayor of Amsterdam decided that the only way to make sure dikes were high enough to prevent flooding was to know precisely where the tops of the dikes were relative to the normal high water mark. To that end, during the year 1683 to 1684, September to September, daily records were kept of the tide, and an average high water mark was calculated. Since that time records have been maintained and an almost continuous sea level record exists from 1700 to 1925. This record is called the “Normaal Amsterdams Peil” (NAP) or the Amsterdam Ordinance Datum sea level record. Here is that record, corrected for PGR (or GIA), normalized to and plotted with the average from Figure 2.

Figure 7 is 330 years of measured sea level data.
The sea level rise over the last 200 years, from 1807, is no more than 27 cm, or about 11 inches. In the 125 years before that, there was no rise at all.
So…what will happen in the future? If the cooling predicted by the adherents to the solar climate driver hypothesis comes to pass, then in the next thirty years we will get a hesitation in sea level rise similar to the 1950 to 1980 period. Much of the easily melted ice stored during the Little Ice Age has melted already, so only the large ice reservoirs, Greenland and Antarctica, can contribute to sea level rise. Most of the rise from pumping aquifers and draining land-locked lakes has reached a limit. Thermosteric rise due to ocean heating has reached a limit due to increased evaporation from tropical seas. If all these are taken into account, sea level rise in the remainder of the the 21st century cannot exceed that in the last century, or about 1.7 mm/year, and perhaps less. This indicates a sea level rise by the year 2100 of less than 15 centimeters, or less than six inches.
In areas with glacial rebound, sea level rise will not be noticed at all. In areas with subsidence, the subsidence should be of concern. In the rare areas where neither is happening, normal dike and seawall maintenance and normal replacement of infrastructure will suffice. Coral Islands can grow upwards at 1 cm/year, so will have no problem with a sea level rise 1/6th of that. If the past is any indication of the future, there is little to fear from sea level rise.

"The hole in the ozone layer was first discovered in 1985 by scientists from the British Antarctic Survey, who described how ozone levels above the Antarctic were steadily dropping compared to the previous decade. This was quickly recognised as a severe environmental problem – and the culprit was identified as the unchecked use of chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs. Soon after, the Montreal Protocol banning the use of CFCs was signed and came into effect in 1989. Now, 27 years later, we have published evidence that shows the ozone hole is beginning to close.  CFCs are a family of non-toxic, non-flammable chemical compounds developed in the 1930s as a safe alternative to dangerous substances such as ammonia for refrigeration and spray can propellants. As CFCs were thought to be risk-free, their use grew enormously.  The chlorine atom is the component of CFCs that is responsible for ozone destruction. Very little chlorine exists naturally in the upper atmosphere as it generally emerges near Earth’s surface – for example from salt (sodium chloride, or NaCl) in sea spray – in water-soluble forms that are “washed out” of the atmosphere by snow and rain. CFCs on the other hand are not water soluble, so are extremely efficient at carrying chlorine high into the stratosphere at the level of the ozone layer. Once in the stratosphere, ultraviolet radiation breaks free the chlorine atom to destroy ozone and react with other substances.  The reason there is an ozone hole in the Antarctic is that it is the coldest place on Earth – it is so cold that clouds form in the Antarctic stratosphere. Those clouds provide surfaces on which the man-made chlorine from the CFC may go on to destroy ozone much more efficiently. Together with sunlight, this special chemistry is what makes springtime (late August to October) ozone depletion worse in the Antarctic. Our study, led by Professor Susan Solomon of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology alongside colleagues from the National Centre for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, shows that the rapid worldwide agreement to sign and implement the Montreal Protocol has paid off. Signed by all the countries in the world, it was the first universally ratified treaty in United Nations history.  We show that the average size of the ozone hole above Antarctica each September has shrunk from about 20m square kilometres to 16m square kilometres since 2000. There are other metrics that indicate the ozone layer is on the mend – such as observations that the ozone hole is opening about 10 days later than in 2000. These observations became even more meaningful through our study’s computer model simulations which meant we were able to attribute more than half of the hole’s shrinking to the reduction in CFCs.  While a trend showing the hole is shrinking is evident, the size has varied from year to year. This is in part due to the effects of volcanic eruptions. For example, the fourth-largest ozone hole occurred in October 2015 following the eruption of Calbuco volcano in Chile. The mechanism by which volcanic eruptions affect ozone levels is well-known: eruptions emit sulphur dioxide, which is converted into tiny airborne particles (aerosols) that enhance chemical conditions for chlorine to destroy ozone.  What is surprising here is that Calbuco was a relatively modest eruption – this underscores the need to monitor and describe such volcanic events carefully in order to account for natural variability in documenting the recovery of the ozone layer. Regardless of the annual ups and downs of the size of the ozone hole, it’s now clear that banning CFCs through the Montreal Protocol almost 30 years ago was the right decision. Because of swift international action, that decision is now bearing fruit and the Antarctic ozone hole is starting to heal – perhaps to close completely by as early as the 2050s. But even while we are on the way to resolving one environmental issue, the next is already upon us: man-made climate change. While the ozone hole is a relatively contained problem and involved only a single CFC-producing industry, the factors contributing to climate change involve many huge, established worldwide industries worth many trillions of dollars. The task ahead of us is great, nonetheless, tackling the ozone hole problem shows what can be achieved if we collectively set our minds to solving a problem."
"They are one of the most unwelcome signs of summer. Buzzing through beer gardens, attacking innocent picnics, wasps arrive ominously with a sting in their tails. Universally disliked, they are swatted, trapped and cursed. But would a wasp-free world really be a better place?  Despite their poor public image, wasps are incredibly important for the world’s economy and ecosystems. Without them, the planet would be pest-ridden to biblical proportions, with much reduced biodiversity. They are a natural asset of a world dominated by humans, providing us with free services that contribute to our economy, society and ecology.  Wasps, as we know, turn up everywhere. More than 110,000 species have been identified, and it is estimated there are still another 100,000 waiting to be discovered. One recent study described 186 new wasp species in one small corner of Costa Rican rainforest alone. In contrast there are only around 5,400 species of mammals, and 14,000 recorded species of ant. This huge and diverse assemblage belongs to the order Hymenoptera and is divided into two groups, the Parasitica and the Aculeata. Almost 80,000 species of wasps belong to the Parasitica group, which lay their eggs in or on their prey or plants using elongated tubular organs called ovipositors. The remaining 33,000 species are Aculeates, most of which are predators, and the ones whose ovipositors have been modified through evolution to form a sting.  Both parasitic and predatory wasps have a massive impact on the abundance of arthropods, the largest phylum in the animal kingdom, which includes spiders, mites, insects, and centipedes. They are right at the top of the invertebrate food chain. Through the regulation of both carnivorous and plant-feeding arthropod populations, wasps protect lower invertebrate species and plants. This regulation of populations is arguably their most important role, both ecologically and economically. Although the majority of wasps lead solitary lives, it is the 1,000 or so species of social wasps which make the biggest impression on insect populations. Social wasp queens share their nests with thousands of offspring workers, who raise upwards of 10,000 sibling larvae during the colony cycle. This means a single nest provides a whopping bang for buck in terms of ecosystem services, killing vast numbers of spiders, millipedes and crop-devouring insects.  Many social wasps are generalist predators too, which means they control populations of a wide range of species, but rarely wipe any single species out. This makes them an extremely useful, minimising the need for toxic pesticides, but unlikely to threaten prey biodiversity. It is not yet possible to accurately quantify their huge economic value in this regard, but their diet of agricultural pests such as caterpillars, aphids and whiteflies makes a massive contribution to global food security.  Wasps also play a crucial role in ecosystems as specialist pollinators. The relationship between figs and fig wasps is arguably the most interdependent pollination symbiosis known to man. Without one another, neither the fig nor fig wasp can complete their life-cycle – a textbook example of co-evolution which is estimated to have been ongoing for at least 60m years. Figs are keystone species in tropical regions worldwide – their fruit supports the diets of at least 1,274 mammals and birds. The extinction of fig wasps would therefore be catastrophic in tropical ecosystems. Almost 100 species of orchids are solely reliant on the action of wasps for pollination. The plants mimic the appearance and chemical profile of female wasps, tricking males into attempting to mate with them, so that as the male wasps attempt to copulate with the flower they are loaded with pollen which is then transferred to the next male-seducing orchid. Without the wasp, these orchids would be extinct.  Wasps also function as generalist pollinators, inadvertently transferring pollen between flowers they visit for nectar collection. One type even provide their larvae with pollen instead of insect prey. These “pollen-wasps” are considered to perform the same ecological roles as bees, pollinating a diverse array of plants.  Unfortunately, while bees are credited with contributing at least €100 billion a year to the global economy through their acts of pollination, the works of wasps in the same sector is often ignored. Even the wasps’ sting could have a positive impact on the human population. Medical researchers are exploring the potential use of biologically active molecules found within wasp venom for cancer therapy. A chemical found in the venom of the tropical social wasp Polybia paulista, has been shown to selectively destroy various types of cancerous cells.  Since they protect our crops, make ecosystems thrive, sustain fruit and flowers, and might help us fight disease, perhaps we should appreciate the wonderful work of wasps before we next swipe at them with a rolled up newspaper. They may be a nuisance on a sunny afternoon - but a world without wasps would be an ecological and economic disaster."

Share this...FacebookTwitterSpiegel science journalist Axel Bojanowski at the online Spiegel today features the controversy surrounding the mobbing of distinguished climate scientist Lennart Bengtsson.
The story covers the events leading up to Bengtsson’s resignation from the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF). Spiegel writes:
The consequences have shocked Bengtsson – and shaken science”.
Concerning the rejection of Bengtsson’s paper by the journal Environmental Research Letters last February, which according to the publisher Nicola Gulley was based on “scientific reasons”, Spiegel quotes Hans von Storch:
‘Scandalous’, Hans von Storch of the Helmholtz Centre in Geesthacht finds the resaoning behind it: The journal obviously did not go by the scientific norms, but rather political utility.”
The Spiegel article features comments from the other scientists, from the side accused of the bullying. According to Spiegel, NASA climate scientist Gavin Schmidt calls the accusations made by Bengtsson “ridiculous”.
Over all the Spiegel article hardly depicts a science that is settled by a consensus among the experts, but rather portrays one that is bitterly and heatedly disputed. Indeed Spiegel even cites Michael Mann‘s characterization of “Climate Wars”. Spiegel adds: “One Austrian professor even requested the death penalty for climate skeptics.
Clearly climate science is all dispute, and no consensus whatsoever.
The Bengtsson controversy prompts Spiegel to pose a series of questions:
Is their science suffering from peer pressure? Is the pressure from consensus too large? Is criticism being suppressed? At stake is the very credibility of the results of climate change. Can we still trust climate science?”

GWPF accused of being “pseudoscientific”
Spiegel also puts the spotlight on the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF), the skeptic organization that Bengtsson was pressured to resign from. Bojanowski calls it a “lobby group“, and quotes Swiss climatologist Reto Knutti of the ETH in Zurich who says: “Organisations like the’GWPF’ contribute to turning the scientific debate into a religious war – they spread pseudoscientific reports even though they are on a political mission.”
Spiegel also quotes Jochen Marotzke, director of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, who accuses the GWPF of cherry-picking science and “mentioning only arguments that serve the purpose.”
According to Spiegel, Myles Allen of the University of Oxford calls the GWPF an organization that pushes an “anti-science-agenda“. Even the “skeptical environmental scientist” Roger Pielke junior of the University of Colorado says the GWPF has a political agenda that is “dressed as science“. But Pielke adds that the “GWPF also pursues legitimate targets that a democracy needs to debate“.
“Shocking how colleagues reacted”
On the mobbing and attempted marginalization of Bengtsson specifically, Pielke also comments at Spiegel that he agrees the mobbing-type behavior is a problem in climate science. “My experience is in full agreement with the accusations made by Bengtsson.”
Spiegel writes that Bengtsson also has support, for example, from Heinrich Miller of the Alfred-Wegener-Institute: “I think it’s shocking how his colleagues reacted. Obviously there’s a prevailing disappointment that that a leading figure is making scientific doubt public.” Bojanowski writes that both sides are busily accusing the other of politicizing science.
Near the end, Spiegel writes of how much uncertainty a science can bear and of the lacking consensus.  Bojanowski cites Heinrich Miller:
Climate warming is understood as a dogma, and whoever expresses doubt is evil.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterEarly this week a German meteorologist tweeted that Germany had set a new record high for the date in the southern state of Baden Wurttemberg at a station called Rheinstetten. I was even told that the station was fairly new (and thus reliable?).
I’ve noticed that on hot days the Rheinstetten station always appeared to be at or near the top of the list for high temperatures, and so I decided to see if I could get more details about its actual siting to find out more on why this is so.
It turns out that the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) maintains the station and provides a good website with important station information. The simple map provided by the KIT site shows the station location (blue arrow) and that it is situated at the southwest end of a glider airfield.

Source: http://imkhp2.physik.uni-karlsruhe.de/~ws_forch/
From the map we see that it is at least in a rural location. An aerial satellite view from Google Maps gives us much more detail:

Aerial satellite view of Rheinstetten weather station (yellow circle).
The yellow circle in the photo above shows the suspected location of the station. Its location was deduced by examining the photos of the station available at the KIT site.
The next photo is one of the photos, and it shows that the station is the mast at the far end of the building at the corner. Note how the station is right up close to the metal building. Do metal buildings get hot out in the sun?

At the front of the photo we also see a pavestone surface, some 12 meters away from the station mast. Roads are located near the mast as well. They appear to be asphalt surface but had been heavily soiled by excavation works right before the satellite photo was made. They could be gravel as well – hard to tell. Another wintertime photo shows vehicles parked close to the mast.
The next photo shows a close-up of the measurement station right near the corner of the metal building.

Source: http://imkhp2.physik.uni-karlsruhe.de/~ws_forch/
The above photo appears to have been taken mid-morning in the summertime.  One could imagine that under certain conditions temperature reading could be easily corrupted by the metal building which acts as a heat source, especially in the afternoon. The KIT station website describes the station as follows:
The measurement station is located next to a living container at the gliding grounds of Rheinstetten. The glider grounds are approx. 2 km behind the southwest city limits of Karlsruhe. The surroundings are characterized by a mixture of agricultural land, fields, and some forest to the east. Overall the most optimum conditions prevail for meteorological measurements, especially for wind.”
And temperature? The site also gives information about the processing of recorded data.
The measured data are recorded on site at the gliding grounds using a PC. The computer connects to the recording system of the University of Karlsruhe and transmits the data every 10 minutes. The measured data are processed at the same intervals and displayed at this website.
On the graphics pay attention to the date and time given. In the event of an operational disruption, the data are not updated and so may be old. Longer periods of station inoperation can be read at the site “Statusmeldungen” [status reports]. There you will find information about operational disruptions and the transmitted data.”
Though the station is not horrendously sited, it appears the readings are corrupted and thus could be improved. If this site represents the general quality of Germany’s measurement network today, then we need to take Germany’s weather statistics with a grain of salt. Many German weather stations have been moved. And as we know from other countries, often these stations are moved to less than ideal locations, e.g. airports, next to parking lots and/or buildings.
I’m still trying to determine if this station is part of the German Weather Service (DWD) network. No other station seems to exist in the immediate area.

"Across New South Wales more than 575 schools will shut their doors on Tuesday, while aged care homes remain on high alert and animal shelters scramble to re-home pets as much of the state prepares for catastrophic fire conditions. The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, declared a week-long state of emergency on Monday in the wake of devastating fires on the state’s mid-north coast in which three people died and at least 150 homes were destroyed. While favourable conditions helped ease the bushfire threat on Monday, more than 60 bushfires continue to ravage the state and the Bureau of Meteorology has forecast “hot, dry and gusty winds” on Tuesday which “will generate very dangerous fire conditions across large parts of the state”. More than 1,300 firefighters have been mobilised and the chief of the defence force has ordered defence bases to provide any assistance requested by local firefighters. The severe fire danger prompted the Rural Fire Service to declare a catastrophic fire danger warning for large chunks of the state, including in the greater Sydney area, the Hunter, Illawarra and Shoalhaven regions. It is the first time the warning has been issued in greater Sydney and the first state of emergency since October 2013, when major bushfires killed two people and destroyed hundreds of homes in the state’s Blue Mountains region. Both the premier and the commissioner of the RFS, Shane Fitzsimmons, urged people living in the catastrophic areas to head for built-up areas, with Berejiklian urging people to “for heaven’s sake stay away from bushland”. “Fires are starting extremely quickly, easily and spreading very, very quickly,” Fitzsimmons told reporters on Monday. “We cannot guarantee a fire truck at every home, we cannot guarantee an aircraft will be overhead every time a fire is impacting on your property, we cannot guarantee that someone will knock on the door and give you a warning that there’s fires nearby, and we certainly cannot guarantee that despite our best efforts the technological tools available will deliver you a message in time.” A community newsletter released on Monday afternoon told Coffs Harbour and Bellingen residents in areas west of the Pacific highway to self-relocate to a major urban area like Coffs Harbour, Woolgoolga, Sawtell, Bellingen, Urunga and Dorrigo, but warned that some places east of the highway are not safe enough to take refuge. The warnings have put much of the state on high alert. Parents will be scrambling to find alternative arrangements for their children after the NSW government again increased the number of schools and Tafe campuses which will close on Tuesday. The full list of government and non-government schools and Tafe campuses now numbers more than 575. “The schools that are operational tomorrow have comprehensive emergency management plans in place which will be activated if required,” the department said. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Aged care providers have been put on notice that evacuations could be necessary. “In anticipation of hot, dry and windy conditions forecast for Tuesday 12 November, all of Anglicare’s staff are reviewing the evacuation plans and making sure all contact lists are up to date,” the Anglicare spokeswoman Tess Delbridge said. On the central coast, north of Sydney, the Gosford pound was calling for volunteers to help with short-term re-homing. “We are asking if there are any coasties who would be willing to collect a dog either this afternoon or tomorrow morning to crash at your home until Wednesday,” the organisation wrote on Facebook. When Guardian Australia called the shelter on Monday, a staff member said, “I’ve got about 30 people here wanting to look after dogs.”  Berejiklian said on Monday she had declared a state of emergency at the request of the RFS. “With catastrophic weather conditions predicted for this week, particularly Tuesday with hot weather and strong winds, I have decided to take the commissioner’s advice and make this declaration,” Berejiklian said. “Everybody has to assume the worst and we cannot allow complacency to creep in.” It comes after fires tore through the mid-north coast of NSW over the weekend, killing three people and leaving 100 more injured, including 20 firefighters. Ten of the more than 60 fires in NSW remained at watch and act level on Monday evening. Dael Allison, from the tiny NSW town of Bobin, north-west of Taree, said at least a dozen people she knew had lost their homes. “Bobin is shocking,” she says. “Bobin is devastated. There would be entire hillsides that wouldn’t have a tree standing.” Allison drove with her partner, Rick Haughton, and son from Port Stephens to Bobin on Sunday to check on friends and on their property, where they grow eucalypts. The main house is still standing but sheds, the original cottage they built and that their children spent the first years of their lives in, and most of the land are burned out. “We’ve had fires but I’ve never seen anything like this,” Allison said. “I’ve never seen fires that come right down to the water level of the creek. “I don’t know where fire crews are getting their water from. “The whole area is just on fire. At least a dozen people I know have lost houses. That would be nowhere near the final count.” The RFS inspector Ben Shepherd warned people outside of the catastrophic fire danger areas that other parts of NSW would still have “severe and extreme” dangers on Tuesday. “We need to ensure that people understand there is a risk in all bushland areas, stretching from Bega all the way to Byron, from the Victorian border to the Queensland border,” he said. In Queensland, more than 65 fires were burning across the state on Monday evening, with firefighters battling three watch and act level fires at: Cobraball near Yeppoon, Townson and Thornton in the Lockyer Valley, and Clumber. Meanwhile, a bushfire threatened lives and properties in Rockingham, Western Australian, and homes and businesses in Port Lincoln, South Australia were threatened by an out-of-control bushfire on the outskirts of the Eyre peninsula town."
"Andrea Leadsom, the new Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, faces an unenviable task: putting farmers out of business. Those that survive will rely on advanced pesticides and intensified, genetically-modified crops. After Brexit, the UK is expected to leave the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) whatever arrangement it eventually negotiates (both Norway and Switzerland, for example, have opted out).  At first glance, this seems like something to celebrate. Most agree that the CAP is not a force for the good, and opposition unites everyone from radical environmentalists such as George Monbiot to establishment-friendly free-market newspaper The Economist. CAP payments benefit mostly large agribusinesses and can lead to wasteful overproduction. On a larger scale, it distorts agricultural prices and contributes to global poverty. Yet direct payments, or subsidies, from the CAP provide more than half of the income of the average UK farmer. Without EU subsidies, up to 90% of UK farms would not survive. The referendum campaign created a huge divide among UK farmers. EU subsidies and regulations conflict with farmers’ traditionally conservative economic principles, and some hung their hopes on the UK rather than Brussels. Indeed, Cameron pledged continued support for farmers in the event of Brexit. However, it is almost guaranteed that, in the medium if not the short term, Leadsom will oversee a huge reduction in subsidies.  The UK government will likely expose its farmers to competition from abroad. As stated in a House of Commons report published just after the Brexit vote, “The UK has always made clear that we would like to move away from subsidies in the long run.” It now has the opportunity to do so.  Also, farming is a small part of the overall UK economy, and not of great strategic importance. This means that the government may use reduction of farm subsidies as a bargaining chip in trade negotiations, so it can get a better deal in its priority areas, such as financial services. A huge amount hangs in the balance for farmers as they discover their role in the new economic order. Brexit will likely lead to dramatic changes in which crops are viable, and cause a significant number of UK farms to cease operations. Livestock will be particularly hard-hit: without subsidies, many livestock farmers would actually have negative incomes. The reduction and streamlining of regulation post-Brexit will be greeted as a victory for many farmers and may make them more competitive. Complying with EU agricultural regulations puts a huge burden on farmers and the government has already identified some as unnecessary “red tape”. However, this same red tape, viewed from another angle, is beneficial environmental regulation, and many in the green movement embrace the EU’s greater risk-aversion. For example, the UK government has expressed frustration about the precautionary approach that the EU takes to new technologies, particularly new pesticides, while environmentalists generally support these bans. Also, the government and public in England are less averse to genetically-modified organisms than most other Europeans. This suggests that more GMOs will be approved and used in the UK, again angering many environmentalists and alienating anti-GMO Scotland. Furthermore, as farmers struggle to make up income lost from subsidies, they will need to pursue higher yields and any newly-approved advanced crop technologies, such as pesticides and GMOs, that promise profits. Counterbalancing this, more than half of the food exported from the UK goes to the EU, making it the most important market for British farmers. In exchange for market access, the UK will probably adopt some EU regulation. Overall, however, environmental campaigners are likely to be unhappy with the UK’s greater risk-taking. Some of the CAP’s most vocal critics are environmentalists. Among their critiques is the fact that the CAP has led to poor land management practices. For example, to qualify for rigid payment requirements, UK farmers have ploughed up wildlife-rich pastures. Both the UK government and the green movement want more emphasis on the environmental benefits that farmers can provide, rather than simply giving them money. This informed the position of most environmental campaigners ahead of the referendum: stay in the EU and try to reform the CAP, as the potential benefits are huge.  Yet leaving the EU, and its common agricultural policy, does provide an opportunity to improve upon its failures. The CAP should be replaced by simpler regulation that supports UK ecosystems and encourages farmers to look after their land. Over the coming months, this is precisely the message that Leadsom needs to hear."

Share this...FacebookTwitterWe keep hearing from alarmists that storms are becoming more violent and more frequent, and thus storm damage and deaths are rising – all because of man-made global WARMING. Unless we stop driving SUV’s, mankind in the future will be wiped out by global warming-precipitated bad weather. Hat-tip: DirkH.
However, the world’s largest re-insurer (and a very active proponent of global warming catastrophe), Munich Re, has just released its latest “catastrophe report“, which looks at the first half of 2014. In it there are some interesting admissions.
Economic losses plummet 56%
“The statistics for natural catastrophes for the first half of 2014 have been marked by pleasingly low levels of global claims. Overall economic losses of US$ 42bn and insured losses of US$ 17bn to the end of June were considerably below the average for the past ten years (US$ 95bn and US$ 25bn respectively). ”
That translates to an almost 56% drop in economic losses from natural catastrophes (not necessarily weather-related, e.g. earthquakes, volcanoes).
Deaths down eye-popping 95%!
“Thankfully, the number of deaths caused by natural catastrophes was also comparatively low. During the first half of the year, 2700 people died as a result of natural catastrophes, which was much lower than is normal during the first six months of a year (10-year average: 53,000). There were around 490 loss-relevant natural catastrophes.”
Only 2700 people died, normal is 53,000! That’s a drop of 95%. Despite the good news, the Munich Re insists there’s been “no change in the overall risk situation“, and so premiums unfortunately will have to stay high because global warming catastrophes are lurking.
“Snowstorms”, harsh “record winter” cause biggest losses!
Ironically the most damage was not caused by something we typically associate with global warming, but rather with global cooling!
“The effect of loss susceptibility on claims was clearly demonstrated by two snowstorms in Japan. These storms in February, which hit Tokyo and central Japan in particular, brought overall losses of around US$ 5bn and insured losses of more than US$ 2.5bn, and were the most costly natural catastrophe worldwide in the first half of the year. Snowfalls of up to a metre are very unusual in the affected provinces in Japan, though they would cause very few problems in other countries. There were numerous accidents, and the roofs of many halls and greenhouses collapsed under the weight of the snow.
Record North American winter, blizzards cause losses

“The record winter in North America also caused significant losses, with extremely cold temperatures and heavy snowfalls over a longer period in many parts of the USA and Canada. The losses from various blizzards totalled around US$ 3.4bn. The most costly snowstorm was in the first week of January: losses for this storm alone totalled US$ 2.5bn, of which US$ 1.7bn was insured. In many instances the harsh winter also had a heavy impact on business, as companies were forced to stop production. At the end of January, a blizzard brought the Atlanta metropolitan area almost to a standstill, even though only a few centimetres of snow had fallen. Snow and ice made the highways impassable, as there was a lack of snow-clearing equipment for a city unused to such conditions.”
Munich Re contorts to blame it on “climate change”
Of course for a company whose business plan is based on promoting global warming catastrophe, the unexpected harsh winter losses may lead to clients asking questions. The Munich Re then undergoes contortions to link the cold to global warming:
“According to Peter Höppe, Head of Munich Re’s Geo Risks Research Department, there is a link between the weather extremes in the northern hemisphere this winter. “These extremes – with heavy winter conditions in North America and Asia, and the extraordinarily mild winter across large parts of Europe – were due to significant and lengthy meanders in the jet stream”, said Höppe. “And scientists are still having intense debates about whether such sustained changes to patterns in the jet stream – and therefore also the frequency of such extreme and persistent weather conditions – might increase in the future due to climate change.”
When one scrutinizes the Munich report, little damage arises from warm events. The warm weather cited is restricted to Europe, which represents a tiny fraction of the world’s surface.
USA tornadoes down 25%
“The tornado season in the USA, which peaks from May to July, has been below average so far. The US weather agency NOAA recorded 721 tornadoes until end of June, in comparison to an average of 1,026 in the years 2005–2013.”
But hey! “Videos filmed on 17 June showed an extremely rare twin tornado in the State of Nebraska.” Wow! Aint that something! Must be global warming.
Munich Re sees no “super El Niño” this fall
“Over the rest of the year, weather events will probably see increasing impact from ENSO, a naturally occurring phenomenon that involves fluctuating ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific. “With the contrary effects of El Niño and La Niña, ENSO can influence weather patterns in many parts of the world”, said Höppe. “It currently looks as though a moderate El Niño will develop by the autumn, with warm water from the South Pacific moving from west to east, thus shifting wind systems and precipitation across the Pacific basin.”
La Niña prognosis for next year…hurricanes!
“Hurricane activity in the northern Atlantic normally decreases during El Niño phases. The number of typhoons in the northwest Pacific usually increases, but they make landfall more rarely. Tornado activity increases in the USA. “This gives a different distribution of losses across regions. Globally, our loss database NatCatSERVICE records no significant differences in overall losses in moderate El Niño years when compared to neutral years, whereas losses are significantly lower in years with a strong El Niño”, said Höppe. The stronger the El Niño, the more likely it is that there will be a La Niña in the following year, when hurricane activity tends to increase.”

"After a month of football, Euro 2016 drew to a close with Portugal defeating France 1-0 in extra time to lift the famous trophy for the first time. But the final game was a turgid affair, and perhaps the image most likely to endure involved a rather unexpected participant.  As Cristiano Ronaldo sat in tears on the turf, the reality of his game-ending injury sinking in only 25 minutes into the game, a moth fluttered around his eye and settled on his forehead. This moth was one of thousands in the stadium, pictured in clouds on the pitch as the players warmed up, and being swept with brooms from advertising hoardings. What were they doing there? The bizarre spectacle appears to have been the result of a coming together of several exceptional circumstances. It is commonly known that moths display an extremely strong attraction to sources of artificial light, although we still don’t really know why. The stronger and brighter the light, the better – and this is our first exceptional circumstance.  Fully lit, the Stade de France shines like a beacon even amid the glow of La Ville Lumière. Worse yet, the format of the lighting – in a ring, facing inwards – means that once a moth finds itself inside the stadium, it would be near-impossible for it to escape the influence of the lights. But many football games have been played under floodlights at big stadiums, and this game began while it was still daylight. This brings us to our second exceptional circumstance, then – the stadium lights were left on overnight on the eve of the game, presumably to aid the ultra-tight security effort that has surrounded the whole tournament. The lights had a full night to attract as many moths as they could into the stadium. When fans and players began to arrive, those moths were nearing the end of their daytime slumber. Still, though, brightly lit stadia have held events on consecutive nights before without experiencing mothy visitations. So to find the third exceptional circumstance, we need to look more closely at the moths themselves. As the game unfolded, it became clear to those in the know that the vast majority of moths on display were representatives of a single species: Autographa gamma, the Silver Y – both names stemming from the γ-shaped marking on the wing. The Silver Y carries metallic patterns on its wing, like many other species in its sub-family, the Plusiinae, including the beautiful Gold Spot and my personal favourite species, the Burnished Brass.   Importantly for our investigation, these moths bear a remarkable similarity to another species recently making headlines, the cabbage-chomping Diamondback moth, which also migrate in huge numbers to UK shores.  Silver Ys make the journey annually from North Africa, travelling through France (including Paris) to breed in Britain. Scientists at Rothamsted Research found that in peak years they number almost a quarter of a billion, and up to four times that number return southwards in the autumn. By a twist of fate, the Euro 2016 final appears to have coincided with this year’s migrating Silver Ys reaching Paris on their northward journey. We know from several recent studies that the profusion of artificial light at night spells trouble, both for moths and the other organisms they interact with in the ecosystem. Moths have short lifespans – Silver Ys may spend as little as two weeks in their adult form after emerging from the cocoon – and in this time must complete their migration before finding a mate and a suitable location for their eggs. Time spent under the influence of a light is time wasted. With luck, organisers at the Stade de France will have the sense to leave the stadium lights off on Monday night. Returned to (relative) darkness, most of the stadium’s temporary lodgers will be able to escape the arena and continue their journey merrily northwards – perhaps, for some, to land on British soil within the coming days much to the excitement of moth lovers who, like me, eagerly await their arrival."
"The link between rising greenhouse gas emissions and increased bushfire risk is complex but, according to major science agencies, clear. Climate change does not create bushfires but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity. The Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk. Dry fuel load – the amount of forest and scrub available to burn – has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth. Dryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past. The year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above-average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 had the fifth-driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970. Australia recorded its hottest  month in January 2019, its third-hottest July and its hottest October day in some areas, among other temperature records."
"It’s survived! The UK’s oldest and most permanent patch of snow is safely buried under a duvet of fresh snow and will live to see another spring. Known as the Sphinx, this icy pocket situated in an isolated corrie on Britain’s third highest mountain, Braeriach, in the Scottish Cairngorms range, is thought to have melted only seven times in the past 300 years. Counting and measuring the pockets of snow that persist year-round is a passion for Iain Cameron. For 15 years, he and his team of volunteers have been tramping the highlands of Scotland, England and Wales, keeping an eye on snow patches. Their records are providing a valuable indicator of the climate crisis.  Having first melted completely in 1933, the Sphinx has become more vulnerable in recent years, failing to survive in both 2017 and 2018. But after a wild and gruelling walk, including a camp-out in a bothy, Cameron reports that about nine sq metres of Sphinx have made it through summer 2019. The story of the Sphinx is a highlight in an otherwise gloomy report, which shows accelerated disappearance of all snow patches and none surviving beyond 22 May in England and Wales this year."
"Last week the UN secretary general, António Guterres, called for an end to new coal-fired power plants. Many European countries including the UK and Germany are decreasing their dependence on coal, but this is not the case everywhere. Across Africa many people rely on standby diesel generators to supplement erratic electricity supplies, leading to local air pollution problems and high emissions of climate-heating carbon dioxide. Although Africa is in a unique position to leapfrog dependence on fossil fuels and utilise abundant renewable sources such as wind and solar, the continent is embarking on a massive expansion of fossil fuel electricity. More than 200 new power stations are planned, the majority of which will burn coal. Power ships – vast floating power stations, some burning highly polluting bunker oil – are already moored in Ghana, Sierra Leone and Mozambique.  African countries have little air quality legislation and poor enforcement. Without emission controls, a study led by the University of Leicester found, the air pollution from these new power plants and expanded fossil fuel use in transport could lead to an avoidable 48,000 early deaths each year by 2030. These are predicted to be mostly in South Africa, Malawi and Nigeria, where oil industry flares are already a major pollution source. "

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  (FAZ), Germany’s leading national political daily, has a commentary on the IPCC’s WG III report. It’s also online here.
On the front page AGW believer Joachim Müller-Jung comments:
The solution appears so simple – but collectively it is so difficult to achieve.”
He adds that meanwhile
Climate policy is now changing course. […] A global cooperation on stabilizing the climate is not going to happen.”
Never mind that Müller-Jung actually believes the IPCC’s already glaringly faulty crystal ball forecasts are going to come true if we don’t act. He sees a number of obstacles ahead in tackling the “climate problem” globally. He writes that coal and natural gas today are “so cheap that the ecological change to renewables will just have to wait” and that in respect to emission reductions “the IPCC has to acknowledge that rigid mandatory targets have little political value and are morally dubious.”
Müller-Jung sees no chance of a collective global agreement on reductions and that the best we can hope for are regional measures that take regional conditions into account. “Many climate activists have a hard time accepting that.”

"Films and TV shows keep depicting wild animals as fun and friendly characters, with human-like personalities. It’s better than representing them as evil monsters, of course, but sometimes films can have a bad influence on which animals become trendy to have as pets. The most recent example concerns the Disney animation Zootropolis (also titled Zootopia or even Zoomania depending on where you live) and the fennec fox, a small, cat-sized fox with large ears that it uses to keep cool in its native Sahara. In the film a fennec fox, named Finnick, appears in only a handful of scenes as a sidekick to one of the central characters, a red fox named Nick Wilde. Yet the character clearly made the most of his limited screen time. Following the movie’s release in China, there have been reports of huge demand for fennec foxes as pets despite their unsuitability for life as companion animals.  Though the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species currently lists the fennec fox as one of “least concern”, this could be a game-changer. The main threat to populations in North Africa is from trapping for sale to tourists and for exhibition purposes, and there is now speculation that the Chinese pet craze could have an impact on their numbers in the wild. There is good reason for this assumption, as this isn’t the first time pet-keeping trends have been influenced by blockbuster films or popular TV shows that have featured anthropomorphised animals or exotic species.  Large, unusual or hard-to-keep dog breeds have been given an onscreen makeover in movies such as Beethoven (Saint Bernards), Turner and Hooch (Dogue de Bordeaux) or the Harry Potter franchise (Neapolitan Mastiff). 101 Dalmatians portrayed the breed as cute, fun-loving family dogs but experts point out that the breed is in fact strong-minded, requires high levels of exercise and can be destructive. In 1997, a year after the film was released, rescue organisations in the US reported that the number of Dalmatians surrendered to shelters had more than doubled. It’s been a similar story recently for Alaskan Malamutes, Siberian Huskies and other wolf-like breeds after the inclusion of wolves and Northern Inuit Dogs in Game of Thrones and the Twilight movies. By 2014 the number of wolf-like dogs taken in by the UK Dogs Trust charity had tripled over four years. Owners found themselves unprepared for the realities of living with large, powerful breeds and their requirements for exercise, socialisation and mental stimulation. It’s not just dogs: sales of turtles and tortoises increased rapidly following the various Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movies. The charity American Tortoise Rescue estimated that the majority were eventually killed, flushed down toilets, or dumped.  Pet shops were inundated with requests for clown-fish after the release of Finding Nemo in 2003, despite the specialist needs and costs associated with caring for tropical reef fish. Harry Potter’s pet Hedwig also led to a substantial increase in the number of pet owls given up to sanctuaries. Chimpanzees have also suffered for decades due to their misrepresentation in popular media. The species is currently listed as endangered, and the illegal pet trade continues to be one of its major threats. The standard practice for acquiring chimpanzees from the wild is to kill the female chimp and take her baby.  Despite numerous film and television representations of chimps as cute, human-like clowns, they are wholly unsuitable as companion animals. Natural behaviour developed by around age five puts humans at risk of severe injury from aggression and biting. Many chimpanzees are given up to research laboratories; a lucky few find a place in specialist sanctuaries. The consequences of trends driven by film and television for many animals are both sad and alarming. The industries should certainly take some level of responsibility for their representations of animals and some have already done this, providing information about the species featured as fictional characters onscreen. However responsibility lies elsewhere too and there needs to be a wider conversation about the relationship humans have with animals in general. This discussion could begin with the acknowledgement that other animals are individual sentient beings with their own species-specific interests and needs. A radical change in human attitudes towards other species is long overdue."
"All the candidates for the 2016 London mayoral elections have talked about their ideas for dealing with the housing crisis, air pollution, congestion, terrorism and extremism. But what has often been forgotten about in the media coverage is that London also has a waste crisis. The capital is the worst performing region in England when it comes to household recycling. (Waste policy for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is devolved.) In 2015, the recycling rate in England as a whole was 44% – London was the only region with a rate below 40%. Out of 33 boroughs, 25 have household recycling rates between 20% and 40%. This means that, as far as the capital’s waste is concerned, more is sent to landfill or is incinerated, compared to other English regions. There is no obvious reason why London should be doing particular badly compared to the rest of the country. Certainly there are reasons that are not specific to London but this can be put down to the differences between the household collection services offered by different local councils.  It is often perceived that housing density and income levels are the main influences on whether people recycle. It is more difficult to provide individual household collection services for people in flats, who may have to take their waste to a communal collection point. Those with a higher income are able to buy more, so may have more to throw away as a result.  However, in a review of research by the Greater London Authority (GLA), it was found that there is a clear correlation between deprivation in an area and lower recycling rates. Local councils may receive less in council tax from those in deprived areas and, with public funding cuts, there is less money to spend on other council services.  The GLA study shows that even deprivation does not have to be a barrier, if there is local political leadership and better negotiation of contracts with waste management companies. Contracts have been criticised as incentivising landfill and incineration over recycling.       Councils are required to provide a waste and recycling collections service. However, this comes in many forms, and my own research has found the general consensus is that the type of recycling collection – unsorted (or “co-mingled”) or sorted by households into different bins – does have an impact. Co-mingled collections are more convenient for households but the risk of contamination and rejection by recycling processing companies is higher. On top of that, since local authorities can use many different waste collection companies, it isn’t always clear what actually counts as recyclable. It also depends on whether councils offer rewards to motivate households or penalise households with fines for not disposing of waste properly. As Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler famously pointed out, decisions taken by local authorities can shape the environment that “nudges” human behaviour.  Two of the main mayoral candidates, Zac Goldsmith (Conservative) and Sian Berry (Green) have suggested working with local councils to develop a consistent or common minimum approach for recycling collection.  There is potentially already a mechanism to do this through the London Waste and Recycling Board, but this body does not have the power to set rules. Its funding comes from the government and the Greater London Assembly. Until 2010, it was chaired by Boris Johnson directly but since then he has been represented by an assembly member, and the current chair steps down this month. This means it is still up to local authorities to decide how to collect waste and they have resisted the idea of a single, London waste authority in the past.  It is perhaps for this reason that Sadiq Khan (Labour) does not think that a common standard for London is realistic. Khan does not elucidate anything more than a vague recognition of the need to meet European Union targets. Caroline Pidgeon, the Liberal Democrat candidate, wants to work with councils to set tougher targets. However, without further lawmaking powers, it isn’t clear how such non-binding targets would help, however tough they are. Yet if Goldsmith or Berry were to be elected they would have a democratic mandate for change, and would find themselves working with a Defra minister in Rory Stewart who is sympathetic to the idea of a unified waste policy. A solution for London’s recycling crisis may be possible – but don’t get your hopes up."
"Despite one or two scares along the way, the UK has not suffered a recession since the deep slump of 2008-09, but it came close to one this year. The economy contracted in the second quarter and for a while there were fears that it could do so again in the three months to September. Those fears have proved misplaced. The City expects the Office for National Statistics to announce growth of 0.3% tomorrow when it unveils its first estimate of third-quarter gross domestic product. The Bank of England has pencilled in a 0.4% expansion.  Either way, Boris Johnson is going to be spared the embarrassment of explaining to the voters why he has called a general election with the economy in recession. That’s not saying all that much, though. The Bank said that, over 2019, the economy is likely to grow by an average of 0.2% per quarter – half its rate of expansion in 2018. Investment has fallen in five of the past six quarters, leaving the economy increasingly dependent on consumer spending. And here, too, there are worrying signs. Consumers have started to save more, an indication they are anxious about the prospects for both the economy and their own finances. Britain is running on fumes. It is not just the GDP figures that will be released this week. Tuesday sees data for the labour market, Wednesday the latest on inflation levels and Thursday news about how much consumers are spending in the shops and online. By the end of the week we should have a reasonably clear picture of the current state of the economy. By that point, the political spin doctors will have gone into overdrive, with one set arguing that the figures show that Britain is booming and another saying it is in dire straits. The truth, as ever, is more nuanced. The good news for the government is that employment levels are high, unemployment is low, and earnings are rising more rapidly than prices. The bad news is that the labour market appears to have peaked in the summer, with gently rising unemployment leading to a slight fall in earnings growth. The story of past elections is that governments can win them – as happened in 1992 – with the economy struggling, and that they can lose them – as in 1997 – with the economy going gangbusters. What matters to voters is not so much whether the economy is growing by 0.3% or 0.4% but which party can craft the better narrative. Labour’s narrative is simple. Years of austerity are to blame for the fact that the economy is growing so sluggishly and that earnings – when adjusted for inflation – are still well below where they were when the last recession began in 2008. Time for a change is always a powerful electoral message, and after a lost decade of growth for wages and productivity, it should be even more powerful. The Conservatives will have a different take. They will point to the delay in delivering Brexit as the reason for the economic slowdown this year and promise that once the uncertainty is ended, a wave of pent-up investment will be unleashed. This is hyperbole. There will, as Mark Carney suggested last week, be some bounce-back in activity now that a no-deal Brexit is off the table, but it won’t be spectacular, and growth over the next few years is expected to be modest by pre-financial-crisis standards. That may not matter, though. The Conservative pitch to voters is that while the economy is perhaps not in the best of shapes, it would be doing a lot worse if Labour were in charge. Will it work? It did in 1992. Britain’s main political parties are entering the general election with – by popular demand – plans for the green economy at the centre of their campaigns. For the first time, polling by YouGov has put the climate crisis among the top three issues facing the country, behind Brexit and the NHS. But will the parties offer realistic environmental policies, or unworkable political one-upmanship? Labour is expected to follow the example of the Green party’s manifesto in bringing forward the government’s existing ambition to become carbon neutral by 2050. It’s an admirable ambition, with a hefty price tag. The Greens would spend £100bn a year to create a “net zero carbon” economy by 2030. Labour plans to spend £250bn on a green fund that would prop up new investments in clean energy and transport projects for a decade. Both are expected to raise taxes and government borrowing to support their plans. But kicking the UK’s carbon addiction will require far more than just cash. Pledges are the easy part, but forging a new path necessitates detailed planning. The government’s official climate adviser, the Committee on Climate Change, has warned that the earliest date by which the UK could meet a net zero carbon target without serious economic risks is 2050. Over a 30-year period, the country could plan meticulously and take careful investment decisions to lower the risk of wasting public money. But even this would require a step-change in ambition in a country that is on track to miss its 2030 climate targets by quite a margin. This is more than a fight between eco-warriors wary of wasting time and economic pragmatists wary of wasting money. A bungled eco- transition would cost Britain both. A green revolution is nothing without a very careful plan of attack. Shares in UK gambling firms have tanked since last week, when an influential group of MPs called for much stricter regulation of online casinos, including stake limits akin to those imposed on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs). In response the Betting and Gaming Council, a lobby group launched this month to replace the trade bodies that proved ineffective in their defence of FOBTs, wheeled out a five-point “safer gambling” plan. It would be cynical in the extreme to suggest that bookies concocted these proposals in response to the hit their shares took at the idea of stricter regulation. It is much more likely that the Betting and Gaming Council prepared this olive branch some time ago, proffering it in good time for the annual Responsible Gambling week (7-13 November). Even so, longtime industry observers are left distinctly unimpressed. Some see the safer gambling manifesto as an act of self-preservation, a minor sacrifice offered up to stave off something more draconian. Others point to elements of the plan that look like flotsam resurfaced from the wreckage of long-neglected commitments. It is certainly a far cry from the quiver of sharp-edged proposals put forward by the MPs. These included hard stake limits and new legislation to replace the Gambling Act, which they described as “analogue legislation in a digital age”. Labour, which drew up the existing act under Tony Blair, has already swung its weight behind a much tougher successor. Westminster sources say the Tory wonks currently writing their manifesto for the election are open to the idea too. A new Gambling Act would bring us full circle. The Betting and Gaming Council is chaired by Brigid Simmonds, once a key figure at lobby group Business in Sport and Leisure, which had a lot of input into the current act. She now faces becoming the mouthpiece of the industry as that legislation is torn to shreds."
"The “mountain chicken” frogs on the Caribbean island of Montserrat are in a perilous and seemingly irredeemable situation. It’s worth questioning whether attempted recovery is even worth the effort. After all, this species, one of the world’s largest frogs, will have to recover from just two individuals.  Hunting, habitat destruction from the 1995 volcanic eruption, and the arrival of the recent fatal fungal infection, Chytridiomycosis (or “chytrid”), has devastated these frogs. Rarely has any species naturally recovered once reduced to a few individuals, without some sort of human assistance. The Seychelles kestrel is one exception. Species declines are largely caused by human activity, whether that be through direct killing, destruction of natural habitats, or the introduction of species like cats, rats or the chytrid fungus.  Sadly, even in recent times, extinctions occur in plain sight. China’s last Yangtze River dolphins, a male and a female, were separately held captive without being bred. Australia’s Christmas Island pipistrelle bat was confirmed extinct, frustratingly, during delayed attempts to rescue the last individuals. Similar late efforts failed to rescue the Po’ouli, a unique forest bird on Maui, Hawaii.  The lack of action in these cases was caused by bureaucracy, aversion to risk, politics, misplaced priorities, and professional bias; human rather than biological factors. Thankfully, other examples demonstrate a better way. North America’s black-footed ferret was thought lost in the 1980s until several were discovered in Wyoming, which inspired a recovery programme. The California condor was reduced to 27 individuals sparking a controversial, but successful, captive-breeding initiative. In New Zealand, the Chatham Islands black robin was rescued from a single breeding pair.  On Mauritius, once the island of extinction, the local kestrel was considered a lost cause until the arrival in 1979 of Carl Jones, a biologist who has just been awarded the Indianapolis Prize – the “Nobel Prize” of conservation – in recognition of his outstanding work. These cases required pioneering innovations, such as double-clutching (removing eggs to encourage pairs to breed again), using more common species as adoptive parents, and training captive-bred animals for wild release. Leaders such as Don Merton, Tom Cade, Noel Snyder and Carl Jones shared ideas with like-minded colleagues across continents, fuelling knowledge and experimentation. Actually getting on with the work is important. For Jones, too many people “talk about conservation…but we’ve got to do it rather than talk about it”. Rare species are not just an interesting entry in the catalogue of life. They have a function in the natural world. Amphibians are important in controlling insects and other invertebrates. In Montserrat, for instance, some farmers have noticed increased levels of crop pests since the frogs disappeared. In practice, action first means setting short-term goals. For the mountain chicken frog, this involves moving the female into the male’s territory, building artificial nests, and protecting locations from threats.  The work must also pursue a long-term vision. A sustainable wild population of frogs means that captive-breeding, already undertaken in bio-secure facilities, is not the sole answer. Threats like chytrid need to be understood first to inspire possible solutions. The disease will not disappear just by increasing the numbers of frogs (though frog population is of course critical).  Fieldwork requires painful attention to detail, literally sitting with the animals to prevent disturbances, then monitoring offspring survival, assessing and carefully improving habitats, and moving individuals to new, safe locations. Conservationists need patience and determination to overcome disappointments. They must seek to understand changing circumstances, keep open to ideas and be willing to develop new approaches if things do not go well.  Fortunately conservation interventions can achieve extraordinary success. Carl Jones has worked with the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation and Durrell (the wildlife charity founded by popular naturalist Gerald Durrell) for nearly 40 years. Jones’ work on Mauritius is responsible for saving five bird species, three reptiles and several plants, and restoring nine off-shore islands. These achievements are not a mere drop in the ocean. His results represent 19% of avoided bird extinctions worldwide. Overall this is nearly 10% of all bird, mammal and amphibian species downlisted on the IUCN Red List. Jones’s international recognition is richly deserved. Jones himself suggests that recovery requires about 20 breeding cycles. That means 20 years for species that breed just once a year. Improved understanding can however, accelerate recovery. Recent efforts in the US with the California Channel Islands fox restored a handful of surviving individuals to a thriving population in just a decade. The near-extinct Mauritius kestrel bounced back to a free-living population from just four birds. India’s unique pygmy hog was reintroduced after successful breeding of a few animals taken from the wild. Conservation is getting smarter and more effective. So on Montserrat, people must act fast while hope remains. A sustainable frog population must be a priority. If people carefully use their knowledge, this extraordinary giant, the mountain chicken frog might withstand threats of disease and habitat pressure on its tiny, volcanic island home."
"These are extraordinary times for energy policy in the UK. After years of resigned acceptance that the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station would be built no matter how much of a basketcase it was, the government has surprised everyone by calling a halt to the process until the autumn. The proposed Hinkley Point C would have two European Pressurised Reactors (EPRs), providing around 3GW of electricity or about 7% of the UK’s total usage. The construction would be paid for by French energy firm EDF and Chinese nuclear companies, but the expense of building it would be underpinned by long-term supply contracts with the UK government, as well as a series of other financial undertakings designed to reduce the financial risks for the developers. Few people argue that Hinkley Point C makes sense. The project’s budget has grown from original estimates of £16 billion to £24.5 billion today. Even this might be an underestimate given the experience of cost overruns similar reactors under construction in Finland, France and China. The long-term supply contracts – known as Contracts for Difference (CfDs) – are designed to guarantee a set income of £92.50 per MegaWatt hour of output, regardless of the actual price of electricity in the market. Since the contracts were agreed, the wholesale price of electricity has fallen, meaning that the estimated subsidy for the lifetime of the project has risen from £6.1 billion to £29.7 billion, a huge burden for UK electricity consumers. And the CfD subsidy is complemented by a suite of other UK taxpayer subsidies and guarantees designed to mitigate investment risks for the French and Chinese investors and to guarantee costs for dealing with nuclear waste or paying compensation for nuclear accidents. Putting all of these subsidies in place has required the UK government to essentially redesign the electricity market over the past few years in an effort to create a situation where investment in a new plant looked attractive. Pretty much every major policy design has been geared towards creating a perfect environment for Hinkley Point C. That’s why it’s such a surprise to see the government has now stepped back – a bit – from the brink. The contracts to put many of the subsidy structures are not yet signed – that was meant to happen today, as part of the official approval process – so the government could still pull out. Obviously that wouldn’t please the French and Chinese, but risking their short-term displeasure could avoid locking the UK into the extortionate project for decades to come. Once the contracts are signed the legal and financial ramifications are so high that the project will go ahead, whatever the evidence against it.  The UK has form on this, notably the THORP nuclear fuel reprocessing plant at Sellafield, which began operation despite the case for it collapsing on every front. But without those contracts in place the project can still falter at the last hurdle. So why the delay? There is all sorts of speculation going round: the new Theresa May administration is not ideologically linked to new nuclear plants in the way that Cameron’s administration was – and therefore has had an attack of common sense about the costs of the project. The government also has security concerns over allowing significant Chinese investment in the UK electricity system – in a post-Brexit world the government is worried about the level of overseas ownership of UK electricity assets – most are owned by European rather than British companies. Then there was the less than ringing endorsement of the EDF board (which reportedly voted only 10-7 in favour of going ahead, following a couple of high-profile resignations) which has rung alarm bells in both the UK and French governments. The real reason behind the decision may emerge over the next few weeks as the government mulls over the pros and cons of the project. That will be fascinating. Equally fascinating, though, will be the debate that must take place at the same time about what an alternative might look like. What might the UK energy landscape look like without the project that has shaped it for so many years? Energy policy is often seen as a bit of a backwater – little tweaks to existing approaches tend to be preferred to massive shifts in strategy. The latest decision has the potential to change that. Without Hinkley Point C, the potential to have a real and considered debate about the future shape of the electricity system has loomed into view. Now is the time to start considering the sorts of options being considered widely around the world, with measures to encourage more flexible, smaller-scale, renewable systems incorporating demand-side measures and new technologies such as storage. A system that is the absolute antithesis of what Hinkley Point C represents. Suddenly UK energy policy has become very exciting indeed."

"On July 6, a two-year-old male Eurasian lynx named Flaviu escaped from his enclosure less than 24 hours after arriving at Dartmoor Zoo in Devon, south west England. He has been on the run ever since.  Zoo officials are confident Flaviu will remain nearby, and consequently the drones, sniffer dogs and humane traps baited with meat that are being used in the attempt to recapture him have focused on woods and farmland surrounding the zoo. Benjamin Mee, the zoo’s owner, believes the lynx will not venture far as there is plenty of easily accessible food in the form of rabbits and birds.  But I want to suggest an alternative possibility: perhaps he’s heading home.  Prior to arriving at Dartmoor Zoo, Flaviu lived with his mother, Klementyna, at the Port Lympne Reserve in Canterbury, Kent. He has been branded a “mummy’s boy” because of the close relationship he had with Klementyna. Consequently, Dartmoor zoo is planning to use bedding from his mother’s enclosure and a recording of her call to try and lure him back. Mee himself has acknowledged that Flaviu’s attachment to his mother may have been his motivation for wanting to escape, stating “we think he is really missing his mum. That is why he could have escaped last week, because he was trying to get back to her”.   Despite recognising Flaviu may have been motivated to escape because he missed his mother, zoo officials and others responsible for conducting the search are not seriously entertaining the possibility that he now might try to return to his previous home. Lynx are typically solitary in the wild and so the expectation is that as a two-year-old male, he would be more interested in finding his own territory.  However, having been born in captivity, Flaviu may not behave as a typical wild lynx. Animal welfare organisations such as the Blue Cross and Cats Protection emphasise that moving home is a very stressful procedure for domestic felines and consequently advocate keeping them indoors for at least three weeks following a move. The internet is full of stories of domestic cats travelling long distances and ending up back at their former residences.  Port Lympne is just over 275 miles from Dartmoor Zoo. Given the documented distances covered by wild lynx, Flaviu could feasibly turn up at his mother’s home some time in late August. The most recent sighting of Flaviu was on July 15, 12 miles north of Dartmoor zoo. If he is heading home his progress is slow, but this is perhaps unsurprising for a young animal experiencing freedom for the first time. A petition is calling for Dartmoor Zoo to return Flaviu to Port Lympne (if and when he is recaptured) so that he can be reunited with his mother. Certainly if Flaviu makes his own way back to Port Lymphe then this argument would be strengthened considerably. And there is precedent for animals who escape from captivity or slaughter against the odds being granted a reprieve. For example, in 1998 two Tamworth pigs escaped from a slaughter house and went on the run for five days before being recaptured. The considerable media attention their escape received resulted in the pair being transferred to an animal sanctuary.  However, the reality for most captive animals belonging to endangered species is that they frequently get moved between zoos and other institutions according to the requirements of international breeding programmes. Flaviu and Klementyna cannot breed together, and so Flaviu’s fate if he is recaptured may well be determined by the value of his genes. There is, of course, the risk that Flaviu will meet a sticky end if he is not recaptured. Certainly, many escapee carnivores end up being shot, or hit by cars, and trophy hunters are reportedly trying to “bag” the runaway lynx.  At some point, Flaviu may encounter the mythical “Beast of Dartmoor”. While local folklore speaks of various demonic black hounds, the “beast” is more frequently assumed to be a big cat or cats whose existence is corroborated and contested in equal measure by regular sightings and inconclusive photographs. Mee himself claims that in the 1980s, before he took over the zoo, it released three pumas. Academic research into sightings and predations suggests they are indeed flesh and blood creatures. For example, forensic tests conducted by a former colleague found that the tooth marks on sheep carcasses brought to her by confused farmers in Wales could be traced to multiple sources including foxes but also medium sized cats such as lynx or leopard. During my own research in Wales, which consisted of interviews with over 60 individuals who had claimed to have seen or encountered big cats, I also found myself face to face with what I can only conclude was a big cat.  In the south west of England, and Dartmoor specifically, sociologist Adrian Franklin has conducted extensive interviews with individuals who have encountered big cats and discovered that there was historical precedent for big cats in private collections being released or escaping in the vicinity. If any of these escapees are still alive, and if any were lynx (as descriptions often suggest), then there’s a possibility Flaviu may not head home and chose instead to settle in the area and start his own family.  Finally, if Flaviu is not caught then his story might also become an interesting case study which could inform discussions surrounding the rewilding of lynx in the UK. If he remains at large, stays out of sight and doesn’t eat too many sheep or domestic pets, then UK residents might be more inclined to feel positive about coexisting with these creatures who were once native to the UK but were wiped out by human activity more than 1,300 years ago."
"The Paris agreement on climate change calls for a global responsibility to cooperate. As we are often reminded, we urgently and drastically need to limit our use of one shared resource – fossil fuels – and its effect on another – the climate. But how realistic is this goal, both for national leaders and for us? Well, psychology may hold some answers. Psychologists and economists have long explored the conflict between short-term individual and long-term collective interests when dealing with shared resources. Think of the commons dilemma: the scenario in which a field for grazing cattle works well when everyone cooperates by sticking to one cow each, but which leads to the so-called “tragedy of the commons” if more selfish drives take over. It is useful to think about overuse of fossil fuels and its effect on the climate as a similar dilemma. If we were to think of this from a purely economic perspective, we would likely act selfishly. But psychological research should make us more optimistic about cooperation. Are you more likely to overuse a shared resource when it is framed as an ethical concern or a business transaction? Research shows people behave less selfishly when it’s framed ethically, or if we emphasise what people will gain rather than lose by reducing their use of fossil fuels. Using the phrase “global warming” rather than “climate change” also engages us emotionally and makes us more supportive of the issue. We also need a balance of good and bad news if we are not going to be overwhelmed by the enormity of the challenge and feel like running away. So wording when communicating to the public as well as in international agreements can make a difference, and we shouldn’t be afraid to appeal to people’s moral sense of what the right thing to do might be. Social norms in behaviour around climate change include things such as “most people recycle”, or “it’s not acceptable to take too many flights”. It’s been shown that communicating these norms can make people adjust their behaviour.  When behaviour is phrased as the default – for example, “my neighbours don’t use too much electricity” – people are also more likely to behave in that way, as we found in a series of experiments.  Research also shows that we need to believe that others sharing the resource think fairness is important if we are to act fairly, or cooperate, ourselves. So we also need a sense of shared identity, which in turn means we are more likely to think others share our values. Shared national identity could be emphasised through communication from government and media; and at a more local level by encouraging more community involvement. When we communicate with fellow users of a shared resource, we trust each other and cooperate more. We also keep communicating. Feedback about how much we’ve used a resource (like household electricity using a “smart home app” or a carbon footprint calculator) makes us use it less. This also works for institutions who use fair decision-making procedures, such as the local council aiming to conserve water.  We also need to know how many people are using a resource, and what its capacity is. And, as we showed in recent studies, we need to know on which information we should base our behaviour and what follows from this information. So countries and local authorities being transparent about their fossil fuel usage is key and, even better, easily achieved. Rewards and sanctions can work well to improve cooperation, from lower tax for buying an environmentally friendly car to a carbon tax for businesses. One potential problem is that this approach can make us feel as if we can’t be trusted and need incentives to do the right thing. But, like schoolchildren with an enlightened teacher, if we get to decide on the incentives and appoint our own leaders to monitor them, then a sense of trust can be rebuilt. We don’t identify and act just as individuals but as members of social groups. We may belong to a family, a community, a nation and the planet, and behave in ways that benefit the group rather than the individual. A shared group identity (such as identifying yourself as a member of your nation or the local school community) can increase cooperation, especially if we believe that group shares our values about the environment. If you strongly identify with your community you don’t need an incentive to cooperate. But at what level should this shared identity be emphasised? Emphasising national identity can prevent cooperation between nations, by increasing competition between them. However, this can be used to an advantage, since nations care about their reputation. So perhaps they could compete to be better than others at meeting climate change goals? Local competition (like a clean city award) can incentivise, too. But we also need to strengthen our sense of being part of the planet – a better global identity could motivate us to empathise with other countries and even future generations. Implementing the Paris agreement will involve big top-down decisions about how much each country is going to reduce their fossil fuels by. This reduction is essential to meet the goal to drastically limit the temperature increase to 2ºC. But how should the amount of fossil fuels used in different countries be reduced when proportions vary between them? For example, half of the remaining gas and oil reserves are in the Middle East. One analysis shows that to keep the planet’s atmosphere below the target of 2ºC, 94% of Europe’s gas reserves can be used but only 30% of those in the Middle East. Given that the Middle East has a larger share, should it be expected to use less than other countries? Should the level of development, population or wealth of a nation also be relevant? And what about how much fuel they have already used? Myles Allen has argued that we don’t have the right to stop countries such as India from using its coal. He suggests instead making companies that use fossil fuels responsible for burying an equal amount of carbon to reduce net emissions.  But there is also scope for appealing to the ideals of international cooperation. We should be optimistic in light of the above psychological research about the capacity of the human race to put the long-term needs of the many above the short-term needs of the few. Big decisions could be facilitated by many of the psychological processes we have described, that focus on global identity, long-term gain rather than short-term loss, intergroup competition and reputation, rewards, shared norms, providing sufficient and clear information, and instilling trust and transparency.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThere’s a lot of excitement flaring up, especially on the alarmist side, because of a possible super El Nino occurring later this year – one that could push global temperature to a new modern high.
That of course is entirely possible. However, it isn’t going to really matter, and possibly may only be the last death convulsion of planetary warming. Everyone knows that a cooling La Nina follows an El Nino event. Indeed a number of solar physicists are now warning that we may in fact be on our final days of warmth for a number of decades to come.
Geologist Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt tells us why in their latest essay. 
================================
Will the solar doldrums of the coming decades lead to cooling? A look at the latest scientific publications
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by NoTricksZone)
Seldom has the sun been as strong as we have seen it over the last 5 decades. Is it just a coincidence that the largest warming of the last 500 years occurred during this phase?
Just a few years ago the tide changed when the sun ended its hyperactive phase. Few people had anticipated this, and so it was a surprise for many. Solar physicist Leif Svalgaard of California’s Stanford University expressed it as follows at the American Geophysical Union last December:
“None of us alive have ever seen such a weak cycle. So we will learn something.”
And so science commenced to consider and think about what all this could lead to. The latest works on the subject include Qian et al. 2014 (“Secular changes in the thermosphere and ionosphere between two quiet Sun periods“), Zhao et al. 2014 (Modulation of galactic cosmic rays during the unusual solar minimum between cycles 23 and 24) and McCracken & Beer 2014 (Comparison of the extended solar minimum of 2006–2009 with the Spoerer, Maunder, and Dalton Grand Minima in solar activity in the past).
After a number of studies it has become clearer: It’s only the beginning! It is expected that the sun will continue becoming quieter over the coming decades. This has pretty much become the consensus among solar physicists. The latest studies on the subject come from Roth & Joos 2013, who assume a decline in solar activity to normal levels will occur during the 21st century. Salvador 2013 goes further and anticipates a solar minimum for the coming 30-100 years. Read the original abstract:
Using many features of Ian Wilson’s Tidal Torque theory, a mathematical model of the sunspot cycle has been created that reproduces changing sunspot cycle lengths and has an 85% correlation with the sunspot numbers from 1749 to 2013. The model makes a reasonable representation of the sunspot cycle for the past 1000 yr, placing all the solar minimums in their right time periods. More importantly, I believe the model can be used to forecast future solar cycles quantitatively for 30 yr and directionally for 100 yr. The forecast is for a solar minimum and quiet Sun for the next 30 to 100 yr. The model is a slowly changing chaotic system with patterns that are never repeated in exactly the same way. Inferences as to the causes of the sunspot cycle patterns can be made by looking at the model’s terms and relating them to aspects of the Tidal Torque theory and, possibly, Jovian magnetic field interactions.
In the Journal of Geophysical Research a study by Goelzer et al. appeared in December 2013 and also foresees a decline in solar activity.

What climatic consequences could this have? In our book “The Neglected Sun” we assume that temperatures could be two tenths of a degree lower by 2030 as a result, which would mean warming getting postponed far into the future. Russian scientists foresee an even more dramatic situation, as described in Germany’s leading national daily Bild of April 4,2013:
AND NOW THIS! Russian scientist sees next approaching ice age
It will get colder beginning in 2014 +++ Human migration cannot be ruled out”
Just a month earlier The Voice of Russia reported:
Planet on the verge of an ice age
Russian scientists are predicting that a little ice age will begin in 2014. They refute the claims of global warming and describe them as a marketing trick. Global warming is indeed happening. The earth has been continuously getting warmer since the second half of the 18th century, the start of the Industrial Revolution. This is why the process gets connected to an anthropogenic impact. Mankind increased CO2 emissions, which caused a greenhouse effect. But Russian scientist Vladimir Baschkin categorically disagrees. He claims that the climatic changes have a cyclic character and are not at all related in any way to human activities. Together with his colleague, Rauf Galiullin, of the Institute for Fundamental Problems of Biology of the Russian Academy of Sciences, he points out that the current warming is merely the continuation of the post Little Ice Age and that, measured on a geological scale, the occurrence of a new ice age is approaching.”
Continue reading at Voice of Russia.
Other scientists share this view as well, among them Professor Cliff Ollier of the School of Earth and Environmental Studies at the University of Western Australia:
Professor Cliff Ollier of the School of Earth and Environmental Studies, the University of Western Australia, recently presented a paper in Poznan, Poland,  in which he described the sun as the major control of climate, but not through greenhouse gases.”There is a very good correlation of sunspots and climate. Solar cycles provide a basis for prediction. Solar Cycle 24 has started and we can expect serious cooling.”
H.S. Ahluwalia of the Department of Physics & Astronomy of the University of New Mexico sees it in similar way, as he describes in an article in the journal of Advances in Space Research in February 2014. Ahluwalia expects a Dalton-type minimum and reminds us that the last minimum of this kind back around 1810 resulted in a cold period.

"The director of the Southern California Earthquake Center, Thomas Jordan, made an announcement recently that would have sent a chill down the spine of every Californian: that the San Andreas fault appears to be in a critical state and as such, could generate a large earthquake imminently. Of course, the reiteration of the seismic hazard to Californians will be nothing surprising, but what is new is the warning that the southern portion of the fault “looks like it’s locked, loaded and ready to go”. Why is this eminent seismologist making these alarming statements? Well, the fact is that there has not been a major release of stresses in the southern portion of the San Andreas fault system since 1857. In simple terms, the San Andreas is one of many fault systems roughly marking the border between the Pacific and North American tectonic plates. Both plates are moving in an approximately northerly direction but the Pacific plate is moving faster than its North American counterpart, meaning that stresses between the plates are constantly building up.  In 1906, some of these stresses were catastrophically released in the San Francisco Bay area in a 7.8 magnitude event and again, in northern California, during the 6.9 magnitude 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. Events of these magnitudes, however, have not occurred along the San Andreas fault in the south of the state – the 1994 Northridge event was associated with a nearby, but separate, fault system – leading to the suggestion that one is imminent and, given the amount of stress that might actually have accumulated, when it arrives it will be the “Big One”. So just how big could this potential earthquake be and is it possible that the destruction demonstrated in the film San Andreas could actually come to fruition?  In short, Californians will be (reasonably) pleased with the answers to these questions. In the film, the San Andreas fault produces an earthquake with a magnitude of 9.0. While not unheard of globally, earthquakes of this size are generally confined to regions of the earth where subduction – where one tectonic plate is being forced below another – is happening, for example in Chile and Japan. The tectonic situation in California is different. Here, two plates are sliding past each other.  As such, recent predictions limit the possible maximum earthquake magnitude along the San Andreas fault system to 8.0, although with a 7% probability estimate that such an event could occur in Southern California in the next 30 years; over the same period, there is a 75% chance of a magnitude 7.0 event. While magnitudes of 7.0, 8.0 and 9.0 might sound negligibly different, the energy that such events would unleash varies significantly, with a magnitude 9.0 event releasing 32 times more energy than a magnitude 8.0 and 1,000 times more energy than a magnitude 7.0. Obviously, however, be it a 7.0 or an 8.0, damage is inevitable, but the whole sequence of events, as depicted in the film, is unlikely. For example, the San Andreas fault is not beneath the ocean and as such, any slippage along it could not displace water to the extent that a tsunami would be generated. The opening up of a massive chasm is also from the land of fantasy, as the plates are sliding relative to each other, not away from each other.  What is realistic, however, is that a great amount of destruction is likely. While the building codes in California are stringent, recommending retrofitting of seismic protection measures to older buildings and preventing the construction of new buildings near to known fault lines, there is no way to make a building 100% safe.  In an attempt to understand the effects of a large, southern San Andreas earthquake, the U.S. Geological Survey modelled a 7.8 magnitude event, with slippage of 2-7 metres, to represent the stresses that have built up in the area since the last large event.  From this model, it was found that damage would be most severe to constructions straddling the fault. Fortunately, constructions of this sort are few and far between following the 1972 Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act. What would be affected by this slippage, however, are the 966 roads, 90 fibre optic cables, 39 gas pipes and 141 power lines that cross the fault zone.  The total cost of damage to buildings was estimated at $33 billion, with modern buildings faring well but older buildings being particularly susceptible. Fires would rage – as they did following the Northridge earthquake – as gas mains, and mains water pipes, become severed; in fact, the damage from resulting fires is estimated as more costly than that resulting from the initial shaking.  The overall death toll is estimated at 1,800. And just when things don’t look like they can get any worse, the main event will have destabilised the tectonics of the region to such an extent that a series of potentially powerful aftershocks will begin. For example, in 2011, Christchurch, New Zealand was struck by a 6.2 magnitude event and since then the city and surrounding region have experienced more than 10,000 aftershocks.  Fortunately, the film San Andreas is pure fiction, featuring the levels of exaggeration we are all used to from film makers who are, ironically, also based in southern California. Even so, in all probability, the San Andreas is likely to generate a significant earthquake in the not too distant future. When it arrives, the damage will be significant and southern California will be massively affected. But Californians are no strangers to these events and the infrastructure of the state, in recent times, has been designed with earthquake protection in mind.  Forget tsunamis and deep chasms opening up, but do expect violent shaking, building damage, fires and widespread economic impacts as the region is out of action for potentially a long period of time."
"The UK’s Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) is no more. New prime minister Theresa May has decided to merge it with the business department into an expanded Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. Even given the breakneck speed of events in British current affairs since the EU referendum, this stands out as one of the most radical changes. But what impact will this have on climate policy? Before joining academia in 2015 I spent the previous 12 years in DECC, the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) and their predecessors, so I watched these latest restructurings with great interest.  Many green groups have already decried the perceived downgrading of the climate agenda with it taking a back seat to business and industry. And they have a point: the obvious downside is the loss of a single, visible, Whitehall department which had a clear remit to tackle climate change. The formation of DECC in 2008 by Gordon Brown’s government was celebrated at the time because it provided a focal point for action on climate change. Perhaps the clearest example of this was during the 2014 negotiations to decide the EU’s 2030 targets, which would inform the bloc’s position going into the UN climate discussions in Paris.  Ed Davey, then Secretary of State, used his position and the firepower of his department to garner support across like-minded European member states. The EU’s headline 2030 target – emissions reduced by 40% from 1990 levels – was in large part to Sir Ed and DECC civil servants. DECC’s work was therefore key to the recent climate negotiations which culminated at COP21 last December where 195 countries adopted the first-ever universal, legally binding global climate deal. There are benefits to this new arrangement, however. A focus on business is necessary if the UK is going to continue to reduce its emissions: the switch from coal to low carbon sources means electricity supply is doing its bit, but other sectors – notably heat and transport – need to up their game. The country needs new policies, and the restructuring should help move low carbon thinking into the business and industry mainstream. The business department has traditionally championed key sectors, including the aerospace, automotive and construction industries.  Aligning those sectors with the low carbon energy priorities could ensure greater progress on electric vehicles, zero carbon homes or alternative aviation fuels. The merge could also offer greater progress on decarbonising heavy industry and other big energy users. This work was already a joint effort between DECC and BIS who had commissioned a series of roadmaps for sectors such as steel or cement in an attempt to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve energy efficiency. The new department’s “industrial strategy” remit should help address the UK’s significant infrastructure challenges. Shifting government policies have unnerved the energy sector which in turn is resisting investment decisions on what infrastructure to build – for example, the curtailed £1 billion carbon capture and storage (CCS) programme and the lack of proposed new gas plants.   Steady energy policies coupled with a more interventionist approach to infrastructure and technology investment could reap rewards. This could mean the deployment of modular nuclear reactors, far smaller than those at the planned Hinkley plant but in need of government support for the development and design stage, and to progress through the necessary safety approvals. It could mean CCS is dusted off and new transport and storage infrastructure such as pipelines and injection wells are built. It could even see British cities shifting their heating from natural gas to hydrogen – an idea already being explored in Leeds. The DECC-BIS merger also means the low carbon and innovation portfolios now operate under the same roof, which should strengthen the cross-government Low Carbon Innovation Coordination Group – though hopefully the move won’t affect DECC’s significant £500m innovation fund. The first statement by Greg Clark, the new business secretary, was encouraging: he clearly stated the importance of clean energy and tackling climate change. That should be followed with further clarity on the UK’s approach to the EU 2030 climate targets, and ratification of the Paris Agreement. This will keep up momentum, confidence and commitment going into COP22 in Morocco."

Video by The New American
Models are faulty…no coming catastrophe
In Lüning’s view, the dire climate warnings are all based on models and the history of climate needs to be taken much more into account for extrapolating into the future. He thinks it’s no surprise many of the predictions are turning out wrong, and he reminds us that the earth’s climate has always seen wide fluctuations and that today’s climate is not unprecedented. “It’s not a catastrophe we are headed to.”
Hockey stick has been discarded
On the manipulation of past data, Dr. Lüning thinks the hockey stick was an error involving poor statistics and methods, with a “wish” for a certain outcome, reminding us that even Michael Mann has revised his charts. The Medieval Warm Period has also been put back in the IPCC 5th Assessment Report.

IPCC claims “not true”
He agrees there have been political efforts to push through false scientific data. “That’s true. And a lot of the articles that are proposed or published by IPCC affiliated scientists; one really has to look twice and three times at them to understand what has happened. And a lot of the claims are just not true.”
Germany’s renewable energy program in chaos
Lüning agrees there should be development in alternative energies, but describes Germany’s renewable energy push as being “in complete chaos“, and is a system where everyone is crying for subsidies and that the system is now on “shaky grounds”. He says some media are already backtracking. “The tide is changing, I think.”
Climate issue way beyond its best-before-date
In Lüning’s view the climate movement reached it’s peak in 2007, and that more and more people are taking a closer look at his own views. He credits his high profile co-author of the book ‘The Neglected Sun‘, Fritz Vahrenholt, for getting the climate science skepticism ball moving. “Step-by-step we are winning them over and a realism is beginning to take place“. He then describes how moderate scientists in Germany and in Europe are becoming more receptive to their non-alarmist message and states that more and more papers on the natural cycles have been coming out.

"At the Paris climate summit in December 2015, 195 countries adopted the first universal, legally binding, global climate deal. Impressive stuff. A major success for the United Nations and met with much congratulatory fanfare. Now world leaders are gathered in New York to actually sign the agreement, which is due to come into force in 2020. The targets are worthy – limiting global warming to “well below 2℃” – but will collective action really live up to such ambition? A colleague of mine recently likened ratification of the Paris agreement to signing up to run the a marathon. You feel very good about it. You collectively pat each other on the back and bask in a moment of self-satisfaction. But then you realise that this will be your very first marathon, you have done no prior training, you have no coach lined up and, what’s more, you have committed to set a new world record. Will you achieve it? Probably not. We almost certainly won’t be able to keep global warming close to the much-heralded 1.5℃, and neither will carbon emissions peak as soon as is necessary to achieve this target. Is success in the climate marathon slipping from our grasp before we have even started training? Let me explore this further. Global warming is closely linked to energy use. There are some significant long-term energy trends, which form an important backdrop against which to consider our preparations. Global demand for energy continues to rise as a direct result of growth in the world economy, increased levels of activity – especially in emerging economies – and population growth. Global GDP is expected to double in the next 20 years. However, reforms in the Chinese economy, coupled with ever-increasing energy efficiency, will help limit growth in energy use to around 35% during the same period. The type of fuel used to generate all this energy is also changing. Use of coal, with its high carbon emissions, is declining markedly. Gas is the fastest growing fossil fuel, supported by an abundance of shale gas with its relatively lower carbon emissions. Oil holds steady. Renewables are undoubtedly the fastest growing sector worldwide, with an expectation that they will quadruple in the next 20 years, albeit from a very low starting point. Finally, the growth rate of carbon emissions is already slowing sharply. This is the expected result of the trends noted above and indicative of an important decoupling of carbon emissions from economic growth. It reflects a marked decline in both energy use per unit of GDP and in carbon emissions per unit of consumption. So, optimistically, the trends seem to point towards a transition to a lower-carbon energy system. This has been backed up by the individual pledges of participating countries prior to the Paris meeting last year, which will be ratified at the signings. But, good as this may seem, it is in fact nowhere near sufficient to meet the International Energy Authority’s 450 scenario. IEA 450 is a plan to limit carbon dioxide atmospheric levels to 450 parts per million, which would limit the increase in global temperature to 1.6℃. Tackling climate change is quite rightly seen as an international effort, requiring a combination of governmental, industrial and individual action. Significantly, it requires sustained and increased effort if we are to have any chance of success. But many countries are already falling short. Take the UK, for instance. The country should be working extra hard to boost renewables. Yet the government has recently dramatically cut subsidies to the renewable industry. The UK should support an increased use of natural gas as the preferred fossil fuel. Yet the government refuses to support much-needed research into the viability and efficiency of shale gas. British engineers should be pioneering work on carbon capture and storage (CCS) in underground reservoirs. Yet the government has recently reneged on its commitment to make available £1 billion capital funding for fully commercial CCS projects. Such obfuscation and lack of action is unhelpful and goes against Britain’s track record of creating innovative solutions to society’s needs. Nowhere is this more compelling now than at the climate-energy nexus – not only for renewables, clean gas and carbon storage, but also in the realm of improved energy efficiency and storage, increased recycling and minimising waste."

Share this...FacebookTwitterA reader/professor has sent me an internal memo he recently obtained from a meteorologist and member of the Deutsche Meteorologische Gesellschaft [German Meteorological Society], abbreviated as DMG. Clearly grave concern is emerging over a large swath of the broader German meteorological-climatological community in the wake of the Lennart Bengtsson witchhunt.
The memo was authored by a group of dissenting DMG-member meteorologists and intended to be published in the DMG reports, but never saw the light of day.
It reveals a growing and widespread worry over the suppression of scientific views among German Meteorological Society members. One of the authors of the memorandum wrote an e-mail to the reader who provided the copy to me. He writes:
A circle of mostly older colleagues of the Free University of Berlin, who very much reject the tone one finds in today’s field of climatology, has asked me to draft a memorandum on the subject and to publish it in the Reports of the German Meteorological Society. Shortened by a half and totally watered down, the memorandum appeared in the last issue. I now take the liberty to bring the original version to your attention.
Greetings and cordial asscoication yours, ************”
I’ve deleted the name to protect the source. What follows is the original, un-watered down version of the memorandum – translated in English:
=====================================
Memorandum
On the situation in the field of meteorology-climatology
Based on observations made for quite some time, and due to the current occasion (IPCC 5), colleagues in the meteorological circles have been witnessing with worry how certain developments are becoming cemented into their scientific fields (foremost climatology) which from a scientific point of view simply cannot be accepted and do not comply to their professional ethics.
These developments involve first of all something in the lines of a democratization of science: Everyone is allowed and should have a say in it. In meteorology-climatology every one includes a highly visible army of organized, little known persons; in Germany this is almost the entire public! The changes that have taken place in science as a result have in our opinion (and that of others) led to very negative impacts on the quality standards of science. For example expressed and disseminated meteorological flaws can hardly be contained and cannot be corrected publicly at all. Yet our meteorological scientists do not speak up.

And it is hardly perceived that behind these developments – admittedly – there is also a political objective for the transformation of society, whether one wants it or not. Currently global sustainable change is the same thing.
Meteorology-climatology is playing a decisive role this political action. The – alleged – CO2 consensus here is serving as a lever within the group that consists of known colleagues who deal with climate, but also consists of a large number of climate bureaucrats coming from every imaginable social field. Together both groups consensually have introduced a binding dogma into this science (which is something that is totally alien to the notion of science).
This is not the first time such a thing has happened in the history of science. Here although this dogma came about through democratic paths (through consensus vote?), in the end it is almost dictatorial. Doubting the dogma is de facto forbidden and is punished? In climatology the doubt is about datasets or results taken over from hardly verifiable model simulations from other parties. Until recently this kind of science was considered conquered – thanks to our much celebrated liberty/democratic foundation!
The constant claim of consensus among so-called climatologists, who relentlessly claim man-made climate change has been established, attempts to impose by authority an end to the debate on fundamental questions. Thus a large number of scientist colleagues end up being ostracized, and thus could lead to the prompting of actions that would have considerable burdens on the well-intended society. Such a regulation and the resulting incalculable consequence it would have for all people would in our view – and that of many meteorological specialists we know – be irresponsible with respect to our real level of knowledge in this field.
We must desire in general, and also in our scientific field, a return to an international scientific practice that is free of pre-conceptions and cemented biased opinions. This must include the freedom of presenting (naturally well-founded) scientific results, even when these do not correspond to the mainstream (e.g. the IPCC requirements).

Again I’ve redacted the author’s name.
Clearly a number of scientists and experts in Germany worry that dogma has engulfed meteorology and climatology, and that history risks repeating itself.

The media went crazy, and so did some “experts”.
Immediately the high priests of climate and end-of-world theoreticians immediately seized upon the bad weather and linked it to man-made global warming and human environmental sins. And again they are calling for human sacrifices to be made at the alter in a bid to appease the angry gods.
UN IPCC Mojib Latif here connected the local German bad weather directly to man and “climate altering Greenhouse gases”.
For me the weather of the last few days was another piece of the puzzle: Climate change and its impacts are becoming increasingly detectable. Germany is feeling the impact of global warming. There are increasingly more hot days with temperatures far above 30°C. And also the phases of heavy precipitation are rising. This is precisely what the models for the case of increased atmospheric greenhouse gases have been predicting.”
Unfortunately, Latif neglected reading even his own IPCC report, which dismisses the link of bad weather to greenhouse gases. At the end Latif says that the international community must act quickly to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.
At Sciblogs here, not even ultra-alarmist and AGW-dogmatist Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) is ready to go as far out on a limb as Latif. Rahmstorf writes that more frequent severe thunderstorms as a consequence of global warming is plausible, but grudgingly concedes the IPCC has no data to support it. He adds in a reader comment:

I also think it’s not appropriate to connect every weather event to climate change.”
Such weather patterns are “nothing new”

Chart right: www2.wetter3.de.gif
Veteran German meteorologist Klaus Eckart Puls of the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) dismisses a linkage to man-made CO2. In an e-mail response to my inquiry he writes that such an idea only comes from people who either know little about the weather statistics before 150 years ago, or people who are attempting to misuse seldomly seen weather patterns for political climate-alarmism purposes.
The weather service archives show: Such weather patterns have occurred and do occur in June over Europe time and again – fortunately not every day. Why? First of all we are now at the time of the year where the sun is at a peak and so we have about 15 hours of sunshine in Central Europe with clear to almost clear skies. So was the case in the days leading up to June 9, 2014. As a result the air over Central Europe heated up day after day. Moreover a stalled low pressure system positioned for days over the Bay of Biscay with a trough extending deep to the south pumped hot air from North Africa and into Central Europe. As the hot air swept over the Bay of Biscay, it picked up a lot of humidity and led to the formation of a strong weather front, which in turn spawned extremely powerful thunderstorms. What happened on June 9 meteorologoically was nothing new, but it’s fortunately seldom.”
Puls reminds us that “even the alarmist-leaning UN IPCC finds no trends to more extreme weather. Not only in its earlier reports, but also in its latest 2013 report.”
For readers who do not know, Mojib Latif is Germany’s version of David Viner. He too also predicted that winters with snow and ice would soon be a thing of the past.

"Like Henry Ford before him, Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk is taking a new approach to car making. Where Ford focused on manufacturing a car that the mass market could afford, Musk is keen to build a vehicle that the environment can bear. Much has been made of the use of solar power at what is to become the largest factory in the world, the Tesla Gigafactory near Reno, Nevada, which will produce battery packs for cars and other applications. The “end-to-end” vision of using renewable energy sources to generate electricity for product manufacture and use is compelling, and one that has been forcefully made by Elon Musk. At an estimated cost of $5 billion (including $1.3 billion in tax incentives) and with factory floor-space intended to grow to some 1.2m square metres by 2020, on four square kilometres of land, it is a monumental project. Look beyond the hype, however, and there are major environmental questions that need to be answered, as the rhetoric and reality of green production are very different. Just look at the embodied energy of the factory alone, that is the energy required to create and maintain it. It takes substantial sunk energy costs and carbon emissions to build the solar panels, and all associated cables, that will power the Gigafactory, and to make and transport the concrete, steel, glass, plastic and other materials needed to create more than a million square metres of factory floor space.  Some studies of office buildings have suggested embodied energy can be as much as 30 times the annual operational energy use. For Tesla’s factory, the use of zero-carbon energy during production makes the energy cost of construction even more significant. For example, cement – more than 60,000 cubic yards of concrete were poured to form the base of the factory – has embodied energy of 4.5 megajoules per kilogram, and an embodied carbon value of 0.73 kilograms of carbon dioxide/kg.  Some 70% of solar panel lifecycle carbon emissions also occur in manufacturing, with a typical total figure of 40g in CO2 emissions per kWh. This means that upward of 50% of the lifecycle carbon emissions associated with the Gigafactory could occur just in building the plant. There will also be additional energy running costs due to the factory being located in the Nevada desert. Significant power will be needed for air conditioning, to keep the 6,500 workers in a healthy ambience, in addition to the usual lighting, heating and powering of production equipment. Is this the best use of available solar power? The issue is simple: renewable does not mean infinite. Many electric vehicles of are of dubious efficiency, and the carbon emissions benefits of each car depend crucially upon the means by which the electricity used to power the car is generated. Even then, compared with an efficient diesel or petrol car, the net reduction in lifecycle carbon emissions is likely to be only in the region of 25-30% – given their promotion as the eco-friendly car, some might expect this figure to be much higher. There are other environmental burdens, too: solar panels are traditionally produced using large quantities of materials such as copper, silver, lithium, and rare earths such as tellurium, or indium for which there are scarcity concerns and very large environmental burdens during extraction and refining including significant human toxicity. In addition, manufacturing processes for panels may involve caustic chemicals such as sodium hydroxide and hydrofluoric acid, for which recycling options are currently limited. The desert Gigafactory is also in a region of the US with recurrent concerns over long-term water supply. Debate over water concerns around Reno was heated even before the announcement of the Gigafactory, and the direct use of water by the plant has undoubtedly added to this. It is expected that the majority of the water used will be captured, if necessary treated, and then returned to the water supply system. Nevertheless, it is anticipated that the facility will need up to 3m cubic metres of water by the time it reaches maturity. Moreover, all those workers, a substantial number of which may be recruited from outside the immediate area, along with their families, will add to the indirect water consumption burden. At an average US household size of 2.8 persons, the factory could see an influx of a further 18,200 people into the Reno area. At an average local consumption rate of 741 cubic metres of water per household per annum, that means a potential additional demand of just over 4m cubic metres per annum in total – more than the factory itself. Tesla certainly is taking a commendable step in the right direction to make its plant as eco-friendly as possible, but there is still room for development. However, where one leads others can and will follow, and the future of manufacturing can only get greener. That has to be good news."

Share this...FacebookTwitterNot long ago Austrian social critic and rap musician Kilez More produced and posted a climate science skeptic video. I reported on this awhile back, see here and here. The video also has English subtitles to help get the overall message across internationally.

The video, watched mainly by young people, has surpassed the 100,000 views milestone. Congratulations to a musician who is surely reaping lots of scorn for getting young people to question what they are told.
What follows is a short interview with Kilez on the video’s success so far:
How do you feel about the video getting over 100,000 views so far?
I’m glad to see the video climbing over the 100,000 views mark – and it shows, that there is a need for a critical point of view on this topic! It’s still one of the most viewed (and of course most discussed) videos of mine.

Have you gotten a lot of criticism or any threats because of the video?
Indeed the video has brought me a lot of criticism. Some bad articles have been written, some nasty insults have been made, some artists even refused to work with me because of that. Really unbelievable how the massive propaganda works on people’s mind – and especially with this topic the mass media does its best to manipulate the thinking. It’s just too important for too many things – like lots of taxes, many many laws, etc. – to let it go. 
But the reactions were not just bad. Also a lot of listeners have been open to the argumentation, starting to dig right through the mass of information. So the video is doing its job! That’s what I want to reach with my music – to get people to start thinking by themselves and searching for information on their own – not through the filtered television-screen in their living rooms.
Do you feel there are attempts being made to marginalize you?
There have been some attempts to marginalize me – and even today. But it’s not only because of the climate-change music video that has been a part of the whole story. A political rapper has his difficulties because the media either first try to black-out my music or insult me and try to marginalize me before they get to the topics. It’s always the same story – try to discredit the speaker to prevent people from listening to the message.

"Hundreds of protesters joined the celebrity activist Jane Fonda in Washington DC for her fifth Friday urging radical change to fight the climate crisis. In front of the US Capitol, Fonda spoke of the “urgency of the climate crisis and need for activism on an unprecedented scale”.  “We cannot leave it to young people to fight this fight for their future by themselves,” Fonda said. Donning her signature vivid red coat – which she says will be the last she will ever buy, in an effort to be more sustainable – she swayed and sang protest songs while embracing an anti-war activist, Jodie Evans, the co-founder of Code Pink. Fonda, 81, has been leading protests at her “Fire Drill Fridays” for more than a month, and she has been arrested four times. Her climate action has followed the work of youth protesters around the world who have been striking from school on Fridays, including the 16-year-old Swedish climate advocate Greta Thunberg. Fonda had not been arrested as of 3pm ET on Friday, but she is scheduled to appear in court over previous arrests later this month. This week’s protest theme was about how the war and military contribute to the climate crisis. The US military is one of the biggest emitters of carbon in the world. “I started in the streets with Jane in 1970, 49 years ago. And I’ve never ever seen her lose her passion or energy. Nobody works like Jane. She does put her body on the line and she is not afraid to be uncomfortable,” Evans said. Fonda is a longtime political activist with roots opposing the Vietnam war. She gained the nickname “Hanoi Jane” in the 1970s when she was photographed atop a North Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun on a visit to Hanoi. A conservative counter-protester, walking alone alongside those who marched with Fonda to the White House, shouted “four more years, Hanoi Jane,” at the group. A large contingent of activists urging the impeachment of Donald Trump also joined the march, as did veterans of the Vietnam war. Surreal moment as protestors supporting DACA dreamers cross paths with the #FireDrillFriday #climate march (merged with the impeach Trump march) and cheer each other on. Sign of the times for political activism in America. pic.twitter.com/vWlmZNPHck At one streetcorner, the Fonda protest encountered a separate group marching in support of undocumented migrants who arrived in the US as children, known as Dreamers. The two crowds sang each others’ chants. Fonda’s protest attracted teenagers and seniors alike. Two first-year college students said they had been introduced to Fonda through her Netflix show, Grace and Frankie, and were drawn to her climate message. “When you read climate studies and see Greta Thunberg and all of these other young activists at work, and then you see someone older also making an effort to try to do something about climate change, it just kind of compels you. You need to be there. You need to have your voice heard,” said one of the students, TJ Boland. But many of the protesters were at the march for more than the climate. They expressed frustration with a system of governance that they see as exploiting the poor and people of color in order to benefit the wealthy and corporations at the expense of the environment. Julie Heffernan and Anne Landsman, two friends in their early 60s, traveled from New York City for the protest. “I’ve been very angry ever since Trump was elected about the fact that we have somebody who is lacking in every quality that I consider as important for a leader, starting off with just basic decency. He’s a misogynist, he’s a racist, he is just everything I despise,” said Landsman, who came to the US from South Africa during apartheid. “The thought that I’d emigrated and moved to a country that I thought was some bastion of decency and just see it just take this dive down has been incredibly upsetting.” Ruth Zalph, 89, who traveled from North Carolina, was protesting against the climate crisis and militarism. She said if money was spent on the “military industrial complex”, it could not be spent on ending poverty and fighting rising temperatures. “I have a great-granddaughter who is six months old, and I’d like to see her grow up in a safe world where people are not having to fight for water and food,” Zalph said at the beginning of a roughly two-mile march to the White House."
"Up on the New South Wales mid-north coast, we don’t have many inner-city greenies. What we do have is a community that’s battling the worst fire conditions we’ve ever seen, and looking down the barrel of what might be the hardest week we’ve had to face.As our magnificent fire service works hard to contain the blazes threatening local lives and properties, it is galling to hear the deputy prime minister condemning anyone who draws the link between bushfires and climate change. Frankly, he’s pretty out of touch with how many people in my community are feeling right now. We’re in the middle of an unprecedented dry spell, with river levels sitting at the lowest they’ve ever been. This is not normally a dry area – the hotter, drier conditions that are driving the current catastrophic fire conditions have developed over the last 10 to 15 years. And the science tells us that it’s climate change causing it.To leave climate change out of this conversation is a betrayal of the regional communities that are threatened by these fires. How can we address the very real and growing threat to our safety while ignoring one of the major causes of unprecedented fire conditions?MidCoast Council, along with many other rural and regional councils, recently declared a climate emergency. We are not out of touch city dwellers, or politicians looking to score a strike against our opponents. We are a community that has recognised that addressing climate change is one of the most important ways in which we can keep our residents safe. The future out-of-control fires we feared are already here – this is our “new normal”, and the science tells us it’s only going to get worse unless urgent action is taken on climate change.As my community stands shoulder to shoulder to protect our homes and our bushland this week, I call on our state and federal leaders to put political point-scoring to one side and focus on what needs to be done to support us. And that includes acknowledging that climate change is fuelling the conditions for catastrophic fires, and that we need a new approach to respond to this increased threat. Claire Pontin is the deputy mayor of the MidCoast Council, NSW Bushfires usually aren’t a problem for us in Bellingen on the mid-north coast of New South Wales. However, in the past few months I’ve watched the massive fires on our escarpment grow and the blanket of smoke engulfing our towns thicken. As the mayor of Bellingen, I’m deeply concerned. Despite what Michael McCormack might think, it’s not just those in the inner city who are worried about climate change and bushfires – those of us in regional Australia living through an unprecedented fire season, which has already claimed several lives and many properties, are very worried about what’s in store this week, and over the coming summer. We’ve never seen conditions like this before. Drought and unseasonal heat driven by climate change are creating conditions for fires in forests that have never burned before, including in our forests of Antarctic beech. It’s no longer enough for our communities to be bushfire prepared. We urgently need to address the root cause of the heightened fire threat – climate change. As I write this, more and more communities in NSW are facing catastrophic fire conditions. And while our overworked and under-resourced emergency service teams are doing their best to keep our families and communities safe, ultimately, Australia is not prepared for a year-round bushfire season. We need to talk about climate change and bushfires together. To leave our rapidly changing climate out of the fire conversation is like talking about a car crash without mentioning speeding. Instead of burying their heads in the sand, governments at all levels must commit to meaningful action to drive down Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. We also need appropriate funding for councils and emergency services to do what we must to keep Australians as safe as possible. This increased bushfire threat cannot be faced alone, and as we head into what may be one of the toughest weeks for Australian communities on record, we need our leaders to acknowledge that a new approach is needed. The future of communities such as ours depends on it. Dominic King is the mayor of Bellingen"
"Suburban London is filled with greenery and lush growth; record crop harvests appear possible across Europe, and nothing too scary has been reported on the UK plant health risk register for some time either – so why the doom and gloom about plants? The bleak picture began with a recent report from the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew on the state of the world’s plants. An accompanying newspaper article went further, saying that botany in the UK was dead. Plants, apparently, are uncool. Looking back over a long career working with plants, I tried to remember when students flocked to study botany. Not only could I not recall those halcyon days, but I started to consider the demise of botany and the general pessimism about plant science. The annual Chelsea Flower Show had over 150,000 paying visitors this year, organised as ever by the Royal Horticultural Society, whose own membership nudges half a million. The horticultural industry is worth over £9 billion and employs over 37,000 people. All appears rosy on the garden front. Of course, there is much more to botany than just horticulture; step back into academia and there is no doubt that the study of plants has declined, as students have instead flocked to molecular biology and biotechnology. But botany was never a cool subject, even when prospective students had lots of courses to choose from. My honours class in the 1970s had a mere fraction of those studying zoology. Plant taxonomy was the least popular course. The module on identifying plants, species by family, was notable for its sheer tedium, however worthy and necessary these skills are to maintaining life on earth. The main beef of those lamenting the decline of botany is not that people don’t love plants or value them, but that we’re losing taxonomists. I have some sympathy for this point of view. Without a sound knowledge of plant species and their inter-relationships, we undermine the fundamentals of all living ecosystems. Plants are the bedrock of existence, as many authors have eloquently explored, and we need people to study them. Yet the lack of botany courses in UK universities hasn’t stopped new generations of botanists appearing, keen on taxonomy and skilled in plant identification. Trainspotting of sorts is in our genes. So in what new ways can budding botanists emerge? The decline of botany has been matched if not outstripped by a burgeoning of studies in ecology, biodiversity and all things environmental. I suspect that there are significant numbers of botanists in ecologist garb: the head of Kew’s science directorate is a plant ecologist, for example. Nor is plant taxonomy dead. The RHS has a head of horticultural taxonomy (paid for with private money) and it is clear that global initiatives to map plant diversity such as Species 2000 – which aims to create “a uniform and validated index to the world’s known (plant) species” – continue to thrive. Taxonomists in all areas of biology agonise a lot about terminal decline. The evidence doesn’t always support this bleak view, however. More importantly, the plant debate seems to ignore agriculture. The Kew report sees agriculture as a harmful practice, threatening natural resources, destroying wild habitats and so on. But not everyone grows oil palms, and it is hardly helpful to suggest that there are good and bad plants in assessing the state of research. There are billions of people who grow plants for their livelihoods, so it’s important to look more closely at how botanists view agriculture. Wild relatives of crop plants are as critically endangered as those with more appealing flowers and attractive foliage. Yet it will come as no surprise that the taxonomy of orchids is better known than that of bamboos. Or that in situ conservation of teosinte, a wild relative of maize, is infinitely more challenging than setting up seed banks. Kew’s interest in economically important plants has stuttered over the years. Visitors will struggle to find anything about agriculture when planning their itinerary, although plant scientists behind the scenes continue to study some key groups, such as palms.  Beyond the taxonomy debate, there is a wider concern for the teaching of whole plant biology. Again, I share this worry, although the scope of the concern seems unduly narrow. Despite the rise of molecular biology and genetics, there are still many countries where botany or plant science courses still exist. Want to study taxonomy? Go to Eastern Europe, Brazil, or the US, where plant sciences continue to thrive. People come to plants from many directions. The Brackenhurst Botanical Garden in Kenya was brought back to life by a zoologist who is a more passionate botanist than I ever was. The study of plants has been reinvented and, as scientists, we should take a more rounded view of where plants grow and who grows them. Who knows, maybe botany will one day become cool after all."
"I’m not sure if you had the pleasure of hearing our deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, on the wireless before 8am on Monday decrying the ravings of people he categorised as “pure, enlightened and woke capital-city greenies”. These would be the people daring to link catastrophic bushfires and climate change. In case you missed this sequence, our Michael rose, ate the sensible man’s breakfast presumably, and then fell into a passion in an ABC radio studio. The leader of the Nationals noted that sure, the onset of the fire season this year was “a tad early”, but we’d had fires in Australia “since time began”. He felt people battling a state of emergency needed help and shelter, not “ravings” or political point-scoring from Richard Di Natale and Adam Bandt.  The host of ABC Radio National Breakfast, Hamish Macdonald, then pointed out it wasn’t just Di Natale and Bandt discussing the documented link between climate change and wildfires – it was Carol Sparks, the mayor of Glen Innes, who stitched drought, climate change and fires together after her northern New South Wales town battled a wall of flame at the weekend that killed two locals. Bah. Old news, the Nationals leader offered. “We know it’s getting drier, we know it’s getting ... er, you know, situations in parts are getting very warm,” McCormack said, before indicating the government was taking sensible action on climate change – which was the kind of action that didn’t inconvenience anyone, and particularly not the coal industry. The deputy prime minister also thought Bandt, the bloke he kept name-checking, and those climate protestors in Melbourne, were getting “way too much publicity; they crave for that, they yearn for that”. These people, he asserted, were “inner-city raving lunatics”. There was an election in May, and the raving lunatics lost, so rather than just persisting there post-defeat, occupying 48.5% of the public space, losers should just shut up and let the non-ravers get on with putting the fires out. Because when you lose an election, all alternative policies, ideas and insights, whether informed by evidence or not, are cancelled – a new take on democracy for sure, but Michael is up for that kind of thing. Fresh thinking. Innovation. Given our deputy prime minister is currently less than calm – either because he’s under pressure and identifying an enemy and picking a fight with them creates a pleasing distraction, or because he believes his intermittently coherent “I’m OK and the rest of you are weirdos” sermonising is a political masterstroke – it is probably best that the rest of us remain perfectly tranquil. Let me say this next bit very clearly. The best way to decline Michael’s now rolling invitation to be tribal is to respond with reason, not with emotion. With that basic objective in mind a couple of things can be noted. Dear Michael. It is possible to do more than one thing at once. Perhaps multitasking has never been a particular strength of the deputy prime minister’s, and that’s fine, because juggling is certainly not for everyone, but I’ll venture it is possible for emergency services to extinguish fires and for politicians and various experts to speak informatively about the underlying causes of fires so catastrophic that they have been designated a state of emergency in the middle of November, not in mid-to-late summer. I reckon those things can happen simultaneously – both the analysing and the doing – without anything terrible happening or without anything fundamental being compromised. I think we are that clever. Truly, I do. To nominate just one example of how to do this, Richard Thornton, the chief executive of the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre, did this very successfully on Monday. He was asked whether now was an appropriate time to talk about climate change. Thornton said: “It’s always a good time to have a conversation around … what the impacts of climate change are going to be.” He said it was too early to say definitively these particular fires were the result of climate change, but “what we are seeing, and what we do know, is fire seasons are starting earlier”. “We know that cumulatively over the length of the fire season, there is a higher amount of fire danger during those times, so we’ve got a 1C increase in temperature over the long-term averages. All of the normal variations that we see between good years and bad years, now sits on top of an extra 1C in temperature – and that drives our fire weather that we see.” Another couple of things can be noted. The record of all governments, policy wise, is a relevant consideration. Not just some days, between the hours of 9 and 5, Tuesday to Thursday. But all days, at all hours. It’s not the only thing to talk about in the middle of an emergency, but it shouldn’t be off limits either. Bushfires don’t cancel accountability. Last thing. People worried about climate change, and the Coalition’s lack of policy action in this country, and the lack of action globally on the part of the big emitters, and the cumulative, potentially catastrophic consequences of that lack of action for human existence are not confined to an inner-city cabal. While the Coalition really wants climate change to be a story where an apocalyptic, sneering inner-city cabal is pitted against the sensible ones in just enough electorates to maintain Scott Morrison’s continued occupation of the prime ministership – the reality eclipses the graphic novel. People are worried about their future in the cities and in the region. Farmers hand-feeding their stock in a crippling drought are worried about climate change. People currently preparing their fire plans, and fleeing the flames, are also worried about climate change. Just to be clear. Worrying about climate change, worrying about whether enough is being done, worrying enough to try and do something, is not a manifestation of lunacy. Lunacy is not worrying about it.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Global Warming Policy Foundation recently announced that Professor Fritz Vahrenholt is joining its Academic Advisory Council. Early this year prominent meteorologist Prof. Lennart Bengtsson had also announced his membership, but later resigned amid a backlash from activist warmist scientists.
The Council is composed of scientists, economists and other experts who provide the GWPF with timely scientific, economic and policy advice. It reviews and evaluates new GWPF reports and papers, explores future research projects and makes recommendations on issues related to climate research and policy. Other distinguished scientist members of the GWPF Academic Advisory Council include Robert Carter, Freeman Dyson, Christopher Essex, William Happer, Richard Lindzen, Ross McKitrick, Ian Plimer, Paul Reiter, Nir Shaviv, Henrik Svensmark, Richard Tol and others.
Professor Fritz Vahrenholt was one of the founders of the environmental movement in Germany. In the 1980s his bestseller Seveso ist überall (Seveso is everywhere) triggered a nationwide debate which led to a fundamental reorientation of the chemical industry towards sustainable development.
NTZ inquired with Prof Vahrenholt, asking why he had joined the GWPF Council:
I very much appreciate Lord Lawson who in the GWPF has surrounded himself with scientists who are not prepared to alter scientific findings to suit the political mainstream.”
On the political and academic pressures being applied on dissenters, Prof Vahrenolt wrote in his e-mail response:

The socio-political pressure on those who refuse to hop onto the bandwagon of alarmism is immense. Scientists who reject the simplistic formula of Prof. Schellnhuber (there is a linear relationship between CO2 and temperature change) must create a platform to act as a counter-weight against faulty conclusions in science and politics.”
When asked about where he sees global warming science discussion is heading.
The real climate development over the coming years will unleash the discourse over the dead-ends of climate policy.”
As Vahrenholt shows, dissenting platforms are indeed forming while the real data trends act to rapidly undermine mainstream climate science and global warming policy. It’s only a matter of time.
Dr Vahrenholt holds a PhD in chemistry and is Honorary Professor at the Department of Chemistry at the University of Hamburg. Since 1969 he has been a member of the Social Democratic Party (SPD). From 1976 until 1997 he served in several public positions with environmental agencies such as the Federal Environment Agency, the Hessian Ministry of Environment and as Deputy Environment Minister and Senator of the City of Hamburg. He then held top management positions in the renewable energy industry.  Vahrenholt is a member of the Germany Academy of Technical Sciences and the Senate of the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft. His 2012 book The Neglected Sun sparked a broad public discussion in Germany about the dogmatism in climate science. He is currently the Chairman of the German Wildlife Trust.

"Several more decades of increased carbon dioxide emissions could lead to melting ice sheets, mass extinctions and extreme weather becoming the norm. We can’t yet be certain of the exact impacts, but we can look to the past to predict the future. We could start with the last time Earth experienced CO2 levels comparable to those expected in the near future, a period 56m to 34m years ago known as the Eocene.  The Eocene began as a period of extreme warmth around 10m years after the final dinosaurs died. Alligators lived in the Canadian Arctic while palm trees grew along the East Antarctic coastline. Over time, the planet gradually cooled, until the Eocene was brought to a close with the formation of a large ice sheet on Antarctica.  During the Eocene, carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in the atmosphere were much higher than today, with estimates usually ranging between 700 and 1,400 parts per million (ppm). As these values are similar to those anticipated by the end of this century (420 to 935ppm), scientists are increasingly using the Eocene to help predict future climate change. We’re particularly interested in the link between carbon dioxide levels and global temperature, often referred to as “equilibrium climate sensitivity” – the temperature change that results from a doubling of atmospheric CO2, once fast climate feedbacks (such as water vapour, clouds and sea ice) have had time to act. To investigate climate sensitivity during the Eocene we generated new estimates of CO2 throughout the period. Our study, written with colleagues from the Universities of Bristol, Cardiff and Southampton, is published in Nature.  As we can’t directly measure the Eocene’s carbon dioxide levels, we have to use “proxies” preserved within sedimentary rocks. Our study utilises planktonic foraminifera, tiny marine organisms which record the chemical composition of seawater in their shells. From these fossils we can figure out the acidity level of the ocean they lived in, which is in turn affected by the concentration of atmospheric CO2. We found that CO2 levels approximately halved during the Eocene, from around 1,400ppm to roughly 770ppm, which explains most of the sea surface cooling that occurred during the period. This supports previously unsubstantiated theories that carbon dioxide was responsible for the extreme warmth of the early Eocene and that its decline was responsible for the subsequent cooling. We then estimated global mean temperatures during the Eocene (again from proxies such as fossilised leaves or marine microfossils) and accounted for changes in vegetation, the position of the continents, and the lack of ice sheets. This yields a climate sensitivity value of 2.1°C to 4.6°C per doubling of CO2. This is similar to that predicted for our own warm future (1.5 to 4.5°C per doubling of CO2).  Our work reinforces previous findings which looked at sensitivity in more recent time intervals. It also gives us confidence that our Eocene-like future is well mapped out by current climate models.  Rich Pancost, a paleoclimate expert and co-author on both studies, explains: “Most importantly, the collective research into Earth history reveals that the climate can and has changed. And consequently, there is little doubt from our history that transforming fossil carbon underground into carbon dioxide in the air – as we are doing today – will significantly affect the climate we experience for the foreseeable future.” Our work also has implications for other elements of the climate system. Specifically, what is the impact of higher CO2 and a warmer climate upon the water cycle? A recent study investigating environmental change during the early Eocene – the warmest interval of the past 65m years – found an increase in global precipitation and evaporation rates and an increase in heat transport from the equator to the poles. The latter is consistent with leaf fossil evidence from the Arctic which suggests that high precipitation rates were common. However, changes in the water cycle are likely to vary between regions. For example, low to mid latitudes likely became drier overall, but with more intense, seasonal rainfall events. Although very few studies have investigated the water cycle of the Eocene, understanding how this operates during past warm climates could provide insights into the mechanisms which will govern future changes."
"A majority of the UK public and almost half of Conservative voters support a radical plan to transform the economy and tackle the climate crisis, a poll suggests. YouGov found that 56% of people back the total decarbonisation of the UK economy by 2030 and just under half support public spending to make large swathes of public transport free to use.  The findings appear to highlight a growing awareness of the scale of the climate crisis and the increasingly radical policy solutions the public is willing to support. Last week a separate survey found that the climate emergency would influence how most people vote, with almost two-thirds agreeing it was the biggest issue facing humankind. The new poll, commissioned by Green New Deal UK, a non-party-aligned campaign group, found that 47% of Conservative voters back a zero-emissions target by 2030, compared with just 16% who support the government’s current aim of reaching that point by 2050. Labour wants the UK to hit zero carbon by 2030 as part of its Green Industrial Revolution agenda, the Green party also has a target date of 2030, and the Liberal Democrats have set a target of 2045. Aliya Yule, a co-founder of Labour for a Green New Deal, which campaigned for Labour to adopt the 2030 target, said the polling showed next month’s vote was becoming the UK’s first “climate election”. “The figures demonstrate the huge public appetite for rapid and radical government action on climate change,” he said. Yule said only Labour’s Green Industrial Revolution plans – which aim to tie radical action on the environment to huge job creation and housing upgrade schemes – would address the scale of the crisis. “Not even Conservative voters support the Tories’ net zero 2050 target. They have no credibility on climate change, not even with their own supporters,” he added. “A target date of 2030 has been Green party policy for years,” said a Green party spokesperson. “The fact that the majority of people now support it shows how much concern about the climate emergency is accelerating, and how little support there is for the government’s policy of setting targets for mid-century and using that as an excuse to take very little action to achieve them.” This week student and pensioner groups called on the leaders of all the main parties to take part in a televised leaders’ debate on the climate. All agreed except for Boris Johnson, who did not respond. Noga Levy-Rapoport, a participant in the youth climate strikes, said: “This general election is our last chance to face up to the climate crisis. The public clearly support the most ambitious targets to decarbonise. “Parties should respond in kind by offering a Green New Deal which rapidly reduces emissions while improving living standards and expanding services like free bus travel.” "
"Many of society’s energy challenges require gigawatts of power, but many more are small – and some are entirely microscopic. To drive a new generation of tiny micromachines that could deliver drugs or clean traces of pollution, physicists are increasingly looking to biology for inspiration. In work published in the journal Science Advances, my co-authors and I present a simulation of a sort of tiny “windfarm” powered by the natural self-organisation of bacteria. It’s a small step towards harnessing the energy potential of microorganisms. We used computer simulations to model many swimming bacteria, such as the E. coli you find in your gut. A dense crowd of these swimming bacteria isn’t too different from traditional, passive liquid, though there’s one major exception: it spontaneously flows, with internal whirling currents. Physicists have started calling anything that spontaneously flows in this way an “active fluid”. It looks something like this: We first placed a solitary disc-shaped rotor in the midst of these chaotic swirling jets. Since the rotor was pinned in place but free to rotate, the turbulence randomly spun it in all directions, like a weather vane in a hurricane. However, when we included an entire array of closely arranged rotors on a grid, we saw something more interesting happen. Mimicking more complex biological self-organisation, the rotations spontaneously organised, with each rotor spinning in the opposite direction of its neighbour.  Every single rotor in our simulation permanently obeyed the pattern, as long as they were close enough together and a whirl of bacterial fluid was trapped around each one. This orderly spinning reminded us of a microscopic wind farm, powered not by gusts but by the surrounding bacteria. Without the rotors, the chaotic swirls of the bacterial flows randomly whirl in all directions. But when we added the rotors, they got in the way of this disordered mess.  Since the swirls couldn’t really fit well between the two rotors, the bacteria started whirling around and around each rotor. In a way, the rotors became the mechanical heart of each swirling jet of bacteria. They anchored the swirls in place and, in return, the bacteria permanently organised the spinning of the rotors.  The bacteria and the rotors form a partnership and out of that cooperation an organised pattern spontaneously occurs. Physicists call this natural emergence of a pattern “self-assembly”. Self-assembly is when simple building blocks organise themselves into complex structures or self-heal. It is spontaneous but orchestrated action. Nowhere is self-assembly more evident than in developing tissues, where cells move collectively into a part of an organism. Striking examples of this multicellular cooperation include gastrulation, an early step in an embryo’s development from a group of cells into a fully-fledged organism; or Volvox inversion, in which a colony of single-celled algae flips inside out. But these examples are both purely biological.  Our virtual prototype shows one specific case of a biological active fluid interacting with simple, man-made components. The fact that both a biological active fluid and tiny microengineered rotors are needed to get this ordering highlights how nature has already evolved incredibly efficient active materials that we could harness for hybrid bio-mechanical machines.  In fact, many of us physicists are already working on systems that involve both biology and micro-mechanical components that come together to self-organise. For instance, scientists have just developed a ray-like swimming robot with a microfabricated skeleton and a rubber body that is powered by heart muscle cells.  That’s the long-term goal: to build tiny machines that don’t struggle against biology, but instead work seamlessly with or even depend on it. Our ability to engineer the microscopic world is an exciting prospect for the future."
"If you hear a bird singing in the spring, you might assume it’s calling to a potential mate in the hope of producing offspring. But in parts of the UK, birdsong could be helping to mask the fact that the populations of certain species are in sharp decline. Our research into willow warblers has found that, in a growing number of locations, many males are failing to attract a mate – with significant consequences for the species. Using data from surveys of willow warbler populations across the UK, we found that the male-to-female ratio has changed from about 50:50 in 1994 to about 60:40 in 2012. But we also found this male bias was greater in small populations of birds, which are particularly common in the agriculture-dominated regions of south-east Britain. This suggests that the fragmented patches of remaining habitat in these areas can attract male but not female warblers. This skews the national populations and shrinks these small populations further because not enough females means fewer offspring. The fact that male birds sing makes them much easier to count than females, so when scientists want to measure wild bird populations they usually count the singing males and use that to estimate the total. However, this doesn’t give us a clear picture of the ratio between males and females in a specific location, especially as unpaired males often sing for longer than paired males during the breeding season. Capturing birds in mist nets (very fine nylon nets that are virtually invisible) can give more accurate estimates of numbers of males and females. Across the UK, citizen scientists catch, ring and recapture birds as part of the British Trust for Ornithology Constant Effort Sites Scheme. Capturing and recapturing ringed males and females allows us to calculate sex ratios and survival rates. To do this, we have to take into account the fact that we’re more likely to capture males during the breeding season because of the way they move around and spend less time at the nest than females. Together with our colleagues Rob Robinson and Jacquie Clark, we studied this British Trust for Ornithology data about captured and recaptured willow warblers to produce a more accurate picture of sex ratios. We found that male-bias is more common in areas with small populations, which are now widespread across much of southern and eastern England. This could be because females have lower annual survival rates than males. But the difference between these survival rates wasn’t consistently greater in the male-dominated populations. And survival rates of males and females have not changed over the period in which male bias has become more common.  If females are less common in small populations, despite being no more likely to die, this suggests that they must be less likely to join these small populations. Most breeding birds return to the same breeding sites each year, and males often breed close to the area in which they were hatched. But females are more likely to disperse and select a breeding location elsewhere. Our findings suggest that females are more likely to choose busier breeding locations where the abundance of willow warblers is higher and the habitat is likely to be of a better quality. If females are more attracted to sites where there are more willow warblers in the first place, then to tackle the declining national population we should focus on creating and maintaining habitats that can support large numbers of birds. While small patches of habitat might be enough for a male to set up a territory, females looking for a mate find these conditions less attractive. And they may simply be less likely to encounter sparsely distributed lone males."
"The Spiny Forest is like nowhere else on Earth, but it’s disappearing fast. It’s a bizarre Dr Seussian world of spiky octopus trees and swollen baobabs, and almost all its species exist only in Madagascar. The strange vegetation teems with even weirder wildlife: there are ghostly white lemurs impervious to thorns, birds that sing communally, and a chameleon that spends most of its life as an egg. Once there were ten-foot tall elephant birds and gorilla-sized lemurs too, but they went extinct just a few centuries ago. Unsurprisingly, scientists have long ranked the Spiny Forest as one of the world’s most important “ecoregions”. Even so, hardly anyone outside Madagascar has heard of it. The tragedy is that the Spiny Forest is rapidly, silently, going up in smoke while the world looks the other way. Southern Madagascar is a dry and impoverished region with little in the way of infrastructure or industry. Most of the population scrapes a living from the land, as cattle herders and farmers, or as fishermen at sea. People also depend on the forest’s essential resources, such as construction wood and fuel, medicinal plants, wild yams and “bushmeat”, among other things. So why is it disappearing so fast? There are two main causes of deforestation – shifting cultivation (also known as slash-and-burn agriculture), and the production of charcoal. Here charcoal is not just a novelty for barbecues, but the fuel that cooks almost every meal. Making it involves baking the Spiny Forest’s precious hardwood trees in makeshift earth ovens, and it’s a gruelling job. Nonetheless, it’s a growing menace. In 2010 my colleagues at the WWF noticed a huge increase in the amount of charcoal being produced in the forest of Ranobe. Ranobe is the richest area in the whole Spiny Forest for lemurs and other wildlife, and it had just been declared a new protected area, so we needed to find out what was going on. I wanted to know what had driven the change, so I interviewed more than 200 charcoal producers to find out. Many had previously been farmers but had given it up – they couldn’t predict the rains any more due to the changing seasons, so their crops failed and yielded nothing. Even areas with irrigation suffered, as the region’s few ageing dams and canals had fallen into disrepair. Nor was it just the farmers who were suffering. Some charcoal makers had been fishermen, but decades of overfishing meant there weren’t enough fish left to catch. Others had been herders, but had lost their cattle to rustlers. With growing families and rising costs of living, money was an issue for everyone, and traditional ways of life just weren’t paying the bills anymore. With nowhere else to turn, desperate communities were descending on the Spiny Forest. The forest, it seems, acts as a safety net. Rural Malagasy people don’t want to produce charcoal or carry out shifting cultivation; they’d rather farm, fish, or find a salaried job. Unfortunately, there simply aren’t many options in the Spiny Forest, and the importance of the forest as a backup seems set to grow as climate change continues to disrupt the region’s weather. The trouble is, practices like charcoal production are tearing huge holes in the forest safety net. However, all is not yet lost. Hundreds of dedicated conservationists are working up and down the island, developing innovative solutions to the nation’s environmental crisis. What’s more, the Malagasy government has spent the past decade creating dozens of new parks and reserves, including several in the Spiny Forest. The tide may be starting to turn, but these efforts need the support of the world. Can we save the Spiny Forest and the safety net it provides?"

Share this...FacebookTwitterLooks like the anti-capitalist, tree-hugging Greenpeace organization doesn’t practice what it preaches when it comes to the evils of capitalism.
A number of newspapers in the German speaking part of Europe are reporting how the environmental activist organization took millions of the money received as private donations and has blown it in high-risk casino-grade investments – instead of using it to protect the environment.
Spiegel here reports, “Greenpeace has been rocked by a finance scandal” and that it has “blown millions from donations“. According to Spiegel:
An employee at Greenpeace Central in Amsterdam lost a total of 3.8 million euros in currency speculation. According to Spiegel information, the money comes from donations transferred to Amsterdam Central from financially sound Greenpeace regional organizations like those in Germany…”
Note how the blame gets shifted to “an employee”, as if Greenpeace management is not accountable. Well, management is responsible and those donating deserves answers as to why their donations were being blown in dubious get-rich-quick schemes.

According to Spiegel, the employee was betting on a falling euro. Mike Townsley of Greenpeace International says the employee has since been sacked and calls the bad speculation “a serious miscalculation”, which was discovered by an “internal control system”. Greenpeace assures that the problem is solved and everything is back in order.
Instead of firing the poor employee, Greenpeace could have taken the socially compassionate step of sending him to training, or perhaps to Gamblers Anonymous. But no, instead they do the cold-hearted capitalistic thing and throw him out onto the streets. Or better yet, they could pay him a huge bonus, and then ask the government for a bailout.
Spiegel writes that the money had been earmarked to set up regional Greenpeace offices. But that money is gone, and the loss is deemed as “substantial”.
I remember Greenpeace activists asking me for a donation on the streets of Rome when I visited last April. Boy, I sure am glad I didn’t give them anything.
As one Spiegel reader comments, “Like everywhere, it’s easier to speculate with other people’s money.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterSkeptic site Die kalte Sonne here features a video with leading German IPCC critic Fritz Vahrenholt taking part in a heated podium discussion last month. The event was held by the Steiermark Chamber of Commerce (WKO) in Graz, Austria. The topic: “Climate change under scrutiny”.
The video can be seen at the WKO-website and at Youtube:

In his presentation Vahrenholt starts by showing how the IPCC is needlessly spreading panic and how they under-estimate the impacts of natural factors. He reminds the audience of 200 that global temperatures have not risen since 1998.
As Europe and Germany hastily attempt to barrel ahead in switching to renewable energy, Vahrenholt warns that the switch “is not sensible” and is “threatening prosperity“. To underscore the absurdity of Europe’s trillion-euro green-energy project, Vahrenholt tells the audience:
Everything we do, at great cost, to reduce CO2 over the next 15 years, up to 2030, will be wiped out in China in just 6 weeks.”
Vahrenholt’s presentation was then rebutted by climate scientist Gottfried Kirchengast of the Wegener Institute, who claimed IPCC science is well-founded and that the planet is facing “weather extremes, ocean-acidification and mass human migration”, which he supported using colorful models and charts.

Vahrenholt foresees cooler world in 10 years
Near the end of the discussion, Vahrenholt reminds that those who destroy society and jobs in their rush to implement green energies will have to bear the ethical responsibility and answer in the future.
Vahrenholt also foresees a cooler world in 10 years, claiming it’s going to happen because of the natural forcings.
Kirchengast countered, accusing Vahrenholt of spreading false information and indirectly compared skeptics to flat-earthers. “There are some people who still think the earth is flat.”
The narrator then summed up by saying that “audience’s opinion at the end of the evening was divided“.
Unsurprisingly the format overall was stacked against Vahrenholt as the other podium participants were all warmists…the usual attempted ambush.

"When Greta Thunberg began her school strike outside the Swedish parliament in 2018, she was alone. Within months, thousands and then millions followed her example. Some of the most enthusiastic school strikers have been in Belgium, inadvertently launching a national movement that bridges the country’s entrenched linguistic divide.  In the first few months of this year, Belgian teenagers organised 20 weeks of school strikes, events that led to the resignation of a regional environment minister, who had made false claims that the strikes were directed by foreign powers. Last month, two of the young women who led the Belgian school strikes embarked on a transatlantic voyage to South America with the initial goal of reaching the UN climate conference in Chile. But events did not go to plan. Four weeks into the journey, 36 climate activists from across Europe sailing on the Regina Maris schooner had reached Cape Verde, the island nation off the coast of west Africa, when they heard of Chile’s abrupt decision to cancel hosting the meeting. “It’s heartbreaking news,” wrote Anuna De Wever, one of the founders of the Flanders school strikes, who also voiced “full support to the people power in Chile”. She and Adélaïde Charlier, the Francophone voice of Belgium’s school strikes, both aged 18, are the two youngest on board the Regina Maris, which aims to cross the Atlantic by wind power alone. They had hoped to be at the UN meeting “to hold our politicians responsible for their lack of ambition”, De Wever said. With no certainty on where the UN meeting would take place, the group decided to go to South America regardless. The Belgian women wanted to keep a promise to meet South American activists who are working to protect the Amazon. A spokesman for the group said its main aim was unchanged: “Putting the climate impact of aviation on the international agenda.” The day after they left Cape Verde, organisers announced the UN meeting would take place in Madrid. This means the young crew will be on the wrong side of the world just as the meeting is getting under way. Thunberg hopes to get a lift to Madrid, but those on the Regina Maris acknowledge they cannot make it in time. Instead, the activists are rethinking how they will get their message to global leaders in Madrid, as well as putting pressure on domestic politicians. Belgium was the second country to undergo the industrial revolution, but its complicated, decentralised politics are hampering efforts to tackle the legacy of coal and steel. The nation of 11.4 million people and six parliaments is on track to miss climate targets in 2020 and 2030, according to the latest progress report from the European commission. Belgium has some of the worst traffic jams in Europe, energy-profligate buildings and a saturated railway network. The last straw for Belgian young people came when the environment minister, Marie-Christine Marghem, took a private jet to the 2018 UN climate summit in Katowice, while Belgium declined to join “the high ambition coalition” – a group of countries pledging extra efforts to tackle the climate emergency. The text was signed by Belgium’s neighbours, including France, Germany, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and the UK. “No, it was not a joke, it was true,” recalled De Wever of Marghem’s flight, in a book about the Flemish school strike movement that she launched with fellow activist Kyra Gantois. “It was at that point, sitting at the kitchen table, that we looked each other in the eye and said: enough is enough.” Launched by the two young women in Flanders, the strikes soon spread to Francophone regions, making them a rare national movement in a country where the linguistic faultline cuts through political parties, newspapers and television stations. “It is Flemish and French,” De Wever said. “Sometimes there are some arguments, especially in politics, but we don’t care about that and we want to unite everyone to fight with us.” Leading the movement must have heaped pressure on the young activists. At a recent climate march, Charlier was surrounded by enthusiastic participants asking her to sign their reusable water bottles. De Wever has experienced the ugly side of being in the public eye: she and her friends complained to the police after her tent was ransacked and they were pelted with urine-filled bottles at a music festival this summer. “It’s a lot sometimes,” she said, sounding buoyant after thousands turned out to the Brussels gathering of the September global climate strike. “You get the good and the bad, but at the end of the day, it is all worth it because it is amazing to see so many people coming on the streets, and you get this result,” De Wever said. One of the school strikers’ champions is the Belgian climate scientist Jean-Pascal van Ypersele, a former vice-chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. He helped the young activists draft a manifesto and said they had succeeded in putting the climate emergency on the agenda. “[The results] are not a full success, but they are not done, their determination to continue is clear,” he said. For now, the school strikers are battling Belgium’s highly decentralised political system. Dave Sinardet, a political science professor at Free University of Brussels, said: “The federal level is not competent to overrule the regions if they would not reach certain targets. “So instead of having a dynamic where the different regions push each other upwards, they rather have a dynamic where they push each other downwards: everybody is looking at the other one saying, ‘you should do more’, so that’s clearly a problem.” The political scientist argued the school strikes did not lead to expected gains for climate-action parties at the 2019 elections. While Greens made gains in French-speaking Wallonia and the federal parliament, these were “not as good as expected”, Sinardet said, while in Flanders, “you don’t see much climate ambition”. It remains unclear whether Belgium can find a more decisive response to the climate emergency, following election results that left the country more divided than ever. Flanders moved right with gains for the centre-right Flemish nationalists and the far right, while Wallonia swung left, with victory for the Socialists. More than 170 days after the elections in late May, Belgium remains without a federal government, although the country has signed up to an EU plan for net-zero emissions by 2050. For Van Ypersele, a professor at the Université catholique de Louvain, the 2050 target is inadequate. The climate scientist is calling on the EU to reduce emissions to net zero by 2040 to keep global heating below 1.5C, the threshold for avoiding catastrophic climate change. “We are heading on a train which is moving at a 100km an hour towards a wall … If we only hit the wall when we are travelling at 20km an hour, everyone understands that the damage to the passengers on the train will be infinitely smaller than if we hit the wall at 80km or 60km an hour,” he said. “It would be better to get to net zero tomorrow morning [ie in] 2040 rather than 2050. It would already be so much better [to get to] 2050 than never.”"
"Growing concern about the climate crisis and the “Greta Thunberg effect” are driving huge increases in individuals and businesses choosing to offset their emissions by investing in carbon-reducing projects in developing countries. NGOs and organisations involved in carbon offsetting have seen as much as a fourfold increase in investment from people who want to try to mitigate their carbon footprints.  Agencies who work with large corporations have also seen a spike in investment in carbon offsetting over the last 18 months. ClimateCare, a company that provides programmes to help organisations offset residual carbon emissions, has seen the amount of carbon offset increase from about 2m tonnes to 20m tonnes in that time, according to its chief executive, Edward Hanrahan. Smaller organisations have also reported massive spikes in offsetting. Caroline Pomeroy, the director of the NGO Climate Stewards, which offsets emissions for individuals and small businesses, said income from individuals offsetting had increased by 156% year on year, and that there had been an 80% increase in income from businesses and charities offsetting. Offsetting means calculating emissions and then purchasing equivalent “credits” from projects that prevent or remove the emissions of an equivalent amount of greenhouse gases elsewhere. Carbon offsetting has been controversial, with some critics saying it allows big polluters and individuals to buy carbon credits in exchange for a clean conscience while continuing to fly, drive and use fossil fuels. But in the past 10 years, highly regulated global carbon and renewable energy markets have been created and participating companies and NGOs are theoretically held to international standards by independent verifiers. The organisation Gold Standard was set up by the environment group WWF and other NGOs to ensure the integrity of projects that reduced carbon emissions and to ensure they contribute to sustainable development. Sarah Leugers, its communications director, said: “Everyone should be looking to reduce their emissions as much as possible first, but for most of us it is impossible at this time to reduce them to zero, so taking accountability and financing the reduction in emissions somewhere else in the world is a way to accelerate the path to a low carbon economy.” Hanrahan said large organisations were being driven to be responsible for not only the emissions that they created as a company, but also so-called “Scope 3 emissions” from the use of their products, by a combination of consumer pressure and governments pushing for corporations to become more accountable for their impact on the climate. Leugers said transformative projects were those that improved cooking facilities in the developing world, for example by providing biogas stoves and projects that improved access to clean water, thus reducing greenhouse gases from burning firewood to boil water. “These are life-changing for people in the developing world and have real impact on reducing carbon emissions,” she said. Gold Standard has  reported a fourfold increase in income from individuals and small businesses paying for carbon offsets through its platform. “People are willing to take action and are looking for ways to take action. We see it as a way that someone can feel empowered and reduce their carbon footprint,” said Leugers. Climate Stewards funds a project in Nepal paid for by the purchase of carbon offsets, where 240 fuel-efficient cooking stoves have been built for remote communities. Each stove saves 6.5 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year per household and the stoves last for about 10 years. The price for a tonne of CO2 is not set globally, and varies between offset suppliers on the voluntary market. The US Environmental Protection Agency in 2015 assessed that for every tonne of CO2emitted into the atmosphere, we sacrifice between $11 and $212 in environmental degradation and negative social impacts. David Hughes, the chair of Climate Stewards, said: “This year, the whole business of carbon offsetting has suddenly taken off. It has been so gratifying to see a lot of individuals choosing to offset over the last 12 months – the numbers have more than doubled. “We are seeing the Greta effect, the impact of Extinction Rebellion, the impact of the words of David Attenborough, the school strikes, all of these coming together.” But Hanrahan said while voluntary carbon mitigation and individual actions were laudable, ClimateCare was clear in its call for mandatory carbon pricing and mitigation for large corporations and industries like aviation. “Our position is that this should not be an optional or voluntary thing. Expecting individuals to be able to make fully informed decisions about such a specialist, complex area is madness,” he said. “What we want is a scenario where corporates are mandated to pay a price on carbon that reflects the societal cost of dealing with climate change and carbon emissions, and to pay for mitigating their emissions.” Flying to and from Malaysia to visit his family each year was causing increasing concern to Shanon Shah, a freelance writer from London. Through his partner, an Anglican priest, he was introduced to Climate Stewards, and began to see a way in which he could compensate for his carbon footprint. “But then I thought, it isn’t enough to offset the flights that I am going to take in the future, as I take them. I sat down and tried to remember all the flights I had ever taken in my life. “And bit by bit I accounted for my flying in the past. Every few weeks when I got a paycheck I offset a few of the past flights that I had made over a particular period. Over the course of six or seven months, I managed to offset all the flights I can ever remember taking. That was around 35 flights.” Shah is continuing his mission to reduce and mitigate his own emissions. “From now on, every time I book a flight I offset it.” But Shah thinks the airline industry itself has to be made accountable for its emissions. Emissions from international aviation are not included in national inventories of their emissions, and under the Kyoto protocol – something there is growing pressure to change – aviation is not subject to VAT or fuel tax. “It has excluded itself from all these environmental protocols, and there should be more pressure to make their emissions accountable,” said Shah. “But in the meantime I think that this is something I can do as an individual.” In Stoke-on-Trent, Daniel Charlesworth, 24, who works for the police, has made a similar decision. He has chosen to offset all his car travel. “I have been researching electric cars for months, but there is a lot of life left in my car and I cannot afford an equivalent electric car,” he said. “So I have begun offsetting my journeys each month and set up a direct debit, I think it amounts to about £7 per month. “I know that even if you have thousands and thousands of individuals like me doing the same it is not going to make a huge difference, but I feel I have a personal responsibility to be accountable for my emissions. And if what I am doing leads others to do it as well, it can help to drive change.”"
"Floods are often presented as human interest stories of stranded grannies and rescued pets, but their impact on hidden infrastructure is just as severe. In late 2015 for instance, a number of power systems and phone exchanges were inundated in Leeds and York which cut off thousands of homes, businesses (who were unable to process card payments), bank machines and even police and hospital services on Tyneside, 100 miles away.  But it’s not just floods and it’s not just phone lines. In fact, a major new peer-reviewed report highlights how, across the UK, the country’s infrastructure – services such as energy, transport and sanitation that are essential for modern society – is already experiencing significant impacts from severe weather related to climate change. Unchecked, the projected increases in flooding will lead to more disruption of infrastructure.  Furthermore, gradual changes in our climate, such as a rise in average temperatures, will reduce capacity and increase running costs.   The Climate Change Risk Assessment report, published by independent advisory body the Committee on Climate Change, is the result of years of collaboration by hundreds of leading experts. I led on the infrastructure strand of the report. Some of the key risks colleagues and I found include: A significant proportion of Britain’s infrastructure is already exposed to coastal, river, groundwater or surface water flooding. This includes more than 40% of the power stations, and nearly one fifth of railway track in England. Across the UK, the number of infrastructure assets exposed could double under expected changes in climate by the 2080s. Warmer weather will place additional pressures on the rail, road, water and energy sectors. Higher temperatures create a risk of buckling on the rail network, causing electricity cables to sag and operate less effectively, and road tarmac to soften and rut. Components such as signalling equipment can overheat and fail. Extended periods of low rainfall, and associated low river flows and groundwater levels, coupled with population growth, are projected to lead to water supply deficits across England and in some other parts of the UK by the 2050s. Widespread water shortages are projected by the 2080s. Nearly 10% of the UK’s transport and road network is already at medium to high risk of disruption from landslides. It’s likely the UK will see extended periods of rainfall in future, increasing the risk of slope and embankment failure. Infrastructure networks are increasingly reliant on each other – for power, control (through digital communications) and transport access for deliveries or servicing. Climate-related risks to infrastructure can now have far wider impact on the economy and people’s health and well-being as a result of this interconnectivity. Extreme events, including the summer floods of 2007 and the storms of the past few winters, have exposed the vulnerability of Britain’s infrastructure and our limited understanding of how it all plugs together. The Yorkshire phone exchange example above is one of many such incidences, and an increased reliance on “smart” technologies will increase our exposure to this particular risk.  Our analysis also identified other emerging risks from interconnectivity. For example, if a shortage of rain means rivers are running low then drinking water will obviously be affected – but also electricity supplies. Almost a quarter of the energy generated in the UK uses water from rivers to cool power plants. Problem is: no one seems to quite realise just how interconnected our infrastructure has become, and no one seems to be in charge of dealing with this risk. Most infrastructure sectors are already taking significant steps to manage these risks. Electricity companies have committed to invest around £400m to protect their most vulnerable sub-stations and power lines from flooding, for example. However, many of these adaptation actions are only sufficient for the next decade or two and, while this may seem far away, it can take years to plan and build major infrastructure like bridges and railway lines which might be expected to last 50-100 years, or several hundred years in the case of London’s sewers. Climate risks should be considered in all infrastructure decisions – after all, retrospective action decades from now would be more expensive and disruptive than getting it right first time. The UK needs a common and coherent framework for assessing risks from climate change, to guide everyone from road builders and town planners to power companies and sewage works. It won’t be easy. Such a programme will need to draw upon the very best that industry, government and academia has to offer to deliver something that is collectively owned and maintained.  We all know the climate is changing. We know infrastructure will be affected. But without a significant effort to develop a coherent way of assessing the risks from climate change, our response will continue to be reactive and ad hoc."
"The Greens’ electoral alliance with the Liberal Democrats (and Plaid Cymru) risks throwing their eco-socialism out with the remain bathwater (Report, 8 November). Greens have far more in common with Labour. Unlike the Lib Dems, Labour and the Greens support the radical transformation of society. Labour’s target is decarbonisation by 2030, the Lib Dems’ is 2045. Like 56% of voters (Majority of UK public back 2030 zero-carbon target – poll, 7 November), Greens are more likely to support Labour’s policy.  It is no coincidence that only Labour and Green MPs are contributors to Extinction Rebellion’s handbook This Is Not A Drill. Back in April, protesters chained themselves to Jeremy Corbyn’s gate, not Jo Swinson’s, saying he was the “best hope this country has got” to meet the challenges of the climate crisis. Furthermore, it is Labour’s shadow chancellor who promises to use every lever of government to fight the climate emergency. Like the Greens, Labour would never enter a coalition with the austerity-creating Tories. On Europe, the Greens and Labour support the most democratic solution (a second referendum) and their politicians play active and influential roles in the pro-remain leftwing Another Europe is Possible campaign. The climate emergency is the most important issue facing us. For this reason, tactical votes in marginal seats should be for Labour. The risk – in this uniquely important election – is letting in the hard Brexit Tories. And like Labour voters, Greens understand how destructive this will be in the fight against the climate emergency.Magi YoungExeter • Almost 33 years ago, in January 1987, you published a letter from Nina Fishman, the Labour and trade union activist, calling for a tactical voting campaign for the coming general election. She was hoping to at least offset the coming third victory of Margaret Thatcher to some extent. That letter led to the first significant organised television campaign. Sadly, Nina died in 2009 (you published an excellent obituary of her by Donald Sassoon). She would have been frustrated to see that electoral reform has still not been introduced for UK elections, and sad about the Labour party’s failure to understand the value of tactical voting. Among other things, that gave us a majority Tory government in 2015, and hence the Brexit crisis. But she would have been delighted by the historic pact between Liberal Democrats, Greens and Plaid Cymru. This is the first proper application of tactical voting by established parties. It could well deprive the Tories of a majority on 12 December. If Labour was able to enter a similar agreement it could do far more.Tim JohnsonLondon • It is ironic that Unite to Remain, founded by Heidi Allen when she was an Independent MP, has become a three-way deal between the Liberal Democrats, Greens and Plaid Cymru, excluding the only grassroots pro-remain independent with a chance of winning: Claire Wright in East Devon. Claire won more than 21,000 votes (35%) in 2017 to the Tories’ 29,000, while the Lib Dems gained less than 1,500. Independents also won by far the largest share of votes and seats in this year’s council elections.

Share this...FacebookTwitterJust a few days ago, the IPCC WG III report claimed that CO2 emissions could be curbed with little pain involved. Well, go tell it to the more than 300,000 Germans who have had their power shut off in a single year because they no longer can afford skyrocketing electric bills. And these people live in a rich country!
And imagine what expensive power means for poor, developing countries. In such countries it’s nothing short of widespread catastrophe and grinding misery.
The online site of German news television station NTV writes of a threatening energy poverty taking hold in Europe and that”more and more people are unable to pay for the electricity that they consume. More than 300,000 German citizens are going to have their power shut off each year.”
Hat tip: DirkH
NTV cites a report from German nation daily Die Welt, which writes German power companies turned off the power for 321,539 people because of non-payment in 2012, up from 312,500 people in 2011.
The reason for the high prices? NTV writes:
A reason for the increased number of power shutoffs is the rash expansion of renewable energies, which lead to higher energy prices.”
Two years ago NoTricksZone reported on an article also from Die Welt who claimed that 600,000 households were getting their power cut off. The figures on power service cutoffs vary broadly. Whichever figure is correct, the scale of the social disaster is immense no matter how you look at it.
It’s time to make energy affordable and attractive for every socioeconomic level, and not a luxury good for the upper classes.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThere are lots of claims on how successful Germany’s renewable energy program has been. Feed-in tariffs mandated by the government guaranteed profits for windpark investors and operators. You couldn’t lose. So it seemed at first.
Unfortunately outputs promised by wind turbine manufacturers and proponents have fallen short of expectations. Moreover, high maintenance costs have in many cases eliminated profits and resulted in losses for investors. As generous as the subsidies may be, profit from wind can be elusive.
So it comes as no surprise when we here how a group of 60 limited partners near Ettenheim southwest Germany have decided to dissolve the wind turbine operating company they had set up in December, 2000. Story in German at www.windwahn.de here. It lost money.
The 60 limited partners unanimously voted on Wednesday to shut down and liquidate the Windpark Ettenheim GmbH & Co. According to Windwahn, the wind turbine had been supplied by Nordex and “did not yield the expected performance“, so says managing director Andreas Markowsky.
Windwahn writes:

It stood still for years, and finally it was taken down in the summer of 2013. In the meantime the concrete pad has also been removed. After the liquidation is completed, the area where the turbine stood will be re-naturalized under the supervision of forest authorities. …The wind turbine did not pay off.”
Windwahn writes that the turbine had been supplied by Nordex and came with a 5-year maintenance contract. But in the end, the turbine remained plagued by technical problems and the 60 partners all had to take a moderate loss on the investment: a bit more than 1000 euros per 2500 euro share.
Markowsky says that the turbine had serious technical problems from the start. For example when winds were strong during stormy weather, the turbine stood still instead of producing maximum output. The limited partners even had to take Nordex to court in bid to be awarded compensation in the amount of 1.8 million euros. Windwahn writes that the case dragged on for 5 years, during which the turbine remained idle and did not deliver any power. Finally, the court awarded the limited partners 1.4 million euros in compensation.
The limited partners had the chance to reduce their losses by taking advantage of the re-powering bonus offered by the German government. Under the scheme turbine operators are paid a bonus to trade up their old turbines for newer, more efficient ones. However, the bonus has been scrapped by the German government, effective August 1, and the offer ultimately was passed up.
The 60 limited partners have had enough of the wind energy business.

"British Airways has pledged to review its practice of making aircraft carry tonnes of excess fuel to avoid filling up at destination airports, which saves money but drives up CO2 emissions. Willie Walsh, chief executive of BA’s parent company IAG, admitted that using the method – called “fuel tankering” within the industry – was “maybe the wrong thing to do” despite the financial incentive behind the practice, because of its environmental impact. Critics said the widespread use of fuel tankering called into question airlines’ commitment to reducing their impact on the environment. The information of excess fuel carriage came from a BA insider during a BBC Panorama investigation. IAG recently tried to burnish its environmental credentials with a commitment to become the first airline group worldwide to commit to net zero emissions by 2050. The Committee on Climate Change says cutting greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 is necessary, affordable and desirable. Here are some of the actions needed to make that happen: • Petrol and diesel cars banned from sale ideally by 2030 and 2035 at the latest. • Quadrupling clean electricity production from wind, solar and perhaps nuclear, plus batteries to store it and connections to Europe to share the load. • Connection of new homes to the gas grid ending in 2025, with boilers using clean hydrogen or replaced by electric powered heat pumps. Plus, all homes and appliances being highly efficient.   • Beef, lamb and dairy consumption falling by 20%, though this is far lower than other studies recommend and a bigger shift to plant-based diets would make meeting the zero target easier. • A fifth of all farmland – 15% of the UK – being converted to tree planting and growing biofuel crops and restoration of peat bogs. This is vital to take CO2 out of the air to balance unavoidable emissions from cattle and planes. • 1.5bn new trees will be needed, meaning more than 150 football pitches a day of new forests from now to 2050. • Flying would not be banned, but the number of flights will depend on how much airlines can cut emissions with electric planes or biofuels.  However, documents seen by the BBC showed a recent BA flight to Italy took on board nearly three tonnes of extra fuel: a cost saving of just £40 but which meant an additional 600kg of CO2 was emitted. Speaking to analysts last week, Walsh said BA often did fuel tankering in order to save money, citing the example of Glasgow airport where jet fuel is 25% more expensive than at Heathrow. However, Walsh said BA was now considering its position on the practice. “We continue to do tankering today. We’re challenging that, we’re asking ourselves whether this is sustainable, and whether we should be pricing in the environmental impact of that. “Clearly the financial savings incentivise us to do tankering. But maybe that’s the wrong thing to do.” BA said that its fuel tankering generated 18,000 tonnes of additional CO2 per year – less than 0.1% of its overall emissions – and that it accounted for 2% of tankering in Europe. A report from Eurocontrol, which coordinates air traffic control for Europe, estimated that airlines save a total €265m (£229m) a year through using the practice within Europe – but at the cost of an additional 901,000 tonnes of CO2. John Sauven, Greenpeace UK’s executive director said it was a “classic example of a company putting profit before planet … they’ll happily pour extra fuel on the fire for a small boost to their profit margin.” Meanwhile, a climate expert described a carbon offsetting scheme offered to customers by Ryanair as “woefully inadequate”. Passengers can pay a voluntary €1 donation when booking. Simon Lewis, professor of global change science at University College London, said that tree planting schemes funded by Ryanair in Ireland and Portugal would offset just 0.01% of the airline’s emissions. He said: “To me, that’s a green gimmick.” Michael O’Leary, Ryanair’s chief executive, told Panorama: “From little acorns grow mighty trees.”"
"The shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, issued a plea last night to set aside public debates about climate change while communities are fighting for their lives and homes in the face of unprecedented bushfires. Speaking at the beginning of ABC TV’s Q&A program last night, Butler said his political colleagues on all sides should stick to an unwritten protocol of “putting political disputes aside” while people were in harm’s way during emergencies.  Butler’s comments came the evening after the morning of an incendiary statement from the deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, who said anyone linking climate change to Australia’s ongoing bushfire disaster were the “ravings” of “pure, enlightened and woke capital-city greenies”. Fire authorities in New South Wales and Queensland are warning of horrific conditions for bushfires on Tuesday and Wednesday, with some areas seeing warnings hit “catastrophic” levels for the first time since the new category was added to the top of the fire danger index in 2009. Butler said while McCormack had appeared to have been reacting to statements from the Greens MP, Adam Bandt, the deputy prime minister should have “stayed above it” instead of entering into a public fight that was “beneath the office of the deputy prime minister”. Butler said instead of covering the impacts of the bushfires and the responses of communities to them, television news bulletins were concentrating instead on a political spat. There would be a time for a serious debate on the impacts of climate change, he said, but “that time is not right now”. If Butler’s plea to keep the climate change debate out of the bushfire response was meant to calm the Q&A audience and his fellow panellists, then it worked. But ignoring Butler’s request, the panel showed it was able to walk and simultaneously chew the climate change gum with a debate that never looked like teetering into the gutter of McCormack’s earlier “ravings”. The NSW firefighter James Lavery asked if fire services could be properly funded “particularly in the context of the growing threat of climate change?” A student, Poppy Burton, was part of a group that was “more inclined for direct action” to help regional communities with food and donations, rather, she said, than the “thoughts and prayers” offered by the prime minister, Scott Morrison. Moments later, the Liberal MP Jason Falinski responded with “our thoughts and prayers” for people in harm’s way. Does climate change cause bushfires? The link between rising greenhouse gas emissions and increased bushfire risk is complex but, according to major science agencies, clear. Climate change does not create bushfires, but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity.  What is the evidence on rising temperatures?  The Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk. What other effects do carbon emissions have? Dry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth.  So is climate change making everything dryer?  Dryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past. What do recent weather patterns show? The year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 has been the fifth driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970. Is arson a factor in this year's extreme bushfires? Not a significant one. Two pieces of disinformation, that an “arson emergency”, rather than climate change, is behind the bushfires, and that “greenies” are preventing firefighters from reducing fuel loads in the Australian bush have spread across social media. They have found their way into major news outlets, the mouths of government MPs, and across the globe to Donald Trump Jr and prominent right-wing conspiracy theorists. NSW’s Rural Fire Service has said the major cause of ignition during the crisis has been dry lightning. Victoria police say they do not believe arson had a role in any of the destructive fires this summer. The RFS has also contradicted claims that environmentalists have been holding up hazard reduction work. The former Rudd-era federal government climate adviser, the economist Ross Garnaut, remembered fondly the bipartisan support he said existed when he was commissioned to compile his landmark government review on climate policy in 2008. Back then, Garnaut said, the science “told us if we did not change the trajectory of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere” then the conditions for “difficult bushfires” would become more frequent. “Unfortunately, it looks like the science was right,” Garnaut said. The host, Tony Jones, handed Falinksi an audience question on whether the Liberal party had ever moved on from an era when its former leader Tony Abbott was describing the science of climate change as “absolute crap”. “Tony Abbott did not deny climate change,” offered Falinski who, with the gentlest of prods, decided not to prosecute his point. Sarah McNamara, the chief executive of the Australian Energy Council that represents electricity and gas companies, said there would only be progress when “politics and ideology” was taken out of the debate, segueing neatly to an audience question suggesting that energy policy should be removed entirely from political hands and given instead to regulators. Butler was pressed by an audience member and Jones on Labor’s climate policy, the latter wanting to know if the party would change its targets. While Butler would not rule out a change to better fit target years – based, for example on the year 2035 rather than 2030 – he said the party would have targets that kept the country on a “pathway to net zero emissions by 2050”. Garnaut drew on his new book, Superpower, to give the audience a glimpse of a future where the politics on energy had once again become bipartisan, and Australia’s economy was forging ahead on the back of some of the world’s cheapest power prices fed by its embarrassment of solar and wind resources. On that point, Jones asked Falinski if his party was still looking to subsidise a new coal-fired power plant. “No, it’s not an option we are considering,” said Falinski – a response that surprised Jones and, perhaps, might also surprise the Nationals senator Matt Canavan, who has been pushing for that outcome in north Queensland."
"A prominent former activist has accused Greenpeace of betraying its original ideas for supporting trophy hunting of polar bears. Paul Watson, now founder and director of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, made the claims in a lengthy Facebook post which has been shared 60,000 times.  Yet Watson misrepresents Greenpeace, Inuit hunting practices and polar bear trade data. He also demonstrates an adherence to an outmoded environmentalism in conflict with the human inhabitants of environments at risk. Watson’s post came days after the US announced it will no longer pursue an international ban on commercial trade in polar bear hides, a move welcomed by Inuit organisations, some polar bear specialists and environmental groups who had argued for years that climate change poses the greatest threat to polar bear populations. An ongoing campaign against trophy hunting affects Inuit livelihoods and diverts attention away from the bears’ real enemy: climate change. Most of the world’s 25,000 or so polar bears are found in northern Canada. Under the 1973 multilateral Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears, the country has a legal and scientifically managed polar bear hunt. Only Inuit and trophy hunters guided by Inuit can hunt polar bears. On average, the quota allows for the killing of around 600 bears each year, and the number permitted is continually refined based on up-to-date scientific evidence. The largest part of the quota is used directly by Inuit. Polar bear meat is eaten by humans and dogs, and pelts are transformed into clothing and bedding, or sold at auction in southern Canada, where they enter international markets. A large bear pelt in good condition can fetch CN$6,000 or more (about US$4,700). In some communities Inuit choose to divert part of the quota to trophy hunters. In 2006, 153 bears were taken by trophy hunters. However, in 2008 the US Endangered Species Act listed polar bears as “threatened” and commercial importation of bear parts into the US was outlawed. As US citizens formed the largest trophy hunt market, by 2010-11 just 26 bears were killed for trophies. Contemporary Inuit live in a mixed subsistence economy. The prohibitive cost of snow mobiles, boats, fuel, firearms and ammunition prevents many from participating in traditional hunting and fishing activities. Those who earn money through wage labour often lack the time to hunt, and those with time often lack the money.  Diverting a small portion of the polar bear quota to the trophy hunt allows Inuit hunters, in culturally appropriate ways, to earn money that is then reinvested in their traditional hunting practices. Rather than the greed-driven Inuit portrayed by Watson, the CN$3,000-7,500 earned by one hunter once a year guiding a ten-day trophy hunt supports large extended families and helps indigenous people protect their culture. And while Watson claims there is nothing “traditional” about guiding trophy hunters, such work provides Inuit with opportunities to use their land skills and environmental knowledge in ways they cannot when employed at gold or diamond mines or in construction work. Since the US trophy hunt market closed in 2008, more Inuit have opted to sell their bear skins at auction, in order to mitigate the loss of trophy hunt income. The claim made by Watson that 300 bears will be killed by trophy hunters this year is a misrepresentation of trade data. According to the Canadian government, parts from around 300 bears do enter international markets from the country each year. Yet only a small proportion of these have been killed by trophy hunters. The remainder, including pelts from bears killed up to 30 years ago, come from the Inuit hunt and generate much needed revenue for financially insecure families. Whatever one’s feelings about the polar bear trophy hunt, neither an international ban on the commercial trade in polar bear parts nor an endorsement by environmental organisations will have any impact on the legal and well-managed polar bear hunt that exists in Canada. A ban on trade would only be to the economic and cultural detriment of Inuit. Greenpeace has never endorsed polar bear trophy hunting. It has, however, started to work more closely with indigenous peoples in Canada. It recognises, as does the WWF, IUCN and others, that small scale and culturally appropriate hunting by indigenous people does not threaten biodiversity. Indeed, it has developed a more nuanced understanding that biodiversity and cultural diversity go hand-in-hand.  Unlike more single-issue environmental groups, Greenpeace now recognises the need to collaborate with Inuit in the fight against climate change – a common foe that threatens both polar bears and humans."
"To mark Earth Day, Apple has launched Apps for Earth: a one week fundraiser for the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) involving 27 popular gaming and utility apps that have developed special paid-for content and an environmentally themed front page to the App store. This partnership between Apple and WWF is symbolic of the rise of consumer environmentalism in our technological age – the idea that environmental concerns can be integrated into the production, purchase and use of consumer products and services. The first Earth Day, held at the height of the US counterculture movement on April 22, 1970, expressed a new environmental consciousness that galvanised a rapid and high-level political response. An estimated 20m people attended demonstrations and rallies calling for an end to polluting industries and making the point that healthy environments and quality lifestyles are interlinked. It lead to many of the environmental laws and institutions that we nowadays take for granted. Over the decades Earth Day has had a number of successful refreshes and now claims to be the largest secular observance in the world, involving more than a billion people every year. Maintaining and broadening engagement with the environmental movement is what it is all about. Apps for Earth certainly has the potential to build support among Apple’s tech-savy, global, middle-class customer base, but the direct financial contribution to WWF maybe more modest: Apple’s partnership with the Aids charity (RED) has raised US$100m since 2006. While this is a significant sum for any NGO it equates to just 0.18% of Apple’s US$53.4 billion net income in 2015. Carter Roberts, CEO of WWF-US, sees Apps for Earth as an example of the rich creativity and the big ideas with big impact that will enable it to succeed in its work. I am not so sure. From a business sustainability perspective this is a conventional deal: all parties benefit in terms of growth, productivity and risk management. Apple gains WWF’s endorsement for its efforts to green its supply chain along with a new “product” to offer its loyal customers, thereby enhancing and protecting its brand and motivating its environmentally-minded employees. WWF gains Apple and the tech media’s endorsement as the world leading conservation organisation and access to the tech-savy, middle class customer base of Apple’s App Store.  When it comes to saving the planet, big impact requires synergies between supporters and expertise. In a modern conservation organisation these imperatives are split between two professional “tribes” working in different departments and with different educations, career incentives and ways of working. At issue is the need for fundraisers and campaigners to communicate complex issues fast and in simple and appealing ways. This may not help build the deeper understandings required to generate support for the pragmatic solutions being developed by technical colleagues in programme departments, who engage with the messy and complex realities of the world over the long-term.  A case in the point concerns the massive investments in proposed new rail lines and roads that cut across protected natural habitats. Behind the scenes, conservation policy experts are generating frameworks, metrics, financial mechanisms along with the insider trust and influence needed to reduce environmental impacts, secure compensation where destruction of areas is unavoidable and identify win-wins where they exist. It’s a world of negotiation and compromise, of mitigation hierarchies and complex offset mechanisms, of shaping the future of the natural world as well as protecting the past.   This is modern conservation in practice, and it doesn’t translate easily into simple sound bites. It is increasingly at odds with the dominant fundraisier-campaigner narrative of “wonderful animals and landscapes which we will protect from the ills of the world for a small amount of your money, time and voice”.  Consumer environmentalism, such as Apps for Earth, aligns conservation with modern consumer culture. This offers fundraisers and campaigners the prospect of reaching new people and generating new funding streams, but it also carries the risk of ever more shallow public engagement and digital activism where masses of people get behind “solutions” that simply make themselves feel good. For a decade or more those in conservation with the grounded, technical know-how have been working with tech giants such as Google to develop open access tools that that enable and empower better environmental management. One of the best examples is the Google Earth Engine that allows sophisticated analysis of geo-spatial information and the development of open-source alert and decision support tools such as Global Forest Watch. Such tools are extending the reach of environmentalism into everyday corporate and investment decision making. Apple and Google have very different corporate ethos. Apple is founded on a belief in design and that simple things work, whereas Google believes in the power of data, is more collegiate and the engineers are king. Conservation fundraisers are attracted to Apple, while their more scientific colleagues are working with Google. Such alignments are understandable but they could also widen the gap between the popular and expert voices of environmentalism, creating a disjointed movement.  Earth Day needs to more than an opportunity for environmentalists to spread the word. It needs to be a day of coming together within the professional environmental movement. After all, the impact of half a million people marching down Fifth Avenue in April 1970 came from their demonstration of unity."
"The recent earthquakes in Japan and Ecuador happened within hours of each other, killing several hundred people. While both quakes were equally devastating for the countries and people involved, neither disaster has reached the scale experienced by Nepal last year. On April 25 2015 Nepal experienced a magnitude 7.8 earthquake that was followed 17 days later by a magnitude 7.3 earthquake. More than 5m people were affected and more than 8,500 killed. Between 1900 and 2015, there have been over 2.5m fatalities globally due to earthquakes, 30% of these have occurred since 2000.  The period 2000-2009 was the worst decade for earthquake fatalities on record, with more than half a million people killed. The current decade (2010-2019) is already on track to exceed that, with more than 350,000 people killed in earthquakes to date.  Of the five most deadly earthquakes in documented history, two have occurred since 2000; the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake that killed more than a quarter of a million people and the catastrophic 2010 Haiti earthquake – which has the highest death toll for an earthquake ever officially recorded (316,000). The 2000s also saw earthquakes in China, Pakistan, Iran and Japan take a combined total of more than 200,000 lives.  While the scale of these numbers is often shocking and highly emotive, it’s important that debates on the underlying science and appropriate mitigation are undertaken with care. Global population growth and urbanisation, especially in Asia, is certainly one factor influencing the high death toll. Asia currently has the highest number of mega-cities in the world, most of which are growing fast, with some expected to grow by more than 46% by 2030.  The number of people living in earthquake zones is now greater than ever before. This includes those living on the Pacific Ring of Fire – a long chain of volcanoes and other active structures surrounding the Pacific Ocean – and along the Alpine-Himalayan belt. This means earthquakes that would previously have killed hundreds now kill thousands or tens of thousands as a result of increased exposure. But increased exposure is by no means the only factor. The adage that earthquakes don’t kill people buildings do, highlights a key challenge in increasing resilience to earthquakes.  The scale of the problem is apparent when we consider that a 2007 study estimated that 90% of buildings in Iran and Nepal – two countries known to have high earthquake risk – had limited earthquake safety. But this problem isn’t unique to Asia. The same study estimated 60-80% of buildings in Austria, which is notably earthquake prone, were similarly vulnerable as a result of low earthquake awareness among professionals. While the knowledge needed to construct earthquake safe buildings is available –  even in some of the world’s poorest nations – its implementation remains challenging. A combination of weak governance, limited capacity and resources leaves this task seemingly insurmountable.  This is further exacerbated because earthquake disasters in any one location are actually quite rare – before 2015, the previous major earthquake in Nepal was 81 years ago – and so memories of just how catastrophic earthquakes can be quickly fade. Our research is taking a new approach by using “scenarios” based on observations from previous events to simulate the hazards that result from an earthquake. These are then implemented using civilian or military simulations that help to test the abilities of first-responders during a disaster. Scenarios are designed to simulate the consequences of an earthquake without having to experience one firsthand. They help to demonstrate the potential scale of earthquake impacts but also quantify how proposed mitigation – such as enforcing earthquake safe building codes – can have major positive effects.  By simulating changes to the current building stock, we can estimate how many lives could be saved as a result of efforts to increase resilience to earthquakes, for example. We know that buildings made from mud brick and earth are particularly vulnerable to earthquakes and replacing these could lead to substantial reductions in earthquake fatalities.  While our findings could aid decision makers, one criticism of this scenario approach is the focus upon a single event – which is by definition not the event that will happen next. However, we can explore multiple scenarios and assess where repeated losses recur – irrespective of the precise nature of each scenario tested. Major losses in different scenarios can then be identified and prioritised for mitigation. This approach allows us to consider how to address future earthquake losses, but it’s by no means a perfect solution.  In all earthquake prone nations seismic risks are just one of the many areas in need of investment. Consequently, it is often the nations with weak governance and the most limited resources that see the biggest loss to life from earthquakes. In these countries efforts to reduce such risks are superseded by the need to address livelihood demands such as clean water.  For countries like Nepal, where seismic risk is considered to be particularly pervasive, this approach can help ensure earthquake risk is considered and prioritise where to deploy the limited resources that are available.  As well as this, we need to continue to explore new ways to make buildings more resilient to earthquakes, but this needs to be coupled with methods to make these efforts sustainable, cost effective, and prioritised by decision makers. So while we can’t eliminate earthquake fatalities entirely, we can certainly work harder and smarter to reduce the losses and devastation that seem to go hand in hand when an earthquake hits."

Part 4/4. The Iron Age to the Present
Research by Ed Caryl
Climate historians usually recognize one Holocene Climate Optimum, from the end of the last ice age to about 4000 years ago. But as we have seen in this series of articles, there were three major warm periods, the first in the Upper Neolithic from 11,000 years BP to the 8.2 KY event, another from 8.2 KY to the 5.9 KY event, then the Bronze Age from 5.9 KY to 3.2 KY before present.
Each warm period resulted in a rise in sea level, the first melting most of the remaining ice from the ice age, the second finishing off the last ice in Canada and northern Europe. Each of these warm periods gave rise to a surge in population and technology. Each warm period advanced civilization. In the Bronze Age, empires arose in Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Anatolia. At 3200 years ago, all this came to an end.
At 3200 years BP, cold dropped sea levels by over 2 meters. Populations went on the move in response to crop failures. The Egyptian, Hittite, and Mycenaean Greek empires collapsed. Piracy (the Sea People) reigned supreme in the Mediterranean. No one knows for sure who the Sea People were because their incursions did not result in their establishing another empire, they simply looted and destroyed most of the cities around the Mediterranean. This was the Greek Age of Heroes. The time Homer attempted to record in the Iliad and the Odyssey. The history of this period survives as myth. This was also the time of Moses as recorded in the first four books of the Bible.

Figure 1 (from upper to lower trace) is sea level, Greenland ice core, and Antarctic ice core temperatures, with the orange Alpine Recession time line at bottom. Some notable events are indicated on the Greenland temperature trace.
Trade was interrupted during this period, so tin imports for bronze were cut off. Bronze continued to be recycled, but the shortage encouraged the use of iron. This was the beginning of the Iron Age. The Iron Age should probably be called the steel age because pure iron is nearly as soft as bronze. Early blacksmiths learned quickly that working carbon into the iron made it much harder. Doing so results in steel, but making steel requires high temperatures making it more costly, so steel edges were welded to iron axes to produce an edge that would remain sharp with use while the whole tool remained less expensive. This is sometimes still done today.
Cool periods brought on plagues and death
The Greek Dark Age lasted for 300  years. Other areas recovered a bit more quickly, but Greece even lost their written language during this interval, only recovering it in the Greek Archaic Period. The Archaic Period began during a warm period seen in a 200-year period of Alpine Recession, sea level stabilization, and southern hemisphere warming. In this period, architecture, art and literature of all kinds flourished. Population increased. Greek colonies were established all around the Mediterranean and Black Sea coasts. All this came to a halt in another cool period.
In 430 BCE, the Plague of Athens struck. It has not been determined what pathogen caused this plague. Typhus, typhoid, the Ebola virus, Marburg, Small Pox, and Measles have all been suggested as possibilities. It killed a third to two-thirds of the population of Athens, including their general at the time, Pericles. It weakened the Greeks to the extent that the Macedonians, and then the Romans, dominated Greece until the middle ages. Population and trade growth at this time exacerbated the spread of disease across the then known world. If the Plague of Athens was caused by the Ebola or Marburg virus, import of animals from Africa, as well as overcrowding and poor sanitation, was the likely cause.
Temperatures and sea levels were rising after this time. Alexander the Great conquered most of the Middle East, but after he died, his generals couldn’t hold that territory. Rome began to flourish, and by 100 Common Era (CE), had conquered most of Europe and a large part of the Middle East. The glaciers in the Alps were in recession for 300 years, 150 years before, and 150 years after, the birth of Christ.

Figure 2 is a map of the Roman Empire in the time of Emperor Trajan. (Wikipedia Commons)
A period of cooling then began in about the year 150 ACE. The Hatepe/Taupo Lake VEI 7 eruption took place in 186 CE. The dust and sulfates may have precipitated more cooling, and the effects were seen in Rome and China. Sea levels began to fall. Crops in northern Europe began to fail. Disease began to take a toll.
The Antonine Plague struck Rome in 165 CE, lasting for 15 years. It killed up to one million people and devastated the Roman army. A few years later, the Plague of Cyprian in 250 to 270 CE repeated this devastation. These plagues carried off several Roman Emperors and caused manpower shortages in agriculture and the Roman army. During this period, germanic tribes began moving south across Europe, putting pressure on Rome at a time when Rome could least resist.
As the temperature dropped from the high of the Roman Warm Period, conflict and migrations stirred Europe and the middle East. Plagues and warfare continued to impact populations. For example, the population of Rome went from one or two million at its hight in the 2nd Century to as low as 100,000 in the 6th Century. The Plague of Justinian struck the eastern Mediterranean in 541 CE. Over the next few years it killed perhaps 25% of the population. As many as 25 million people died over the next three centuries. More migrations took place. This population summary is taken from Wikipedia here. The population levels of Europe during the Middle Ages can be roughly categorized:[1]
•       280–400 (Late Antiquity): population decline.
•       400–1000 (Early Middle Ages): stable at a low level.
•       1000–1250 (High Middle Ages): population boom and expansion.
•       1250–1350 (Late Middle Ages): stable at a high level.
•       1350–1420 (Late Middle Ages): steep decline
•       1420–1470 (Late Middle Ages): stable at a low level.
•       1470–onward: slow expansion gaining momentum in the early 16th century.
Notice how this description follows the global temperature as seen in the sea level curve in Figure 1. During the Medieval Warm Period, 950 to 1250 CE, and the resulting population boom and expansion, the construction of large cathedrals began all across Europe. The Vikings expanded across the Atlantic to Iceland and Greenland, even briefly establishing a colony in Newfoundland. All this came to and end, again because of climate. Mt Rinjani in Indonesia, erupted in a VEI 7 event in 1257 CE. This event may have precipitated the Little Ice Age. There was a famine across Europe in 1315, caused by bad weather triggered by another volcano, Mount Tarawera in New Zealand. The Black Death struck in 1346, beginning in the Crimea. It is estimated that 30 to 60% of the European population died. The Spörer Solar Minimum from 1460 to 1550 contributed to low temperatures. 
Figure 3
The low-stand in global temperature in the Little Ice Age is reflected in the CO2 level as seen in the Antarctic Law Dome ice core data, Figure 3. This is because of lower sea surface temperatures. Low temperatures span the Maunder Minimum and end at the Dalton Minimum of the early 19th Century.
If the solar minimums of the 15th and 17th centuries contributed to the Little Ice Age, then the Modern Maximum must contribute to our current higher temperatures. As one can clearly see, high temperatures drive increasing populations, increasing crops, increasing innovation and technology.
Low temperatures drive famine, disease, social unrest, and declining populations. In the last 10,000 years, There were many times when the temperatures were higher than today. These were times when mankind expanded in many ways. We have had times of cold in the recent and far past. These were times when humanity declined.
We need not fear warmer temperatures. We do need to prepare for cooler temperatures, whether those arrive next winter, decade, century, or millennium.

"Further heavy rainfall has been forecast for the UK this week and more flooding is expected as communities already affected struggle to cope. Seven severe “danger to life” flood warnings remain in place in South Yorkshire in areas along the River Don. The Met Office also issued 41 active flood warnings and 94 flood alerts, and said a weather system moving across Europe would bring a “fair amount” of rainfall to England and Wales. Widespread flooding affected towns across the Midlands and northern England on Thursday and Friday. The body of Annie Hall, the former high sheriff of Derbyshire, was found in the River Derwent on Friday morning after she was swept away by flood water in Darley Dale near Matlock. Parts of the village of Fishlake near Doncaster in South Yorkshire were still cut off on Sunday, and under a metre (3ft) of water from the nearby River Don. Only tractors were able to get in by road. The local council called on residents to evacuate their homes. A rest centre was set up on at nearby Stainforth community centre for evacuees. Among visibly shaken arrivals from Fishlake were Chris Davies and Lorraine Healy. The flood waters rose so quickly on Friday evening that they were only able to grab two small plastic bags of clothing, and their three animals, a rabbit and two parrots, they said. “My whole car was under water. It took 30 minutes for everything to get flooded,” said Davies, 33. His rabbit Amber and parrot Jojo were safe but his other parrot, Ruby, had died of stress, he said.. He thought his house must be under four or five feet of water. He and Healy had borrowed money to stay at a local hotel in Lakeside, he said. Dan Greenslade, also from Fishlake, had been trying to get back to his flooded house after his girlfriend gave birth to their daughter on Friday. “I know it’s under water. A neighbour sent some pictures of the outside of it. But that was yesterday, and they say the waters are rising,” he said. “We’ve just decorated it and we moved in three weeks ago to get ready for the baby.” They were staying with his girlfriend’s parents in a nearby village, and friends had donated a Moses basket and baby clothes. “So the baby’s OK. But all of her stuff is at our house.” Nigel and Stephanie Roberts, who moved to Fishlake two months ago had been staying with their son in neighbouring Hatfield since the early hours of Saturday. They were hoping to hitch a ride to their home with a food convoy to rescue their parrot, Del Boy, who was stranded on the top floor. Stephanie said: “The garage started to flood about an inch and within two hours we had a foot of water. Then it entered the house and the kitchen. It was bubbling up through the floorboards.” About half of Fishlake’s 700 residents had already left, some spending Saturday in the Hare and Hounds pub, and others seeking shelter and company in the church. Others were staying in the upper floors of their homes. Some remaining residents have criticised Doncaster council for leaving them stranded. The council said it was unable to provide “on-the-ground support” because the area was covered by a severe flood warning and the advice was for residents to evacuate. Roselyn Jones, Doncaster’s mayor, said the Environment Agency had warned the water level could rise further. “The recommendation is to evacuate. Our first priority is preserving life,” she said. The Hare and Hounds were supplying food to those stranded in their homes, but the landlords, Angie and Scott Godfrey, tsaid on social media on Sunday that they were “fuming” that Doncaster council had not kept them supplied. “We have been inundated with calls, messages from people wanting a HOT MEAL. These people have no electricity & are living upstairs. We have the equipment to cook the lunches, we just need the food!!” they wrote on Facebook. South Yorkshire police said it had extra officers working in Doncaster to patrol and protect the evacuated areas. The Environment Agency said water levels on the Don had peaked in most places and were receding, but warned of more wet weather that “rivers may respond quickly to” on Monday and asked people to sign up to flood warnings. Sophie Yeomans at the Met Office said it was going to be an “unsettled week in terms of rain”. The forecast was for rain to reach Northern Ireland on Sunday evening, before affecting Wales and north-west England later and then spreading across the rest of the UK into Monday morning. Northern Rail said disruption in South Yorkshire could continue until Tuesday morning in some areas and that a significant amount of work was required before the tracks were cleared. Flood waters continued to subside, but tracks in several locations remained under water and debris and damage were surfacing as they receded, it said."
"Fly out of Delhi and you can see it: a band of grey smog, so thick it blots out the sun. Tune in carefully and you’ll hear it, too: a subtle symphony of snorts, coughs and wheezing. To the untrained nose, Delhi’s air is a potent bouquet. High notes of charred biomass mingle with sulphurous remnants of Diwali bonfires, with base notes of subsidised diesel, burned plastic and coal. I moved there in early 2017. To me, a relative outsider from south-east India who spent her 20s trying to draw attention to injustices in India’s coal belt, Eau de Delhi smelled a bit like justice. It was only fair that the city’s most powerful and privileged breathed a fraction of what they extracted from communities who relied on land and forest. I hoped that this toxic air would waft down the same corridors where environmental safeguards had been rapidly undermined by the Modi government. I was wrong. Jet-setting politicians almost never shared the same airspace; they keep office windows closed with air purifiers on. Barely a year of bloodshot eyes and blocked sinuses later, I left Delhi, conscious of the privilege to be able to do so. For my wisest counsellors – the city’s auto-rickshaw drivers who didn’t wear masks, and chain-smoking environmentalists – leaving for good was not an option. What is it like to live and love in a city that shoves two packs of cigarettes down your throat every day without your consent? How did Delhi get here? Its geography doesn’t do it any favours. Delhi is a land-locked city-state of 29 million. In winter, low-speed winds bring dust from the Gulf and cold-air inversion keeps pollution close to the ground. Delhi borders the wheat-bowl states of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana, which were the laboratories for India’s green revolution – a revolution that rescued India from famine, but the city is now facing the fallout from industrial farming and climate change that’s changing rainfall patterns. Farmers have an extremely short window to clear their land for the sowing of winter crops. There’s not enough machinery to go around, little demand for biomass power plants and no assurance that early maturing seeds will ensure high yields. Farmers confess they have no choice but to set fire to their fields, but the smog affects them, too. Delhi also has 13 coal-fired power plants within a 300km radius, and hundreds of cement plants and smaller factories to cater for the construction of a new urbania that knows no seams. Throw in the waste of a metropolis and you have a steady toxic baseline, summer and winter, that is said to shave seven years off your life. The inertia around the capital’s killer air, however, owes a lot to a unique political deadlock. Delhi is host to the Narendra Modi-led government, the Aam Aadmi party (AAP) at state level, and a municipality administered by Modi’s Bharatiya Janata party (BJP). Ask for accountability and things get tricky. Crop-burning spans multiple state borders and ministries. Communication breakdowns have bordered on the ridiculous in recent years, with the state’s chief ministers trying to set up emergency meetings via public spats on Twitter. In charge of Delhi is Arvind Kejriwal from the AAP. His “common man’s party” was formed on the back of a powerful, nationwide movement in 2013 that promised to clean up politics. AAP came to power in Delhi in January 2015 promising cheaper electricity, a transition to renewables, and an end to the city’s pollution and water woes. Months later, key environmentalists in AAP were ousted, including activist-lawyer Prashant Bhushan, who took on coal oligarchs in court, and pro-farmer Yogendra Yadav, prompting another prominent activist, Medha Patkar, to quit. In Kejriwal’s first winter as chief minister, he announced an odd-even traffic scheme as an emergency measure on a trial basis: drivers with odd-numbered plates could drive on odd days of the month and vice-versa. It was met with disbelief, valid questions of who it let off the hook and attempts to subvert it. Single-SUV households became double-SUV households to circumvent the ban. Studies show particulate matter levels did go down at choke points. But activists say shutting down Delhi’s more than 40-year-old Badarpur power plant in 2018 was far more effective in easing the city’s airways. Cut to a few weeks ago. The AAP government announces free public transport on the city’s buses for women, but this is dismissed as an election gimmick by the BJP. AAP rolls out odd-even again and a defiant BJP MP rides into the heart of the city in an odd-numbered car on an even-numbered day in protest. Delhi’s coal plants fail to meet emission standards that the BJP authored four years ago, but a BJP leader wonders aloud if Pakistan and China were releasing noxious gases. Which takes us to this week, when India’s supreme court ordered “the entire police machinery to ensure that not even a single incident takes place of [crop] burning henceforth”. The directive has brought temporary relief but is also deeply unsustainable and classist. What the highest court has done is force poor people, once again, to shoulder the burden of environmental accountability, while putting them at risk of punitive action. It’s a pattern that environmental movements know well. The past five years have seen vicious reprisals against indigenous defenders, bright lives reduced to statistics in Global Witness reports. These indigenous people resisting encroachments, such as large-scale deforestation by big coal, are on the frontlines of the battle against climate breakdown. Many of their strongest advocates have allegedly been spied on. While big polluters can fund political parties using electoral bonds, which are effectively anonymous, organisations such as Greenpeace have been crippled by Modi-imposed funding restrictions. But urban climate movements are wising up. This week, Delhi mothers and sanitation workers stood together with banners screaming #BullshitNoMore. And, faced with storm surges that could wipe out the city, Mumbai’s well-heeled stood with Warli tribe elders to save the Aarey forest, the last of the city’s lungs. On the hallowed steps of Bangalore’s town hall, the city’s de facto protest site, I spotted hundreds of new faces at this September’s school strikes. “A for apple, B for ball, climate change will fuck us all!” screamed eighth-grader Greta-believers at their first ever protest. Seven of the 10 most polluted cities in the world are in India. If the nation is to breathe better and survive the crises at its door, it could use a whole lot more irreverence and unlikely alliances – holding to account governments that do not consult the worst-affected on decisions that affect us all. There can be no climate justice without equality – locally, intergenerationally and internationally. Will politics ever catch up? • Aruna Chandrasekhar is an independent journalist from India.

Off topic but for some readers this could be a real game-changer when it comes to your precious health.
I’ve been on a low-carb, high fat, lots of meat diet for about 6 weeks now. I’ve lost about 15 lbs. and my belt has moved to the last hole. I no longer get the bloated feeling and the trousers fit nicely again. My research on the best way to lose weight led me to the video below.
If even just half of what this doctor says is right, and I believe he is mostly right, then the population has been the victim of a huge nutritional and pharmaceutical scam of monumental proportions. It’s 90 minutes long but well worth listening…I couldn’t stop listening. THIS COULD CHANGE YOUR LIFE! The interview starts in earnest at the 7 min. mark.

Like the guy says at the end…what’s going on “is mind-blowing”. Like Dr. Davis says (like climate science) it’s going to take years to unravel the mess that the decades of disinformation has produced.
But wait, it all gets much much worse…the following presentation will blow your socks off!

Another expert, Dr. Sally Fallon, even calls it “genocide”. The tragedy is that millions have died horrible deaths at the hands of what I now believe to be a sinister industry…call it the abortion-of-adults industry. Again, all worth taking the time to watch.

"Red deer are the largest surviving native land mammals in the British Isles. Over the centuries, wolves, bears, elk and wild cattle have all been driven to extinction, but deer have persisted. Though they are now limited to the margins of the modern world, in the past these animals played a central role in human life and, somehow, unlike other large mammals, endured.  It is easy to understand how deer arrived at some of the remote places on the British mainland where they now thrive, but questions arise over how the animals on the distant Scottish islands of Orkney and the Outer Hebrides got there. Deer are known to be good short distance swimmers, but the isles are thought to have been separated by wide and deep sea channels from the mainland for as long as Britain itself has been an island. Today, other than deliberate introductions, these outer isles still have only a few terrestrial species, such as otters and rodents. The archaeological record shows that deer appeared on the Scottish isles at the same time as humans arrived, so could there be a link between the two? Evidence for the first insular human and deer populations on these islands dates back to the Neolithic, some 5,500 years ago, a time when the first farmers were establishing themselves in Britain. These farmers spread across to the islands, taking with them domestic cattle, sheep, pigs and crops, as well as wild deer. By releasing the deer, settlers developed a new, less labour intensive food supply that could supplement farming, and provide valuable antler – but just how did they do it? In our recent study, we combined archaeological skills with genetic research, to understand how our ancestors moved deer to and from the islands. The results were unexpected. We attempted to match DNA sequences from ancient deer bones found across Scotland from different times, with the populations of deer living on other nearby places, such as the Scottish mainland, Norway and Ireland. By including deer from the Bronze, Iron and Viking Ages we also explored if they were introduced to the islands once or many times. Though we found that deer from mainland Scotland and the Inner Hebrides were all close matches with the Irish and Norwegian deer, only a single specimen of ancient deer from the outer isles matched any deer population, modern or ancient. These animals actually came from much further afield – but from where did they originate? There are some other enigmatic island introductions we can compare the deer to. One study suggested that the Orkney vole, a species only found on mainland Europe and on Orkney, which also appears at the time of the first farmers, most closely matches historic voles in Belgium. Research is also shedding new light on our understanding of the movement of early people as well as their relationships with wild animals. While sea-going prehistoric boats are rare in Britain, there is increasing evidence that people travelled and traded over long distances, so it could be that they came from even further afield than first thought. The deliberate introduction of deer to the islands suggests that early farmers diversified, employing a sophisticated land and stock management system. The deer provided meat, fat, hides and sinews, while antler, shed and regrown each year, was a vital sustainable resource used to make tools and other items. Bones left by islanders suggest that, in the absence of predators, ancient deer numbers were managed by culling the young animals. This close management allowed humans and deer to both persist on the small islands for centuries, and provides a model for our understanding of how and why deer, unlike other large mammals, were not hunted to extinction. Today, deer are big business. Britain is home to some 350,000, the largest population in Europe, and deer stalking is estimated to be worth over £100m a year to the Scottish economy. However, the animals no longer have any natural predators and conservationists are worried that their huge numbers are damaging the natural environment, forestry and agriculture, as well as compromising road safety. As these remote deer populations are still managed by humans, and their genetic line remains free from interbreeding, we can ensure the ancient deer lineages are protected. And by comparing modern deer with their ancestors, we can conserve and manage our herds today to ensure their continued survival in the future. But the search for the source of the original Scottish island deer continues. We will now be looking further afield for the source populations and testing ancient and modern deer across southern Britain and into Europe. In particular, whether there is a link with the Orkney vole. Questions are still outstanding, however: where did these mysterious island deer come from? What does this tell us about the people that they lived alongside? And what other mysteries are there still to discover about this ancient human wildlife relationship?"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis sunny, warm, spring Sunday morning in Germany brings us yet another spectacular scandal…one that shows how the Environment Ministry of the German government is not really interested in climate science after all, but in using the climate issue as an instrument to generate hundreds of millions of euros for funding pet environmental programs.
Daniel Wetzel of the online Die Welt brings us a story titled: “The Brazen Report-Falsification of Climate Tricksters“.
The story today is about how the conclusions the UN IPCC report released last month apparently did not satisfy the expectations of a series of German government agencies within the German Ministry of Environment, and so they made some major changes in their own German language four-page summary for the public and media. The four-page summary contains outright contradictions and falsifications of IPCC recommendations, Die Welt reports.
Wetzel first explains how condensing the monster size IPCC report into a summary that is only a few pages long (one that can be easily digested by the public) is a daunting task. More than 1000 pages of technical gobbledygook gets summarized into a 33-page Summary for Policymakers – in English. But that too is also too tough for an increasingly lazy German media and groups to get through. Die Welt writes:
And so the journalists, speakers and environmental groups were thankful that the German federal ministries and authorities responsible for climate protection provided a very clear four-page summary of ‘key points’ of the IPCC report.
Responsible for the German summary were four high-ranking institutions: led by Ministry of Environment, and involved were the German IPCC Coordinating Office in Bonn, the Environment Agency in Dessau, and the Federal Ministry of Education and Research.”
This is where the scandal begins. The government agencies, obviously unhappy with the recommendations of the IPCC, simply ignored and changed some of the IPCC key findings in order to say the opposite in their 4-page German summary.
For example the German Ministry of Environment was not pleased that the IPCC report was sharply critical of the practice of maintaining a renewable energy subsidy system alongside an emissions trading system. Die Welt:
The UN declares emissions trading an effective instrument that makes subsidies for renewable energy unnecessary. But the German government reverses the conclusion and makes emissions trading the culprit that supposedly ‘constricts the impact of other measures’.”
Also the German report reverses the sense of an emission trading scheme. Wetzler at Die Welt explains:

Emissions trading is by definition a system in which a number of freely tradeable emission certificates is prescribed so that free market prices can result for the emissions certificates. From this system of a fixed certificate number and flexible prices, the German translation turns it into a system of flexible certificate numbers to force the highest possible price for emission rights.”
When asked by Die Welt to comment, the Environment Ministry simply shuffled the matter off to the German IPCC Coordination Office, who in turn played it down, claiming that the “core messages” were “not a literal or even official translation of the IPCC report.” and that it was “a first presentation of the report in an intelligible form.” and that “that elements of the report can be reflected only in highly abbreviated form. ”
Yet, it was good enough to use for informing the media and public?
“Not what we wrote”
When confronted, the IPCC responded by insisting that the German version “is not what we wrote.” Die Welt also asked the IPCC scientists concerning the German translation of their core messages. writes that they “reacted with surprise”. Die Welt quotes Edenhofer:
That’s not what we wrote in the IPCC report,’ declared Ottmar Edenhofer who as Co-Chair of Working Group III played a leading role in formulating the original IPCC report. ‘Fundamentally the purpose of an emissions trading system is not to generate high prices.’ ‘Only the original English version is important,’ says Edenhofer. […] What ‘the ministries or other agencies do with it is not in my hands.'”
Gross misinterpretations “a scandal”
Meanwhile the German Association for Emissions Trading and Climate Protection (BVEK) views the (mis)interpretations of the IPCC report as “a scandal. Die Welt quotes:
‘Essential statements of the UN IPCC were simply reversed to say the opposite,’ criticized association director Jürgen Hacker: ‘The demand for the highest possible CO2-prices have nothing to do with that statements of the UN report, but they do correspond very well to the interests of the German Federal Ministry of Environment.'”
Die Welt then writes that indeed the German Ministry of Environment was banking on high CO2 certificate prices. The auctioning of emission certificates was supposed to “feed a billion-euro ‘energy and climate fund’ which in turn would finance a number of environment programs of Ministry, led by Barbara Hendricks.” Now that certificate prices are so low, the German Ministry has to go begging for money, Die Welt writes.

Share this...FacebookTwitterCentral Russia is famous for it’s harsh winters, but it also has warm southern European-like summers. Well, at least it used to.
Today’s English-language online Russian news site RT here reports that a “freak summer snow” has struck areas of Central Russia in the cities of cities of Chelyabinsk and Sverdlovsk just north of Kazakhstan – in the middle of July! Hat-tip Alexander Hamilton at FaceBook.
“Snowdrifts”
Here we are not talking about high up in the mountains, but down in low country. The RT writes:
Snowdrifts piled up on the roads of Russia’s Ural region on Saturday as an abnormal summer snowstorm hit the region, bringing the area into the spotlight once again after last year’s meteorite fall. Siberia also witnessed a downpour of giant hailstones.”
The RT website adds (my emphasis):
Residents of the cities of Chelyabinsk and Sverdlovsk, located in Russia’s eastern Ural region, were taken aback when it suddenly started snowing in the middle of summer on Saturday.”
Also the Siberian city of Novosibirsk was hit by a heavy hailstorm, captured on video and posted at Youtube (hat-tip: RT):

"When James Shaw’s zero-carbon bill passed with bipartisan support in parliament on Thursday, New Zealand became one of the first countries in the world to enshrine its climate change targets in law. But for someone at the centre of a landmark piece of legislation, Shaw is a reluctant politician. Although the Green’s co-leader has been a party member since his teenage years, inspired by the French bombing of Greenpeace’s Rainbow Warrior in Auckland Harbour in 1985, he responds to a question about whether he is a career MP with, “No. I can’t. I couldn’t,” and then adds “no” a few more times for emphasis.  The former management consultant – now climate change minister – sits at the centre of government, but he doesn’t like parliament much, and has to let the “weird stuff” wash over him, he says. Shaw doesn’t have an office. He works, surrounded by staff, in his open-plan ministerial suite, where he has “taken out a bunch of walls.” It took him four months to convince parliament’s building services that he should be allowed to do it. “I actually had to go to the Speaker and say, look, where is the rule that says the ministers can’t sit with staff?” Shaw says. “And he said there actually isn’t a rule. It’s just a tradition. So I said, can I change it?” It improves coordination and “speeds things up,” he says. If he needs to concentrate, he puts on headphones. When he left the world of management consultancy and became an MP in 2014, politics was a means to an end, he says: “Even some of the largest, most powerful, most moneyed-up companies in the world still operate within system constraints.” “And the place where those constraints occur are actually things to do with regulatory and pricing and tax and that kind of stuff. In other words, it’s political.” Now he’s at the centre of New Zealand’s zero-carbon push as a key coalition partner in Jacinda Ardern’s government. It’s no coincidence that Ardern’s opening speech at the United Nations climate summit in September, closely echoed his views. The world faces a “stark” situation she said, urging those listening that with the necessary changes, progress was “within our grasp.” “I wrote a lot of it,” Shaw says. Shaw, 46, is – unlike Ardern – an unknown on the world stage, but he is he is the architect behind some of the most ambitious climate policies that anyone in the world is trying to enact. “I think sometimes a domestic audience undervalues or underestimates the impact on global action of action by other countries,” he says, of the oft-cited fact that New Zealand is responsible for just 0.17% of global emissions. “Part of what we’re doing is we’re role modelling for other countries. And actually, countries do look at each other and go, where are we relative to the pack?” On whether global heating can be curbed, he says: “I think the chances are slim.” But there’s no reason for not trying, he adds. “In fact, that’s all the more reason to try.” It is an optimistic view for a man who is reluctant to use the word “optimism.” As well as being New Zealand’s climate tsar, statistics minister and associate finance minister, Shaw, has co-led the Green party since 2015. The party’s eight MPs support Ardern’s governing Labour party, giving her the majority she needs to stay in power, along with New Zealand First. Together their climate agenda is ambitious: the zero carbon act — passed Thursday and loosely modelled on Britain’s 2008 Climate Change Act – legally enshrines a framework for New Zealand to keep global heating within 1.5C of pre-industrial levels. A plan to tax farmers for their emissions from 2025, or earlier if they are not making progress on reductions, was announced earlier this month. A proposed law that would force businesses to declare climate change risks to their shareholders is also on the cards. But at each turn – due to the three-party deal the Greens are a part of in government, and Shaw’s efforts to get cross-parliament support for his bills where possible – there were concessions and compromises made. On the day he announced New Zealand’s farmers would – in a world first – begin to pay for carbon emissions from 2025, Shaw sparked a furore inside his own movement. Farmers were broadly supportive of the move, because it gave them a grace period to work on the problem themselves, although some did not want to be taxed on emissions at all. But environmental groups, the Green party’s traditional allies, accused him of caving to agricultural interests. Analysts speculated on whether Shaw had gambled with his party’s fate at next year’s election. Does the climate change portfolio feel like everyone is perpetually slightly unhappy with him? “It feels like that every day. That’s exactly it,” he says. But with all eyes on New Zealand – particularly those of other agricultural countries – the government had to do something. “For 30 years, we’ve been involved in this Punch and Judy show, and it’s resulted in nothing,” Shaw says. “And so one side simply winning over the other, which has been the record of the last three decades, just isn’t going to cut it. We’ve got to get started.” Shaw walks to work when he can; he passed his full driver’s license test this year and still does not like to drive. A violent episode in March, when he was punched in the face on his way to work by a man who had targeted him for his political views, did not deter him from going out alone, a luxury New Zealand’s politicians are rare in being permitted. The assault generated a day of frenzied debate in New Zealand about the safety of its lawmakers. Thirty hours later, the nation’s attention was diverted by the deadly terrorist attack in Christchurch, in which 51 people were killed. Shaw, sporting a black eye, arrived in the city the day after the shootings. He was “emotionally pretty thrown” by the attacks, he said, but New Zealand’s response had been “brilliant, not perfect.” “Those kinds of things can tip you into a very dark place, and we didn’t go there,” he says. The political, for now, leaves no time for much else. He draws a blank when asked to name books or music he enjoys; weekends will, if he’s lucky, involve a walk with his wife, Annabel and a craft beer – “one of my greatest pleasures of modern Wellington” – when the work he brings home allows it. The table-top role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons, always a big part of his life, is on the back-burner. He only keeps up with new episodes of Star Trek: Discovery because he is not allowed to read ministerial papers on aeroplanes. “There’s a thing particularly about sci fi where you’re imagining possible futures,” he says. “And so interestingly, there’s a coherence there between what we do here and that.” But he says his move to politics and all has come with it will be worthwhile if “that was the moment when we got on top of our emissions and started to bring them down.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterRebound and Sea Level
By Ed Caryl
During the peak of the last ice age, enough ice was collected in the great ice sheets that the global sea level was reduced by more than 120 meters. The ice sheets themselves were, in places, more than two kilometers thick. The great weight of that ice depressed the earth’s crust and mantle by hundreds of meters. In some places, ground that is now a hundred meters above sea level, was pressed down below the sea level that existed before and shortly after the ice melted. Because the earth’s mantle has a high viscosity, and the earth’s crust a high bending strength, these areas are still slowly rising after 12,000 years, and will rise for another 12,000, barring another ice age to press them down again. This “isostatic rebound” or “post-glacial rebound” (PGR) complicates sea levels worldwide because it continually changes the sea bottom and coastline shapes. The University of Colorado sea level measurements add 0.3 mm/year to sea level rise to “adjust” for this. Is this adjustment reasonable?
Locally, this rebound can be measured by precision GPS. Geological studies have also determined the prehistoric amount of rebound that has taken place. I will just mention three areas that have been and will be vastly changed by rebound: the St Lawrence Seaway area in Canada and northern New England in the U. S., an island beach in Nunavit, northern Canada, and Finland in northern Europe.

Figure 1 is a world map of PGR from the Wikipedia article on that subject, here.
The present day St. Lawrence River Seaway sits at the edge of the present PGR area that marks the boundary of the great Laurentide Ice Sheet of the last ice age. North of the river, the Provence of Quebec is rising. South of the river, southern New England is rising much slower or falling. This is apparent at Lake Ontario, where the tilting has resulted in the northern shore rising faster than the southern shore, and wetlands on the north draining and drying out, while on the southern shore, beaches are drowning and wetlands are being created from formerly dry land. The whole lake is very slowly rolling southward.
At the end of the last ice age, ice had blocked the St. Lawrence valley and formed the glacial Lake Candona, covering what is now the lower three Great Lakes, Ontario, Erie, and Huron. When the ice dam failed, the water level fell 300 feet (100 meters) in a few days. At this point, Lake Ontario may have been connected to the world ocean through the Champlain Sea. The Champlain Sea covered the whole area that is now Lake Champlain and all the St. Lawrence River Valley up to Lake Ontario. Pierre’s boyhood home in Northern Vermont was under seawater, or at the shore during this period. The Champlain Sea lasted from 12,500 years ago up to 9800 years ago, when the rising land finally cut off Lake Champlain from the waters to the north. The land has continued to rise in the Lake Champlain area, and now the lake is 29 to 30 meters above mean sea level.
In the far north of Canada, where the center of the ice sheet was thickest, the land is currently rising at nearly 2 cm a year. In the past, when the last ice had melted, the rate was even higher, and the land will continue to rise into the future until the next ice age returns. The PGR uplift is constant, without fits and starts, in contrast to land in tectonically active areas like California and Japan, and other areas that are near plate boundaries where earth movements will abruptly change sea level.

Here at Rebound Beach are many fossil beaches, one above the other, preserved because for most of the year the ground is frozen and snow-covered, there is little rain, and very little tidal action. The beaches seen here are like a stereo tape recording (with a stream dividing the tracks) of rising and falling sea levels recorded on a steadily rising, evenly sloped land form. It appears that since the last time the tape was erased, when the ice scrubbed the slope clean over 12,000 years ago, there have been about 20 rises, falls, or hesitations in the sea level, where the rate was different from the steady PGR. A dating of each of these fossil beaches would result in a good record of sea level over the last 12,000 years.
Figure 3 (left) is a map of Finland as of 11,000 years ago. Source. The blue area was water.
Finland 11,000 years ago was mostly sea-bottom with an archipelago of islands. Many place-names in Finland reflect this history with high ground that has island or other maritime feature names. As the land rose, lakes were cut off from the sea, and the Gulf of Bothnia became smaller. The current rate of uplift here approaches 1 cm a year in the northern Gulf. On this map, at the left edge just below center is a narrowing of the Gulf of Bothnia at Kvarken. This narrowing separates Bothnian Bay from the outer Bothnian Sea further south. The water at this point is only about 25 meters deep. Bothnian Bay is already nearly fresh water due to the number and size of the rivers flowing into it. The salt content is now too low to be tasted and there are many freshwater fish species. In about 1500 years uplift will create a further narrowing, reducing the depth to about 10 meters, creating a river flowing south across the Kvarken. At that time Bothnia Bay will be a freshwater lake.
The rising of the bottom of the Bay of Bothnia and the Baltic Sea in general will reduce the volume of the Baltic and force that water into the world ocean, raising the sea level generally. Just to estimate the amount of rise, if the average PGR is 5 mm/year for the Baltic, and the Baltic is roughly 1/1000th of the total ocean area, then the world ocean will rise 0.005 mm/year.
But the Baltic is small compared to Hudson Bay, and Hudson Bay is also rising. The tide gauge at Churchill is rising (sea level falling) at 1.2 cm/year. Hudson Bay is 0.34% of the World Ocean. The PGR here will contribute 0.041 mm/year to general sea level rise. The other waters around the islands of Nunavit in northern Canada will contribute about another 0.004 mm/year, making a total for the Baltic and Canada about 0.05 mm/year.
But the PGR rising is offset by sea bottom sinking. As the earth’s mantle rises, the mantle in the surrounding area must flow down and under to compensate. As can be seen in figure 1, the North Atlantic, the bottom between Newfoundland and Greenland, and the ocean bottom north of Canada, is sinking. These areas are totally under ocean, unlike the rising areas that are mostly land. The sink rate seems to be 3 to 4 mm/year over an area much greater than the rising sea bottoms, which would appear to more than cancel any sea level rise due to PGR. The 0.3 mm/year positive “adjustment” to sea level rise by the UC sea level group does not appear to be justified.

"Hey Bobin, I came home today. I wasn’t really expecting to. I got a call when I was still asleep, asking if I wanted to drive up to see if the house I grew up in still exists. It does. I’m glad I came.We’re reasonably well fire-prepped but the house probably only remains thanks to a well-timed water bomb from the RFS. The cottage I grew up in until I was 12 doesn’t.  It’s an oddly pretty pile of corro, ash and charred logs supported by a couple of stone walls my mum built when I was in utero. The sculpted face of a warrior woman that looked over me from the mantel while I was sleeping in the lounge room as a kid now looks out over a ruined mess. Maybe a fitting end for that place. At least it means we don’t have to decide what to do with it. Bobin, I saw parts of you today that I thought I’d never see. Parts that I probably shouldn’t have seen. I saw the insides of trees as infernos. I saw blackened hillsides with nothing left but rock and ash. I saw rainforest on fire. I saw fucking creek beds on fire. Creek beds completely dry, with water in the few deep pools a foot lower than I have ever seen in my 35 years of knowing you. I saw a country school blackened and twisted and melted to the ground today. After only 136 years. I’m glad the library still stands, and I hope that the relevant authorities have the vision to bring it back. And the hall. We would be devastated without you. I saw a few people today. Some fucking amazing ones. I saw firefighter friends who I’ve known for years, still working after a few hours’ rest following 36 hours of chaos. I saw friends whose houses had been saved looking out for other people. I saw friends who had nearly lost everything, but had managed to escape with their house intact, and their animals still alive, riding the relief high. I saw other friends who had lost everything. Like, everything. Just got out to a neighbour’s house with wallet and laptop and a change of clothes before everything collapsed. Photos lost. Memories lost. The smell of home replaced with the lingering smell of ash. I saw some of those friends still smiling, laughing even. I saw others crying. I met new friends helping old friends with a place to stay, and old friends helping new friends put out spotfires. I saw other friends getting ready for the fire that would be hitting right now, well prepared, but with fingers crossed that their place burns out slowly tonight, because if it isn’t burnt by Tuesday, it will probably burn harder then. I left knowing I have many friends who are prepared, but also knowing you can never be prepared enough. I hope they get it easy. Bobin, you’re fucking gutted. I’ve seen fires run through you. The hall nearly burnt a few years ago. But there was never anything like this. No one expected six houses in the middle of the village, in the middle of open paddocks, to just disappear. What the fuck. But Bobin, if I know any place, and community, that can take a gut punch like that, and stand straight back up, it’s you. You’re a community of amazing people, with an amazing capacity to get shit done. You can pull through this. You’ll probably even do it in style.I really came home today. I felt it so much. I am who I am because of you. I have fallen back in love, and I look forward to helping you back on your feet in whatever way I can.

"Heeding the advice of fire controllers and decades of scientific reports, Glen Innes Severn council last month declared a climate emergency. As the New South Wales government itself has now declared, those emergency conditions extend far beyond our shire borders and touch every community across the state. Within our borders we have seen a magnificent, humane and unstinting response from the Rural Fire Service, State Emergency Service, Red Cross, Salvation Army, NSW Police, Glen Innes Severn council employees, fellow councillors, the deputy mayor, Dianne Newman, and hundreds of community volunteers who for months now have done everything from sweep gutters to pitch tents to butter bread for sandwiches.  Throughout this time, every effort has been made to prepare and defend both private and public properties in my community of Wytaliba, NSW, which last week succumbed to merciless physics that pay no heed to opinion, nor folklore, nor politics. Members of my family are in hospital. Two community members, my neighbours for decades, are lost to us. We have lost dozens of homes beloved by hundreds of people. An entire community has been all but wiped off the map. In the face of this tragedy already I have received a personal message of support from the NSW governor, Margaret Beazley, for whose humane and wise words I am most humbly grateful, and for whose leadership of the state of NSW we are together all indebted. Alongside everyone in this community, I also welcome the commitment of our state member for Northern Tablelands, Adam Marshall, to the rebuilding of Wytaliba public school, a much-loved school which burned to the ground on the same day that the federal government announced that only private schools will share in $10m of drought support funding. While all this is a personal tragedy for my family and myself, it is but one story within an unfolding statewide and global disaster, about which our community deserves nothing less than the honest and unvarnished truth. There are already those who, following such statements, will aim to shoot the messenger. To those people I say this: take your best shot, for I have already been through hell and there is nothing you can say or do that can touch me now. But for the sake of the future, for the sake of our community and the rising generation who will inherit this scorched Earth, one can only hope there will be enough people remaining who retain the common decency to listen, to heed the cries of those in harm’s way, who will now together take decisive and collective action to save our ecosystem and our civilisation from collapse. Already there are armchair experts ready with free advice about meeting with disaster. Let it be made perfectly clear that all the area that burned has already been a fire ground for two months. There were hazard reduction and backburns under state authority last month and last year. The properties were all well-prepared and extensively defended. People who have lived with fire risk for decades knew exactly what to do, and they did it. The full expertise and advice of fire controllers has been heeded at every turn. I’ll put my 20-year Rural Fire Service medal up against your free advice any day of the week. The anger is real. The anger is justified. Because this disaster was all foreseen and predicted. For decades the link between a hotter, drier climate, land-clearing, excessive irrigation and increased fire risk have all been attested in scientific papers. Equally for decades there have been those who insist they know better. Their ignorance and arrogance have delivered us only ashes – let these now be swept away. Instead, we will turn towards the sober and sensible measures recommended by fire controllers, and by scientists. We will insist that governments at all levels take heed of that advice, for we have seen now up close the result when they do not. We turn to those governments now to seek what support is needed and available to assist these devastated communities to get back on their feet. To protect these communities from future harm by curbing climate change. To commit to a saner, safer world where we measure our progress in terms of sustainability, and our wealth in terms of community. In the face of disaster, everyone learns something about themselves and the people around them. What, I wonder, will be the lesson learnt from this disaster? That remains to be seen. But for now it is the words attributed to Winston Churchill that are salutary: “if you’re going through hell, keep going.” • Carol Sparks is the mayor of Glen Innes Severn council"

Share this...FacebookTwitterSome NTZ readers may recognize the face of a person who appeared at the recent Heartland: Austrian rapper Kilez More, whom NoTricksZone featured on couple of occasions. I’m also proud to say that NoTricksZone had a hand in helping to organize Kilez’s appearance in Las Vegas. So for me watching him at the end the following video is particularly gratifying. I hope you’ll take time to watch his short speech.
 
Kilez gets introduced by the great James Delingpole (1:54:30) and starts his act at the 2:02:55 mark. (Excuse the substantial technical-audio breakdown during his performance). 
So what business would a young rapper artist have performing before a crowd of staid, humorless scientists who probably use slide rules to tie their shoes? I mean dancer/singer types and climate scientists are about as opposite as you can get. Well Kilez produced a skeptic rap song hammering at “climate science”. At Youtube his music video has been viewed close to 120,000 times.
“Manipulation from schools, teachers, universities…”
In his run-up speech at the Heartland Conference before his rap performance Kilez talks about the formidable social and institutional forces acting to indoctrinate the youth with man-made climate change dogma, recalling the “manipulation from schools, teachers, universities and everything“.  He adds, “History shows us that when everyone has the same opinion, then you have to take a second look. And there is an old saying in Austria which says: ‘When everybody says yes, then go ahead and say no. And if everybody stands, then start moving. And most important of all, when everybody is quiet, then speak out loud.'”
What impresses the most about Kilez is the aura of fearlessness, energy, optimism and confidence he exudes, not appearing at all to be intimidated. I like how he tells James Taylor he isn’t yet finished. I wish his speech had been longer, much longer. The fresh energy he offers is sorely needed at times.
Inspired by Climategate

He recounts how he did his own research and realized that what bothered him the most was not that the debate was hidden, but what the climate issue was being used for: “All the taxes, all the laws” and the burning of biofuel was coming at the expense of the poor. Ultimately it was the Climategate affair that spurred him to produce his hit rap music video.
He then tells of the backlash he faced and of how activists even badgered festival organizers to get them to keep Kilez off stage and how he has to fight these battles against activist forces day in and day out. But his cheer and humor are unstoppable, and even infectious…and implies that the trip to Vegas makes it worth it.
Young people won’t buy books on the subject
After the rap performance (unfortunately with audio-technical defects) he emphasizes the importance of the skeptic message reaching young people and that the video acts as a “door-opener” for them as it takes a complex subject and transport it to them. Music and song acts as a first step to get young people to take a closer look, as they aren’t likely to go to the bookstore to buy a book about it. Finally, he praises the impact the video is having because he feels it is indeed opening the doors for open debate among the younger generation.
Kilez could have taken the easy path and opted to play along with the leanings of the showbiz industry, but instead he has elected to go against a powerful social headwind because he feels it is the right thing to do. That’s the mark of a courageous man. Keep it going, Kilez!
Hope to read your comments!

"Ash dieback is back in the news, even though it never really went away. The first confirmed reports were from a few woodlands in East Anglia in late 2012, and urgent surveys soon established a much wider distribution in other parts of England as well as Scotland and Wales. Since then, the disease has spread relentlessly and few areas with ash appear unaffected. The worrying feature of ash dieback is that most trees appear susceptible, dying within a few years. Some survive for longer, but the long term prognosis for ash in the UK is not good. Even as we celebrate the survivors, an insect pest introduced into Europe from Asia is heading our way. Already established in North America, the emerald ash borer has ripped through ash trees in the northern states in the US and threatens to do the same in the UK. The paper that recently returned ash dieback to the media spotlight did so in a general review of the ecological importance of the common ash (Fraxinus excelsior) in northern Europe. The author’s prediction that ash would be driven to near extinction by a fatal combination of dieback and emerald ash borer was not new, even if media reports suggested otherwise: the same prediction was made in the UK in 2012 and in other European countries from the turn of the century.  Ash is a keystone species in the UK, providing a habitat for almost 1,000 other organisms (excluding bacteria). Over 100 species are either completely or highly dependent on ash for survival. So it’s not only ash that is threatened by extinction – if indeed this is what is going to happen. While many reports suggest that the ash tree will eventually disappear from British forests, all is not totally lost. Researchers working together as NORNEX have identified a 200-year-old tree in Norfolk – named “Betty” – that could hold the key to fighting dieback. The tree’s strong tolerance to the disease has helped scientists identify three genetic markers which can help to predict a tree’s susceptibility to the disease. Tolerant trees still get infected by the disease popularly know as “Chalara”, but more correctly as Hymenoscyphus fraxineus. In our experience, all common ash appear susceptible to infection, but their responses differ.  A rate of 3% of trees showing tolerance doesn’t sound high, but ash does seed prolifically so perhaps survivors will eventually fill some of the gaps left by more susceptible individual trees. At the first sites where ash dieback was reported around 20 years ago in Lithuania, many healthy looking ash were left standing, when the badly diseased mature trees were felled. Sadly, almost all of the trees that were left in those first fellings are now either dead or showing severe dieback. The latest research in the UK strongly suggests that Hymenoscyphus fraxineus was already present some years before its official confirmation in 2012. Given the extent of damage caused by the disease, why was it not discovered earlier? A possible reason is that it takes time for a pathogen population to build up sufficiently to become strikingly obvious. It is too late to start agonising about a failure to detect ash dieback. A disease spread by the wind to widely dispersed trees is impossible to stop. We need to think more carefully about research priorities and what we want to achieve. A first priority should be to maintain healthy ash trees in the wider environment in the UK and elsewhere in Europe. This means paying equal attention to the pathogen and the host – and what happens between them. There is good news for the UK, however: the government has already recognised the need for even more and sustained research to avoid such damage to forests. Alongside NORNEX, much research emphasis has been on understanding the fungus that causes the disease and looking for resistance in the host.  The pathogen that causes dieback orginates in Asia, where it invades the tree’s leaves, but doesn’t cause disease – nothing to get concerned about there. When the fungus came to Europe (we’re not sure how), however, it also spread to the stem, killing branches and eventually whole trees. The NORNEX report mentions the second threat on the ash tree’s horizon: the emerald ash borer, an insect which is present on the continent of Europe, having spreading westwards from Moscow. The bright green bug is native to the same areas of east Asia as H. fraxineus, but spread to North America – probably in the late 1990s/early 2000s – where it is devastating all native species of ash. Unfortunately, it is now highly likely that the Emerald ash borer will gradually spread across Europe towards the UK, too.  The ash trees remaining after the effects of H. fraxineus will certainly provide suitable food sources for the borer in the UK. It is essential, therefore, that the rewarding efforts made to understand ash dieback are continued with emphasis on the emerald ash borer. Salvation may be possible, but not overnight. There are some promising paths to pursue but we have to consider whether Asian ash species will provide suitable habitats for the same dependent species as native ash, an ecological question that is hard to answer. Strengthening resistance using Asian ash species holds considerable promise for the future – and not only for ash. The genetic methods employed by NORNEX are relevant to different tree species threatened by other diseases and insects. There is hope ahead to dampen the doomsday scenario that brief bursts of media interest fuel.  It’s not good by any account, but there are glints of hope to lighten the path ahead."
"Ocean acidification is causing fundamental and dangerous changes in the chemistry of the world’s oceans yet only one in five Britons has even heard of ocean acidification, let alone believes it a cause for concern. Around 97%  of climate scientists believe global warming is principally driven by human activity, yet only 16% of the public know the expert consensus to be this strong. These are just two examples of common misconceptions among the UK public on the science of climate change. When surveyed, many people report feeling unsure and confused about various aspects of the discipline. Furthermore, they lack trust in scientists: in the wake of the IPCC’s fifth assessment report, nearly four in ten people felt that scientists were exaggerating concerns. Are these realities any surprise when we see headlines such as “Planet is not overheating, says professor” and “Scientists ‘are exaggerating carbon threat to marine life’” in the UK’s national media? It was the former article that recently prompted a number of members of the House of Lords, including me, to write a letter to the editor of The Times, John Witherow. We highlighted the newspaper’s recent record of tendentious and misleading coverage of climate science (among many other articles, it must be said, that are worthy of the paper’s name and tradition). The “not overheating” article described a study suggesting there is no statistically valid evidence for man-made climate change – and therefore that the planet will not warm significantly by the end of the century. But the study was not conducted by a climate scientist and it ignored basic physical laws. It did not undergo scientific peer-review and it was funded by a climate-sceptic lobby group, the Global Warming Policy Foundation. The fact that a newspaper of The Times’ standing gave coverage to such a piece of research is both remarkable and deeply concerning. But it is not an isolated example. Instead it typifies a disturbing pattern in parts of the UK national media where there is an apparent determination to systematically undermine climate science and those conducting it – and to amplify marginal dissenting arguments even when they come with no evidence. Our letter was intended to highlight the loss of credibility that inevitably comes with printing such stories. Indeed, it is precisely the failure of papers such as The Times to treat climate change properly that is prompting more informed readers to vote with their feet and turn to credible web-based news outlets such as BusinessGreen and Carbon Brief. The media is changing rapidly and established papers such as The Times are competing for readers, credibility and eventually influence against smaller publications that are often producing better coverage. The Times’ loss of credibility is its own problem. However, such articles raise wider concerns about the misunderstandings generated among the public, and the loss of trust in science. These problems result because, despite the proliferation of new media, the established titles continue to play a very important role in perceptions of science. They form the principal conduit through which the public and politicians access scientific information, they provide a proxy for public debate and help set the tone – and often the agenda – for policy-making. Thus poor-quality or slanted science reporting contributes, either unwittingly or wittingly, to the public misunderstanding of science. Public misunderstanding of science can have serious consequences. In the early 1990s, The Sunday Times persisted in denying the link between HIV and AIDs after most other publications had acknowledged reality. An editorial in Nature described its reporting as “seriously mistaken, and probably disastrous”. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, media outlets gave widespread coverage to the hypothesised link between the MMR vaccine and autism – coverage that has since been criticised as naïve and misleading. It goes without saying that such misrepresentations of scientific knowledge run against the interests of society. People are unable to make informed decisions or to demand appropriate action from politicians. In the MMR case, outbreaks involving more than 2,000 cases of measles in 2012 were attributed to years of under-immunisation following media misreporting of the MMR issue. In the case in hand, The Times’ poor reporting on climate science has the potential to cause real harm. Of course, there are uncertainties in climate science, but uncertainty should not be conflated with doubt. As Naomi Oreskes and Eric Conway have so clearly documented in their excellent book Merchants of Doubt, those who wish to undermine the credibility of scientific evidence, for instance the tobacco industry in relation to cancer and smoking, have systematically tried to turn “uncertainty” into “doubt”. So where does this leave us? Editors must be free to print what they want within the law, as a free press is vital for democracy. It is entirely right that scientists, like everyone else, are subject to questioning. Not all of us are angels – and not all research is good research. We are above neither the law nor legitimate journalistic scrutiny – and editors are quite within their rights to seek out divergent views. But the key word here is “legitimate”. Scrutiny that is carried out in the public interest with the intention of uncovering genuinely bad practice is entirely fair; questions asked and articles slanted with the intention of promoting a specific argument are not. And even opinion articles must acknowledge the evidence, otherwise what are they but fiction? Readers also have rights – and the right to object to distorted or biased coverage is one of them. I would argue that in the case of scientists, this extends far beyond being a right – it is virtually an obligation. In 2014, UK citizens invested about £10 billion in research and development. If research is funded by the public, then it is the public’s right to have findings disseminated accurately. And as both the recipients of public funding and the individuals with expertise in these complex subjects, the onus is on us academics to ensure that research is properly communicated. Engaging with the media is not to every scientist’s taste. The journalist’s world is a lot more feisty and less respectful than ours. But in the end, accurate reporting of science matters. Editors do respond to comments and criticism. Scientists can and indeed must challenge poor reporting on climate change and, if enough of us do so regularly, it will improve – to the benefit of scientists, the public and indeed journalism itself."
"Fire chiefs in Australia have warned of “the most dangerous bushfire week this nation has ever seen”, saying New South Wales – the country’s most populous state – faces an unprecedented “catastrophic” fire day on Tuesday Sixty fires are currently burning in across the state, 40 of which are running out of control. There are also nearly 50 fires burning in Queensland, and fires in Western Australia and South Australia. Across NSW, three people have already died, and more than 150 homes have been razed. An extreme and persistent drought has left much of the region tinder-dry. The conditions, combined with temperatures in the high 30s and strong winds, are expected to present about 1,300 volunteer firefighters from across the country with life-threatening fires on Tuesday that will be impossible to stop. Even as emergency authorities were making their preparations, the federal government’s refusal to discuss the role of climate change in worsening the fire risk attracted condemnation, after the deputy prime minister Michael McCormack on Monday dismissed such concerns as the “ravings of … inner-city lunatics”. Earlier, the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, took the unprecedented step of declaring a state of emergency that will be in place for a week.  At one stage on Friday, weeks ahead of Australia’s traditional bushfire season, 99 fires were burning out of control simultaneously across the state, including 17 that were considered life-threatening emergencies. Already this year, bushfires have burnt more than 850,000 hectares across NSW – an area more than five times the size of Greater London – and three times as much as burnt all of last fire season. Thousands have been evacuated from their homes and hundreds of schools have closed. The commissioner of the NSW Rural Fire Services, Shane Fitzsimmons, said the state faced “the most dangerous bushfire week this nation has ever seen”. And he warned that – beyond the immediate threat this week – the fire threat would only worsen as Australia heads into summer. “We have got the worst of our fire season still ahead of us. We’re not even in summer yet,” he said. In the decade since NSW’s bushfire ratings system was revamped – following Victoria’s Black Saturday fires which killed 173 people – Australia’s largest city, Sydney, has never had a “catastrophic” rating. As well as the greater Sydney region, the areas immediately north and south of the state capital – the Greater Hunter, and the Illawarra and Shoalhaven – are also rated catastrophic. The catastrophic rating is based on a matrix of factors including temperature, humidity, wind and dryness of the landscape. Residents are being warned that fires under these conditions are, in some cases, impossible to suppress, and homes will burn. People in fire-prone areas have been told to leave on Monday. “Catastrophic is off the conventional scale,” Fitzsimmons said. “It’s where people die.” Three people were killed on the NSW north coast over the weekend. Two people were found separately in burnt-out cars, apparently trying to flee fast-moving fire fronts. Another woman, 69-year-old Vivian Chaplain, was found unconscious, and badly burned, at the scene of a fire in Wytaliba. Relatives said she had stayed to protect her home and animals. She was flown to hospital in Sydney but later died. The debate over the early and severe start to the east coast fire season has become acutely political, with politicians repeatedly avoiding the question of whether climate change was a contributing factor. The conservative coalition government has faced consistent criticism over inaction on climate change. Carbon emissions are continuing to rise in Australia, reaching their highest ever levels last year. The government says it will meet its Paris agreement targets, but this is disputed by climate scientists. After the prime minister, Scott Morrison, offered “thoughts and prayers” to those who had lost family and homes, but refused to answer questions on climate change, critics compared his “thoughts and prayers” to those offered by the NRA after mass shootings in the US, as substitute for discussion on gun control. Australia’s deputy prime minister, from the country-based Nationals party, condemned the climate change concerns of “raving inner-city lunatics” when Australians in rural areas were still battling fires. “We’ve had fires in Australia since time began, and what people need now is a little bit of sympathy, understanding and real assistance – they need help, they need shelter,” he told ABC radio. It is not a political thing. It is a scientific fact that we are going through climate change. “They don’t need the ravings of some pure, enlightened and woke capital city greenies at this time, when they’re trying to save their homes, when in fact they’re going out in many cases saving other peoples’ homes and leaving their own homes at risk.” But Carol Sparks, the mayor of the Glen Innes Severn council on the NSW north coast, whose house in the hamlet of Wytaliba was severely damaged, said the role of climate change could not be ignored. “Well, I probably couldn’t respond how I really feel on television but I think Michael McCormack needs to read the science, and that is what I am going by, is the science. “It is not a political thing. It is a scientific fact that we are going through climate change.” Sparks, from the Greens party, said of most immediate concern were the houses still burning, and the welfare of those who had lost loved ones and property. “But the overall thing is we are so dry in this country – we haven’t had rain for years in some places. All the dams and creeks and rivers are dry, and we need to look at what we’re going to do about that in the future. To deny climate change is, to me, a very ill-informed and uneducated way of looking at things.” Climate scientist Ned Haughton’s childhood home in the NSW mid-north coast village of Bobin was razed at the weekend. He said with climate change, “it’s going to get worse”. “The state and [federal] Liberal governments are just trying their hardest to shut down any decent action on climate,” he said. “This is just not the right way to act if you care about the planet, if you care about your kids’ future, if you care about other people in your community’s future.”"
"The world’s oldest message in a bottle recently washed up on the North Sea island of Amrum, in Germany. It was one of 390 such bottles placed in the ocean by scientist George Bidder back in August 1906. During the 110-year voyage, the bottle had travelled just a few hundred miles – hardly a Robinson Crusoe-style call for rescue from a far corner of the globe. But nonetheless Bidder was on to something: such messages were and still are vital for scientists seeking to understand ocean circulation patterns. Bidder was an eminent marine biologist who worked across the globe, focused mainly on sponges. While at the Marine Biological Association in Plymouth, on England’s south-west coast, he became interested in understanding the movements of bottom-feeding animals and so perfected the “bottom trailer” bottle which sat just above the seabed, and was gently bounced along by the ocean’s deepest currents. The bottles were either picked up by trawlers or eventually found their way to the coast. They gave an indication of flow patterns and Bidder managed to prove a much-suspected theory that bottom feeders prefer to move against the current.
Oceanographers have used such methods for many years to study flow, both at surface and near sea-bed – and the return on these messages is surprisingly good. Scientists rely on the public discovering them (usually washed up on beaches) and reporting their final position. To encourage the observer to report the bottle Bidder promised the princely sum of one shilling – which the finder received from the MBA more than a century later.    Thousands of messages, containing everything from photos to wedding cake, are thrown to the sea to be taken on a voyage of adventure – and there is a certain romance in that. Many wash up a few hundred meters along the shore, others take a much longer journey.   I get phone calls most months about such discoveries. I once deployed 1,000 such messages myself in the English Channel to the south of the Isle of Wight. Around 400 were returned, providing invaluable information on the general flow of the region which can then be used to determine how pollutants would move in our coastal seas. However today our knowledge of oceans currents is advanced enough that random individual messages rarely tell us some new facts of the ocean – there are no mystery “supercurrents” waiting to be discovered.   Accidental spills can nonetheless still help ocean science. In 1992, a container of plastic bath toys broke free in the Pacific off the coast of Japan and 29,000 plastic ducks, turtles, beavers and frogs made a bid for freedom. Since then these “friendly floatees” have been studied by Curtis Ebbesmeyer, a retired oceanographer and beachcomber from Seattle. Their arrival at beaches around the Pacific and, more recently, the Atlantic coast of Canada have enabled scientists to understand more about the so-called Pacific garbage patch and how water flows through the narrow Bering Strait and eventually into the North Atlantic.   There was a flurry of interest as yellow plastic ducks started to appear on British and French beaches a few years ago – but when I inspected them more closely they turned out to be distant cousins of the Pacific contingent, probably escapees from a rubber duck race in some local river.  That said, given how long plastic lasts in the environment, there is every reason to expect the friendly floatees to eventually find their way to a beach near you, wherever you live. What these ducks show is that, in time, all the oceanic waters are connected and even the water found 6km down a Pacific trench will, over many hundreds of years, reach the coast of Scotland or Brazil. Scientists still deliberately use the message in a bottle technique these days, though they are more sophisticated now, and significantly more expensive.   Today there is a network of more than 3,800 “Argo floats”, which can adjust their buoyancy in order to travel at any depth of the ocean. Not only do they then go with the flow, they collect data on the temperature, salinity, oxygen and even phytoplankton levels of the oceans. To report their position and transmit data they pop up to the surface every five to ten days before returning to depth to continue their journey. With enough power for more than three years, these robotic messages in a bottle work hard to give us details that really do advance our understanding of the oceans and the changing climate. The Argo network is worldwide – buoys have been deployed by virtually every ocean science nation on the planet and, as with all oceanographic data, the information is open access, with a new app to add the Argo data to Google Earth.   So now we can all enjoy finding messages from the ocean from our computers without having to comb the beaches, though you would lose out on that healthy sea breeze – and, as an oceanographer, I would never want to miss that."
"Britain’s railways can no longer cope with the effects of the climate crisis, a senior rail executive has warned. Extreme weather events including heatwaves, storms and flooding have damaged infrastructure and halted thousands of services across the UK this year. Alex Hynes, the managing director of Scotland’s railway, said more investment would be needed to future-proof the railway against rising temperatures. “The railway in this country can no longer cope because of climate change,” he said. Calling for more to be done on decarbonising rail, he told the Railway Industry Association conference in London: “We have a vested interest in making this work.” In July, hot weather forced trains to run at maximum speeds of 20mph (32km/h) on parts of the railway network, resulting in many services being cancelled and rail operators telling people not to travel. Trains were slowed due to the risk of tracks buckling in the heat and causing a derailment. Extreme temperatures can also result in overhead electric lines drooping and being damaged by trains. Hynes said the rail industry needed to build tracks resilient at 40C (104F) in the rest of the UK and 35C in Scotland. Steel in rails is currently stress-tested at 28C. More than 1,000 trains were cancelled in Scotland alone due to record temperatures in summer 2018. This was reduced to 200 in 2019 despite an even hotter summer, after a £4m investment in track resilience. Hynes suggested the rail industry should see the commercial opportunity in the climate emergency and tell passengers when they are taking a greener form of transport. “There is money to be made … We need to tell people they are on an electric train,” he said. However, Anthony Smith, the chief executive of Transport Focus, told the conference that according to the independent passenger watchdog’s research, most passengers would prefer an on-time diesel to a late-running electric train. Although railways have long been susceptible to weather-associated delays, from snow in winter to problems with wet leaves in autumn, Network Rail is expecting to invest billions more to mitigate the effects of more frequent and extreme events. Much of its most recent climate change adaptation plan was written in the aftermath of extensive flooding in 2015, including the closure of the Devon-Cornwall line after the track was washed away at Dawlish. Heavy rainfall and flooding remain the most significant problems in parts of the rail network, notably Wales. However, Network Rail data for 2018-19 showed total delays ascribed to high temperatures surpassed the combined total of flooding, snow, fog and cold even before the more widespread disruption in July."

Share this...FacebookTwitterEurope’s regulation bureaucrats are going out of control once again.
Citizens, they feel, aren’t grown up enough to responsibly operate their own household applicances. They need to be nannied, the EU bureaucrats believe.
So out they come with the European Ecodesign Directive, which originally was intended to regulate electric appliances like flat screen televisions, dishwashers or lamps. But the power to intrude into people’s lives and tell them how to live was just too irresistible – Brussels bureaucrats wanted more. In 2009 the directive was expanded to include all appliances that “can impact natural resources.” All the intrusion and regulation are justified by the need to “protect our climate”.
Last October I wrote about how the EU was gearing up to restrict household vacuum cleaners. Next in line are coffee machines.
The Austrian daily Der Standard here reports that a new European eco-design directive will switch off coffee machines already after five minutes. The directive will go into effect on January 1, 2015. Commercial coffee makers will be exempted.
Already harsh criticism is mounting. Some German conservative politicians say that the EU “should focus more on really important issues.” Moreover, the German business association UV Nord criticizes the “regulation madness” of the EU.
But the EU commission defends the move, claiming that it does not regulate the coffee machines in general, but rather only their warming function.
Der Standard writes:
The manufacturers can decide whether they wish to allow the consumers to decide if they want to deactivate the automatic switch-off function of the hot-plate function.”

High-carb, low fat diet puts the pounds on and makes you sick. This “registered dietician” claims carbohydrates are the way to go! Unfortunately she has been woefully misinformed and the high-carb diet she is peddling isn’t even working for her. Photo cropped from FOX 32.
Even Time Magazine is coming around!
Bryan Walsh writes at leftie-veggie Time Magazine here is waking up to one of the greatest myths ever perpetuated onto mankind. No, I’m not talking about global warming from carbon (that’s the second biggest). I’m talking about the myth that heart disease is caused by fats from meat, eggs, butter, etc.
Walsh at Time writes:

Ending the War on Fat
For decades, it has been the most vilified nutrient in the American diet. But new science reveals fat isn’t what’s hurting our health.
[…] We were only doing what we were told. In 1977, the year before I was born, a Senate committee led by George McGovern published its landmark ‘Dietary Goals for the United States,’ urging Americans to eat less high-fat red meat, eggs and dairy and replace them with more calories from fruits, vegetables and especially carbohydrates.

The progressive, enlightened George McGovern – a Democrat.
And the rest is history. Today we are finding out it was all driven by junk science from greedy Big Food, and pharmaceutical companies who, as of today, have raked in hundreds of billions in revenues from medications for treating “high cholesterol”, diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiac diseases and many many others. They did this by promoting a diet that made us very sick. There are documents that prove they intentionally deceived the public. I wonder if they will ever be brought to justice for the health mayhem the inflicted onto the public.
I suspect that in about 30 or 40 years from now people will also wake up to the “consensus” driven myth of CO2 causing global warming, climate change and extreme weather. You could substitute the word “fat” in the above text with “CO2”, etc. and get a pretty accurate story.
Just as the junk science vilifying fat caused mayhem in human health, the junk science vilifying CO2 will cause mayhem with our economic health.
For me it is already clear. I switched to a high-fat, low-carb diet and lost 20 lbs over the last three months or so. I have more energy, no longer put up with cravings every 2 hours, and I’m off the blood pressure medicine.
Of course I’m still eating a good share of vegetables.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany today likes to boast a total of 36,000 megawatts of installed photovoltaic capacity and over 30,000 MW capacity of wind power. Theoretically at noon on a sunny, windy day Germany could cover almost all of its electric power demand, which at noon on a workday is roughly 70,000 megwatts.
But anyone familiar with Germany’s climate knows the country’s weather is often gray and sees about as much sunshine as Alaska does. Germany has a fair amount of windy days, but periods of windless days are also frequent enough. They can’t be avoided and must be reckoned with. In a nutshell, solar and wind power production are often AWOL and so conventional power systems (coal, gas, nuclear) always need to be on standby, ready to deliver on a minute’s notice.
To illustrate, the following chart depicts German electric power production and consumption over the 6-day period 14-19 July: conventional power (gray), solar production (yellow), wind (dark blue), hydro (light blue) and biomass (green). German consumption is shown by the red line.

Readers immediately notice the huge fluctuations in solar and wind power outputs. At night there’s no sun and the wind appears only sporadically.

//-->




The data from the above chart show, for example, that at 9 p.m. on July 16 total wind power output was a mere 0.334 gigawatts and the day’s last rays of sunlight were delivering only 0.103 gigawatts of power. That means the two sources of wind and solar combined were putting out only [(0.334 + 0.103)/65]100 = 0.7% of their rated capacity. That in turn means the remaining 99.3% had to come in large part from the conventional coal, nuclear and gas power plants.
Germany’s installed wind/solar systems on average operate roughly at about 15% of their capacity.
Moreover the chart shows that wind energy output was close to zero for a period of three days (July 16 – 19). Little wonder that wind and solar have yet to replace a single conventional coal power plant in Germany. No matter how much installed solar/wind capacity the country has, it still has to rely on conventional power on windless nights, which are frequent enough.
The result is that the economics of wind/solar energy are just plain awful. To illustrate, imagine the costs involved in being forced to own two cars: an expensive one that runs on average only 1 random day a week, and a cheaper one that can run anytime. Whenever you want to drive, you are first required to drive the expensive/unreliable one. Only when it doesn’t start up are you allowed to drive the cheaper, always operable car. Obviously such a model of personal transportation (being forced to own, maintain, insure and repair two cars) would bankrupt most working-class households.
Today’s green wind/solar energy makes little economic sense.

"The board of French energy giant EDF has voted in favour of investing in a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset, England. However, in a surprise move the UK government has delayed a final decision on the project, sparking new debate on what is the right step forward for energy in the UK. A recent report by the UK’s National Audit Office added to a long-running argument about how much new nuclear will cost in higher bills, higher subsidies or a mix of the two. The deal offered by the UK government had set a price for electricity from Hinkley of £92.50/MWh (in 2012 prices) which is index-linked and runs for 35 years from when the power station starts. That’s roughly double recent wholesale electricity prices. But what’s missing is a fresh discussion on what to do instead of large projects like Hinkley. This requires a challenge to the mindset that’s led the UK to paint itself into a corner. There’s long been a culture of big is better when the UK considers energy – find the next big gas field or build another big power station and the problem is sorted. Locally produced solar and wind energy is now more common. We have all seen how prices for panels and turbines have tumbled with forecasts that costs for solar and onshore wind will fall a further 41% and 60% by 2040 respectively. That’s great news but, as the much-missed David MacKay pointed out, the space for such distributed supplies will become an issue at some point. The big is better culture goes hand-in-hand with a focus on the supply side. Addressing Britain’s energy shortages traditionally meant finding new gas fields or building more power plants, but we’re now seeing a shift in investment to the consumption side with more focus on efficient cars, buildings or industrial processes. Across the world, 32% of energy sector investment in 2015 went on efficiency measures that reduce demand – up from just 17% the previous year. UK policy needs to reflect this shift. For the past eight years the government has had a standalone Department of Energy and Climate Change with a remit that often left transport, construction and industry in the control of other, larger departments. The new Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy can aim for a balance between addressing both the supply and consumption of energy. Moving DECC to within the business department raises the interesting question of what role energy might play in any industrial strategy. EDF’s difficulty securing the investment for Hinkley is a reflection of the financial challenges faced by all of the major European power companies. In 2013, Gerard Mestrallet, the then CEO of GDF Suez (now renamed Engie) led a delegation of the major energy firms to the European parliament and said:  European energy companies are experiencing difficulties for which there is no precedent: the impairment of their European assets, the early closure of power plants, and a reduction in investments amongst other problems. The entire sector’s business situation is under severe pressure.   Results since then have merely illustrated those pressures with mounting losses and plans for companies like E.On and RWE to split themselves into “old” and new"" parts. The oil and gas industry faces similar challenges. Its return on capital peaked in 2008, nearly halved by 2013, and now has slumped with hydrocarbon prices that look to be “lower for longer”. The UK’s North Sea oil and gas industry’s net rate of return, a measure of profitability, hit an all-time low of 0.6% in the fourth quarter of 2015, well below the country’s manufacturing sector at 7.2% or the service sector at 22%. Returns in oil and gas measured this way used to vary between 20% and 60% and consistently outpaced the other sectors. The traditional investors in British energy look smaller and less able to take on very large scale projects than in the past. The evidence from Hinkley is that the UK government won’t invest up front in such projects. As EDF is 85% owned by the French government, the board’s decision will tell us something about the French state’s investment appetite. The UK needs to get over the idea that huge megaprojects are the solution to everything. Instead, it should think of a new mix between smaller and larger, be more joined up in considering consumption as well as supply and think more decentralised than central. That expands the industries, companies, institutions and government departments involved. That calls for an industrial strategy focused on energy."

Share this...FacebookTwitterRenowned Swedish paleogeophysicist Prof. Nils-Axel Mörner also has sent his comment to NoTricksZone concerning the termination of the fellowship of Caleb S. Rossiter and the state of climate science.
His comment is also followed by a joint statement sent by German climate scientists Prof Dr. Gerhard Gerlich and Dr. Ralf D. Tscheuschner.
Nils-Axel Mörner:
Ass. Professor, Paleogeophysics & Geodynamics
Sea Level, Paleoclimate, Sun-Earth Interaction
The story of ‘a twinkling blanket of bulbs’ is touching (the words by Rossiter in WSJ). Of course, South Africa should have its new coal-fired power plant. The global hysteria about CO2-emissions is a terrible instrument in neo-colonialism, and has set up such remarkable personal behaviours of inquisition and book-burning.
The issue is surely not founded in science. More remarkable is that it has swept across the world. However its days are doomed, and with the accumulation of new facts and records, it will wither away – but until that day of science liberation arrives, we will continue to face much destruction, inquisition and misconceptions.”
Prof. Dr. Gerhard Gerlich / Dr. Ralf D. Tscheuschner:
The days of this CO2 malarkey are coming to an end – sooner or later. Therefore, Professor Rossiter’s fellowship at the Institute for Policy Studies should be reactivated since he got the point. We have emphasized that there are no atmospheric CO2 greenhouse effects in physics, and climate models are not based on physics. The anti-CO2 campaigners never presented measurements, which show that an atmospheric gas volume warms up in response to a concentration increase of the trace gas CO2. And never it was proven that so-called “fossil fuels” are fossil. The earth ball is a huge repository of resources wrapped into a thin film of mankind. So what? An enlightened, up-powered and industrialized Africa will be a source of our future inspirations and creativity.  IPCC, Al Gore, and their buddies should turn off their light bulbs sustainably. This would solve most of these (pseudo-)problems of our time immediately.”

"Authorities are warning New South Wales residents not to underestimate the damaging effects of smoke as air quality worsens amid the state’s bushfire crisis. About 80 fires are burning across NSW, filling Sydney’s skies with smoke pollution of “hazardous” proportions, according to the environment department. The latest air quality index rating has recorded 221 micrograms of particulates per cubic metre in Sydney’s east, while the lower Hunter’s figure of 306 was the worst in the state. Dust has also contributed to poor air quality in Sydney, Newcastle and the central coast ahead of a southern change expected to hit on Tuesday evening, the Bureau of Meteorology said. The NSW Ambulance commissioner, Dominic Morgan, said the smoke was causing “slightly above-average demand” on services, with almost 100 asthma or breathing-related calls since Tuesday morning. Of those, 39 were from the Sydney area and another 35 were from the north of the state where the majority of fires are burning. In one case paramedics treated a patient who no longer had their reliever medication. Morgan urged asthmatics and others vulnerable to respiratory issues to remain vigilant, or the consequences could be fatal. “To fail to make a plan when you have an asthma condition or respiratory condition and not have reliever medication, this could be a deadly condition for you,” he said. “So make a plan and get medical aid as soon as possible.” The Australian National University population and climate health expert Liz Hanna said everybody should be wary of the smoke’s irritating effects. “Never underestimate how these things can sneak up on you and how damaging they can be, even if you think you’re fit and well,” Hanna said. “Smoke can amplify pre-existing conditions but also trigger responses in people that don’t know that they’re subclinical. “They can have quite a dramatic response and this could be their first time. “That’s when it’s really quite dangerous because they don’t know they’re vulnerable and they tend to not have the medication by their side.” Inhaled heat can also burn people’s throat and lungs, Hanna said. “There’s a wicked tendency for people to get out there in their thongs and shorts,” she said. “That offers zero protection to the radiant heat of a fire. “They should wear thick cotton fabric rather than some of the artificial fabrics that can actually melt and burn the skin.” Hanna echoed the advice of authorities for people to remain indoors and avoid outdoor activity, noting long-term exposure to pollution can lead to problems later in life. “You can have scarring in which case your long-term respiratory function is diminished,” she said. “All this stuff can sensitise [people] and give them lifelong problems with breathing and greater susceptibility to colds and coughs and shortness of breath when confronted with other problems.” Across NSW more than 575 schools were closed on Tuesday after the state premier, Gladys Berejiklian, declared a week-long state of emergency in the wake of devastating fires on the NSW mid-north coast in which three people died and at least 150 homes were destroyed."

"The Turkish military’s attempted coup to topple president Recep Tayyip Erdogan didn’t last long. The government restored control the following day and soon declared a three-month state of emergency, with more than 60,000 people since arrested or placed under investigation. This isn’t just Turkey’s problem. The country’s pivotal position in the transport of oil and gas gives it huge geopolitical significance. Straddling Europe and the Middle East and providing export routes from Central Asia to the rest of the world, Turkey is an important and growing energy transit hub.  Shipping in the Bosphorus straits between the Black Sea and Mediterranean Sea was halted in the immediate aftermath of the attempted coup because of security concerns, though it was soon reopened. Although oil and gas flows were broadly unaffected by the coup, the prospect of prolonged instability raises the spectre of disruption to their transit. Two major oil pipelines pass through Turkey to the Ceyhan terminal on its Mediterranean coastline. One begins in Baku, the capital of oil-rich Azerbaijan, before passing through Georgia. The other delivers oil from Kirkuk in northern Iraq and has been affected by fighting with Islamic State and Kurdish insurgents, and disputes between Baghdad and the Kurdish government. When fully operational the two piplines have a combined capacity of 2.7m barrels per day, which is more than three times greater than the UK’s daily production. The country’s location at the mouth of the Black Sea means it plays an equally key role in the seaborne oil trade. Around 3% of the world’s oil and petroleum products pass through the Bosphorus from Russia, Ukraine and central Asia.  Turkey is also an important transit state for the EU’s natural gas imports. The Blue Stream pipeline, which runs underneath the Black Sea from Russia, carried 14.7 billion m³ of gas in 2013 – equivalent to 9% of the total Russian gas supplies to Europe that year. Blue Stream was built in the early 2000s in response to growing disruption of gas flows through Ukraine and Belarus. The recent conflict in Ukraine highlights how Turkey’s importance has grown in recent years. Further into the future, the planned Southern Gas Corridor development would see gas from fields in Azerbaijan flowing through Turkey to the EU by 2018, while the planned Turkish Stream pipeline across the Black Sea would also circumvent Ukraine. Turkey’s key location for energy supplies and regional affairs means the EU has always considered it a strategic partner. The country’s accession process for membership started back in 2005. And this same strategic importance may be useful even today – some have suggested Europe’s timid response to Erdogan and his crackdown after the attempted coup is because of Turkey’s crucial role in supplying the EU with energy. Although European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said Turkey was “not in a position to become a member” following the coup, the ongoing migrant crisis and concerns over energy supplies mean it will be difficult for the EU to take too strict a position. As the EU seeks to become less dependent on Russian gas it will need to develop supplies from Central Asia through Turkey’s Southern Corridor, while also increasing its supply from global Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) markets. At the same time, Russia will continue to reroute its gas exports away from Ukraine, instead increasing flows through Turkey and through the expanded Nordstream pipeline in Germany. It is therefore highly unlikely that the strategic nature of EU-Turkey relations will change in the foreseeable future, even if Erdogan’s government places further restrictions on society. But, given further civil unrest or terrorism could increase political instability and threaten Turkey’s energy sector, Europe is right to be worried."
"Opponents of the Iraq war often highlight the importance of oil when explaining why the invasion took place. While leaders at the time denied it was a motivation there is no doubt the country’s huge oilfields did offer possible post-conflict opportunities for the Iraqi industry and international corporations.  However what is missing from the post-Chilcot Report discussions and debates is a sense of what Iraqi oil sector is actually like today. So, even if the war really was “all about oil” … did it succeed on those terms? For Iraqis dealing with the aftermath of invasion, the development of its oil and gas sector after 2003 is analogous to the nation as a whole: the vaulting ambition of the American occupation; the dysfunctional institutions they bequeathed; and Iraq’s internal rivalries that may lead to its partition. Oil is central to Iraq’s present and future. It accounts for 99% of all government revenue. Along with existing reserves of 143 billion barrels (5th in the world) it is estimated there are 50 to 200 billion barrels yet to be discovered making it the largest unexplored market in the world.     For decades before the invasion, the industry had been in the hands of the state-owned Iraq National Oil Company. “Arab oil for the Arabs” was one of the most popular slogans of the Baathist era (1968-2003), and nationalisation in 1972 was the enactment of a policy that had first been demanded in the 1950s.  But if American post-war planners were aware of this history they appeared to ignore it. Away from Iraq, they planned to open up the nationalised oil industry to international investors and owners, and to the benefits of liberalisation.  By 2003, the Iraqi oil industry was in desperate need of renovation and modernisation. A combination of war and sanctions had shielded it from many of the advances that the industry had made elsewhere in the previous quarter of a century. New techniques in seismic surveying and drilling technologies held the potential to transform current and future production. Iraq could have become a beacon of oil industry privatisation.  However, while external knowledge and investment may have been useful, there was no appetite among Iraqi politicians or people for privatisation. The occupation was also in no position to push through any reform that could unite nearly all the country’s political forces in opposition. In the end, the US-led administration announced in September 2003 that foreign investment was acceptable for the rest of the economy but not for the oil sector. The occupiers never actually resolved how the Iraqi oil sector would be rebuilt and its wealth distributed. Prior to 2003 all oil profits had gone to Baghdad, providing a succession of authoritarian leaders with the means to maintain their rule (Saddam Hussein being the final and most brutal example). Oil was most plentiful in the supergiant fields of Rumaila, near Basra in the Shia-dominated south, and near Kirkuk in the north-east. Yet neither city received the full rewards of their oil as the Shia and Kurdish communities were marginalised in the era of Saddam.  An equitable distribution of oil wealth was therefore key to resolving conflict in Iraq and avoiding the emergence of another Saddam. Everyone knew this. However despite this ambition the governments that have followed the US-led occupation have proved themselves incapable of reaching a fair settlement.   The Iraqi Constitution, agreed in 2005, suggests oil is owned by all Iraqis but does not specify how its wealth would be shared. In an attempt to decide how money will be distributed, a National Hydrocarbon Law was drawn up back in 2007. However various drafts continue to fail to resolve disputes among oil and non-oil producing regions and the law still awaiting parliamentary approval nine years later.  In the middle of all of this the oil industry continues functioning in a complex framework of varying interpretations of the constitution and laws dating back to before 2003. Production has increased as international companies have entered to exploit the established oil fields around Basra and Kirkuk through a series of licensing agreements.  But the legal problems persists, foreign oil firms still employ few Iraqis, and local communities see no benefit from the international presence. The international companies persist using foreign workers and security companies to maintain their production.  Oil is a target for ISIS as a resource to be captured for its nascent state or an industry to be disrupted in the territories it does not control. Oil facilities in Baiji were a site of fierce fighting between government and ISIS forces in 2014 and 2015, and oil pipelines are frequently attacked. Although the sector functions, the chaos surrounding the oil industry mirrors the confused outcomes of the invasion. A different approach was followed in the north of Iraq where the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) divided up its territory into blocks for exploration, inviting international companies in on production sharing contracts. When discoveries were made, major companies like ExxonMobil and Chevron got involved.  The difficulty the KRG faced was that, although oil had been discovered, the lack of an Iraq-wide agreement meant it was unclear how it could be monetised. Baghdad and the KRG have had endless disputes over ownership and budget allocation. The greater the dispute between the two, the more the KRG has pulled away, signing energy deals with the Turkish government and selling its oil on the international market. Getting oil out of Kurdistan was initially a problem, but in 2014 a new pipeline joined KRG oil fields to Turkey. For the leadership of Kurdistan, oil is a key political and economic asset, potentially leading to an independent future, although the recent global fall in the price of oil has called into question if this is financially viable.  The development of oil in Iraq after 2003 is much like the development of the new state. The oil industry is a mix of state ownership and international interests, while the legal framework they work in highlights the continued failure to resolve divisive issues. Kurdistan demonstrates the very real potential of the country dividing.  Divergent interests are joined together by oil but there are few political leaders who can articulate a unifying narrative. This is then played out within a dysfunctional political system left behind by a hasty and ill-conceived occupation, further complicated by the later emergence of ISIS. The invasion of Iraq in 2003 may not have been all about oil, but a settlement on oil is required if the post-invasion conflict is to be resolved."

"The beguiling behaviour of marine mammals in their natural environment is fascinating to us human observers. Watching dolphins leap gracefully through the surf, or whales making waves with their massive tale flukes is the stuff of countless bucket lists and high definition wildlife documentaries. Perhaps part of the appeal lies in marine mammals behaving a lot like we do. They share many of our biological characteristics, such as bearing live young, suckling them with rich fatty milk and investing time and energy into rearing them into adulthood.  Studying their behaviour, what makes them tick as complex social creatures, is essential for their conservation in an aquatic environment which remains almost entirely alien to us. And while it may be alien, it is an environment with a massive human footprint.  For unfortunately mammalian attributes are not all we share with our oceanic cousins. There is arguably now no marine habitat that remains unaffected by human activities. Prey depletion caused by humans, noise, temperature changes, chemical pollution and entanglements in fishing gear have all changed the place in which marine mammals evolved.  Our research shows that this simple reality makes the need to understand their behaviour and social structures all the more urgent, a call which is being echoed by the charity Whale and Dolphin Conservation.  In recent decades there has been a strong emphasis in conservation circles on understanding the population size and distribution of marine mammals, as well as their genetic diversity.  Conservation is principally obsessed with conserving genetic diversity, which is exactly as it should be, as diverse gene pools help ensure resilience against environmental change. But genes may not be the whole story. Marine mammal behaviour, just like ours, is partially determined by genes and the environment in which they live. However there are also social factors at play, and what makes marine mammals behave the way they do is potentially as complex as the processes which drive human behaviour.  In some cases, nurture may play just as important a role as nature for marine mammals. Almost 20 years ago, renowned conservation biologist Bill Sutherland examined how the behaviour of different species could be used to improve conservation efforts. He concluded that behavioural ecology needed to be better integrated into conservation science and policy making. But to what extent has this message from 1998 been taken on board?  Marine mammals exhibit a wide range of fascinating behaviours, from the complex cooperative bubble-net feeding of humpback whales, to ice-cave building polar bears and tool-using sea otters. They also have a great diversity in their social structures and changing social dynamics, which range between the complex third-order alliances of bottlenose dolphins, close relationships between non-related males, to the more solitary lives of beaked whales.  As well as having innate behaviours, which they acquire through their genes, these species, like humans, can learn individually and from each other. Social learning may be of particular importance to conservation efforts, because it can influence the resilience of a population to changes in their environment.  Killer whales learn foraging strategies from their social group and tend to stick to them. As a result, if there is a decline in their preferred prey, they may be less likely to switch to other species, or use alternative foraging tactics. Such a behaviourally conservative species is likely to be more vulnerable to change. But learning is only part of marine mammal social dynamics. Social structure, and the various roles played by individuals may also be important for how a population responds to change. The loss of individuals that hold key information on the location of critical habitat or a food source may have significant consequences. Humans live in many different types of cultures, environments and circumstances. We make important choices about what to eat, who to socialise with, where to live and how many offspring to have. These factors can strongly influence our fertility rates, survival, and even our evolution. It is certainly plausible that many of these factors influence the success of marine mammals as well. A better understanding of the behavioural ecology of marine mammals is therefore hugely important. It is difficult to envision an approach toward conserving a population of modern humans which merely preserved their genetic integrity and did not also consider their socially learnt behaviour.  While there are some attempts to incorporate behaviour, efforts to conserve marine mammal biodiversity still focus strongly on maintaining genetic integrity and diversity. But the emerging evidence indicates that social and behavioural diversity may also be central to individual, group, and population viability. The challenge ahead is teasing out the most relevant factors and understanding how to incorporate this new knowledge into conservation efforts. On the whole, policy makers have been slow to keep up with the emerging behavioural research. More alarming still, from the perspective of the marine mammals themselves, is that the degradation of their environment has continued apace."

Just before the 3-minute mark he comments on the general nonsense behind the claims that global warming causes more cold weather and on how John Holdren, senior advisor to President Barack Obama on science and technology, “was mouthing off on how global warming was causing it to get so cold back in January”.
At the 3:08 mark Joe reiterates his long term forecast for global temperatures:
“I do think the planet is going to be cooling the next 20 to 30 years due to natural processes. But some of these explanations border on inane”

He then reminds viewers that those blaming the cold on warming “obviously do not make forecasts for a living“.
Trapped heat constantly AWOL
And already we see that the earth’s temperature has not risen in almost 18 years. This year’s once forecast “super El Nino” is failing to materialize, which raises the question as to where all “the missing heat” could possibly be lurking.
It’s turning out that the missing heat is wholly theoretical and exists only in climate models, and is nowhere to be observed in reality.
Predictions of it reappearing have failed over and over again.

Share this...FacebookTwitterBritain has the UKIP party; Germany has got the Alternativ für Deutschland (AfD) party, translated: Alternative for Germany. Both are equally hated by the establishment. The media do all they can to portray them as dangerous, right-wing, beer-hall populists.
In a nutshell: they are a threat to the cozy establishment.
Last September the AfD party barely missed reaching the 5% hurdle in Germany’s national elections, and thus just missed taking seats in Parliament. Some claim the results were tampered with in order to keep the enfant terrible party out. No matter the result, the party did send a clear message, and it continues to send such messages today.
In it’s latest press release, the AfD announces its position on Germany’s renewable energy feed-in act, calling for its abolishment.
The energy summit last Tuesday at the federal Chancellor’s Office missed its targets. The planned, low-impact slowdown in the expansion of wind and solar was softened considerably using tricks. The rise in the renewable energy feed-in act (EEG) subsidies will continue to gallop on ahead unhindered, so concluded even a proponent of the transition to renewable energies, Holger Krahwinkel, of the consumer associations. Share prices of wind energy plant builder Nordex at times shot up by 7%.
‘The EEG charges is driving the electricity costs dramatically upwards,’ explains Dr. Alexander Gauland, spokesman for the Alternative für Deutschland. ‘Already they are among the highest in Europe. Since the start of the EEG act, the payments made by power grid operators to the owners of renewable energy plants have totaled to be more than 120 billion euros – paid by the consumers. Just in 2013 the figure was 23 billion euros – the tendency is strongly upwards.’
Gauland summarizes: ‘That’s why every ‘correction’ or ‘reform’ amounts only to a senseless doctoring of the symptoms. The cost burden on the German consumer is already very immense and is no longer bearable for more than 600,000 households. At the same time more industrial jobs are moving to cheaper foreign countries. That number is already tens of thousands, and also here the trend is strongly upwards. This is why the AfD is requesting the immediate abolishment of the EEG act. It has made this request an official position in its European election program.“

"Note: this article is spoiler-free. The epic television series Game of Thrones makes compelling viewing for many reasons. Exotic locations and cutting edge visual effects have spectacularly translated George R R Martin’s vision onto the small screen. These production values have made the series one of the most expensive ever made and allowed the attention to detail required to build an immersive world of humans, dragons, the old gods and the new.  But as fantastic as this conjured world is, recent research seems to prove the old adage that fact can indeed be stranger than fiction. Because while the lands of Westeros and beyond experience dramatic shifts in weather and seasons, changes in climate here on Earth are even weirder.  Other than constant politicking and backstabbing (not to mention front stabbing, decapitation, and immolation) there are few constants in Game of Thrones. Long running shows typically assure us that our favourite characters will carry on and that their lives will span seasons. But anyone who has been keeping up with the Starks and Lannisters will be well aware by now that playing a central role provides no guarantee of longevity. Remember the Red Wedding? But throughout this maelstrom there is an ever present factor. A brooding menace that belittles all the squabbles and fighting.  The threat of winter’s return. “Oh, my sweet summer child,” Old Nan said quietly, “what do you know of fear? Fear is for the winter, my little lord, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep and the ice wind comes howling out of the north.” Winter in Westeros is a serious business. The larger towns and citadels survive with stockpiles of food and firewood. Small communities either flee or perish. What makes winters so harsh is that they can last for many years. The opening book of A Song of Ice and Fire – A Game of Thrones from which the television series takes its name – opens with concerns that the winter is due to return after nine years of summer. Such a long summer heralds an equally long winter.  Why the change of seasons is so unpredictable is subject of speculation in the real world and in the books. Some claim it was a consequence of a battle some 8,000 years ago. The scholars, healers, and learned men – the Maesters – discount this as a fable with no supporting evidence. How could humans alter the seasons? What’s intriguing is that this Game of Thrones myth may have some basis in reality. Because something happened here on Earth about 8,000 to 12,000 years ago that could have profoundly affected the Earth’s climate and the history of all civilisations. Glaciations, or ice ages, have been a regular occurrence on Earth for the past 2.6m years, the geological period known as the Quaternary. Due to a combination of orbital mechanics, tectonic processes, and ocean currents, the Earth’s climate periodically is thrown into a reinforcing feedback loop that plunges temperatures lower and lower. The polar ice caps and glaciers expand while sea levels fall as much as 120 metres.   Periods between ice ages – interglacials – have lasted around 10,000 years in Earth’s recent geological history. Given that it’s been more than 12,000 years since the last glacial maximum, one may conclude that a new ice age is overdue. However, that may not be the case. We may have stopped it.  Humans began farming almost as soon as the last ice age ended. Although the numbers of humans were small, land use change such as burning fields and forests would have released carbon dioxide into the Earth’s atmosphere, which along with methane from the increased number of cattle, could have been sufficient to effectively put the next ice age on hold, so delicate was the balance between the two climate states. It’s worth pointing out that the difference in global temperatures between our current climate and the depths of the previous glacial maximum is about 5℃. Consider how different a world that is 5℃ warmer than today would be.  A study published in the journal Nature at the start of 2016 contained the even more remarkable conclusion that human activity since the Industrial Revolution has not only paused but indefinitely delayed the series of ice ages. In fact, it may be that by elevating atmospheric carbon dioxide to levels not seen on Earth for millions of years, humans have ejected the Earth out of the Quaternary ice ages. Think about that for a moment. The process of industrialisation that began some 300 years ago has disrupted a 2.6m-year-old climate state. No more ice ages. But isn’t that good news? The dawn of a new ice age would plunge civilisation into chaos. We may not have intended to, but our actions have avoided such a calamity. Unfortunately, it’s possible to have too much of a good thing. Now we fear not winter, but a period of rapid warming, the likes of which our civilisations have never experienced before. It seems unimaginable that we could effect such significant change over such a short period of time. Harder still to acknowledge is that if we are to avoid dangerous climate change, then we must radically change how we power our industrialised societies.  Such change will not be easy to effect. As Tyrion Lannister once observed:  “Most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it.” An adage that could apply to some of those who wish to become the most powerful person on Earth, as much as whoever vies to sit on the Iron Throne."
"There’s nothing better than a breath of fresh air. Scientists have proven that getting out and smelling the roses can make you feel more relaxed. Spending time in green spaces is associated with lower stress levels and blood pressure too. In fact, research has shown that contact with natural environments can improve our social development and encourage us to make better choices on a daily basis. The way we plan and design villages, towns and cities has a direct impact on our physical and mental health and well-being, yet so many public places in neighbourhoods are being underused and poorly managed. Take Nottingham, for example, where ball games have been banned in a number of areas, and fences were erected to stop neighbours from accessing green spaces.  Parks and squares are regarded as some of the greatest legacies of the Victorian era, used to promote health and well-being in an era of slums and poor sanitation. In Nottingham alone 130 acres of green areas were developed around the city to promote better health – an unprecedented figure for green infrastructure in those times. Inexplicably, however, despite previous experiences green spaces are now being closed off to the general public.    The increase in mental health illness in urban places is a matter of concern across the world, and no less so in Britain. One in four people in the UK suffer from mental health disorders, and almost 20% of the population have been recorded as showing signs of anxiety or depression. Mental health accounts for the largest NHS expenditure: its cost has increased from eight to 11 billion pounds per year in the last decade, and currently costs around £850 per person every year.  But this should not just be a matter for the health service to worry about: the design of the built environment could help solve these problems. Contact with natural elements is a key aspect of well-being. Designing with an emphasis on guiding people into and through the space, providing clear links with navigation cues leading to meaningful places, can alleviate some of the environmental stress in urban settlements.  To achieve improved lifestyles, we need to connect closely with our public and green places. However, for this to happen people must develop a sense of responsibility, which comes with a feeling of ownership and belonging. The most effective way to achieve this is through designing and managing public places to help develop a sense of social identity, and create collective place memories at a neighbourhood level. But opportunities are repeatedly being missed across towns and neighbourhoods to make the most of what the locality has to offer. Small-scale life projects that regenerate or invigorate interest in different areas are often welcomed by schools and universities as they give students the opportunity to learn while providing a valuable service to communities. But these engagement programmes are often isolated events driven by individuals through their personal networks: a more strategic vision is needed. This kind of design requires strong leadership from the authorities and commitment from developers to provide more than just houses – and it’s not as hard a task as it may seem. In Leicester, the new Lubbesthorpe site – built with 75 acres of new woodland and 250 acres of park land – and Hinkley West development, designed with 109 acres of open land, have recently been built to incorporate these principles. The government’s Big Society, launched in 2010, empowered communities to encourage more social action, supporting people to help themselves; to use local networks and resources to make communities more resilient. Yet the UK still has one of the highest indices of loneliness in Europe: people feel less close to their neighbours, and therefore have no one to turn to in a crisis.  The impact of loneliness on health compares to smoking 15 cigarettes a day and imposes higher risks than diabetes or obesity. The strengthening and survival of social support networks in communities is vital to the physical and psychological health of the population, so what better way to help this community spirit than offering open spaces where people can meet and enjoy themselves? Indeed, the devolution agenda could facilitate the creation of management strategies at a more local level, engaging communities in the planning and caring of their local assets. Broader application of neighbourhood plans could also become a vehicle to deliver a stronger sense of local commitment towards green spaces. Furthermore, small scale public places could become hubs for skills development, network bridging, leadership strengthening and building trust. These places could offer a platform to develop local support networks, engage different age groups and battle loneliness. We know we need to live in a more sustainable landscape capable of hosting more positive lifestyles, yet too often, overarching constraints commonly ingrained in multiple land ownership issues, public health and safety and long term management costs, obstruct any prospects of change.  Now is the time to make a greater effort to find alternative ways to deliver well-being above all other concerns: alienating people from their neighbouring public places does exactly the opposite."

"You’ve probably seen dramatic images of out of control wildfires that directly and immediately affect people. The news recently followed 200 firefighters tackling a blaze in California, while this May many watched the evacuation of more than 50,000 people from Fort McMurray in Canada.  But, every so often, in regions too remote for the TV cameras, satellite images reveal vast fires covering thousands of square kilometres in smoke. This is what’s happening in Siberia, right now. This all leaves an impression of large-scale destruction and ecological disaster. But are we really right to be worried? Although – wrongly – perceived as avoidable disasters, wildfires have been a natural and fundamental part of many of the world’s forests, grasslands and shrublands for millions of years. Fire is part of a natural rejuvenation cycle in these ecosystems. Attempts to eliminate it can have negative ecological impacts such as loss of biodiversity or increased vulnerability of forests to disease, and simply increase the risk of larger, more catastrophic fires. Although necessary for many ecosystems, wildfires do release vast amounts of carbon into the atmosphere, currently 1.6–2.8 gigatonnes a year, equivalent to a third of the total amount emitted from the burning of fossil fuels. The CO2 emissions from fires help accelerate global warming, which in turn leads to more fire, while soot emitted from fires is often deposited on ice leading to accelerated melting. But that’s only part of the story. While burning vegetation inevitably releases carbon, this carbon is normally taken up again when the forest regrows. And charcoal formed during burning means carbon is “locked up” in soils and sediments. So wildfires in regions adapted to fire can overall be considered “carbon neutral” or in some cases even lead to carbon sequestration in the longer-term. This means naturally recurring wildfires aren’t necessarily a threat to ecosystems or the global climate. What is of wider concern, however, is when they occur in ecosystems that are not well adapted to fire such as tropical forest or peatlands, or where fires are changing in their extent, or in how severely they burn the landscape. While the average annual area burned globally has changed surprisingly little during the last few decades, there are worrying trends in some regions such as larger blazes and longer fire seasons in the western US as a result of land management and a warming climate. Considering all this, what about the current fires in Siberia? Are they really anything out of the ordinary – and what should we make of the concern raised by Greenpeace, that the Russian government’s official figures of area burnt are huge underestimations? Satellite observations can help us answer these two questions. First, satellite data has long shown that Russian government statistics are substantial underestimations of actual ﬁre activity. Second, the annual area burned in boreal Asia (predominantly Siberia) is particularly variable, compared to the world’s other main vegetation zones. On average around 5m hectares have burned every year between 2001 and 2012, but this covered a range of more than than 15m in 2003 to less than 3m in 2005. The area burned so far this year in Siberia is well within that range, but then we’ve only just reached midsummer – the season is not yet over. Just like boreal Canada, temperatures in Siberia are increasing faster than in many other parts of the world and this trend is expected to continue. Rising temperatures lead to drier vegetation, to fuel the fires, and more lightning, which increases the risk of fire. A hotter climate also lengthens the season during which fires occur. These factors combined are expected to increase fire activity in this region. What is particularly worrying here is some of the fires in Siberia and other boreal regions affect peatlands which are gradually thawing thanks to global warming. This has a knock-on effect on the climate. When they burn deep into the ground peatland fires can release carbon that has accumulated over millennia and turn these peatlands from being net carbon sinks to long-term carbon emitters. So irrespective of discrepancies in reporting of fires in Siberia and the fact that fires are a natural feature of boreal forests, we can expect more fires and more associated greenhouse gas emissions in boreal regions in a warming world."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s online flagship daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) reports here German CO2 emissions rose 2% in 2013. This marks another setback for German efforts to curb emissions by 40% (relative to 1990 levels) by 2020.
Cold weather hampering fight against warming
Ironically, experts are blaming “cold weather” for thwarting the country’s efforts to combat “global warming” through CO2 emissions reductions. The FAZ writes:
Foremost the cold winter drove up natural gas consumption. Emissions of coal and oil also drove up emissions considerably.
Coal is currently inexpensive because in America it is being displaced by even cheaper natural gas that is pressed out of the ground using the ‘fracking method'”.
According to the FAZ, which cites experts, Germany’s CO2 emissions climbed 20 million tonnes last year.

This is the second year in a row that German CO2 emissions have risen, despite having invested a whopping $250 billion in green energies. Some critics call the green energy feed-in act a “giant capital-destruction machine”.
26 million unemployed in EU28!
Europe, on the other hand, saw its overall CO2 emissions fall by 2.5% in 2013.
But that reduction has a lot to do with Europe’s economic malaise…especially in places like Spain, France, Italy, Portugal and Greece. When jobs are killed off and a major portion of the population becomes idle, reduced energy consumption is the natural result.
Currently Europe’s unemployment rate stands at a whopping 12%. More than 26 million men and women are unemployed in the EU28, according to Eurostat.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOn March 17, Germany’s Helmholtz Association held a podium discussion in Berlin. The title: “What can we believe? The climate debate and its impacts”.

Climate science and policy panel discussion in Berlin, March 17, 2014. Photo: Helmholtz Association
I wrote about this almost 6 weeks ago, read here. What’s a bit special about this podium discussion is that one skeptic, Dr. Peter Heller of Science Skeptical, was allowed to take part on the panel of 5 experts.
The five experts discussed climate science and the uncertainty surrounding it. The Helmholtz Association has since released a report on the event.
There is no concensus
On the claim there is a consensus, the Helmholtz Association panel discussion clearly dumps cold water on that in its article right off the bat, writing in the introduction:
Experts dispute the extent, consequences and causes of climate change.”
Hans von Storch, a critic of science actively telling policymakers what to do, however then said:
Global warming is a fact and cannot be scientifically explained without the observed increase in greenhouse gases.”
But this is statement that everyone agrees on, including skeptics. Unfortunately von Storch does not say how much of the warming is due to greenhouse gases, which is not a surprise because no one knows the answer to that question. Is it 5%? 20% 50% or 95%?

Andreas Hense, Professor for Climate Dynamics and the University of Bonn, reminds that there is uncertainty involved in the science and adds:
But what we do know with a relatively high accuracy, with high probability, is that certain climate variables such as the upper air temperature over the last 100 or 120 years have changed due to man-made influences, but not only because man-made influences but also volcanic influences or solar influences.”
So natural factors are being acknowledged after all. The Helmholtz article writes that the panel member opinions on the magnitudes the different factors have on climate “diverged”, thus confirming that there is no consensus.
Von Storch fears a role for science in policymaking
The Helmholtz article also writes that many scientists feel they are being crowded into a role in which they do not feel comfortable:
Hense said that he now avoids all discussions with the media. Von Storch said he even fears science taking a role in the political decision processes which they are not entitled to take.”
Schellnhuber’s approach roundly rejected
Werner Krauss at Klimazwiebel also reports on the podium discussion, and writes that the 2°C target of was rejected unanimously by the panelists (4 of 5 of whom were warmists) and that “a Herr Schellnhuber was sorely missed and thoroughly dissed – everyone agreed on the rejection of the scientifically dubious limits such as the 2°C target or measures that are not democratically legitimized.”
So all of us here in Germany can breath a sigh of relief in that even warmists think the Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber’s master plan for a great transformation of society and its calls for a watering down of democracy is going too far.
Hopefully the Helmholtz Association will post the video of this worthwhile event in the days ahead.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI sent an e-mail to Fritz Vahrenholt to ask his opinion on the Lennart Bengtsson mobbing scandal. Professor Vahrenholt is one of the fathers of the German environmental movement and co-author of the best-selling skeptic climate science book “Die kalte Sonne“.

Climate science critic Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt says doubt on climate science is gaining. Photo credit: Die kalte Sonne. 
My questions to Professor Vahrenholt:
Also having expressed skepticism on climate science and having come under fire for doing so, do you think there is an atmosphere of intimidation that acts to keep people from expressing their doubts on climate science? Do you feel this is also the case in Germany? Do you think the strategy of marginalizing and silencing critics has been a successful one for the warmist side? Or do you think it is failing and is only hurting them?
Professor Vahrenholt’s responded:
It would be a wonder in a country where climate alarmism sets the tone of the energy-political debate like in no other country things would be otherwise.
I still can remember very well when the Academy of Technical Sciences prepared a report on the possibilities to adapt to climate change three years ago. At the time I was one of the three directors of the Working Group. I attempted to add to the report the uncertainties of the climate models, the natural influences on climate development, the decoupling between CO2 rise and temperature development over the last 15 years.

Three scientists threatened to quit unless I ceded the leadership of the WG. But I resisted the pressure to do so. The three scientists (which included the vice president of the German Weather Service) resigned.
Or just think back to the unspeakable report by the Federal Environment Minister in which scientists and journalists who held skeptical views were branded.
My impression, however, is that the marginalization of mainstream alternative positions is no longer succeeding so easily.
The real development is putting the apologists of climate alarmism in their place. And the off-the-rails energy policy, which believes will have an impact on the global climate, is doing the rest.
Doubt over the dogmatic position of the CO2-alone is causing climate change is increasingly getting broader and more public.”

"It’s a tricky thing to grow enough food for a ballooning population without destroying the natural world. And when I say a tricky thing, I mean it’s one of the greatest challenges humanity has ever faced. Luckily for us, it is theoretically possible, and the easiest way to get there is by drastically cutting down on meat. We deforest an area the size of Panama every single year. Across the world, food is the number one cause of deforestation, especially our taste for meat. But it doesn’t have to be this way. Researchers recently modelled how the world could feed itself in 2050 without converting any current forests into agriculture. They tested the outcome under 500 different scenarios that varied according to realistic assumptions on future yields, the area needed for farming, livestock feed and human diets. They found that “deforestation is not a biophysical necessity”. “While a wide range of feasible options to feed a no-deforestation world were found, many only worked under certain circumstances,” said Karl-Heinz Erb, lead author of the study, published in Nature Communications. For example, meat-heavy diets were not compatible with lower yields similar to those under organic farming, or under the potential negative effects of climate change. Of all the variables involved, the feasibility of feeding the world with no deforestation is more dependent on what we are eating, than on how well we farm. “The only diet found to work with all future possible scenarios of yield and cropland area, including 100% organic agriculture, was a plant-based one,” Erb said. Even better: if we all woke up vegan in 2050, we would require less cropland than we did in the year 2000. This could allow us to “reforest” an area around the size of the entire Amazon rainforest – somehow fitting considering 70-80% of deforestation in the Amazon is due to the livestock industry. In second place, the vegetarian diet was compatible with 94% of future no-deforestation scenarios. Going veggie would also save on cropland, allowing for an area around the size of India to return to nature. This land-saving makes sense when considering the conversion rate between the grain that we could have directly consumed but instead feed to livestock. For example, in the US, it takes an astounding 25kg of grain to produce 1kg of beef, pigs require a grain to meat ratio of 9:1 and chickens, relatively less wasteful, are 3:1. As renowned ecologist Hugh Possingham put it: “Just stop feeding grain to animals – don’t eat something that ate something that you could have eaten.” Plant-based diets are particularly impressive when compared to those that are rich in meat, which would require a 50% increase in global cropland area by 2050. In order to achieve this with a chance of no-deforestation, we’d have to convert lots of pasture to cropland and substantially increase yields, likely through using chemicals. But both conversion and intensification generally degrade ecosystems and lead to less biodiversity. Overall the new study found that a meat-eater requires at least double the resources of a vegan or vegetarian. The study also links to the basic availability of food, one of the main pillars of food security. As people, especially in the Western world, eat less meat, the global demand for grain is reduced – for example, the US could feed 800m people with the grain currently fed to livestock. Less meat consumption would mean more food is available in poorer countries which could enjoy becoming more self-sufficient. With other recent research showing that reducing our meat intake could result in two thirds less food-related CO2 emissions, and save millions of lives there are few excuses left to justify having meat at every meal. Most of all, this study brings some much needed good news. In a world where environmental issues are often overwhelmingly depressing, where it seems monopolies that are out of our grasp run the show, here we have a pathway to a healthier, greener and more equitable world. And it’s quite literally handed to us on a plate. As the researchers of the study noted: “We are cutting back on meat, mainly as a result of this study.” And that’s the beauty of this approach, it doesn’t have to be all or nothing, vegan or carnivore. Eating sparse amounts of meat, the path of the “carnesparsian”, can have a huge impact – on your own health and that of the planet. Do the forest a favour. On Earth Day 2016, why not pledge to eat for the planet and challenge yourself and your friends to have a meat-free May. This article was updated on April 26, 2016, to include more recent data on livestock deforestation in the Amazon."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThat’s the title Die Achse Des Guten here bears at its website.
Few countries have spent as much as Germany on measures to reduce CO2 emissions. Today German website Die Achse Des Guten here links to a blurb appearing in German “intellectual” weekly Die Zeit here which unwittingly tells readers what Germany has gained for its 100-billion-euro investment in green energies so far: nothing!
DIE ZEIT writes:
Actually, the German government wanted to decrease the emissions of CO2 – also through the transition to renewable energy. However our chart shows the opposite is the case.
Greenhouse gas emissions have been increasing for three years in Germany, 1.2 percent for last year.”
The DIE ZEIT chart shows Germany emitted 913 million tonnes in 2009 (due in large part to the global financial crisis) with emissions rising steadily to 951 million tonnes in 2013. The lion’s share of Germany’s post 1990 reduction stems from the shutdown of dilapidated communist East Germany and it’s dinosauric industry.
For the taxpayers who may be angered by the lack of return on investment, 2014 may post a slight emissions drop…but not because of anything the government and the 100 billion euros have done, but because of the warm winter Germany saw this year.

"A pro-EU leaflet recently issued by the UK government caused controversy over the use of public funds for a political campaign. But even more scandalous was the fact that the leaflet made only one passing mention of climate change and none of wider environmental policy. The prime minister’s reform mandate was also notably quiet on the subject.  We should therefore welcome the latest report by the cross-party group of MPs who sit on parliament’s environmental audit committee (EAC). Their report on EU and UK environmental policy will do much to inform the debate on the June 23 EU membership referendum.  The environmental benefits of EU membership should be front and centre of any remain campaign: there’s widespread acceptance among experts that the union makes a huge difference. The UK was known as the dirty man of Europe in the 1970s and 80s and the EU is widely credited with helping clean up the national environment.  The EAC report is the third to be published since March reviewing the implications of the referendum for the UK’s environment, with all broadly similar in their conclusions. The Institute for European Environmental Policy think tank argued that the EU has been good for the UK’s environment and expressed concern over the prospects for habitats and birds in the event of a Brexit. A group of independent academic experts, including myself, also launched a report in April which, while not advocating a position, highlighted the risks of leaving the EU and suggested that on balance membership has been beneficial for the UK. The latest EAC report is similarly positive. So there exists a near-consensus on the value of EU membership across relevant environmental experts in academia, NGOs and parliament. But this does not necessarily reflect wider opinion among the political classes: there is no better indication of this than the fact that one member of the EAC, leading eurosceptic Peter Lilley, insisted that a dissenting report expressing his views be appended to the main document.  The calls from the Conservative backbenches for a bonfire of red tape have also often had EU environmental regulations in their sights, and a recent blog in the Economist even suggested that climate scepticism often goes hand-in-hand with euro-scepticism. It seems unlikely then that environmental arguments are going to change the mind of hardened eurosceptics. However these reports may provide food for thought for those who are more uncertain about their voting intentions. One clear finding emerging across the reports is that environmental policy benefits from transnational governance arrangements: pollution does not respect national borders and therefore mitigation of environmental problems requires cooperation across and between states. The EU provides a vehicle for such cooperation.  Dealing with environmental issues also requires clear targets and deadlines. The EU requires its members to set clear policies with strong enforcement mechanisms, which UK citizens can rely upon. For example, the UK government is currently facing legal action over failing to meet European air quality standards. EU policy also provides a degree of long term stability, and a more certain investment climate for the infrastructural development required to boost renewable energy or to secure better water quality through projects such as the Thames Tideway tunnel.   Finally the EAC report notes the degree of scepticism among those giving evidence that a UK government acting independently would maintain the same level of protection for the environment as that provided currently by the EU. Lilley picks up on the same point but is clearly more sanguine than his colleagues on the committee about the prospects of a UK outside the EU maintaining similar standards of protection.  Here then is the nub – and maybe the point upon which those who care about the environment may wish to base their decision on June 23. Who do you trust to keep the UK’s environment safe?"

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere Joe is talking about record highs!
Weatherbell Analytics meteorologist Joe Bastardi, a person studying and observing the weather for some 40 years, says in his latest Saturday Summary that global sea ice this year has a pretty good chance of setting a new record high since satellite measurements began.

Image cropped from Weatherbell Analytics May 10, 2014 Saturday Summary. 
At the 8:14 mark Joe starts talking about global sea ice. He shows how the current high Antarctic levels, should they continue, combined with the projected Arctic positive anomaly could result in a new record high.
What’s going to happen if the Antarctic maintains this very very robust anomaly here, and the Arctic actually goes above normal? What’s going to happen? Well, there’s the possibility we’re going to break the all-time global sea ice records.”
I beg your pardon! How can that be? Supposedly we have record global warming taking place. How can sea ice be rebounding with abandon if it’s getting warmer and warmer. It’s not adding up, folks.

Gore about to be humiliated
Joe then reminds his viewers of Al Gore’s 2007 prediction, and chides the former VP:
This is the summer that former vice president Al Gore back in 2007 said that this was the summer that the Arctic ice cap could disappear.”
Also in the summary Joe dumps a good amount of cold water on the probability the earth is going to see a very powerful 1997-like El Nino event, showing that the current circumstances in the Pacific are very different from those of 1997. So the chances of seeing a new annual, global record high temperature, something the warmists have been waiting 16 years to see, are diminishing.
2014 could see record high global temperature – with near record high sea ice?
On a new global temperature record this year, we have to keep in mind that there are a half dozen or so datasets tallying global temperature, and so we have to expect that at least one of them will be corrupt enough to concoct a new all-time record no matter what happens – mark my words. Ironically, this could be the year where we see both a “record warm” planet with near or even record global sea ice. Go figure that one out!
That’s climate science!

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman reggae and hip hop musician Pierre Fox presents a revealing interview (in German) with Prof. Dr. Hans Schellnhuber (28 June 2014).
When it comes to the progress of the green movement and the Great Transformation, the Potsdam Professor appears deflated and demoralized.

No matter what one may think of the German Godfather of climate alarmism, Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber is always fascinating to watch, never failing to deliver comments worth quoting. He’s the professor that once claimed that glo´bal temperature changed linearly with atmospheric CO2 change, and said that the planet would explode with 9 billion people. He also said that a population of 1 billion be an acceptable level.
Like a doomsday “asteroid collision in slow motion”
Already at the 0:14 mark after having said what a unbelievable privilege it is to work at the Potsdam Institute he states:
One day our eyes opened: “Oh! I’m now researching on aspects of the greatest problem facing mankind in the 21st century. And this conviction hardened. Yes, this is the greatest problem of the 21st century.”
At the 1:12 mark Schellnhuber spectacularly piles on the dramatization when it comes to characterizing the seriousness of global warming, comparing it to an approaching asteroid collisions with the earth.
I compare it to an asteroid colliding with the earth in slow motion, yes. If scientists said an asteroid is on a path toward the earth and that we have 20 years to build a defense system, we probably would all start to do everything we could and build away, and wouldn’t care if it cost 50 billion or a thousand billion. But when I say an asteroid is approaching, and that it is called global warming, but the strike will be over 100 years, everyone asks, ‘So what?’. […] Mankind has a hard time planning 20 or 30 years ahead.”
Here we need to conduct a survey of scientists: “Do you believe global warming is as serious as an earth-shattering asteroid strike?” I seriously doubt many scientists would share Professor Schellnhuber’s earth’s doomsday paranoia.
Democracy as an obstacle
On whether politicians are doing enough, Schellnhuber thinks they are moving slowly, but says that new systems of doing things often take time to unfold. But once they are 20 or 30% in place a tipping point is reached, and there is nothing to stop the shift to the new system. As an example at the 3:42 mark he gleefully cites the fact that share prices of Germany’s major power producers have collapsed.

Ten years ago that was unimaginable. …Suddenly this quaint little feed-in act had an effect. It was just a toy from green politicians.”
Schellnhuber places his optimism in system change and not in political progress. He views gradual political movement and compromise as obstacles to progress. No surprise here, Schellnhuber was never a fan of democracy by independently thinking citizens.
At the 4:44 mark when asked what individuals can do, the Potsdam professor says, “We need societal forces that aim to achieve justice…climate change is an extremely unjust matter, yes…forces that are based on values, the protection of creation – if I want to be religious, and so on. Otherwise we just aren’t going to be able to build the political pressure.”
Conferences: most “frustrating and tiring events ” in the world
Prof. Schellnhuber is clearly frustrated that climate policy has bogged down, and says the UN climate conferences are probably the most “frustrating and tiring events in the world”.
Later in the interview viewers can witness the sort of nonsense that is produced when a climate professor and a reggae singer discuss economics in an exchange. Schellnhuber believes that divestment could be an effective strategy, if only it were possible to convince investors that oil, gas, and coal are dangerous to the planet. Schellnhuber doesn’t seem to be aware that investment in wind parks and solar systems have already failed.
Slowly one begins to perceive that Prof Schellnhuber is on another planet (one that is about to be hit by an asteroid and where renewable energy works). His solution to get things moving: Get the population to think like he does, and only then will they invest in green energies. He then blames the “inner laziness” of the population to do the right thing, and says that “perhaps we need regulations, laws…compulsion.”
Resigned and frustrated, Schellnhuber spurned by Merkel
At latter stages of the interview, at the 10:20 mark, having worked himself up, Schellnhuber displays a combination of frustration and resignation…as if the human population were hopeless. At the 10:34 mark Schellnhuber contemplates that if only Obama could be re-elected again, and if “Merkel did not run for fourth term“. Here Schellnhuber de facto confirms what some of us have already began to suspect: Merkel has stopped listening to him and the Potsdam scientists.
The only hope left for the climate movement, Schellnhuber summarizes, is great leadership coming from somewhere. “A few climate Ghandis wouldn’t be bad.”
The warmists are becoming demoralized.

"The world’s sea level is expected to rise by up to 82cm by the end of the century. Some areas of the world, such as the north-east coast of North America and the Western Pacific, will be more affected than others. But in many places this will mean floods are more likely, the cost of coastal protection will rise, and coastal ecosystems will be put in danger. Yet it isn’t just the average sea level that will rise. The biggest risks will come from the fact that the highest sea levels (caused by high tides and weather) will also increase by at least as much as the mean. This is what are seeing so far in many parts of the world. A potential increase in the frequency and severity of storms could make higher sea-level extremes and their impact even worse. More violent storms could also produce more energetic and higher waves, testing the resilience of ships and offshore structures like oil rigs and disrupting trade. But how serious will these problems be? Computer models of climate change caused by greenhouse warming indicate that the most devastating tropical cyclones will be between 2% and 11% more intense by 2100. The same models also indicate there will be fewer tropical cyclones overall but more high-intensity cyclones. This leaves us with a rather unclear picture that is further complicated because scientists disagree on whether and how tropical cyclones have been changing over the past 30 or 40 years.  The role of regional climate patterns like the El Niño cycle of wind and sea temperature changes in the Pacific and the monsoons in the Indian Ocean also add to this complexity. Although we expect climate change to influence these phenomena, they also vary significantly from year to year naturally, making it very challenging to say if any particular extreme event is driven by climate change. Research we conduct with several collaborators involves examining changes in extreme waves and sea-level records to identify factors that contribute to changes in extremes. This information can then be used to improve computer models of sea level in the hope of making this picture clearer. As mentioned, sea level extremes have generally been found to change in line with the observed mean sea level trends. But changes in extremes are also caused by changes in the tides, in the seasonal cycle, in currents in the ocean, and the number of the typhoons impacting on land. We found that each of these factors affected the areas studied (the Mediterranean Sea, the Caribbean Sea, and the North Sea) by a different degree. We also found that these factors were not all related to climate change or natural variability. For example, significant changes in the extremes at the Chinese coasts are linked to changes in regional tides thought to be related to the extensive land reclamation going on to create more space for building. This kind of human influence is distinct from climate change but just as important to the local environment. Other partners worked on improving the parameters of models of tropical cyclones. This confirmed that previous models underestimated sea level extremes. But what this also means is that climate models that are much less detailed aren’t good enough to produce firm conclusions on whether climate change will increase extreme ocean activity. For example, we know that wave heights in the North Atlantic have increased, partly due to changes in regional atmospheric patterns. But for the Norwegian Sea, the increase has been much smaller since 2000 than previously recorded. If we want to understand how marine extremes will change in the future, we need to look at each location individually and take into account the specific factors that will affect its extreme ocean activity. We also need more detailed global and regional climate models and a clearer understanding of cyclonic systems to be able to predict changes in the severity and the pathways of cyclones and how they affect extreme activity. Other environmental factors that could become more extreme, such as temperature, salt levels, oxygen content, acidity and current speeds will also be important in determining the impacts of climate change on the marine environment. But the data we have now doesn’t allow us to do such comprehensive analyses. Until we have a clearer picture, we won’t know just how extreme our oceans will become as the climate changes."
"Tribal leaders, fishermen and environmentalists from Alaska will testify before Congress on Wednesday in an effort to save America’s biggest national forest – the latest battle against the Trump administration’s assault on environmental protections. The Tongass national forest, one of the world’s last intact temperate rainforests which plays a crucial role in fighting the climate crisis, is under threat of logging as Alaska seeks exemption from the Roadless Rule, which protects millions of acres of pristine forests across the US. The Tongass is considered the “crown jewel” of the national forest system, sequestering huge amounts of carbon dioxide to keep the greenhouse gas out of the atmosphere. The Roadless Rule prevents mass clearcutting of trees in undeveloped forested areas and is seen as one of the most broadly supported environmental protections in the US. Donald Trump has reportedly intervened in the Alaska case, raising fears that other states with strong extractive industry lobbying machines will seek to fast-track similar exemptions without properly consulting communities on the impact that felling trees in wilderness areas will have. “There are indications that many other states are watching to see what happens with Alaska, which has shown us how this administration is blindly following whatever industry, corporations and lobbyists want without thinking about future generations,” said Blaine Miller-McFeeley, senior legislative representative at the legal not-for-profit Earthjustice. Wednesday’s hearing by the natural resources subcommittee on national parks, forests and public land (NPFPL) will hear evidence on the potentially devastating consequences for the Tongass and its people. “We’ve been here for thousands of years. These are our lands and we depend on the Tongass for food security,” Joel Jackson, 63, president of the organized village of Kake, said. “Tribes everywhere are worried and watching very closely at what they’re trying to do in Alaska,” added Jackson, who will testify. “Tourism and commercial fishing run this region economically, not timber, which is a pathetically small sector,” said Lance Preston, 47, a fisherman and board member of the Seafood Producers Cooperative in Sitka. “The salmon already faces challenges from ocean acidification and warming … A very small minority stands to gain economically by being very irresponsible.” Stretching 16m acres over 500 miles, the Tongass is unique in its size and biodiversity, with thousands of islands, waterways, glacial fjords and green valleys flanked by rugged mountains and sprawling forests of old-growth cedar, spruce and hemlock trees. It is home to myriad species including wild Pacific salmon, brown bears, wolves, Sitka black-tailed deer and bald eagles, and attracts more than a million visitors annually. The Roadless Rule was adopted during the Clinton administration after an extensive public consultation, in which 96% of the 1 million participants nationwide supported protection for unspoiled forests. Since then Alaska has fought the regulation, but its efforts to roll back the protection have been repeatedly thwarted in Congress and the courts. Then, the state’s petition for an exemption was granted by the Department of Agriculture in August 2018 without consulting any tribal nations. The state was given $2m in federal funds by the Forest Service (FS) to help facilitate dialogue about six potential outcomes ranging from no change to full exemption. At least 10% of this money was given to the Alaska Forest Association – a timber industry group – to aid their participation in the process, according to documents obtained by KTOO.  The Angoon Cooperative Association, Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes, Hoonah Indian Association, Hydaburg Cooperative Association, organized village of Kake and organized village of Kasaan – which all have roots in the Tongass dating back thousands of years – were belatedly offered a seat at the table as “cooperating agencies” alongside the state in the review process. The tribes say they were not given any financial support leaving them scrambling to make sense of complex long document. Their requests for extensions were repeatedly denied. In June, Trump held a private meeting with Alaska’s governor, Mike Dunleavy, on Air Force One. Shortly after, Trump instructed the agriculture secretary, Sonny Perdue, to grant a full exemption, according to the Washington Post.  Last month, a full exemption, opening the door for the logging industry to bulldoze roads and clearcut trees over 9m acres, was recommended in the draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). In response, tribal leaders wrote to Perdue condemning the federal government’s rushed and unfair handling of the proposed exemption, which they said “represents the most controversial and potentially destructive assault on our way of life to date”.  In the Tongass, the tribes mostly live on isolated islands, relying on salmon fishing, deer, moose, grouse and berries. This traditional diet remains extremely important amid rising food prices and cuts to ferry services. “All communities deserve to have access to the resources they rely on for subsistence, but this administration has gone out of its way to change the rules for their friends who seek to profit off those resources,” said the New Mexico congresswoman Deb Haaland, chair of the NPFPL. In May, fellow committee member and Arizona congressman Ruben Gallego, and the Washington senator Maria Cantwell, senior member of the Senate energy and natural resources committee, introduced legislation to codify the Roadless Rule in order to permanently protect millions of acres of pristine national forests. The 2019 Roadless Area Conservation Act would prevent state exemptions to the rule, which nationwide protects habitats for 1,600 threatened or endangered species, reduces wildfire risk and supplies clean drinking water to 60 million Americans and 350 communities across the US. “The administration continues to try to solve 21st-century problems with 19th-century thinking, trying to extract a relatively small amount from our few remaining pristine natural areas,” said Cantwell. Nationally, public support for the Roadless Rule remains strong: a Pew poll in March of this year found three-quarters of respondents want protections to remain in place. Locally, the vast majority of south-east Alaska’s 32 native and white communities also support the current roadless protection.  But the Alaska congressman Don Young, the Republican leader of the NPFPL, believes the Roadless Rule has been a “disaster” for his home state. He has been working closely with Trump, senior White House staff and the rest of the Alaska delegation to secure an exemption. “Congressman Young believes an exemption is needed to not only boost the economy of south-east Alaska, but to bolster the long-term health of the Tongass national forest by promoting active resource management,” a spokesperson said. The rule already allows for individual exemptions: in Alaska, every single request for the Tongass to date – more than 50 – for projects such as mines and dams has been approved. Dunleavy’s office did not respond to requests for comment, but has previously blamed the rule for destroying logging and thousands of jobs. The timber industry contributes less than 1% to the south-east Alaska economy, compared with 25% by the fishing and tourism industries combined. Tongass waterways produce 80% of the commercial salmon annually harvested from south-east Alaska, valued at $60m. The FS has lost almost $600m on Tongass timber sales over the last 20 years, according to Taxpayers for Common Sense.  The FS is legally obliged to take into account public opinion before making its final decision, which is expected in mid-2020. If it is fully repealed as Alaskan Republicans want, 5m acres of the Chugach national forest, which is second only to the Tongass in roadless acreage, could also be threatened, according to the Southeast Alaska Conservation Council. In both forests, vital food sources and Native cultural and sacred sites are at risk. “If we didn’t have wild food to eat, we would be starving right now. We are living in virtual poverty because of the systems of government,” said Wanda Culp, a Tlingit advocate for the Tongass in Hoonah. “The Roadless Rule is just the latest example of how we jump through hoops but get nowhere – there is no due process for indigenous communities. We are nuisance communities standing in the way of industry profits.”"
"On my official UN visit to Norway in September, I found inspiring examples of leadership on climate change. I encountered a nearly emissions-free electricity system, the highest share of zero-emission vehicle sales in the world (almost half of all new cars sold are fully electric), and billions of dollars being invested in a Green Climate Fund that provides support to developing countries, as well as a burgeoning Climate and Forest Initiative. However, Norway continues to explore for oil and gas at a time when the International Energy Agency and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that meeting the vital 1.5C target in the Paris agreement requires that the majority of existing fossil fuel reserves cannot be burned.  The Norwegian paradox is that its leadership on some aspects of climate action is undermined by its continued dependence on a large fossil fuel industry. Norway, as one of the world’s wealthiest nations and a leading producer of oil and gas, has a responsibility to lead efforts in mitigation, adaptation and, to some degree at least, compensation for the loss and damage caused by those products. It is this Norwegian paradox that is currently under scrutiny in the court of appeal in Oslo. In a high-profile lawsuit filed in 2016, Greenpeace Nordic and Norway’s Nature and Youth organisation argued that the government is violating the rights of present and future generations to a safe and healthy environment by continuing to issue licences to petroleum companies, enabling them to explore for new oil reserves. In the first week of the appeal hearing, we heard that the Norwegian government challenges elements of established climate science and maintains its argument that Norway is justified in continuing to search for new oil in the vulnerable Arctic region. In 2018, the district court confirmed that the right to a healthy environment is an enforceable human right protected by article 112 of Norway’s constitution. The government has a legal obligation to respect, protect and fulfil this fundamental human right. However, the judge accepted the government’s claim that Norway has no responsibility for carbon emissions resulting from burning Norwegian oil and gas outside of Norway. Hence the appeal by the environmental organisations. From a climate change perspective, it is irrelevant where on Earth fossil fuels are burned. The emissions exacerbate the global climate emergency. There is no such thing as clean coal or clean oil, only varying degrees of dirty. Earlier this year an Australian court recognised this reality in overturning the approval of a new coal mine. The court acknowledged that the government needed to consider not only the climate impacts of digging up the coal, but also the emissions produced eventually by burning it, regardless of where in the world combustion occurred. The judge concluded that the proposed mine was in “the wrong place at the wrong time”. There is no doubt that major oil producers like Norway are fuelling the global climate emergency and contributing to a wide range of human rights violations across the planet. These human rights impacts fall primarily upon small island developing states and lesser developed countries. It is a staggering injustice that the world’s poorest people, who have made virtually no contribution to causing climate change, are paying the highest costs. Were it not for the enormous carbon emissions, I would suggest that every Norwegian travel to a nation like Fiji or Dominica to see the damage that has been caused. I visited Vunidogoloa, one of the first communities in the world to be relocated because of rising sea levels, storm surges and salinisation of their water and farmland, as well as impoverished informal settlements on the outskirts of Fijian cities, populated by people whose homes were destroyed by Cyclone Winston in 2016. These communities lack adequate sanitation facilities, and regular flooding is causing outbreaks of water-borne diseases such as cholera. Winston was the strongest storm ever to reach land in the southern hemisphere, inflicting damage equal to about 31% of Fiji’s GDP. And in Dominica, two hurricanes in the past five years have damaged more than 90% of buildings at a cost of more than three times its GDP. The Fiji and Dominica examples are the tip of the iceberg of human rights violations caused by the climate crisis. In the future, as global temperatures rise, these violations will only worsen. The Norwegian government must not then ignore its global responsibility for the emissions from the oil and gas it exports. Climate change impacts are even more severe today than in 2016 when Norway became the first industrialised country to ratify the Paris agreement. Time is running out. The world needs Norway to demonstrate climate leadership by ending exploration for additional oil and gas reserves, stopping further expansion of fossil fuel infrastructure, and protecting the fragile Arctic. By harnessing its immense wealth and ingenuity, Norway could lead the world in demonstrating how to achieve a just and equitable transition to a fossil-free economy. • David Boyd is the UN special rapporteur on the environment and human rights"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe intense but short heat wave that struck parts of Central Europe earlier this month created quite a bit of hysteria among some German activist climatologists and most of the media.
For example IPCC climatologist Mojib Latif attributed the heat and severe thunderstorms to global warming. Stefan Rahmstorf tried to hint this may be the case, but had to concede there was no real data to back it up.
DWD dismisses connection to climate warming
Now the DWD German Weather Service has made it’s opinion public on the matter. At his climate blog at online flagship daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, journalist Joachim Müller-Jung writes, “It does not suffice to attribute the heat records to climate change” and he quotes the official DWD spokesman Gerhard Lux:
It may suit our imaginative world of the consequences of climate warming, but we are sticking to the principle that you cannot craft a climate statistic from one singular extreme weather situation.”
We’ll remember that when the next storm or hurricane hits. Good to see that Germany’s national weather service, the DWD, is keeping its sanity and dismisses the link between singular extreme weather events and climate change. 
Heat records show no climate trend

Müller-Jung then adds:
The hot ‘African air’ produced record temperatures exclusively in southern Germany, already in Hessen or North Rhine Westphalia [Central Germany] there was not a single heat record. From heat records, which happen every few years and thus are too seldom as a whole, it still is not possible to discern a climate trend.”
In northwest Germany where I live, the temperature did not even reach the 30°C mark. So the intense heat was not only short, but it was rather local/regional as well.
Lux does note, however, that the frequency of heavy rainfall events (more than 30 mm) has risen. (That may have more to do with decadal cycles).
When asked why journalists have the feeling storms are more frequent, Lux says it is because people are far better networked today and every storm gets instantly communicated everywhere.
In earlier times no one gave a rat’s ass about a storm way out in East Hicksville, except the Hicksvillers. By the time the dramatic Hicksville pictures reached the audience in other places, it was already old news. That’s not the case today.
