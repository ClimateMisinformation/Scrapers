"The UK is in the perverse situation of having no coherent foreign policy on the eve of completing an international negotiation that has consumed all of the government’s energy. The situation is less paradoxical than it sounds, because Brexit is a project based on an assertion of what the country does not want to be – a member of the EU – without a clear articulation of what it should be instead. That omission will be felt keenly, but not discussed, at Sunday’s extraordinary summit, where Theresa May and the 27 other European heads of government are expected to agree the broad outlines of a future partnership. But this “deal” will not answer the existential question that Brexit raises: if Britain’s influence in the world is no longer to be deployed as part of a European project, how will it be felt? The leave campaign did not recognise that as a legitimate question because Eurosceptics always saw “Brussels” as a hostile force and a drain on the sovereign power of a nation state. Brexit, in that view, offered enhanced status as “Global Britain”. That fantasy, like so many of the leaver pledges, has been dismantled by events. The dynamics of a 27-to-one negotiation have demonstrated how a continental bloc asserts power greater than the sum of its parts and greater than any one European country can wield alone. Power in the world is not simply a matter of autonomy to sign trade deals. EU membership has been an axiom of British foreign and security policy well beyond the arena of economic cooperation. To jettison that arrangement would have been risky at any point in recent decades. With Donald Trump in the White House, the timing is exquisitely poor. Mr Trump has started a trade war with China that looks like the prologue to a long confrontation between superpowers. Traditionally, a US president would look to Europe for strategic alliance under such circumstances, but Mr Trump has also picked trade fights with Brussels and heaped scorn on the EU.  Britain does not have to pick a side in this volatile environment but it will have to express priorities. The national interest will often demand alignment with our continental neighbours. That is a fact of culture, history, geography and realpolitik. Historians will look back and wonder how it was that Britain could make such consequential decisions about its role in the world without them featuring in domestic debate. The parochialism of cabinet rows has crowded out strategic challenges. Urgent, global issues are scarcely discussed: climate change; the potential uses and abuses of artificial intelligence and genomics; large-scale population migrations. These are forces that will reshape human society, and it is hard to see how a medium-sized, albeit rich, nation can grapple with them alone. The most influential actors will be those that can operate on continental scale – China, the US, India, the EU. Such gigantism requires political deftness and skill to navigate. There will be questions about how much freedom ought to be devolved within such superpowers. Once a key player in such debates, we will be a bystander. Britain is recusing itself from that level of influence, downgrading its clout in the world. That might be what many voters want, or at least a price they are willing to pay for Brexit. It is difficult to know, when the question has never been put in those terms. This weekend’s meeting in Brussels is all about Britain and what Mrs May has negotiated. There needs to be more focus on the question of what future British prime ministers will be able to achieve after Mrs May has surrendered the UK’s seat at the summit table."
"Seven years ago, Greg Combet, then a Labor minister, implemented a carbon price in a minority parliament, an experience so arduous it helped curtail his political career. Now, safely outside political life, he looks on with bemusement about where the climate and energy debate has washed up. On Tuesday, Combet launched a new report by the Industrial Relations Research Centre at the University of New South Wales investigating how countries such as Australia can achieve a fair transition for coal workers displaced as the economy decarbonises.  It got a bit lost in the wash of the week – let’s face it, it’s hard for substance to compete with the rolling spectacle of political dysfunction – but it’s an interesting bit of analysis funded by the CFMEU’s mining and energy division. In 2011 Combet had to fight almost everyone in the country to get the clean energy package legislated. Business was hostile. The energy sector was hostile. Barnaby Joyce was screeching apocalyptically about $100 lamb roasts. But while Combet’s experience was everyone shouting at him for doing something, we’ve now come full circle. Now, all the shouting is about the current government doing nothing. Business and energy retailers are on the frontline of increasingly frantic calls for policy certainty. The Gillard government would have killed for the conditions the Coalition has blown away over the last three years with reckless abandon. In any case, Combet ventured out this week about the future of coal. He insists the outlook is clear. If the world, and specifically Australia, is to do what is necessary to contain warming at 2C, then almost all coal-fired power will be gone by 2040. “That’s only 22 years away,” he tells Guardian Australia. “The energy companies get it. This is very much front of mind for the asset holders, and they want rational policy. They aren’t fighting it anymore. They don’t want stranded assets.” He says the energy market is going to transition “whether or not we’ve got Scott Morrison at the helm” and government owes it to people who will be materially affected in the transition to play it straight. “Workers in coal power stations need to know the truth. You really have to tell people the truth about structural change when it’s coming – you can’t be populist about it”. Earlier this year I asked the resources minister Matt Canavan whether he felt an obligation to help Australian communities face up to the inevitability of a carbon-constrained future. He responded as if I’d committed a thought crime. Labor, for its part, is putting a package of measures together. It’s likely to include a new statutory authority to oversee the transition and the programs intended to ameliorate it; specific industrial relations arrangements to ensure workers are managed through the process; and programs to drive economic diversification. Labor took a policy on coal transition to the last federal election, but it has to be re-engineered in some respects to take into account lessons learned from the closure of the Hazelwood plant, and also to reference the requirements of the reliability obligation in the national energy guarantee. Scott Morrison dumped the emissions reduction component of the Neg – it was a casualty of the Liberal leadership implosion – but Labor is likely to keep the policy with its own tweaks. A Labor Neg will have a higher emissions reduction target than the 26% proposed by Malcolm Turnbull, which will drive coal closure, but the reliability obligation (which requires retailers to provide sufficient quantities of dispatchable power to the grid) could mean that some coal persists in the system in a reserve capacity. Labor’s objective is to land the policy before the party convenes in Adelaide in mid-December for its national conference. The government’s new energy minister, Angus Taylor, is pushing in the opposite direction. Taylor is a bright bloke, with a lot of expertise in energy, which makes some of the positions he is pursuing hard to comprehend. While the science says the energy sector has to transition, and quickly, Taylor is digging in for coal. He’s signalled he wants to extend the life of existing plants and achieve new investment in generation by offering government support, including the possible indemnification of new coal-fired power from future carbon risk, which transfers the risk of these projects from private proponents to taxpayers. Taylor will also meet with the energy companies in Sydney next week to waggle his finger censoriously at them over their pricing behaviour. Now, why? Because he needs an outcome on that before voters go to the polls next year, because Morrison, in the spirit of handing on a poisoned chalice, has dubbed him the minister for getting power prices down. Power prices are high, and it would be terrific if they were lower. Ministers should stick up for the interests of consumers, that’s a given, but we also need ministers to think about interests that extend further than the next six months – something this government has become incapable of doing, which is what happens when the sum of your mistakes forces you to live minute to minute, without much care for whether anything connects to anything else, or whether things make sense. As the chairman of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, investment banker and company director Steven Skala, noted this week, the transition is on in the energy market. It can’t be reversed. Business has moved. The financial markets have moved. “The question now is not one of direction, but of pace,” he said. Unlike some disruptions, which present too quickly for governments to ameliorate the effects, we can see this one coming. We are living through the first phase of it. When it comes to Australia’s 8,000 coal workers and the communities that depend on those workers spending their incomes locally, governments can either pretend they can hold back the future, indulging inane, virtue signalling with Alan Jones about “fair dinkum” power while letting real people be crunched in the transformation, or they can act to make the shift as just as possible. The report Combet launched this week warns that a hands off approach has left many retrenched workers and their communities with very difficult transition problems. “Because of lack of subsequent support, some problems – like intergenerational unemployment, poverty and poor physical and psychological health – continue and worsen with time, becoming entrenched and systemic,” it says. “These people, their families and communities have been left to carry the main costs of structural adjustment. This represents a very unfair transition.” So here’s a thought. Instead of “fair dinkum” power, perhaps we could contemplate some “fair dinkum” action?"
"Heatwaves in the UK are lasting twice as long as they did 50 years ago, ice days are disappearing and tropical nights are starting to occur as far north as Middlesbrough, according to a Met Office report. The first study of climate extremes in the UK by the government agency shows the longer-term trend behind this summer’s prolonged spell of high temperatures and the weakening of winter frosts. In line with numerous other research papers on the rise in global temperatures, it also highlights how weather patterns are being pushed off a normal path as a result of human emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Until now the annual UK Climate Report has focused on monthly and yearly statistics, but a new supplement adds a series of indices on extreme weather. Mark McCarthy, the manager of the National Climate Information Centre, said: “Monthly, seasonal and annual climate data provide a valuable record of the changing climate in the UK. However, these average figures have a tendency to mask extreme weather and climate events. So in our latest report we have focussed on those measures which record weather extremes.” The new report shows that warm spells – when the maximum temperature is above the 90th percentile for the time of year – are becoming much more prolonged. From 1961 to 1990, the average longest warm spell each year was 5.3 days. From 2008 to 2017 this more than doubled to 13.2 days. This year, which is not included in these statistics, was even longer at 17 days. The south-east has seen an especially striking increase over the same period, up from an average of 6.1 days to 18.3 days. Tropical nights – when minimum nighttime temperatures remain above 20C – are being measured for the first time. They were almost unheard of until a couple of decades ago. Even the famous hot summer of 1976 never saw any of these nights, which are particularly gruelling for the elderly and infirm because they provide no respite from the heat. Since 1995 they have started to be recorded in London, Kent, the Isle of Wight and even occasionally in Wales and the north-east.  McCarthy said tropical nights were still very rare but he expected them to occur more frequently in the future. “With projections in climate suggesting warmer temperatures, it is useful to have this metric in place so that future changes can be monitored.” McCarthy said he was most surprised that extremes of hot and cold were changing at different speeds. While the temperature on the hottest day of the year has risen roughly in line with the average annual rate of warming since 1961, the coldest day has warmed at twice that rate. In the 30 years until 1990, the bitterest winter night in the UK averaged -8.5C. From 2008 to 2017 it was -6.8C. Parents who walk their children to school in the depths of winter may also have noticed there is less ice on the path than during their own childhoods. This is confirmed by the metric of “icing days”, which shows that the average number of days each year with freezing temperatures has fallen from 4.8 to 3.2. In the south-east last year there was not a single day averaging below 0C. The weather is becoming a little wetter and more dreary. The maximum daily deluge each year has risen by 17% from 64mm to 75mm, while the longest wet spell has increased from an average of 12.4 days to 12.9 days. The longest dry spell has become shorter, falling from 20.5 days with less than 1mm of rain to 18 days, though this year has brought such severe droughts that many farmers have had poor harvests. Many have already had to feed their winter food stocks to their animals and face increased costs as a result. In August the government was forced to relax rules on how much groundwater farmers were allowed to use after agriculture bodies warned continued dry weather could lead to food shortages and increased prices. Last month the UN’s top climate body warned that unless global temperature rises are held to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the world is likely to face catastrophic impacts from climate change, with flooding, droughts and extreme heat all more prevalent. Governments will meet in Poland in December for the latest round of negotiations over how to implement and strengthen the recommendations of the 2015 Paris agreement."
"Too many polar bears are roaming the Canadian Arctic, and the growing population is posing an increasing threat to Inuit communities, according to a controversial new government report which has been bitterly contested by environmental scientists. The draft report was prepared by the Nunavut government, and consists of submissions from Inuit community groups across Canada’s northernmost territory. Public consultations are set to start on Tuesday before the government unveils the final report later in the year. “Inuit believe there are now so many bears that public safety has become a major concern,” said one section of the report, according to the Canadian Press. “Public safety concerns, combined with the effects of polar bears on other species, suggest that in many Nunavut communities, the polar bear may have exceeded the coexistence threshold.” The renewed focus on polar bears comes after a tragic summer for the region: two people were killed by bears in separate attacks, including father Aaron Gibbons, who died protecting his children. Researchers agree that polar bears represent a growing threat to Inuit communities, but say that is because climate change has pushed them closer to human settlements – not because the bear population is growing. “There seems to be a divergence between scientists and Inuit on the threat that climate change poses to this species,” said Andrew Derocher, a polar bear researcher at the University of Alberta. Scientists and conservation groups have warned that a warming climate has reduced sea ice and the availability of prey, pushing bears on to the mainland – and closer to humans. But Inuit argue their own observations are often ignored, and the new report highlights a growing tension between scientific research and Inuit knowledge based on from thousands of years of living in the region. “We know what we are doing, and western science and modelling has become too dominant,” wrote the Kitikmeot regional wildlife board as part of its submission to the report. “Our knowledge, is not the same as thousands of years ago. If your life depended on it, you’d better know what the ice condition is,” said Gabriel Nirlungayuk, an Inuk hunter of Rankin Inlet. “Our knowledge has always evolved.” Aerial surveys are often used by scientists to determine the population health of bears. But Nirlungayuk said that some of the best hunting conditions for polar bears are during stormy, foggy weather that grounds aircraft – when bears can sneak up closer to their prey.  The polar bear hunt remains a critical and lucrative component of life in the northern communities. Hunters can receive as much as $10,000 for pelts, with residents parcelling up and sharing the meat for food. Canada has long resisted legislation that would terminate the harvest. While Inuit and scientists disagree on the population of the bears, they both foresee problems in the future. Derocher worries bears will continue to show up in communities, drawn in by numerous attractants – putting both humans and bears in harm’s way. “We’ve been saying this for years: we’re going to have a lot more problem bears. And if we don’t get on top of it, we’re going to see a lot more issues coming down the road,” he said. Nirlungayuk agrees. “We want to enjoy being out on the land with our families. But today, people need to carry a rifle all the time just to enjoy the great outdoors.”"

"Roger Kelly had been up through the night, watching the orange glow emanating from the hillside above his home of 30 years. The Seminole Springs mobile home park, a co-op of 215 small lakeside homes tucked into the canyon between Malibu and Agoura Hills, was on the warpath of the most destructive fire to ever hit Los Angeles and Ventura counties.  By the early morning on Friday last week, flames were quickly billowing toward them. “The way the smoke was coming you just knew it was on the other side of the hill and about to jump,” he say. His wife was ready with essentials packed. “I never thought we would burn here,” he said. “So, I just grabbed my surfboard” and left many other possessions behind. But before the day was through on Friday, half the neighborhood would be gone, leveled into ash and metal, foundations and car-frames. Referred to as a “hidden gem” by those who live there, most outsiders – even southern California locals – didn’t know the Seminole Springs neighborhood existed until an aerial view of the Woolsey fire caught by a local TV helicopter showed what was left behind. Roughly 100 small homes, which had once been closely clustered together in the canyon, had been reduced to rubble. Lots of people here consider one another family. That’s why the broadcast footage haunted residents. “I probably looked at that screenshot 100 times trying to figure out [who was spared],” Kelly said. “I could see my neighbor’s house, but I couldn’t really see mine. It was killing us, my wife and I.” By Saturday the president of the park had called – his home was safe. But in a tight-knit community like this, the relief couldn’t be fully felt, as neighbors suffered. “I didn’t know my place was there for sure, until I saw it with my own eyes,” he said, explaining why he evaded blockades set by the authorities and returned to the evacuated area over the weekend. “We came over the little hill and I saw it and … I couldn’t believe it. I got so overwhelmed with emotion. Just to see all the devastation.” Most members of the mobile home park, which was built in 1969, had lived there for years, raising their families together. It was the kind of place no one wants to leave, once they snag a spot. Initially constructed as a senior community, over the last few decades Seminole had begun to welcome families with children and recently, the 215 units were filled by a mixture of old and young.  The Seminole Springs website shows brightly colored kayaks adorning the shore, trails that lead past the lake into the green hillsides overlooking the community. There’s a pool, a BBQ area, and a lounge. “It was a gem,” Kelly said. “And it will be again. We hope.” Kelly adds: “In my opinion because we are a community of 215 families and homes –and we have been here for 40 years – we should have been a priority, rather than saving the big fancy homes built way in the middle of nowhere.” The Woolsey fire, which is still burning across more than 97,620 acres near Malibu in southern California, is 47% contained after six days of an around-the-clock firefight. The Los Angeles county fire chief, Daryl Osby, said the battle against this giant blaze, which has now scorched an area larger than the city of Denver, has been the most difficult he’s seen in his 35-year career.  So far, it has consumed more than 435 structures, a number officials say is likely to rise as damage crews finish their assessments. “I feel bad that we lost any homes,” Osby told the Guardian. Though he didn’t know the specifics of the Seminole Springs fire, he said it was something he would assess in the coming months when officials study the fire’s progression. “We did the best we could,” he adds, emphasizing that their teams had to use the limited resources they had to focus on saving lives. “I think we were successful at that objective, preventing death. Unfortunately, it was at the expense of people’s homes.” Carol Ornelas’s home was perhaps the last one that burned before the fire moved past the neighborhood. She lived in one of the few decimated houses in the lower-part of the park. Her three best friends, who live in the upper-part of Seminole Springs, all lost their homes. “We all moved there to be in the same place. But now it’s unbelievable,” she said. “Usually, if something terrible happens to one of your friends you can all rally to help that person – but it is all four of us.” ﻿Now she is resting with a friend and trying not to focus on the negatives. Ornelas had just moved her 94-year-old mother into an assisted living facility, and had recently brought all her family’s keepsakes to her Seminole Springs unit. She and her husband, a drummer, also had the only photo of him playing for Sonny and Cher hanging on the wall. Nothing could be recovered from the wreckage. “They are just things,” she said, “but they are things that we absolutely can never replace. Things that are not valuable so to speak, but they are the things I wanted to have forever. That’s the worst part – losing the things you can’t replace.” Houston Waye, a new resident who moved into Seminole Springs in February, left on Thursday evening to ensure his wife, animals, and two-year-old baby were out safely, but he returned on Friday afternoon, avoiding blocked roads by hiking in through a back route. In the first scramble to get out, he’d barely brought any of his own things. “I had two dogs, a cat, a tortoise and a two-year-old,” he said. By the time he returned, most of the damage was done. But he and others worked to ensure the smoldering patches wouldn’t reignite. The homes on the edge, between the line of saved homes and burned ones, were ablaze when he arrived. Waye and a neighbor who stayed through the ordeal used hoses to put them out. “This will bring out the best in a lot of people,” their neighbor Brandon Rubin said, calling helpful residents heroes. His was one of the homes still standing, but as someone who both grew up in Seminole Springs and who returned to live there with his girlfriend, receiving the news was “one of the most bittersweet things you can imagine”, he said. “There are faces to all those homes that you see gone,” he said. “Close to 100 homes were lost. That is a lot of people in trouble. ” But, he is certain they will rebuild – and they will do it together. “Like any community it’s not perfect. But we all love each other. We are all there for each other,” he said, adding: “the stuff is gone. But we are here. We are strong people and we are going to get through it – together.”"

"The social media influencer Jack Harries has said young people have a duty to protest against environmental destruction, as he took part in a day of protest in London that led to at least 14 arrests. The 25-year-old, whose YouTube channel has 4 million subscribers, spoke to the Guardian as he helped hold a 68-metre banner over the side of Westminster Bridge with the words: “Climate change: we’re fucked”. Harries, who has made a number of films about environmental destruction, said he was willing to use his social media influence to inspire his followers to take action over the climate. He said: “As a young person growing up in London I feel scared for the state of my future [and] overwhelmed by the news about climate change, and I feel like our government is simply ignoring the problem. “It’s worth noting I don’t want to be here, but I feel that it’s my duty as a young person to make our voices heard and to force our governments to listen because, ultimately, it’s our future that’s at stake.” He added: “Climate change is a global issue and it’s up to all of us to stand up to be heard. I think we have gone past the point of turning off our lightbulbs or having shorter showers. This is an existential threat. Young people should be angry and should be demanding change from their leaders. “For far too long leaders have avoided action on climate change because they have banked on the fact that young people don’t understand. We are here today to tell them that we do understand the issues, and we are scared.” Harries spoke at the beginning of a new day of action by the Extinction Rebellion group, which is orchestrating a week of events planned to bring London to a standstill. They say they have 500 activists who have signed up to be arrested.

He said: “If we carry on like we are now, my grandchildren have no future, absolutely no future. This is the last-ditch attempt, it’s too late to try anything else.” A second protester, facing police who arrived minutes later, said: “You don’t have to waste your time with CCTV because we’re not running away and we’ve got paint on our hands.” A spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion said the protesters used water-based spray chalk, which washes away easily.

"On a stiflingly hot morning, Daw Mya Htay rolls up her longyi, a Burmese sarong, ready to wade into the sea. “The well used to be the centre of our village,” Mya Htay says, grasping the side of a cement water well. But it no longer holds fresh water.  For the people of Khindan, the well is symbolic of their losing battle with the sea. Ten years ago, the town noticed erosion of the beachfront. Five years later, the well was swallowed by the sea. “Because of the storm surges, my old house was destroyed. The sand deposits just fell away,” says Mya Htay. Two kilometres of the village coast have been affected by accelerated erosion. Two weeks ago, the UN jolted the world with the message that we have 12 years to limit climate catastrophe. Its report urged action to cut carbon emissions to avoid the atmosphere warming by a disastrous 3C. In countries such as Myanmar, even a modest rise could be the tipping point for a new conflict over water and a new wave of climate refugees. Worldwide, Myanmar is the second most vulnerable country to extreme weather events. The effects are widespread: in the dry zone, home to nearly a third of Myanmar’s total population, temperatures are projected to rise by up to 3C after 2040. In the Irrawaddy delta, in the south – where people are still rebuilding after the country’s worst natural disaster, Cyclone Nargis, which displaced 2.4 million people – the mid-level projection for sea-level rise is up to 40cm by 2050. A sea level rise of roughly 13cm by 2020 may sound less alarming than the rate in the Republic of Kiribati, a group of Pacific islands that at risk of being totally erased this century. But climate consultant Sonia Leonard, who is working in Mon state with environmental organisation Alarm, points out that in low-lying floodplains where more than 140,000 people live, this increase will result in permanently flooded areas and a loss of productive agriculture land. People in Khindan have had to migrate from their homes several times. They have moved back as far as they can go on vacant land. “Now they’re literally just waiting for their houses to fall into the sea,” says Leonard, who is mapping vulnerable communities likely to be displaced by climate change. This year more than 150,000 people across Myanmar were displaced by flooding. What was once consistent rainfall has been replaced by a more intense monsoon, causing flash-flooding. “We feel like hermit crabs, we do not have a place to live,” says Khin Ohn Myint, her voice wavering as she looks at the bones of her house in the sea. What’s most striking is that this year has been par for the course in terms of abnormal monsoon periods and natural disasters.  “If this is just a normal year, with a large storm surge that has been slowly intensifying each year, what happens when a big cyclone hits again?” asks Leonard. In Khindan, the population visible on the streets consists mostly of elderly people and young children. Village elder Aung Shein’s situation is typical: “My children have had to go across the border [into Thailand] to look for work, so we are looking after their children,” he says. As people lose their land, experience a drop in crop productivity and struggle with declining water availability, many in Myanmar’s rural or coastal areas are migrating to the cities. Outmigration is also high, with more than 4 million Myanmar migrants working in Thailand alone. The new government has started to provide financial aid of 20,000 kyat (£9.65) for each household affected by natural disasters, but even officials concede this isn’t much for people who lose their houses or land.  Shashank Mishra of the Myanmar Climate Change Alliance believes access to water could spark conflict in the future. He points to the dry zone, where people have already been forced to leave their homes due to lack of water or an increase in temperature. “The total monsoon period has already decreased from 144 days per year in 1998 to 125 days,” Mishra explains. The number of extremely hot days is projected to increase from one day a month to between four and 17 by 2041, adds Mishra, which will also cause serious health problems. Ten years after Cyclone Nargis, some villages have received new cement tanks to hold fresh water, but there remains a pressing need for better adaptation planning. Leaning over a map of the Irrawaddy delta, field officer Win Naing explains: “We have built two storm shelters here in these central villages, and we are trying to build more mangroves to shelter village coastlines.” But if another intense cyclone hits – and since the 80s, cyclones in the Bay of Bengal have increased in number, often developing into hurricane-force storms – taking shelter in a multipurpose shelter may not be enough. One expert who has worked in Bangladesh advocates a “land bank”, for the government to earmark vacant land that can be allocated to future climate-displaced people. Setting aside parcels of land, which vulnerable communities can move, to is a concrete solution in a rights-based approach that aims to prevent land conflict. Scott Leckie of Displacement Solutions in Australia warns: “In most places in the developing world they [climate migrants] will end up landless, migrating from rural areas and ending up in slums in the cities with severe increased poverty, if there is no assistance.” U Hla Maung Thein, from the environment and conservation ministry, says the government is trying to work towards the goals set in the Paris agreement. “We have initiated plans such as a fish adaptation project, and for a community forest in Hinthada in the Ayeyarwady division and Chauk in the Magway region.” Climate activists welcome the government’s pledges, but say implementation must be quicker.  Back in Khindan, Daw Mya Htay gives her grandson a push on his bike while discussing climate change. She sighs. “It would be convenient if there was no sea level rise,” she says. Then, turning back to her house she shrugs. “But if it does, where will we go?”"
"A leading business group has expressed significant concern with the Morrison government’s controversial plan to underwrite new power generation, noting it could leave taxpayers exposed to liabilities “with a net present value of billions of dollars”. The Ai Group has used its submission to flag major problems with the proposal, ranging from its “extremely aggressive” administrative timetable, with projects being drummed up before the next federal election; a lack of obvious “strong independent governance” arrangements, and the lack of an overarching climate and energy policy.  The criticism joins significant pushback from Australia’s power companies, and from lobby groups representing renewable energy, reflecting profound frustration in the business community about the way the Coalition has conducted itself on climate and energy policy. Only the lobby group representing Australia’s resources giants, the Minerals Council of Australia has, thus far, lent public support to the initiative. The Ai Group says an underwriting program to encourage new generation is reasonable in theory, but if it is not well designed then taxpayers are exposed to significant risks, generators can be shielded from market pressures, and special treatment for some generators can deter investment outside the program. It notes the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission proposed an underwriting program with a low price floor of $45-50 per megawatt hour “that would be unlikely to expose the Commonwealth to much financial risk” – but the Morrison government has ignored those parameters and is pursuing options that “carry much greater risks”. The submission notes the underwriting program is being carried out in a policy vacuum. The government has indicated generation projects supported through the new underwriting mechanism would need to conform with an objective to reduce electricity emissions by 26% below its 2005 levels by 2030. But Ai Group says this is an “inadequate approach to integrating emissions and energy policy”. It says generation assets operate for decades “and emissions targets for 2030 – 12 years away – are not an adequate basis for consideration”. It says Australia has signed up to the Paris targets, and there is “no reason to think that applying a pro-rata – 26% target to the electricity sector is sufficient or efficient”. “There are strong arguments that deeper reductions in electricity emissions are cheaper and more practical than pro rata reductions across more challenging sectors,” the submission says. It calls on the Morrison government – which has abandoned emissions reduction after the internal furore over the national energy guarantee – to set a sectoral or economy-wide emissions policy framework to help guide future investment decisions. “Our strongly preferred solution to this uncertainty is for all sides of politics across the commonwealth and the states to agree an efficient, pro-competitive, stable and scalable framework for integrating climate and energy policy”. “In the absence of such a framework, government can try to support investment by guaranteeing it against policy risks. But this support may be very expensive, difficult to sustain and insufficiently credible to attract investment”. Ai Group says the governance arrangements for the scheme are completely unclear, and a process where proposals are considered by the Department of the Environment and Energy, “with possible ad hoc appointment of outside experts on certain matters, and decided on by the minister for energy with, presumably, Cabinet consideration” raises several concerns. The energy minister, Angus Taylor, has flagged underwriting new coal projects under the scheme, and the possible indemnification of projects from the future risk of a carbon price. Speculation is rife around the energy sector that the government underwriting proposal will ultimately centre on an extension of the Vales Point power station near Lake Macquarie in New South Wales. It is owned by Trevor St Baker, who was vocal during a recent stakeholder session convened to discuss the underwriting program. The Ai Group says: “Given that an underwriting program could result in long-term Commonwealth liabilities with a net present value of billions of dollars, a strong governance arrangement is essential for the actual and perceived integrity of the process”. It points out, for example, that the net present value of fully offsetting the lifetime emissions of a new 2GW high efficiency low emissions (HELE) power plant could be $17.5bn, and more than $1.3bn annually by 2030, depending on what carbon policies are ultimately adopted. The business group says the Morrison government needs to take a breath and stop attempting to finalise contracts prior to the federal election expected in May 2019. “Given the low level of detail currently available, the wide scope of possible design options, and the severe risks of poor design to the public purse and the integrity of the electricity market, we strongly recommend that the government slow down”."
"“It was like something out of a science fiction movie,” says Barbara Hall from the office of the beachside hotel she runs in Placencia, southern Belize. “I woke up at 6am, looked out my window and realised we had a big problem. It was absolutely overwhelming.” The sight that greeted her that morning was a gargantuan tide of sargassum – a type of ocean seaweed that had swept in overnight. At sea, sargassum is an essential habitat for some marine life, but when it reaches land it rots, sucking up oxygen from the water and emitting hydrogen sulphide gas, which smells like rotten eggs. It has washed up in the Caribbean in unusually large amounts since 2011, but this year the largest volumes ever have appeared on shores from Barbados to Mexico, with piles several feet deep stretching for miles, and dozens of metres out to sea. It has had a significant effect on the tourism on which much of the region depends – the sight and smell left beaches highly unattractive, and swimming was impossible. On land, the gas rapidly destroyed nearby electric units, such as TVs; eroded metals and even affected human health, with people living near inundated areas complaining of headaches, nausea and skin irritation. Marine life was also affected; across the region, there have been reports of fish, turtles, dolphins and other creatures succumbing to the piles of rotting algae. While oceanographers are uncertain of its causes, they think global warming could be a factor, and coastal communities could be due even worse sargassum inundations in the future. “This is a major issue for many island countries,” says James Franks, senior research scientist at the Gulf Coast Research Laboratory at the University of Southern Mississippi. “We don’t fully understand it … there are many unknowns.” It is believed the sargassum has benefited from increased nutrients in the sea – perhaps from mineral-rich dust blown from Africa, Franks says. Others believe fertiliser runoff from industrial farming in the Americas may be to blame. Warmer waters would also encourage plant growth. “I imagine global warming is part of the problem,” says Amy Siuda, a sargassum specialist at Eckerd College, Florida. “We’re experiencing changes in currents that certainly can be related to warming of the atmosphere.” Changes in wind patterns – potentially caused by a warming climate – mean sargassum might have been moved from areas where it has usually stayed, with winds and currents bringing it further south than normal, Siuda says. She adds: “Ocean currents are the results of winds, changes in winds are the results of solar heating and changes in atmosphere and circulation. Ultimately, we can change circulation patterns by warming our atmosphere.” Regardless of the causes, sargassum is being taken so seriously that governments across the Caribbean have initiated emergency programmes to deal with the issue. Belize, a tiny nation in Central America, is highly dependent on tourism, and sargassum is the “biggest concern” of all to the trade, says Hall. Hall says the authorities are “doing a good job” and are preparing the funding needed for expensive and complicated clear-up operations. Nonetheless, some hotels have reported cancellations during the slow season. The impact during high season could be devastating, say numerous locals employed in tourism. Hall stresses that hotels are taking firm steps to deal with the issue – such as preparing booms to keep the tides of sargassum out at sea – and they remain optimistic for the region’s future. But she admits some sargassum control methods employed in the nearby Yucatan peninsula of Mexico – which is much better-resourced – have not worked. In the northern Belizean island of Ambergris Caye, there was a mass fish die-out. The sargassum is “wiping out a generation” of the area’s young sea creatures, says Kirah Castillo, technical manager of the Hol Chan marine reserve just off the island. Months-old juvenile creatures such as lobster and conch migrate to nursery areas of mangrove and seagrass and are believed to have been suffocated by sargassum. “Whatever juveniles came in will have died,” Castillo says. The effects are likely to be felt in two to three years’ time, when the creatures would be due to enter the fishery, she says. These creatures are hard to see and the phenomenon has not been measured, Castillo says, but “we know from the biology of these animals that it is happening and will have an effect on the ecosystem. That’s a major concern for us.” The complex suspected causes of the sargassum problem mean it could worsen, with little prospect of a preventive solution. “Everyone now recognises this is a critical issue and may be long-term,” says Franks. Siuda agrees: “If the inundations increase in frequency, they could potentially last all year long without a break, maybe in larger amounts.” It represents a new challenge coastal communities will have to adapt to. “You couldn’t stop the waves. You could just see it coming and coming,” says Hall in her hotel office. “It’s a difficult thing, to feel powerless.”"
"Climate change is already harming Americans’ lives with “substantial damages” set to occur as global temperatures threaten to surge beyond internationally agreed limits, a major US government report has warned.  The influence of climate change is being felt across the US with increases in disastrous wildfires in the west, flooding on the east coast, soil loss in the midwest and coastal erosion in Alaska, according to the US National Climate Assessment. The Guardian saw a draft of the report before publication on Friday. The draft outlined that “impacts of climate change are intensifying across the country, and that climate-related threats to Americans’ physical, social, and economic wellbeing are rising”. Climate change-related risks “will continue to grow without additional action”, it added. The quadrennial report, the combined work of 13 federal agencies, was released by the Trump administration on the day after Thanksgiving. Scientists who worked on the report said their research was not watered down but claimed the release was timed to bury the findings during the holiday season. Global temperatures could be limited to 2C above pre-industrial era if greenhouse gas emissions are slashed but “without significant reductions, annual average global temperatures could increase by 9F (5C) or more by the end of this century”, a previously released chapter states. Even 2C warming is likely to have major ramifications for societies, as the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report spelled out. Heating the planet well beyond this would create a “totally different world”, said Michael Oppenheimer, a climate scientist at Princeton University. “It would be indescribable, it would turn the world upside down in terms of its climate. There would be nothing like it in the history of civilization.” Oppenheimer, with many other scientists, has said warming of around 3C is more likely given the advance of renewable energy and expected emissions reductions in the future. “That is more of an economic, political and technology question,” a report author who wished to remain unnamed told the Guardian. “It’s hard to say what we are on track for right now.” The draft report warned that the current response was insufficient to stave off the worst impacts, stating that “neither global efforts to mitigate the causes of climate change nor regional efforts to adapt to the impacts currently approach the scales needed to avoid substantial damages to the US economy, environment, and human health and well-being over the coming decades”. Another report author said: “Climate change is loading the dice against us, it’s going to affect our water, food and ecosystems. This report is important because it shows it’s already happening where we live, not on far off islands or at the poles.” Included in the dozens of draft report chapters: The summary states the “earth’s climate is now changing faster than at any point in the history of modern civilization, primarily as a result of human activities. The impacts of global climate change are already being felt in the United States and are projected to intensify in the future.” Average sea levels along the US coast have increased by around 9in since the early 20th century as the oceans have warmed and land ice has melted. If emissions are not constrained, “many coastal communities will be transformed by the latter part of this century”. Fisheries, tourism, human health and public safety are being “transformed, degraded or lost due in part to climate change impacts, particularly sea level rise and higher numbers of extreme weather events”. Wildfires have burned at least 3.7m acres in the US in all but three years from 2000 to 2016. “More frequent and larger wildfires, combined with increasing development at the wildland-urban interface portend increasing risks to property and human life,” the report states. More than 100m people in the US live in places with poor air quality and climate change will “worsen existing air pollution levels”. Increased wildfire smoke risks heightening respiratory and cardiovascular problems, while the prevalence of asthma and hay fever is also likely to rise. Major groundwater supplies have declined over the last century, with this decrease accelerating since 2001. “Significant changes in water quantity and quality are evident across the country,” the report finds. Climate change will “disrupt many areas of life” by hurting the US economy, affecting trade and exacerbating overseas conflicts. Low-income and marginalized communities will be worst hit. The national climate assessment is mandated by Congress to compile the latest research on climate change. The last report came out in 2014. Donald Trump has since announced the US will withdraw from the Paris climate deal, with his administration working to dismantle every major policy designed at lowering emissions. The release of the report comes as California is racked by its most deadly wildfire on record, the so-called Camp fire, which razed the town of Paradise. At least 84 people have died and tens of thousands of people have had to flee the fire, which has occurred at the same time as a smaller blaze further south, near Los Angeles. Trump has downplayed assertions by scientists and firefighters that climate change is making California more wildfire-prone, instead pointing to “gross mismanagement” of forest areas. Ryan Zinke, the interior secretary, has said conservationist lawsuits by “radical environmental groups” were to blame. While visiting devastated parts of California last weekend Trump was asked if what he had seen and heard had changed his mind about climate change, which he has previously called a “hoax”. Trump responded to the question with a firm: “No.” “When there are daily images of California burning up it’s hard for the administration to argue climate change isn’t happening,” said Oppenheimer. “The strategy seems to be let sleeping dogs lie and hope the public doesn’t pay much attention to it.”"
"The Trump administration attempted to downplay the stark findings of its own climate change assessment, as Democrats sought to pressure the White House to avert looming economic and public health disaster. The US National Climate change assessment, the work of 300 scientists and 13 federal agencies, was released on Friday afternoon. It found that wildfires, storms and heatwaves are already taking a major toll on Americans’ wellbeing, with climate change set to “disrupt many areas of life” in the future.  The voluminous report, which warns of hundreds of billions of dollars lost, crop failures, expanding wildfires, altered coastlines and multiplying health problems, represents the most comprehensive and sobering analysis yet of the dangers posed to the US by rising temperatures. Climate change could slash up to a tenth of US GDP by the end of the century, the report found, with $1tn in coastal real estate threatened by rising sea levels and storms. Heatwaves are set to cause thousands of extra deaths and worsen conditions such as asthma and pulmonary disease through increased air pollution. A White House spokeswoman, however, said the assessment was “largely based on the most extreme scenario, which contradicts long-established trends by assuming that, despite strong economic growth that would increase greenhouse gas emissions, there would be limited technology and innovation, and a rapidly expanding population”. The spokeswoman added the next report, due in four years’ time, will “provide for a more transparent and data-driven process”. Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University and a report co-author, said the White House’s statement was “demonstrably false”. She added on Twitter: “I wrote the climate scenarios chapter myself so I can confirm it considers ALL scenarios, from those where we go carbon negative before end of century to those where carbon emissions continue to rise.” The climate assessment galvanized Democrats, who will control the House of Representatives next year. “The days of denial and inaction in the House are over,” said Frank Pallone, a New Jersey congressman set to chair the energy and commerce committee. “House Democrats plan to aggressively address climate change and hold the administration accountable for its backward policies that only make it worse.” Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a newly elected representative from New York City who has become a standard-bearer for the left, tweeted: “People are going to die if we don’t start addressing climate change ASAP. It’s not enough to think it’s ‘important’. We must make it urgent.” Authors of the report, which is mandated by Congress, echoed the sense of urgency and lamented the timing of its release on the day after Thanksgiving, which is usually the busiest shopping day of the year. “This report makes it clear that climate change is not some problem in the distant future – it’s happening right now in every part of the country,” said Brenda Ekwurzel, a co-author and director of climate science at the Union of Concerned Scientists, in a statement. “When people say the wildfires, hurricanes and heatwaves they’re experiencing are unlike anything they’ve seen before, there’s a reason for that and it’s called climate change.” Ekwurzel added that the report “makes a convincing case the White House should stop rolling back climate policies and recognize that a much larger scale response is required to keep people safe”. Donald Trump did not immediately comment on the report, although on Wednesday he responded to a cold snap on the east coast by tweeting: “Brutal and Extended Cold Blast could shatter ALL RECORDS – Whatever happened to Global Warming?” The president took a trip last week to see the aftermath of California’s deadliest ever wildfires, a phenomenon experts say is worsened by warming temperatures. During a visit to the town of Paradise, which was wiped out by the so-called Camp fire, Trump said he wanted “a great climate”. But he has largely blamed forest management for the blaze. He has repeatedly disparaged or dismissed climate science in the past. In a statement in response to the release of the climate assessment, the former vice-president and environmental campaigner Al Gore said: “The president may try to hide the truth, but his own scientists and experts have made it as stark and clear as possible.”"

"Half of the increase in Australia’s annual carbon dioxide emissions can be linked to a single issue: the failure to bury greenhouse gases underground at the country’s largest liquefied natural gas development. Chevron’s Gorgon LNG development in the Pilbara is considered a landmark development in carbon capture and storage, a long-promised technology to limit emissions from fossil fuels. Under its agreement with the Western Australian government, the energy giant is required to capture 80% of emissions from an underwater gas field over a five-year period and inject them into a reservoir 2km under Barrow Island. The Minerals Council of Australia chief executive, Tania Constable, last month told ABC the project demonstrated that carbon capture and storage was “coming through very strongly”. But nearly two years after the start of LNG production from the Gorgon gas field, emissions storage is yet to begin. A Chevron spokeswoman said technical issues were identified in the commissioning of the storage project and modifications were under way. She said it was expected underground injection would begin by March. The company said between 3.4m and 4m tonnes of carbon dioxide would be buried each year. It was estimated it would cut Gorgon’s total emissions – counting both fugitive emissions from gas wells and those released during production, when the gas is compressed into liquid form for export – by about 40%. The $2.5bn project is backed by $60m in federal government funding. A new report has questioned whether the company expects the project to work. The analysis by research group the Australia Institute said Chevron has also applied – and been granted approval – to emit an average of 8.7m tonnes a year to 2020 under the government’s “safeguard mechanism”, part of the Tony Abbott-era Direct Action climate policy. It said if the injection project does work Gorgon’s emissions would fall from between 8.5m and 10m tonnes to between 5.1m and 6m tonnes a year. The institute’s climate and energy program director, Richie Merzian, said by granting it a higher emissions limit the government was allowing Chevron to plan for the carbon storage project to fail. Federal government data shows increased LNG production was the main reason national emissions rose by 6.8m tonnes in the year to March. The Australia Institute report suggests the delay at Gorgon’s carbon injection project played a central role, causing emissions equal to half that increase. “Rather than holding Chevron to account, the Morrison government is giving it as much leniency as it possibly can,” Merzian said. “It’s another example of the government’s inaction on climate change. If the government isn’t going to address LNG emissions, which is one of Australia’s fastest-growing sectors, then Australia has no hope of meeting its Paris target.” LNG production in Australia has tripled since 2012, doubled in the two years to 2017 and is expected to grow another 18% this year. The related growth in emissions is projected to effectively wipe out carbon pollution avoided through the 23% renewable energy target. The LNG industry is covered by the safeguard mechanism, which grants big industrial sites generous pollution limits, known as baselines. The baseline at Gorgon is drawn from Chevron’s projections of how much will be emitted in its biggest production year in the first five years of operation. The company can emit up to that baseline for free, but will have to buy carbon credits to offset any emissions above it. The baseline is expressed as 25m  tonnes over the three years to June 2020. Merzian said the mechanism was next to useless while companies could nominate their own baseline. “It’s like allowing a taxpayer to nominate how much tax they want to pay,” he said. Based on the cost of carbon credits under the government’s emissions reduction fund, Merzian estimates it would cost Chevron up to $52m a year if it was required to offset the pollution it had agreed to sequester but that is currently being released into the atmosphere. Neither Chevron nor the federal environment minister, Melissa Price, answered directly when asked if Gorgon’s baseline implied the carbon storage project would not work. A Chevron spokeswoman said the company had applied for a baseline in accordance with strict regulations overseen by the Clean Energy Regulator, a government agency. A spokesman for Price said the baseline was calculated based on an audited forecast of emissions intensity and production at full capacity. “Businesses must manage their emissions and keep to [their] limit,” he said. Price’s spokesman said LNG exports played a role in international emissions reduction efforts by providing a relatively low-emitting fuel source for electricity. In WA, the Environment Protection Authority is investigating the agreement between the state and the company in light of the delay, including when the five-year period in which it has to bury 80% of fugitive emissions officially started. After a tour of the Gorgon site in October, state environment minister, Stephen Dawson, was quoted in the West Australian saying he would give the company the “benefit of the doubt” that it would overcome the technical issues the storage project was facing. The EPA is expected to report back by April. Dawson said it should be clear by then if the carbon injection project would work and whether Chevron could meet the target. “Discussions will then need to commence on how Chevron can offset the portion not able to be sequestered,” he said."
"Brazil’s president-elect Jair Bolsonaro has chosen a new foreign minister who believes climate change is part of a plot by “cultural Marxists” to stifle western economies and promote the growth of China. Ernesto Araújo – until recently a mid-ranking official who blogs about the “criminalisation” of red meat, oil and heterosexual sex – will become the top diplomat of South America’s biggest nation, representing 200 million people and the greatest and most biodiverse forest on Earth, the Amazon. His appointment, confirmed by Bolsonaro on Wednesday, is likely to send a chill through the global climate movement. Brazil was where the international community first came together in 1992 to discuss reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Its diplomats have played a crucial role in bridging the gap between rich and poor nations, particularly during the forging of the Paris agreement in 2015. But when the new government takes power in January, the foreign ministry that leads that work will be headed by a man who claims climate science is merely “dogma”. In his blog, Araújo states his goal is to “help Brazil and the world liberate themselves from globalist ideology”, which he sees as anti-Christian. The 51-year-old diplomat – who has never served as an overseas ambassador – claims unnamed leftist politicians have hijacked environmentalism to serve as a tool for global domination. “This dogma has been used to justify increasing the regulatory power of states over the economy and the power of international institutions on the nation states and their populations, as well as to stifle economic growth in democratic capitalist countries and to promote the growth of China,” he wrote in a post last month. In another, he claimed the centre-left Workers party in Brazil was “criminalising sex and reproduction, saying that all heterosexual intercourse is rape and every baby is a risk to the planet as it will increase carbon emissions”. He then went on to accuse the party of criminalising red meat, oil, air conditioners and Disney movies. The incendiary rhetoric echoes that of Bolsonaro, who won last month’s presidential election with about 57.7m votes. The former army captain has since moved to put in place one of the world’s most far-right administrations and promised to align Brazil more closely to Trump and the US. Climate negotiation experts said the appointment was sad for Brazil and the world – though they held out hope that the new foreign minister will be more pragmatic when he comes to represent his country. “Brazil has played a very significant role for the Paris agreement. It would be really bad for the country’s image if he brings with him his ideology,” said Carlos Rittl, the executive secretary of the Brazilian Climate Observatory. He said climate was the one area where Brazil could proudly boast to be a global leader, and urged the new foreign minister and president not to isolate the country in this field. “Bolsonaro is not Trump. Brazil is not the United States. We don’t have the same cards,” he said. “If Brazil becomes a pariah on the global climate agenda, it would be extremely bad for our business, especially agribusiness. When they go to Europe to negotiate a deal, climate safeguards will be on the table. ” The risk of losing soya and beef sales in Europe is thought to be why Bolsonaro has backtracked on threats to quit the Paris agreement and merge the agriculture and environment ministries. But he remains intent on opening up the Amazon to the farmers, miners and construction companies that supported his campaign. His pick as agriculture minister is the head of the farming lobby, Tereza Cristina Dias, who conservationists have nicknamed the “Muse of Poison” due to her enthusiastic support for relaxing controls on agro-toxins. She and her colleagues are said to be gutting the responsibilities of the environment ministry before its new head is appointed. The environment institution is likely to be so subservient that insiders joke there will soon be two agriculture ministries in Brazil. The slim hope now for climate advocates is that the powerful agribusiness lobby will come to realise that the rain for their crops depends on a healthy Amazon and stable global environment. More than 80% of Brazil’s municipalities have experienced drought in the past five years, which scientists have linked to deforestation. But loggers are not waiting. The latest deforestation figures showed a sharp rise in deforestation during the election campaign, suggesting protections for nature and indigenous land are already weakening."
"The former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull says a “constituency” of Coalition MPs believes climate change is a fraud, and that the issue has become a “third rail” for the Liberal party. Speaking at the Australia Bar Association’s annual conference in Sydney on Friday night, Turnbull, the guest of honour at the event, said a climate-sceptic group within his own party held the line that “if you don’t do what we want, we will blow the show up,” the Australian reported.  “And that is essentially what you’ve seen — and so the problem is that everybody loses”. Turnbull, who was replaced as prime minister by Scott Morrison in August and subsequently retired from politics, was asked at the event about his personal commitment to act on climate change. He famously crossed the floor in opposition to vote with Labor in support of an emissions trading scheme, but as prime minister led a government with little resolve to reduce emissions. “The truth is … the Liberal Party and the Coalition is not capable of dealing with climate change,” Turnbull told the conference. “It is just a fact I regret to say. It is like a third rail. We have at the present time in the Coalition, a group of, a constituency, that is the best way to describe it, who believe we should get out of [the Paris Agreement], that climate change is a fraud, the more you have the better, and are literally on another plane. “They are not prepared to play ball with everybody else.” Turnbull has previously conceded that any policy on climate change would be extremely difficult for the Liberal-National Coalition because it was treated as an ideological matter within the party. “The emissions issue and climate policy issues have the same problem within the Coalition of ... bitterly entrenched views that are actually sort of more ideological views than views based,” he had said while being forced out as prime minister. During an appearance on the ABC’s Q&A program this month, he described his removal from the prime ministership as an act of unexplained madness, and accused leading conservatives of “blowing up” the government."
"I am saddened by the overwhelmingly one-sided criticism of David Attenborough’s alleged failure to address environmental issues in his nature programmes (Letters, 12 November). Like many teachers I have used Attenborough’s wonderful productions to enthuse my pupils with a love of science and a deep appreciation of our living planet. No living person has educated more children and adults than he. And with education comes the knowledge and understanding necessary to debate the survival of life on Earth calmly and rationally. One of Attenborough’s great strengths is his refusal to be evangelical or politically correct (there are enough of those about). He talks the language of Darwin and evolution but doesn’t preach atheism or secularism. He has shown us virtually every ecosystem on the planet but, having armed us with the knowledge, leaves it up to us, and especially the environmentalists, what to do with it. Stan LabovitchWindsor  • I agree with much of what George Monbiot has to say, but I found his criticism of David Attenborough harsh and unjustified (Attenborough has betrayed the living world he loves, 7 November). Attenborough’s much-acclaimed wildlife programmes can have left most viewers in little doubt about his deep concerns over the damage being done to the environment, and made a significant contribution to public awareness of the problems. Some years ago, I happened to be at the north pole base camp for expeditions and other activities at the same time as the Frozen Planet team. I was struck by the care and time they were taking to find the right conditions for Attenborough to stand at the pole in order to do a piece to camera expressing his worries about global warming. This was not somebody trying to brush the issue under the carpet.

"The Republic of Vanuatu says it will explore whether it can take legal action against fossil fuel companies and countries for their role in causing climate change. The Pacific nation says it is growing desperate for financial assistance to deal with the loss and damage it is increasingly experiencing due to extreme weather and global warming.  In a statement on Thursday to the Climate Vulnerable Forum, an international summit focused on those most at risk to the effects of climate change, Vanuatu’s foreign minister, Ralph Regenvanu, said he was putting the fossil fuel industry “and the states that sponsor it on notice that the climate loss and damages ravaging Vanuatu will not go unchallenged”. “My government is now exploring all avenues to utilise the judicial system in various jurisdictions – including under international law – to shift the costs of climate protection back onto the fossil fuel companies, the financial institutions and the governments that actively and knowingly created this existential threat to my country,” he said. No such case brought by a country has been tested but there have been cases brought by citizens in domestic jurisdictions. Small island countries such as Vanuatu are especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Under the Paris agreement, countries have agreed to limit global warming to between 1.5 and 2C. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s recent special report warned the planet had only 12 years in which to meet the 1.5C goal and that the damage of even half a degree warmer than that would be far more significant. Regenvanu told the forum that Cyclone Pam, the tropical cyclone that hit Vanuatu in 2015, wiped out 64.1% of its GDP, or $US449.4m. He told Guardian Australia that Vanuatu was facing huge costs in trying to adapt to and prevent the impacts of climate change. “The mechanism that has been but in place by the Paris agreement to assist least developed countries like Vanuatu to adapt and take measures to deal with loss and damage is the Green Climate Fund,” he said. “Unfortunately countries like Australia who are the big polluters have just announced they will not contribute. “There is a moral argument to say that to address our loss and damage bill we should be getting that from the people who are profiting off it.” He said Vanuatu was looking for other countries to join it and would be discussing this at the next conference of parties on climate change in Poland next month. Vanuatu is home to 260,000 residents and is made up of 82 volcanic islands dispersed across 1,280km of sea. Many of its islands sit less than a metre above sea level. Greenpeace said the country was on the front lines of climate change. “Vanuatu’s brave announcement today is part of a global wave of legal action against oil, gas, and coal companies and laggard governments,” Jennifer Morgan, the executive director at Greenpeace International, said. Richie Merzian is the climate and energy program director at yhe Australia Institute and a former Australian government negotiator to the UN on loss and damage from climate change. He said Vanuatu’s announcement was a sign of growing frustration among countries vulnerable to climate change over the loss and damage mechanisms within UN climate forum. “These countries are desperate and they’re looking for support and instead of finding a friend they’re finding a closed door,” he said. “It’s great Vanuatu is looking for every option available to make their case and there are a number of test cases around the world that they can learn from.” "

"Europe faces even deeper political turmoil and the possibility of mass migration from Africa unless the world urgently addresses the threat of climate change, the former US secretary of state John Kerry said on Thursday. Speaking at a Guardian Live event, at Central Hall in London, he said he was deeply disturbed at how issues such as climate change, cyber wars and the future of the oceans were not ballot box issues, admitting it was hard to translate these issues into an acceptable set of choices for voters. In the discussion with the Observer’s chief political commentator, Andrew Rawnsley, Kerry said: “We are heading for catastrophe unless we respond to some life-threatening challenges very rapidly. We have a climate-denying president that pulls us out of the the Paris climate change agreement at a time when literally every day matters. “Europe is already crushed under this transformation that is taking place due to migration. In Germany Angela Merkel is weakened. Italian politics is significantly impacted. “Well, imagine what happens if water dries up and you cannot produce food in northern Africa. Imagine what happens if Nigeria hits its alleged 500 million people by the middle of the century … you are going to have hordes of people in the northern part of the Mediterranean knocking on the door. I am telling you. If you don’t believe me, just go read the literature.” The former secretary of state for the Obama administration reminded his audience that climate change scientists had just warned that historically unprecedented steps were needed to prevent an extra 0.5C (0.9F) increase. He pointed to the fires in California and the repeated intensive storms – Harvey, Irma and Maria – that cost the US $265bn last year. Kerry said Harvey dropped as much water on the Houston, Texas, area in five days as goes over Niagara Falls in an entire year. Irma, he said, had the first recorded, sustained winds of over 185 mph for 24 hours. He said the Green Climate Fund set up in Paris was supposed to have $100bn, but it only had $6bn, making it very difficult for poorer countries to make the right energy decisions. China and India, he said, were still on course to build a wave of coal-fired stations. “We should not be building a single coal fired plant anywhere on the planet,” he added. Kerry insisted the doors to the G20 summit in Argentina later this year should be locked until the fund was replenished. At the same time, he said, the private sector had to come up with the transformative breakthroughs but all voters have to make “damn sure” that politicians will take the issue seriously. He also made an impassioned defence for the EU, saying the institution had been set up initially to prevent war, but Europe was now seeing old demons return in the form of antisemitism and racism. Kerry, insisting he did not want to interfere in the UK elections, reminded his audience that before the 2016 referendum he and president Obama had called for the UK to stay in the EU. “To the best of my knowledge [Obama] has not changed view,” he said. He added: “I do not think this is the moment for the EU to start falling apart.” Kerry also defended the Iran nuclear deal that he signed in 2015, but that has been torn up by Donald Trump. He said the “deal is the tightest, most stringent, most accountable, transparent nuclear arms agreement on the planet”. Under the deal, if the Iranians had tried to make a bomb “we would know immediately because we have radio transmission seals on centrifuges and stockpiles. We have a right to trace, from cradle to grave, every piece of uranium”. He described the US midterm election results as encouraging and said the Democrats should be preparing for the 2020 election. He refused to identify his chosen presidential candidate, saying he was not convinced he had identified that person yet. But he said the essential element of any ideal successful candidate “will above all be authenticity”. • This article was amended on 19 November 2018 to correct the fahrenheit conversion of a difference in temperature of 0.5C.

"On climate and energy policy, Labor never learns from its mistakes, Scott Morrison told us on Thursday, apparently limbering up for another heart-warming election season of who can be the biggest numpty. The prime minister is wrong about that. The evidence tells us Labor does learn from its mistakes, and in climate and energy the ALP have become shape shifters in order to keep doggedly pursuing policies reducing emissions in an environment when that activity is construed, ever more bizarrely in reactionary circles, as some kind of hostile action. Again, with our eyes fixed firmly on the evidence, we can note Morrison is brave to be talking about mistakes and a lack of learning in climate and energy policy, given the Coalition has been a rolling botch-up in this area, lurching from bouts of hyperpartisan self-interest to desperate scrambling to produce a policy that Tony Abbott wouldn’t veto (oops he vetoed it anyway), ending at a point that can only be described as outright clustercuss. Just consider one small counterpoint from Thursday. Bill Shorten went to Bloomberg and laid out an energy policy that defined the pressing challenge of transforming Australia’s energy market from top to bottom, and then he rolled out some detailed policy options for dealing with it. The energy minister, Angus Taylor, by way of riposte, bunged on a high-vis vest, stood in front of a smelter in Tomago, and talked about Shorten having to nominate which burping cows he would cull, which, for a person of Taylor’s intelligence and technical expertise, must feel about as close as it comes to End Times. We’ve been here before: the hyperbolic carry on, it’s all pretty tired. It was stupid then and it’s even more stupid now, with the clock ticking, the grid creaking, power prices rising and emissions rising in sectors of the economy outside electricity. We don’t have time for more nonsense, and there’s already been far too much of it. When it comes to climate and energy policy, voters desperately need someone to be a grown-up and, on Thursday, Shorten told them, in his most important speech as opposition leader, that it would be him. He would be the grown-up because, God knows, someone had to be. Now, to the merits of Shorten’s policy offering. It’s a bit depressing, frankly, where we find ourselves, at the tail end of the dumbest decade, because the only options to achieve progress are third-order options, where governments are back to rolling out industry policies as the solution to problems. A number of business groups on Thursday pointed out the downside risks of energy policy by picking winners but frankly some of those business groups were also on the front line of campaigning against a carbon price, a market mechanism, only a couple of years ago – so, chaps, what goes around comes around. You reap what you sow. So, we are where we are. Wishing it were otherwise is a waste of energy and a waste of time and, in the context of where we are, Labor’s offering is sensible enough. The plan looks like this. Give the Liberals one more chance not to be wreckers on the taxpayer dime, give them an opportunity to wake up for themselves and vote for their own mechanism, the national energy guarantee. And in the event that fails, then drive the required transformation by a combination of measures: a 45% economy-wide emissions reduction target, funding the Clean Energy Finance Corporation to drive new investments in large-scale generation and storage, upgrading sub-optimal transmission infrastructure and preparing coal communities for the inevitable transition. Conceptually, that’s not a bad mud map. Of course there will be detailed questions to answer, and there’s an obvious one sitting right at the heart of Labor’s package. If the economy-wide emissions reduction target is 45% (and that’s the plan) then shouldn’t the emissions reduction target for the electricity sector be higher than that given abatement is cheaper in electricity than in other sectors of the economy? It’s cheaper to reduce emissions in electricity than it is, say, in transport. The reality is the electricity target should be higher than 45% to try and contain the costs of the transition. It’s a question that needs an answer but that’s a tangle Labor won’t want to get into, particularly given Taylor and others are already thundering apocalyptically about “wrecking balls” through the economy."
"Cooling the Earth by injecting sun-blocking particles into the stratosphere could be “remarkably inexpensive”, according to the most detailed engineering analysis to date. The fear of a rogue nation or military force unilaterally taking control of the global climate is unfounded, the researchers added, as the many thousands of high-altitude flights needed to affect global temperatures could not escape detection.  The new research estimated the technology costs of putting millions of tonnes of sulphate particles high into the atmosphere. This form of geoengineering mimics major volcanic eruptions, which have significantly reduced global temperatures in the past. “We show that a hypothetical deployment programme, while both highly uncertain and ambitious, would be technically possible,” said Gernot Wagner from Harvard University. “It would also be remarkably inexpensive, at an average of around $2bn to $2.5bn per year.” About $500bn (£388bn) a year is currently invested in green technologies. The idea of geoengineering is controversial, with opponents arguing it could seem like an easy solution to global warming and weaken efforts to cut the root cause of emissions. Others warn it risks serious unintended consequences, such as droughts and damage to crops. In October, more than 100 civil society groups condemned geoengineering as “dangerous, unnecessary and unjust”. However, many scientists say not conducting geoengineering research would be even more dangerous, because climate change may become so bad that governments feel compelled to deploy it despite not knowing its full consequences. “Unfortunately, climate change is dire enough for us to have to consider drastic action,” said Dr Matthew Watson at the University of Bristol. “Some argue against researching these ideas but personally I think that is a mistake. There may come a time, in a future not so far away, where it would be immoral not to intervene.” The new study, published in the journal Environmental Research Letters, found that the most cost-effective way to deliver the particles requires the development of a new type of aircraft. If the sulphates were released from commercial jets, the particles would fall out of the sky in days. No aircraft exists that could carry tonnes of particles to the 12-mile (20km) altitude needed in order for them to remain aloft for a year or more, and rockets would be far too expensive. The new plane would need much larger wings and four engines rather than two, as the air at 12 miles is just 7% as dense as at sea level. “It would be an unusual design, but one does not need technological breakthroughs,” said Wake Smith, an aviation engineer who worked with Wagner. The researchers calculated the cost of a 15-year programme in which six to eight new planes are added each year, including crew costs, maintenance, insurance, fuel, landing charges, spares and training. The programme would begin with 4,000 flights a year and end with 60,000 flights a year by almost 100 aircraft. “The amount of flights happening would be so big it could not be done secretly,” said Smith. “This is not like the German naval buildup before the second world war. If people were doing this, we would know about it.” The impact of the programme would be to reduce warming by 0.1C per year, with a total reduction of 1.5C, said Wagner. This is based on emissions being curbed from today’s levels but still rising and leading to 3C of warming, a level considered catastrophic by scientists. A major recent report from the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) cited 1.5C of warming as a far safer limit. The researchers said they were not advocating the deployment of solar engineering, but believed it must be assessed. “It can only be part of an overall climate policy portfolio that first includes [emission cuts], adaptation and carbon removal from the atmosphere,” said Wagner. The IPCC report said geoengineering might be adopted as a temporary “remedial measure” in extreme circumstances. “If the world runs through the door with its hair on fire, we need to understand what the options are,” said Smith. Prof Joanna Haigh at Imperial College London said: “This plan is a distraction that may well encourage weaker action on emissions reduction.” She said the money would be better spent on helping nations cut emissions and protect themselves from extreme weather. The costs of compensating for droughts, floods and food shortages that geoengineering might cause would be much larger than the engineering costs, said Phil Williamson at the University of East Anglia. “International agreement to go ahead would seem near-impossible. Rapid reductions in emissions remain the best way to avoid climate catastrophe.” Blocking sunlight does not address other problems caused by global warming, such as the acidification of the oceans. However, Prof Peter Cox at the University of Exeter said: “The fact that researchers at one of the world’s top universities are costing the deployment of such a radical [geoengineering] scheme shows how urgent the climate change problem has become.”"

"Looming climate breakdown is opening fresh divisions among environmentalists over nuclear energy, with a major advocacy group calling for struggling nuclear plants to be propped up to avoid losing their low-carbon power. Nuclear is the single largest source of low-carbon electricity in the US. But a third of nuclear plants are unprofitable or scheduled to close, risking a rise in greenhouse gas emissions if they are replaced by coal or natural gas, a major Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) report has found. US emissions could increase by as much as 6% if struggling plants are shuttered early, the report warns. This scenario has put pressure on many environmental groups to re-evaluate their intrinsic opposition to nuclear energy as a dangerous blight that must be eradicated. “We are running out of time to make the emissions reductions needed to avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis,” said Steve Clemmer, director of energy research for the UCS climate and energy program. “Losing a low-carbon source of electricity like nuclear power is going to make decarbonization even harder than it already is. Nuclear has risks, it’s not a perfect technology, but there have to be trade-offs.” The US, like the rest of the world, faces a steep challenge to avoid the worst ravages of heatwaves, drought, extreme weather and flooding. The IPCC report states emissions must reach net zero by 2050 to avoid the most punishing climate change impacts, whereas the Trump administration is currently dismantling every major policy aimed at lowering emissions in the US. The US has an ageing fleet of nearly 100 reactors at 60 nuclear plants, with many nearing the ends of their expected lifetimes. Five plants have shut down since 2013, with a further five set to shutter over the next eight years. In total, a third of US nuclear power plants are set to close down or are unprofitable largely due to a major shift to cheaper natural gas. As nuclear provides more than half of the US’s low-carbon energy, this situation “raises serious concerns about our ability to achieve the deep cuts in carbon emissions needed to limit the worst impacts of climate change”, the UCS report states. Replacements for nuclear will vary across the country. The huge Diablo Canyon plant in California, for example, will probably spawn a surge in renewable energy when it shuts in 2025. But in other states, such as Ohio and Pennsylvania, weak clean energy policies and the abundance of natural gas mean the closure of nuclear plants will probably raise emissions. “Renewables can fill a lot of the gap but it’s a timing issue,” Clemmer said. “Over a long timeframe we can ramp up renewables and phase out coal, gas and nuclear generation but we don’t have that time. We have to cut half of all emissions by 2030, according to the IPCC. We can’t physically ramp up renewables fast enough.” Anti-nuclear campaigning has been a foundational shibboleth for groups such as Greenpeace, which has pointed to disasters such as Chernobyl in 1986 and Fukushima in 2011 as evidence that the sector should be shut down. While the UCS have never been militant opponents of nuclear power, Clemmer said “we are getting a bit more vocal” about the benefits of keeping plants open as the scale of the climate crisis has become clearer. Many opponents remain implacable, however. “Nuclear reactors are a bad bet for a climate strategy,” said Dr Gregory Jaczko, who was chairman of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission during the Obama administration. “The Union of Concerned Scientist models don’t reflect the reality of the United States electricity market. Renewables are getting cheaper faster than expected and are in some cases the least expensive source of electricity.” Jaczko said new nuclear is a “financial boondoggle”, with investments better placed in solar or wind. “Employing nuclear for climate change is like Dorothy seeking the Wizard of Oz to get home,” he added. “It’s an expensive enticing mirage.” Clemmer said he agreed that new nuclear plants are enormously expensive but said there was a case for the US government to invest around $814m a year to keep existing unprofitable plants online, given the cleaner energy they provide. “Environmental groups may come round to this, but I’m just not sure,” he said."
"Bristol has declared a “climate emergency”, with the council unanimously backing a commitment to be carbon neutral by 2030 in an effort to avoid catastrophic climate breakdown. The motion put forward by Green party councillor Carla Denyer and passed on Tuesday means the city has the most ambitious emissions targets of the UK’s core cities group – with radical policy implications in the coming years.  The move was triggered by a UN report last month which said the world has just 12 years left to avoid catastrophic climate breakdown. Denyer said: “This is a fantastic day for Bristol and I’m delighted the council will be bringing forward its target for making the city carbon neutral by 2030. She said the UN report made it clear that “time to preserve Earth as we know it is running out”. “We can’t wait for the UN or national governments to negotiate when we have just 12 years to act – we have to show how it’s done and commit to ambitious action at the level of cities, which we did this evening.” The target is much more radical than the UK government’s national target of an 80% reduction in emissions by 2050 and comes amid growing concern about interlinked ecological crisis, from climate breakdown to extinction. In a sign of the growing frustration about lack of action, thousands of people are expected to take part in civil disobedience in the UK this weekend as part of the Extinction Rebellion campaign. Denyer said that the Bristol declaration could see a focus on renewable electricity, carbon neutral buildings, congestion charges and investment in clean transport infrastructure. It could also have far-reaching implications for big-ticket projects like the proposed expansion of Bristol airport. “It will mean viewing all policy decisions through their impact on greenhouse gas emissions,” she added. Denyer said that although there would be changes for residents, they would lead to wider benefits. “It should be possible to achieve while maintaining the same or even improved quality of life, because changes that reduce carbon dioxide emissions often also address inequality, public health, air quality, etc. “For example, encouraging active travel and public transport – that would reduce congestion as well as improving health outcomes by reducing air pollution and increasing uptake of cycling and walking.” The move was inspired by US cities such as Berkeley and Hoboken, and the global C40 cities which have all set ambitious emissions targets. Jonathan Bartley, the co-leader of the Green party, said Bristol’s decision – which won cross-party support on the council – had set “a gold standard on climate action”. “With the UN warning we have just 12 years to limit climate catastrophe this is the common-sense policymaking we need to face the future.”"
"Warmer winters are linked to increased crime rates in parts of the United States, a new study has found. Researchers found that violent crime is almost always more prevalent when temperatures are warmer in the winter months. The trend was especially strong when winters were mild in regions that usually have fierce winters, like the north-east and midwest.  The study has implications for how America reacts to climate change as the promise of a warming climate could therefore lead to rising crime levels. Researchers compared crime and climate data from the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting program and the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration, covering 16,000 cities across the north-east, south-east, south central, west and midwest regions for the study published in GeoHealth. The crime data covered the years 1979 to 2016. “The relationship between climate, human interaction and crime that we’ve unveiled is something that will have an impact on people’s wellbeing,” said Ryan Harp, the lead author of the study and a doctoral candidate in the department of atmospheric and oceanic sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder. The explanation is simple enough: warmer temperatures mean more people are out and about, creating the opportunity for crime. In technical terms, three elements needed for a crime to occur – a motivated offender, a suitable target and the absence of a guardian such as a police officer – are more likely to come together when the weather is decent. The link between warmer temperatures and crime all but disappears during the summer months, the study found. That finding cast doubt on an alternative theory, known as the temperature aggression hypothesis, which holds that heat causes stress which makes people more likely to commit crimes."

"At a recent green innovation event at Imperial College, London, PhD candidate Naomi Pratt and several other students handed out flyers. They were holding elephants on sticks, or “oilophants”, to represent the elephant in the room at the discussion: Imperial’s links with the fossil fuel industry. “Within two minutes we had security guards coming round saying ‘you can’t hand out flyers here, you can’t have this sign. Move along, you’ve made your point,’” Pratt says. Pratt is the leader of Divest Imperial, a group set up to pressure the university to eliminate financial investments in fossil fuel companies from its endowment fund, and reduce its reliance on research funding from the fossil fuel industry. Although their protests are not always shut down, the recent event wasn’t her only experience of being asked to stop flyering in a public part of campus. “It’s a stark example of how Imperial is run as a business, and how it’s trying to control its image,” she says.  Imperial ranks in the bottom tier of People & Planet’s annual sustainability ranking for universities. In response to the poor performance, it produced a report aimed at understanding what had gone wrong. Of the staff and students surveyed for their views, 98% felt the university should be doing more on sustainability and climate change. Pratt sees any concern about the links as window dressing, given that in reality the university “is almost like an extension of the [fossil fuel] industry”. Imperial is proud of its relationships with fossil fuel companies, from which it receives valuable research funding and funded professorships, as well as input into degree programmes that produce the next generation of oil and gas engineers. In addition to questioning Imperial’s relationships with the industry, Pratt is troubled by their access to students and the campus. Fossil fuel companies make regular appearances at careers fairs, and some courses have mandatory field trips sponsored by the oil and gas sector. “They have an almost ubiquitous presence on campus,” she says. “You hear students repeating industry lines back to you: ‘we’re going to need fossil fuels for x amount of years, it’s important to have an energy mix.’” Imperial is not alone, though its strength in science means it’s considered to have some of the deepest links with the industry. Cambridge University received an estimated £1.9m – or 0.4% of its total funding – from oil and gas companies in 2016, according to research by the Zero Carbon Cambridge campaign group. Other universities, including Aberdeen, Oxford, Warwick and Sheffield, are known to have similar ties. Can universities justify these relationships? Imperial says it works with industrial partners to find “solutions to the world’s need for energy”, alongside research aimed at reducing the environmental impact of fossil fuels – through carbon capture and storage, for example, or battery technology and solar cells. It defends its investments as enabling its endowment to better invest in research and education. But the fossil fuel industry is under increasing pressure following a recent UN report, which criticised its efforts to limit climate breakdown. The report warns that the world needs a 45% cut to carbon pollution by 2030 to limit the temperature rise to 1.5C. Recent protests by climate activists in London have ramped up in its wake. Chris Saltmarsh, a co-director at People & Planet, says that although fossil fuel divestment has been the most successful student environmental campaign, there is growing concern about universities’ wider links with the fossil fuel industry. “Students are saying these companies need to be challenged – do they deserve any space on our campuses at all?” he says. “We don’t think it’s right for universities to be profiting from or investing in companies driving the climate crisis.” Part of the reason the movement hasn’t gained the same traction as divestment, in Saltmarsh’s view, is that fossil fuel relationships can be hard to map, and are in some cases “deliberately opaque”.  “It would take a policy shift on a governmental or supra-governmental level to outlaw fossil fuel companies from research partnerships,” he says. “We would argue that all public research institutions and any other companies investing in research for the public good shouldn’t be associating themselves with fossil fuel. Any relationship is either profiting them directly or bulking up their reputation so that they can continue to extract.” The picture is similar in the US, where Ben Franta, a PhD student at Stanford University, is working on a study mapping how much research is funded by the oil and gas industry. He believes there has been an “invisible colonisation of academia” by fossil fuel companies. “I think that most people are still largely unaware of the pervasiveness of oil industry funding in academia, especially for climate and energy research,” he says. “The full picture of the ubiquity of this funding is not really known yet.” Like Pratt, Franta cut his teeth in the divestment movement. It was only when he observed that professors who were vocal against divestment often received funding from the oil and gas industry that he realised how insidious these relationships can be. He sees it as only a matter of time before campaigns start to target research funding and the visibility of oil and gas companies on campus. “One of the amazing things about this whole story is that all this has happened without anyone really knowing about it,” Franta says. “When most people hear about this situation they’re pretty shocked by it. They think: ‘this doesn’t make sense – it’s like tobacco funding health research, there’s a clear conflict of interest here.’” Among academics, attitudes are conflicted. James Dyke, a visiting environmental sciences academic at Southampton University, is a staunch advocate of the need for radical action to slow down climate change. Yet he acknowledges the defences of fossil fuel relationships that some colleagues offer. These companies are aware of the significance of climate change, but the global economy would collapse if they stopped producing overnight. Equally, they plug serious gaps in research funding, without which some departments would be forced to close. “Universities should ideally be places to work with those companies to allow them to transform,” Dyke says. “Walking away and taking the moral high ground – ‘we won’t take your money’ - means cutting off what could be a critical player in the required transition.” The problem is that fossil fuel companies aren’t working towards the transition to a lower carbon economy in any meaningful way. According to Mat Hope, editor of environmental investigative journalism website DeSmog, much of the money from the oil and gas industry goes towards funding research that will help companies continue to operate in the North Sea region for many more years – by drilling in deeper and more treacherous waters, for example. “This is despite climate scientists explicitly stating that the industry will have to be rapidly shut down,” he says. Hope sees the support for universities from fossil fuel companies as part of a deliberate strategy to soften their image. “They are trying to become an integral part of the economics of higher education as a means to encourage a favourable tax environment, and ensure ongoing local and national government support for the industry,” he says. “All despite the UK’s climate commitments.”"
"George Monbiot’s observations (The Earth is in a death spiral. The only hope is radical action, 14 November) are well worth reading and thought-provoking. At one point he writes: “Academics, afraid to upset their funders, have bitten their lips.” There are exceptions. Keith Kahn-Harris’s book Denial: The Unspeakable Truth ought be compulsory reading for every university student of English, history and moral philosophy. He seems an academic who has definitely not bitten his lip, but sought to penetrate a fog of lies perpetuated by denialists: those who shout down and treat with contempt the historians and scientists who have sought the truth and presented us with their findings.  Climate change denialists dredge up countless explanations for floods and fires. Donald Trump blames “poor forest management” for the conflagrations in California that have killed many people.  Monbiot and Kahn-Harris ought to be on the reading lists of all of us who seek to understand truths about the planet that we share with fellow human beings, animals and plants.Penelope MaclachlanLondon • We applaud the Committee on Climate Change’s recommendations to shift land use from inefficient food production towards restoring forests and other climate-critical landscapes (Tree planting in UK ‘must double to tackle climate change’, 15 November).

"How is it possible to live with despair? If, in the wake of last month’s horrifying UN report on global warming, you’ve been asking yourself this question, take some solace (or at least solidarity) from the knowledge that you’re not alone. Jonathan Franzen has been grappling with it for years, and as the final-countdown title of his new volume of essays suggests, his despair at the state of the planet and our absolute inability (“political, psychological, ethical, economic”) to save it is, if anything, deepening. “I don’t have any hope that we can stop the change from coming,” he says bluntly at the conclusion of his opening essay, and nothing in the following pages suggests he is anywhere close to changing his mind. But by refusing to hope for the impossible, Franzen, improbably, manages to produce a volume that feels, if not hopeful, then at least not hopeless. There’s nothing he can do – there’s probably nothing any of us can do – to avert or even alleviate the coming catastrophe. But for now, he’s here and he’s alive, and over the course of these essays he offers us a series of partial, tentative answers to the question he poses himself at the beginning: “How do we find meaning in our actions when the world seems to be coming to an end?” This is not a collection that wastes time attempting to persuade us of the reality of the climate crisis; frankly, we’re way past that. “Drastic planetary overheating,” Franzen assures us, “is a done deal” – and by the way, we need to revise significantly upward our definition of what “drastic” means. The notional two-degree figure widely cited by politicians as the upper limit of what we, and the planet, could possibly accommodate is a line we’re on course to gallop past in just a few years’ time. By 2100, we may well be looking at a five or six-degree temperature rise, and even then there’s a possibility we’re being lowballed. “The scientist who confidently predicts a five-degree warming by the end of the century,” Franzen suggests, towards the end of the collection, “might tell you in private, over beers, that she really expects it to be nine.” It’s a body blow moment in a book that declines to pull its punches, and Franzen acknowledges that many of his readers – “the people for whom the prospect of a hot, calamity-filled future is unbearably sad and frightening” – might be “forgiven for not wanting to think about it”. But over the course of these essays, he succeeds in demonstrating that resignation brings with it a curious intellectual freedom. His acknowledgment that the macro problem is beyond him allows him to start thinking more creatively about micro solutions: what can be achieved here, now, today. Naturally, there’s another way to read his position. Viewed through the other end of the telescope, Franzen’s acceptance of the coming crisis could be seen as an abdication of responsibility: resignation in terms of action, rather than comprehension; a ducking of the issue that’s just a left-liberal version of the US president’s fatuous claim that the climate will “change back”. It’s an accusation to which Franzen is acutely sensitive, not least because it has been levelled at him before. In the collection’s opening piece, “The Essay in Dark Times”, published as “Is it too Late to Save the World?”, what begins as a fascinating consideration of the role of the essay at a moment of objective peril evolves, via a circuitous route that takes in quitting smoking, birdwatching in Ghana and Trump’s election, into a critical rereading of another essay (“Save What You Love”, also collected here) that he wrote for the New Yorker, some two-and-a-half years earlier. That one was triggered by his fury at the actions of the National Audubon Society, the US’s foremost organisation for bird conservation. Franzen’s passion for birdwatching is almost as well known as his novels, so to say the Audubon Society was an unlikely target is an understatement. But it was precisely “as a bird-lover” that it attracted his ire. In 2014, the Society had, “with much fanfare”, thrown all its resources into the climate change fight, declaring that global warming was “the number-one threat to the birds of North America”. There’s no question that climate change poses an existential threat in the medium-term, however, “in 2014, the most serious threats to American birds were habitat loss and outdoor cats”. In Franzen’s view, the society’s position was both “narrowly dishonest” and potentially harmful, in that it might discourage people “from tackling solvable environmental problems in the here and now”. He said as much in his essay, was duly denounced as a “climate-change denier”, and retreated in a mixture of shame and regret on the one hand, and injured self-justification on the other. The irony, of course, was that he wasn’t attempting to deny climate change at all: “In fact, I’m such a climate-science accepter that I don’t even bother having hope for the ice caps.” Rather, he was denying that our current piecemeal, unserious attempts to mitigate it will have any consequential effect, and arguing that therefore we might better expend our efforts on conservation projects whose benefits “are immediate and tangible”. Where Franzen perfectly strikes the balance between form, content and voice you know you’re in the presence of a master It’s a complex position, both to articulate and to accept. But it is not, in the years since he first set it out, one that he has backed away from, because it represents the only hope he has left, and the central hope of this collection: that facing the future “honestly, however painful this may be, is better than denying it”. Rather, as these essays show, the conclusion he has come to is that it’s not his position that’s lacking, but his ability to put it across in a way that readers can accept. It’s a challenge to him as a writer: to think harder; to write more clearly and with more sympathy. It’s a question of what the essay, as a form and specifically in his hands, can do. And it’s a challenge to which he rises. This isn’t a flawless collection: there are uneven moments, and occasional longueurs. There are also – and I say this as a bird-lover – a whole lot of birds. They are the animating spirits of the collection, flitting and rustling through the essays, and Franzen ably makes the case both for their hold over him and their symbolic significance (“If you could see every bird in the world, you’d see the whole world”). But as the pages turn and the feathers pile up, it becomes harder and harder to keep the murres, taikos and storm petrels straight in your head – or, finally, to invest too deeply in the differences. Yet there are essays in which the balance between form, content and voice is perfectly struck, and when you reach one of those, it’s clear that you’re in the presence of a master. The opening essay, in which the idea of the essay itself is held up to the light, is a thing of supple, compelling intelligence, and by placing “Save What You Love”, his piece on the Audubon Society, after his retrospective analysis of its weaknesses, he effectively contextualises it, and allows us to read it for what it is: a teasing-out of complex arguments that refuses to reach for satisfying but reductive conclusions. Then there’s the title essay, which comes fittingly at the collection’s close, brings together all of its strands (climate change, humanity, thinking, writing, birds), and is simply a delight. In it, Franzen weaves together, lightly but tightly, two narrative threads: his expedition on a cruise ship to Antarctica, and the life of his uncle Walt, whose unlooked-for bequest paid for the trip. The timelines diverge wildly (the trip takes a couple of weeks; Walt lived to a ripe old age) but by combining them, Franzen expertly shows how they speak to each other. They’re both stories about death: Walt, we learn, “lost his daughter” (in a car crash in her 20s), “his war buddies, his wife, and my mother” before mortality caught up with him; the Antarctic is both a death zone, the literal and metaphorical end of the world, and, thanks to climate change, dying itself. But read on, and we find that the real resonance between the two tales is the urgent case they make for the worth and beauty of life. Walt survived his tragedies, kept faith with the world, and “never stopped improvising”; in Antarctica, Franzen comes face to face with a king penguin in the wild, and finds that it “seemed to me, in itself, sufficient reason not only to have made the journey; it seemed reason enough to have been born on this planet”. It’s the work of a writer at the top of his game – limber and lovely, delivering deep insights with delicacy and grace – and it poignantly makes the only case for climate action that has any chance of succeeding: that there is so much worth living for. “Even in a world of dying,” Franzen concludes, “new loves continue to be born.” • The End of the End of the Earth by Jonathan Franzen (4th Estate, £16.99).

"Twenty-two people have been arrested after protesters daubed the windows of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy in London and blocked passing traffic in an effort to provoke society into action over climate change. One protester climbed above the revolving doors of the main entrance of the building in Westminster and wrote “frack off” in black spray paint, and another sprayed the extinction symbol in red on windows facing traffic on Victoria Street. A spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion, the group that coordinated the demonstration, said their members used spray chalk, which washes off. During the day, protesters superglued themselves to card-entry gates inside the staff entrance to the building, and lay down outside in Victoria Street blocking westbound traffic.  The protest is intended to be the first in a series continuing throughout the week and culminating with a mass civil disobedience action on Saturday, which activists are calling “rebellion day”. ""Frack off"" #extinctionrebellion protester spray paints department for business energy and industrial strategy as they escalate the #ClimateBreakdown demonstration pic.twitter.com/K2FsFDNXPU Dozens of protesters had locked themselves together outside the doors of the BEIS building and others glued themselves to glass. At another entrance, protesters from the group Christian Climate Action could be seen through windows to have entered the lobby of the building and locked themselves to fittings. Bell Selkie, 48, from Wales, sitting glued by her left hand to the door of BEIS, said the effects of climate change were becoming obvious. Bell Selkie, 48, centre, farmer from Wales, locked on and glued to the doors of the department of business, environment and industrial strategy: ""I live on a farm and the harvests are failing and it's very obvious to me that climate change is hitting now.""#extinctionrebellion pic.twitter.com/P0MWndqsLx “The IPCC report in October gave us six to 12 years, and this is known to be a conservative report. If we don’t respond with a war-style effort now we are all fucked, all of us. My heart is breaking and I’ve got to do something, and I’m putting my life on hold,” she said. Some protesters wore high-visibility vests and patches with the words “conscientious protector”. Asked what that meant, one demonstrator, who preferred not to be named, said: “I have a conscience and I’ve never done anything like this before; I have to do something. We have to protect the environment because if we don’t, all the other problems, all the other causes that exist, are pointless. Everything else is pointless.” The Green party peer Jenny Jones came to witness the demonstration after seeing news of it on social media from her office in the House of Lords. She said she backed non-violent direct action. “If we’re not bold then we won’t have a usable planet in the next few decades,” she said. “The fact is we need action, we need it fast. This government has dragged its feet long enough. Whether it’s solar subsidies, making windfarms difficult or even actually supporting things like fracking, this government has actually gone in the wrong direction almost every time. So let’s hope they listen.” Contacts from inside the building said announcements had been made over the internal public address system that entrances and exits were blocked and no one was able to enter or leave the department. In a statement, Extinction Rebellion said: “The UK government, specifically BEIS, is promoting fracking – meeting with fracking companies more than 30 times in the last three years, compared to zero times with anti-fracking groups – despite massive local opposition. “From Preston New Road (665 days now and counting) in Lancashire, to Kirby Misperton in North Yorkshire, to Horse Hill in Surrey, communities are coming together to fight against fracking.” "
"Eighty-five people have been arrested as thousands of demonstrators occupied five bridges in central London to voice their concern over the looming climate crisis. Protesters, including families and pensioners, began massing on five of London’s main bridges from 10am on Saturday. An hour later, all the crossings had been blocked in one of the biggest acts of peaceful civil disobedience in the UK in decades. Some people locked themselves together, while others linked arms and sang songs. By 2pm the blockade of Southwark Bridge had been abandoned and protesters moved from there to Blackfriars Bridge, where organisers said they were soon to move west towards Westminster Bridge. Demonstrators occupied Southwark, Blackfriars, Waterloo, Westminster and Lambeth bridges. The Metropolitan police said all the bridges had since reopened  and that most of the arrests had been for obstruction under the Highways Act. Afterwards, demonstrators gathered in Parliament Square to hear speeches. Roger Hallam, one of the strategists behind the actions, told the Guardian he felt the protest had been fantastic. “This is total prediction stuff, mass participation civil disobedience,” he said. “They can’t do anything about it unless they start shooting people, and presumably they won’t do that.”  The day was due to end with an interfaith ceremony outside Westminster Abbey. The move is part of a campaign of mass civil disobedience organised by a new group, Extinction Rebellion, which wants to force governments to treat the threats of climate breakdown and extinction as a crisis. “The ‘social contract’ has been broken … [and] it is therefore not only our right but our moral duty to bypass the government’s inaction and flagrant dereliction of duty and to rebel to defend life itself,” said Gail Bradbrook, one of the organisers. Alice, 19, from Bristol was one of those blocking Westminster Bridge. “I took the coach at 3am to make sure I didn’t miss it,” she said, “and I’m so glad that I did. It’s a tiny personal inconvenience and, having made it, I get to be part of a rebellion. “This moment will be remembered in the history books, when we finally stopped allowing our leaders to take us over the cliff.” Jenny Jones, the Green party peer, joined the protest on Westminster Bridge. She backed the nonviolent direct action taken by demonstrators. “We are at the point where if we don’t start acting and acting fast we are just going to wipe out our life support system,” she said. “It’s fine to think we are a rich country, the sixth biggest economy in the world, but actually we won’t do any better than anywhere else because climate change will massively affect us too. “Basically, conventional politics has failed us – it’s even failed me and I’m part of the system – so people have no other choice.”  Father Martin Newell said on Blackfriars Bridge: “What brought me here is the climate emergency, the extinction emergency and my faith in God who created all this and whose creation we’re destroying and crucifying … I’m called as a Christian to protect our neighbour who’s being abused.” In the past two weeks more than 60 people have been arrested for taking part in acts of civil disobedience organised by Extinction Rebellion ranging from gluing themselves to government buildings to blocking major roads in the capital. However, those disruptions were eclipsed on Saturday, when organisers say 6,000 people took part in protests. “It is not a step we take lightly,” said Tiana Jacout, one of those involved. “If things continue as is, we face an extinction greater than the one that killed the dinosaurs. I don’t know about you, but I’d rather be a worthy ancestor.” Extinction Rebellion, which cites the civil rights movement, suffragettes and Mahatma Gandhi as inspirations, said smaller events took place in other UK cities as well as overseas on Saturday. Organisers say they are planning to escalate the campaigns from Wednesday, when small teams of activists will “swarm” around central London blocking roads and bridges, bringing widespread disruption to the capital. “Given the scale of the ecological crisis we are facing this is the appropriate scale of expansion,” said Bradbrook. “Occupying the streets to bring about change as our ancestors have done before us. Only this kind of large-scale economic disruption can rapidly bring the government to the table to discuss our demands. We are prepared to risk it all for our futures.” The group is calling on the government to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025 and establish a “citizens assembly” to devise an emergency plan of action similar to that seen during the second world war. On top of the specific demands, organisers say they hope the campaign of “respectful disruption” will change the debate around climate breakdown and signal to those in power that the present course of action will lead to disaster. The group, which was established only a couple of months ago, has raised around £50k in small-scale donations in the past weeks. It now has offices in central London and over the past few months has been holding meetings across the country, outlining the scale of the climate crisis and urging people to get involved in direct action this weekend. “Local groups are setting up across the country and even new groups are seeing around 100 people come to meetings, and we have coaches coming, from Newcastle to Plymouth,” said Rupert Read, a philosophy academic at the University of East Anglia. The campaign hit the headlines a couple of weeks ago when the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams was one of almost 100 academics to come out in favour of it. In a letter published in the Guardian they said: “While our academic perspectives and expertise may differ, we are united on this one point: we will not tolerate the failure of this or any other government to take robust and emergency action in respect of the worsening ecological crisis. The science is clear, the facts are incontrovertible, and it is unconscionable to us that our children and grandchildren should have to bear the terrifying brunt of an unprecedented disaster of our own making.” The civil disobedience comes amid growing evidence of looming climate breakdown and follows warnings from the UN that there are only 12 years left to prevent global ecological disaster. The group is also making international contacts, with 11 events planned in seven countries so far, including the US, Canada, Germany, Australia and France. “To properly challenge the system that is sending us to an early grave we have to be bold and ambitious,” said Read. “Forging new connections across the world and learning from each other.”"
"Veganism, once widely seen as an alternative, if not an extreme, lifestyle, is now in the mainstream. Exactly how many people in the UK have eliminated animal products including dairy and honey from their diets is uncertain. One recent survey suggested there could be as many as 3.5 million vegans in the UK. The Vegan Society offers the much lower figure of 600,000 vegans, which still represents a fourfold increase in four years. But either way, and combined with a big increase in vegetarians and occasional meat-eaters (otherwise known as “flexitarians”), a huge shift in eating habits is under way. This week’s annual food and drink report by the supermarket Waitrose says around a third of people have either cut down on or stopped eating meat altogether. There is more than one explanation for this change in behaviour. More than half of those surveyed by Waitrose said animal welfare was their motivation for changing their diet. The intensive farming and slaughter of livestock has long aroused feelings of regret and distaste in many people who do not object on principle to eating meat. Such feelings, along with concerns around health and sustainability, have led to rising demand for organic and free-range products among those who can afford them. The growing trend towards giving up meat altogether suggests either that the moral objections have spread, that other factors than animal welfare are in play – or, most likely, some combination of both.  These other factors are health and the environment. Expert advice on diet has long focused on a balanced intake of nutrients, and eating more fruit and vegetables and less sugar and fat. There is no simple answer to the question of whether it is healthier to be a carnivore or not. But over the past few years what was once suspected has become official: cured and processed meats can cause bowel cancer, and are classified by the World Health Organization as a group-one carcinogen, alongside tobacco and asbestos. Little wonder, then, that health-conscious people are giving up BLTs. While the health case for vegetarian and vegan diets is inward-looking, the environmental arguments point urgently outwards and forwards in time. Last month a major international study concluded that huge reductions in meat-eating are essential, especially in the western countries that eat most of it, since food production is a big contributor to global warming as well as deforestation, water shortages and pollution from fertilisers. This was one of the main arguments for veganism made by the freelance journalist Selene Nelson in an article this week, after her exchange of emails with Waitrose Food magazine editor William Sitwell led to his resignation. Mr Sitwell had responded to her pitch for a vegan series featuring recipes and tips with a reply that joked he might instead commission a series about “killing vegans” to “expose their hypocrisy”. Since Waitrose is currently promoting new vegan lines, it was unimpressed when these comments ended up in the press. What might have been laughed off in a note to a colleague was poorly judged as a response to a freelancer’s pitch for paid work. Had he thought better of his rudeness and sent a follow-up email, the story might have had a different ending. Vegans, as has been pointed out by Mr Sitwell’s defenders, are not a minority it is a crime to insult. What they are, to those who would rather ignore the peril of rising carbon emissions, is an irritation. To others who share their concerns, they offer a challenge – even an inspiration."

"Fifty Conservative MPs have called on Theresa May to adopt an ambitious target of cutting carbon emissions to net zero before 2050, to show international leadership on climate change and protect British jobs. Former ministers Damian Green, Oliver Letwin and Anna Soubry are among the signatories of the letter to the prime minister, which said that a stronger long-term goal would cut energy bills and improve air quality. The UK is committed to cut emissions by 80% by 2050. But the government recently asked its climate advisers to consider whether a deeper cut is needed in the light of a landmark UN report on the risks posed by global warming. Simon Clarke, the Brexiter Tory MP who organised the letter, said: “By setting a net-zero target before 2050 we can ensure the UK is at the forefront of the zero-carbon technological revolution whilst cementing our status as a global climate leader.” More than 160 MPs have signed the plea to May, including from Labour, the SNP, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and the Green party. Organisers hope to get 100 Tory MPs signed up by the time the government’s advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, reports back next spring. Meeting a goal of net-zero emissions before 2050 would require far-reaching changes beyond those already under way in energy, buildings and transport. But the letter’s signatories argue it would put the UK “at the forefront of the race for investment in clean industries”, and build on a history of “British ingenuity” in science and engineering. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, used his conference speech in September to commit the party to a target of net-zero emissions by the middle of the century. The letter calls for the goal to be met before 2050 but there is no agreed date – WWF said this week that 2045 was possible. The intervention comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the Climate Change Act receiving royal assent on Monday, the same day the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is due to publish a major report on how global warming will affect the UK."

"It’s a stark message from a Nobel-prize winning economist. “We were a very different country 40 years ago,” he says. “The downhill slide has been pretty fast. America, I think, should be an important warning to other countries not to take for granted their institutions. I worry that things in the United States could get much worse.”  Joseph Stiglitz is coming to Australia next week. The renowned economist and Columbia University professor has been awarded the 2018 Sydney peace prize for leading one of the defining public policy discussions of our age – the crisis caused by economic inequality. Stiglitz is credited with pioneering the concept of the “1 per cent”, the idea that the upper 1% of Americans have accumulated so much political power and wealth in recent decades – through voter suppression, gerrymandering, and the corrupting influence of money – that the country’s economy has suffered, and its democracy has been undermined. In 2011, barely two years into Barack Obama’s first presidential term, he warned the political upheavals then roiling countries including Egypt, Tunisia, Libya, Yemen and Bahrain could one day be visited upon the US, but in an American way. Later that year, the Occupy Wall Street protest emerged in Manhattan’s financial district. His 2012 bestselling book The Price of Inequality explained in detail how America had been growing apart, at an increasingly rapid rate. He argued forcefully that the severe inequality in the US was a choice of the country’s leaders: a consequence of their policies, laws and regulations. This month he plotted in Scientific American how inequality had worsened so much over the last 40 years that US democracy was imperilled. “Whereas the income share of the top 0.1% has more than quadrupled and that of the top 1% has almost doubled, that of the bottom 90% has declined,” he wrote. “Wages at the bottom, adjusted for inflation, are about the same as they were some 60 years ago. Wealth is even less equally distributed, with just three Americans having as much as the bottom 50%.” “As more of our citizens come to understand why the fruits of economic progress have been so unequally shared, there is a real danger that they will become open to a demagogue blaming the country’s problems on others and making false promises of rectifying ‘a rigged system’. “We are already experiencing a foretaste of what might happen. It could get much worse.” Stiglitz tells Guardian Australia, in the lead-up to his trip to Australia, that this country has a lot to learn from America. “One of the reasons I wrote [The Price of Inequality] is almost as a warning to other countries,” he says. “Some of the forces attacking what I would call the social order … those who are shortsighted and in the 1%, know that what they want is contrary to what would evolve in a functioning democracy. “Most Americans want a higher minimum wage, they want gun control, they want access to healthcare, they want stronger financial regulation – the polling on some of these issues is, you know, 75% or more – and yet our democracy can’t deliver it. “Those on the other side have to undermine democracy if they’re going to thwart the will of such a large majority, so they undermine it by disenfranchisement and disempowerment.” Stiglitz says the vision of policymakers in the aftermath of the second world war was to draw together a community that had fought together, to help society become more equal. In the 1960s that was reinforced with demands for racial and social and gender justice, to break down further the forces that had long-divided society. “It was a continuation if you looked at it in a grand historical [perspective] where we’d gotten rid of feudalism and hereditary privilege and we were moving step by step to a greater system of social justice,” he says. “That was our vision, with the civil rights movement.” But the election of Donald Trump as president, and a Republican push to further undermine economic equality, mean the old social contract is being further undermined. “Now we have Trump – a misogynist, a racist, a bigot – as president and openly espousing these things, and we have the majority of the Republican party voting for a tax bill that increases inequality and leads more people to have no insurance coverage. It’s further undermining the social contract and [the old] vision.” Stiglitz says he plans to talk about all of these things in Australia, including the problem of climate change – which he says presents the strongest critique of the capitalist system. “It reminds one of Jared Diamond’s story of collapse on Easter Island where they cut down the last tree and there they were, unable to paddle to any other island and they’d destroyed their future,” he says. “We’re doing the same. The magnitude of the dysfunction is unbelievable. And what’s remarkable about it is, some of the work I’ve done has shown the cost to our society of dealing with this is minuscule, at most 2% of GDP, whereas the cost of not dealing with it could be horrendous.” He says any view of a well-managed society would be “why not deal with the threat of climate change?” “Particularly because the way you’d do it would actually stimulate the economy.” Prof Joseph Stiglitz will be in Australia to receive the Sydney peace prize. He will be awarded the prize at the City of Sydney peace prize lecture on 15 November, and speak at the National Press Club in Canberra on 14 November and at the Athenaeum Theatre in Melbourne on 19 November"
"Bill Shorten has unveiled a $15bn program for driving the transformation in Australia’s energy system to low-emissions sources, declaring climate change is no longer an emergency, “it’s a disaster”. The Labor leader unveiled the energy policy reboot on Thursday, repeating an invitation for the Coalition to embrace the national energy guarantee it ditched during the August leadership implosion but also outlining a detailed alternative in the event the pitch for bipartisanship is ultimately rebuffed. Shorten committed to topping up the Clean Energy Finance Corporation to the tune of $10bn and unveiled a new $5bn fund to modernise ageing transmission infrastructure – the ramparts of a 10-year plan to boost the share of renewable energy in the grid and retire coal generation. The funding is off-budget and does not hit the bottom line. The Labor leader said he would use the Australian Energy Market Operator’s integrated system plan as the basis for transforming the energy system, with a Shorten government playing a hands-on role creating renewable energy zones, investing in new generation and transmission infrastructure and also in firming technologies, like batteries and gas peaking plants. Shorten said if he wins the next federal election, the government will fund the transformation through concessional loans, equity and contract-for-difference auction schemes that are already used in some Australian states, and internationally. The Labor leader said potential projects to be underwritten or funded included upgrades to interconnectors, a second connection across Bass Strait assisting Tasmania’s “battery of the nation” project and Snowy 2.0. He said he was also interested in new gas pipeline networks for northern Australia. Labor is proposing an emissions reduction target across the economy of 45% and aims to have renewables achieve a 50% share of the electricity market by 2030. Eight coal-fired power stations are set to close over the next two decades because they have reached the end of their operating life, and Labor’s higher emissions reduction target will drive a faster rationalisation. Shorten unveiled a coal transition plan on Thursday, including a $10m training fund to skill workers in the coal-fired power sector to work in renewable energy, overseen by a Just Transition Authority coordinating the eventual plant closures. There will also be enhanced industrial relations arrangements for displaced coal workers. Labor will insist that power plant operators and coalmine operators participate in pooled redundancy schemes to ensure workers are given offers of employment at a nearby power station or coalmine, subject to enough positions being created. Shorten said the objective of the plan was to build the essential energy infrastructure to power industry and manufacturing, while helping households cut their power bills with more renewables and storage. He said too much time had been lost in the climate and energy wars of the past decade and governments needed to act, not only to safeguard communities against the impact of global warming but also create the industries of the future. “We will only achieve this if we move now,” Shorten said. “You only get one chance to get in on the ground floor. If the politics of the nation gets bogged down for another three or four years of infighting, of inertia … the moment will be missed. “The world is very unforgiving for nations who do not take the opportunities that are presented to them.” Shorten said plans for direct investment in the energy network could “not be hostage to the climate sceptics in the parliament”. “We will act to bring down power prices and to boost these new blue-collar and green-collar industries. And, in a time of rapid economic and industrial change and disruption, only Labor will make it a priority to help workers and communities affected adapt to the transition.” The Coalition on Thursday rebuffed the overture on bipartisanship and limbered up for another election fight over climate and energy policy. The energy minister, Angus Taylor, declared the government would never adopt an emissions reduction target of 45% “and we would never adopt the targets”. Taylor said Labor needed to explain the practical effect of a 45% emissions reduction target in an energy intensive economy like Australia. “If Labor is committed to those targets, they need to explain which businesses are going out of business in Australia,” he said. “They need to explain which cattle, how many cattle are going to go. They need to explain which aluminium smelters and refineries are going to shut. They need to explain which fertiliser factories, which cement factories are going to shut. “The truth is that these targets, these reckless targets, will be a wrecking ball through the economy. We won’t stand for it.”"

"A record slow freeze of many regions of the Arctic this winter is making it harder for pregnant polar bears to find birthing dens. The delayed formation of sea ice during autumn has worried biologists, who fear a first “extirpation event” – the local extinction of a species – may be approaching faster than forecast for the most affected populations. The waters around Svalbard, an archipelago between Norway and the North Pole, have a little over half the average area of ice for this time of year. According to the Norwegian Ice Service, the 172,291 sq km (66,522 sq m) of ice on 14 November was the lowest for this time of year since records began in 1967. October also saw a huge departure from previous trends, particularly in the Barents Sea, which had freakishly warm weather in February and August. Scientists say these shifts, which are caused by the manmade heating of the globe, are disrupting the behaviour of species that depend on thick winter ice, such as narwhals, seals, belugas and polar bears. “We’re restructuring a whole ecosystem. Sea ice is to the Arctic what soil is to the forest. Without sea ice we’ll still have an ecosystem but it won’t include polar bears & many other species,” tweeted the scientist Andrew Derocher, who has studied the bears for 35 years. “It’s sounds like a broken record, reporting record-breaking low sea ice cover in Svalbard. This area has warmed dramatically in recent years. Polar bears here may be the first extirpation event,” he wrote, though he noted that so far the problem was restricted to habitat loss. One of 19 polar bear populations in the Arctic, Svalbard has close to 2,500 individual bears. This number has been stable for the past 15 years, but pressures are growing. Because of the delay in ice formation, bears have to wait longer to hunt for seals, which means they are missing out on an autumn feeding season that is important for them to build up fat. A recent study showed bears survived previous warm periods by gorging on beached whales, but this was unlikely to be enough to cope with the current pace of climate change. Although there has been some ice formation in recent days, it was still the second lowest on record on Thursday. The most immediate concern is for pregnant females, who normally travel across the ice at this time to make maternity dens on Hopen and other islands that are important for reproduction, said Jon Aars of the Norwegian Polar Institute. “Unless sea ice forms within the next few weeks, pregnant females will have to swim,” he said, noting this uses five times as much energy and runs down fat reserves that are important for producing milk and raising cubs. Previous research in other Arctic regions have shown that pregnant females declined in weight and litter sizes went down from 1.8 to 1.6 between 1993 and 2017. Aars said if current climate trends continued bears would struggle, although it was hard to say when the tipping point would be. “In 2000, we didn’t foresee that Svalbard would be ice-free at this time of the year,” he said. “If this continues, there’ll be a threshold where it will be hard for the bears to reproduce. Things can happen fast. I’m not optimistic about whether the bears will survive. If the sea ice disappears, then so will the bears.” An ice-free Arctic is forecast by about 2040."
"Knowingly creating a false impression of the world: this is a serious matter. It is more serious still when the BBC does it, and yet worse when the presenter is “the most trusted man in Britain”. But, as his latest interview with the Observer reveals, David Attenborough sticks to his line that fully representing environmental issues is a “turn-off”. His new series, Dynasties, will mention the pressures affecting wildlife, but Attenborough makes it clear that it will play them down. To do otherwise, he suggests, would be “proselytising” and “alarmist”. His series will be “a great relief from the political landscape which otherwise dominates our thoughts”. In light of the astonishing rate of collapse of the animal populations he features, alongside most of the rest of the world’s living systems – and when broadcasting as a whole has disgracefully failed to represent such truths – I don’t think such escapism is appropriate or justifiable.  It is not proselytising or alarmist to tell us the raw truth about what is happening to the world, however much it might discomfit us. Nor do I believe that revealing the marvels of nature automatically translates into environmental action, as the executive producer of Dynasties claims. I’ve come to believe it can have the opposite effect. For many years, wildlife film-making has presented a pristine living world. It has created an impression of security and abundance, even in places afflicted by cascading ecological collapse. The cameras reassure us that there are vast tracts of wilderness in which wildlife continues to thrive. They cultivate complacency, not action. You cannot do such a thing passively. Wildlife film-makers I know tell me that the effort to portray what looks like an untouched ecosystem becomes harder every year. They have to choose their camera angles ever more carefully to exclude the evidence of destruction, travel further to find the Edens they depict. They know – and many feel deeply uncomfortable about it – that they are telling a false story, creating a fairytale world that persuades us all is well, in the midst of an existential crisis. While many people, thanks in large part to David Attenborough, are now quite well informed about wildlife, we remain astonishingly ignorant about what is happening to it. What makes Attenborough’s comments particularly odd is that they come just a year after the final episode of his Blue Planet II series triggered a massive effort to reduce plastic pollution. Though the programme made a complete dog’s breakfast of the issue, the response demonstrated a vast public appetite for information about the environmental crisis, and an urgent desire to act on it. Since 1985, when I worked in the department that has made most of his programmes, I have pressed the BBC to reveal environmental realities, often with dismal results. In 1995 I spent several months with a producer, developing a novel and imaginative proposal for an environmental series. The producer returned from his meeting with the channel controller in a state of shock. “He just looked at the title and asked ‘Is this environment?’ I said yes. He said, ‘I’ve spent two years trying to get environment off this fucking channel. Why the fuck are you bringing me environment?’” I later discovered that this response was typical. The controllers weren’t indifferent. They were actively hostile. If you ask me whether the BBC or ExxonMobil has done more to frustrate environmental action in this country, I would say the BBC. We all knew that only one person had the power to break this dam. For decades David Attenborough, a former channel controller widely seen as the living embodiment of the BBC, has been able to make any programme he wants. So where, we kept asking, was he? At last, in 2000, he presented an environmental series: State of the Planet. It was an interesting and watchable series, but it left us with nowhere to go and nothing to do. Only in the last few seconds of the final episode was there a hint that structural forces might be at play: “Real success can only come if there’s a change in our societies, in our economics and in our politics.” But what change? What economics? What politics? He had given us no clues. To make matters worse, it was sandwiched between further programmes of his about the wonders of nature, which created a strong impression of robust planetary health. He might have been describing two different worlds. Six years later he made another environmental series, The Truth About Climate Change. And this, in my view, was a total disaster. It told us nothing about the driving forces behind climate breakdown. The only mention of fossil fuel companies was as part of the solution: “The people who extract fossil fuels like oil and gas have now come up with a way to put carbon dioxide back underground.” Apart from the general “we”, the only distinct force identified as responsible was the “1.3 billion Chinese”. That a large proportion of Chinese emissions are caused by manufacturing goods the west buys was not mentioned. The series immediately triggered a new form of climate denial: I was bombarded with people telling me there was no point in taking action in Britain because the Chinese were killing the planet. If Attenborough’s environmentalism has a coherent theme, it is shifting the blame from powerful forces on to either society in general or the poor and weak. Sometimes it becomes pretty dark. In 2013 he told the Telegraph “What are all these famines in Ethiopia? What are they about? They’re about too many people for too little land … We say, get the United Nations to send them bags of flour. That’s barmy.” There had not been a famine in Ethiopia for 28 years, and the last one was caused not by an absolute food shortage but by civil war and government policies. His suggestion that food relief is counter-productive suggests he has read nothing on the subject since Thomas Malthus’s essay in 1798. But, cruel and ignorant as these comments were, they were more or less cost-free. By contrast, you do not remain a national treasure by upsetting powerful vested interests: look at the flak the outspoken wildlife and environmental presenter Chris Packham attracts for standing up to the hunting lobby. I have always been entranced by Attenborough’s wildlife programmes, but astonished by his consistent failure to mount a coherent, truthful and effective defence of the living world he loves. His revelation of the wonders of nature has been a great public service. But withholding the knowledge we need to defend it is, I believe, a grave disservice. • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"

"Hundreds of students around the country are preparing to strike from school because of what they say is a failure by politicians to recognise climate change as an emergency. They’ve been inspired by 15-year-old Greta Thunberg, a Swedish student who has been sitting outside the parliament in central Stockholm to draw attention to the fears younger generations hold about the global climate crisis and the failure of countries to take urgent action.  Fourteen-year-old Milou Albrecht, a year 8 student at Castlemaine Steiner school in Victoria, her classmate Harriet O’Shea Carre, and 11-year-old Callum Bridgefoot from Castlemaine North primary school, started by protesting last week outside of the offices of their local representatives, the Labor MP Lisa Chester and the Nationals deputy leader, Bridget McKenzie. They’ve been joined by 50 students from local schools and are planning weekly events. And what began as a small local protest is growing into a nationwide movement. Students in Melbourne, Sydney, Canberra, Perth, Hobart, the Whitsundays, Lismore, the Gold Coast, Albury-Wodonga and the Sunshine Coast are planning to walk out of classes this month. Similar plans are being explored in other regional areas including Coffs Harbour, Cairns, Townsville and the southern highlands of New South Wales. Hundreds of students have indicated they want to attend protests outside state parliaments in the capital cities on 28, 29 and 30 November. The idea for the strikes came from the Castlemaine students, who contacted the Australian Youth Climate Coalition for help. They have had assistance from the coalition and their parents with contacting media, building a website and spreading the word about the strikes through their social networks. “We think it’s important because it’s a huge problem,” Milou said. “The Earth is already too hot, with droughts in winter in NSW and the coral reef is dying.” She said students were speaking to Greta in Sweden each week. “I would like our politicians to acknowledge climate change is an emergency and take the necessary steps in order to have a sustainable world,” she said. A 14-year-old Fort Street high school student, Jean Hinchliffe, is organising the Sydney walkout on 30 November. She said there was a template letter students who were worried about taking time off class could give to their teachers. “We’ve got involved because at this stage we can’t vote, we’re not politicians and we want to make a difference,” she said. “We can’t stand around waiting. “I think it’s because climate change is scary seeing that it’s our future. This is a fact and not to be debated.”"

"Millions of gas boilers will need to be replaced with hydrogen alternatives and coupled with electric heating devices if Britain is to hit its carbon targets at the lowest cost, according to the government’s climate advisers. In a report on the role hydrogen could play in the energy system, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) spelt out the huge but necessary cost the country faces to switch to green heating.  The cheapest scenario, it said, is a mix of electrifying heating and fitting hydrogen boilers, and will cost the UK £28bn a year, or 0.7% of GDP, by 2050. While electricity supplies are rapidly switching to low-carbon sources, almost all homes today rely on fossil fuels – predominantly natural gas – for heating and cooking. The public is largely unaware of the alternatives, said the report, and consumer understanding is “far from where it would need to be” before decisions on decarbonising heating are made in the 2020s. While householders can keep their radiators, the CCC envisages that in future they will need to live in much more energy efficient homes with heat pumps that use electricity to draw heat from the ground or air, running alongside gas boilers. Air-source heat pumps cost about £6,000-£7,000 but are expected to become cheaper as they become more mainstream. To meet the long-term goal of cutting carbon emissions 80% by 2050, gas boilers would eventually need to be replaced by hydrogen ones that provide backup heating at times. Chris Stark, the chief executive of the CCC, said the committee had previously been a “bit suspicious” of heat pumps but was now confident enough to recommend their rollout as a hybrid heating measure running alongside gas boilers, before a later move to hydrogen too. “I’ve been cautious about the hydrogen story, because it’s often portrayed as a panacea. [But] I’ve been surprised how well it’s come out of our modelling when it’s accompanied by energy efficiency and electrification from heat pumps,” he said. Stark urged the government to set out its plan for decarbonising heat in the next three years. The report said while ministers may have “a strong temptation politically to ‘kick the can down the road’ by sticking with natural gas for longer”, it would be cheaper and better to act sooner. Despite the high costs of decarbonising heating, the CCC believes the total consumers spend on energy bills could stay similar to today, as it expects electricity prices to fall as more is sourced from wind, solar and nuclear, and costs of running a car to become cheaper owing to the switch to electric vehicles. Stark said he was now more optimistic about hydrogen, and that it offered “something in the long-term that we need”. But the CCC said producing hydrogen in a low-carbon way would be a big challenge. Today the vast majority is made from natural gas and is high carbon, but in the future that production would need to involve carbon capture and storage. Producing the hydrogen in bulk using renewable electricity generation and electrolysis was considered “unnecessarily expensive”, said the CCC. It added that evidence showed the use of hydrogen would be increasingly important to cut carbon emissions from industrial processes, such as in furnaces and kilns."
"The main greenhouse gas emissions driving climate change have all reached record levels, the UN’s meteorology experts have reported. Carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide are now far above pre-industrial levels, with no sign of a reversal of the upward trend, a World Meteorological Organization report says.  “The last time the Earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO2 was 3-5m years ago, when the temperature was 2-3C warmer and sea level was 10-20 metres higher than now,” said the WMO secretary general, Petteri Taalas. “The science is clear. Without rapid cuts in CO2 and other greenhouse gases, climate change will have increasingly destructive and irreversible impacts on life on Earth. The window of opportunity for action is almost closed.” Levels of CO2 rose to a global average of 405.5 parts per million in the atmosphere in 2017 – almost 50% higher than before the industrial revolution. Levels of methane, a potent greenhouse gas responsible for about 17% of global warming are now 2.5 times higher than pre-industrial times owing to emissions from cattle, rice paddies and leaks from oil and gas wells. Nitrous oxide, which also warms the planet and destroys the Earth’s protective ozone layer, is now over 20% higher than pre-industrial levels. About 40% of N2O comes from human activities including soil degradation, fertiliser use and industry. The WMO also highlighted the discovery of illicit production of CFC-11, a banned chemical that also both warms the planet and destroys ozone. Investigations indicate that at least some of the production is in China. In October the world’s scientists said global warming of even 1.5C would have severe consequences for humanity. International climate agreements had for two decades set 2C as a limit. “Every fraction of a degree of global warming matters, and so does every part per million of greenhouse gases,” said the WMO deputy secretary general, Elena Manaenkova. “CO2 remains in the atmosphere for hundreds of years and in the oceans for even longer. There is currently no magic wand to remove all the excess CO2 from the atmosphere.” Prof Corinne Le Quéré, of the University of East Anglia, said she was not surprised by the new record levels of greenhouse gases. “But I am very concerned that all three gases most responsible for climate change are rising upwards unabated. It seems the urgency and extent of the actions needed to address climate change have not sunk in. “Low-carbon technologies like wind, solar, and electric transport need to become mainstream, with old-fashioned polluting fossils pushed out rapidly.” Efforts to cut emissions are increasing and on Wednesday the UN’s climate change body published a report on the commitments made in 2018. It found 9,000 cities in 128 countries were taking action, along with 240 states and regions in 40 countries and more than 6,000 businesses in 120 countries. Patricia Espinosa, head of the UN framework convention on climate change, said: “On one hand, greenhouse gas emissions have yet to peak and countries struggle to maintain the concentrated attention and effort needed for a successful response to climate change. On the other hand, climate action is occurring, it is increasing and there is a will to do more. I highlight this because falling into despair and hopelessness is a danger equal to complacency, none of which we can afford.”• This article was corrected on 22 November 2018. An earlier version said that at an average of 405.5 parts per million CO2 levels in recent times were two-and-a-half times higher than before the industrial revolution, and that methane levels were 3.5 times higher. Nitrous oxide levels were said to be at more than double pre-industrial levels."

"Heatwaves severely damage the fertility of male beetles and consecutive hot spells leave them virtually sterilised, according to research. Global warming is making heatwaves more common and wildlife is being annihilated, and the study may reveal a way in which these two trends are linked. The scientists behind the findings said there could also be some relevance for humans: the sperm counts of western men have halved in the last 40 years.  Researchers studied beetles because their 400,000 species represent about a quarter of all known species. Insect populations are plunging worldwide as temperatures rise, falling by about 80% in 30 years in Puerto Rico’s rainforest and by 75% in German nature reserves. Insects are such an integral part of life, as pollinators and prey, that scientists say their decline could lead to “ecological Armageddon”. Little is known about the precise causes of the decline, though climate change, habitat destruction and global use of pesticides are considered probable factors. The research, published in the Nature Communications journal, found that exposing beetles to a five-day heatwave in the laboratory reduced sperm production by three-quarters; females were unaffected. “Beetles are thought to constitute a quarter of biodiversity, so these results are very important for understanding how species react to climate change,” said Kris Sales, at the University of East Anglia, who led the work. Other research has shown that heat can damage male reproduction in humans as well as cows, sheep and other mammals. “There could be relevance for human fertility,” said Prof Matt Gage, co-leader of the UEA research group. “The paradox is that one of the reasons the climate is warming up and we are having more heatwaves is there are too many humans. So maybe this is a leveller.” Stuart Wigby, of the University of Oxford, who was not involved in the study, said: “Given what we already know about the generality of the sensitivity of sperm to heat, there is every reason to expect that similar effects would be seen in other insects and also in mammals including humans.” The red flour beetle used in the experiments is a tropical species that thrives at 35C. When exposed to temperatures of 5C and 7C higher, male fertility plummeted. While these were high temperatures, 90 countries had experienced them in recent years, said Gage. After being exposed to a heatwave, the number of offspring produced by males fell by half. Even more worryingly, harmful effects were inherited by the males they produced – their lives were 20% shorter and they in turn produced fewer offspring. The most extreme impact was in male beetles exposed to two heatwaves 10 days apart – their offspring production fell by 99%. “It kind of wipes them out,” Gage said. Sales added: “Insects in nature are likely to experience multiple heatwave events, which could become a problem for population productivity if male reproduction cannot adapt or recover.” Further experiments are under way to find out whether the beetles can adapt to heat shocks and to examine how other species, such as butterflies, cope with raised temperatures. The research is among the first of its type on cold-blooded creatures. “There is a big gap, as most of life on Earth is cold-blooded and it is much more directly affected by temperature variations,” Gage said. “We’ve shown that sperm function is an especially sensitive trait when the environment heats up, and in [species] representing a huge amount of global biodiversity.” How the heat damages the sperm is not fully understood, though the researchers noticed damage to sperm membranes. It is likely that the DNA in the sperm is also damaged, meaning harm can be passed to offspring. Most warm-blooded male animals protect sperm from excessive heat by having testes outside the body, leaving them several degrees cooler. Wigby said the understanding of factors that reduced male fertility was poor. “So any studies that add to our understanding of the basic mechanisms underlying variation in male fertility is valuable. Showing that the harm can occur in a heatwave-like scenario is new and important, as is the demonstration of transgenerational effects. However, the applicability to the real world is always an issue for lab studies.”"

"Democrats don’t have a plan to address climate change comprehensively – or even to a significant degree – if they regain control of the US government in the near future, despite criticizing Republicans as the party of pollution. After failing to get conservatives on board to limit planet-warming gases through legislation or regulation, Democratic leaders in Washington are now wary of wading into another tough political fight, despite an intensifying environmental crisis.  If Democrats win back the House in Tuesday’s midterm elections, their strategy is to hold oversight hearings on Donald Trump’s environmental rollbacks and pursue more incremental and popular measures, according to close observers and a senior Democratic aide. Environmental advocates hoping progressive politicians will lead efforts to save the planet may be shocked to learn there’s no wide-ranging strategy or headline-grabbing legislation waiting to be unveiled – even if Democrats take the White House in 2020. The party’s efforts as currently planned won’t be enough to spur the rapid transformation in how society operates that leading scientists say is needed to spare humanity from the worst of rising temperatures, extreme weather and massive societal and economic disruptions. But few in the party – or the big environmental groups that traditionally support it – are prepared to admit this outright. “Obviously, a transformative government response to climate is clearly needed based on what we’re seeing from science. We have about 10 years left to really be doing something, but it’s hard [for us] to do because the Republican party is largely in denial on this,” said Congressman John Delaney, a Maryland Democrat running for president in 2020. Congressman Ted Deutch, the Florida Democrat and cofounder of the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus in the House, said he’s not “rosy eyed” that Democrats in the majority could get Republicans to reverse their stances on the environment and climate. “But I’m also not a cynic,” Deutch said. “I don’t reject the possibility of a major piece of legislation, and I think it’s possible to put together a bipartisan bill.” Democrats have a decent chance of winning a majority in the House of Representatives in the 6 November midterm elections this year, while the Republicans are predicted to keep control of the Senate. A senior Democratic aide familiar with the party’s policy blueprints was resigned to the situation. The aide said it doesn’t make sense for the House to work on legislation that Republicans in the Senate will never take up. The source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the issue is politically sensitive, said Democrats will instead try to encourage infrastructure projects to prepare communities for climate change and invest in green power.The source said “increasing public awareness will be a huge part of an eventual solution” and that Democrats hope to lay that groundwork. But the current leadership isn’t considering anything like the contentious cap on greenhouse gases that Democrats pushed for in 2009 or a tax on industry for carbon pollution. The aide said Republicans have “demonized” attempts to slow climate change, making the issue politically intractable. That is despite almost daily reports of melting glaciers, dying wildlife and worsening storms in the US and across the globe.Democrats don’t only fear futile battles over legislation with Republicans. They also are wary of turning moderate Americans against the party if climate solutions raise the cost of living. George David Banks, a former Trump White House energy and climate adviser, said Democrats aren’t planning any major legislation because they are “still dealing with the fallout from the failure of Waxman-Markey”. Democrats have twice tried and failed to take major steps on climate change. In 2009 when they controlled Congress and the White House, the House passed the controversial “Waxman-Markey” proposal to cap greenhouse gases, but the Senate never took it up following a massive lobbying campaign against it that included ads warning of higher gasoline prices. After that defeat, the Environmental Protection Agency in 2015 finalized a rule for power companies to burn less coal. But the supreme court halted it and Trump’s administration is in the process of rolling it back. Progressive environmental advocates say Democratic leaders, including Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, aren’t thinking big enough now. “What I worry about is that Pelosi is going to get bogged down with oversight and is going to introduce a bunch of small-bore tax credit bills,” said RL Miller, the cofounder of the grassroots-focused advocacy group Climate Hawks Vote. Miller cautioned that while smaller federal efforts and states’ work to limit climate pollution are good, the US will still need to make big changes across every sector of its economy. Polling shows that while a majority of Americans care about climate change, few rank the environment as the most important problem. “What I expect Democrats to do is not what I hope Democrats would do,” she said. While 72% of voters backing Democrats see climate change as a “very big” problem, only 11% of those supporting Republicans do, according to the Pew Research Center, making any consensus extremely difficult.  But Sarah Hunt, the cofounder of the Joseph Rainey Center for Public Policy, who works with conservatives on climate efforts, said Democrats should offer an “alternative vision”, even if they don’t think it would succeed with Trump in the White House. Elan Strait, the World Wildlife Fund’s US climate campaigns director, argued the action just isn’t in Washington. “There’s no cigar back room where people are hammering out a climate deal because that’s not where the movement is right now … the movement really is at the city and state level,” he said, despite reports that local action isn’t enough. The carbon tax method, to charge businesses and their customers for greenhouse gas pollution, recently won a Nobel prize but currently has limited support in Washington, despite multiple proposals from some Democrats and Republicans. For now, the US policies under discussion do not come close to matching what science requires. Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University, said she is “not aware of any comprehensive plan that would accomplish what the US needs to do” to meet the commitments it made to other countries in the Paris climate agreement, which is meant to keep warming to 2C but is not on track to succeed. “I want to see action, and so far there has been precious little of it,” Hayhoe said."
"More than a year after the US Environmental Protection Agency took down information on climate change from its website for an “update”, it now seems uncertain whether it will ever reappear. In April last year, the EPA replaced its online climate change section with a holding page that said the content was being updated to “reflect the agency’s new direction under President Donald Trump”.  Information previously found at epa.gov/climatechange made it clear that human activity was warming the planet, resulting in harm to Americans’ health as well as crucial ecosystems on which humans depend. The “update” page has now given way to a page that simply states: “We want to help you find what you are looking for.” Below, there are links to search other areas of the EPA website, as well as to an archived “snapshot” of the site from the day before Trump became president in January 2017. The switch was observed by the Environmental Data & Governance Initiative, which tracks changes in government websites. “It’s an embarrassment. It is a ghost page,” said Judith Enck, who was EPA regional administrator during Barack Obama’s presidency. “It’s a bit like Amazon not allowing the public to order books via its website – it’s that fundamental. There’s no other issue at the EPA more important than climate change; it affects air, water, health and whether large parts of the world will survive.” Scott Pruitt, a climate change skeptic who was Trump’s pick as EPA administrator until he resigned in July amid a long-running ethics scandal, repeatedly questioned basic scientific understanding of climate change while he headed the agency, such as whether carbon dioxide is a primary driver of planetary warming. The EPA under the Trump administration has attempted to roll back all key measures designed to address climate change, such as limits on pollution from coal plants, rules to prevent methane emissions from oil and gas drilling and tighter fuel efficiency standards for cars. Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist who is now acting EPA administrator, has said “federal regulations are not necessary to drive greenhouse gas reductions”. A senior EPA official, who asked not to be named, said: “Wheeler has been somewhat meticulously going through the mess Pruitt left behind and I think is finally getting to the place of making some decisions on stuff.” The official added: “I’ve been surprised that we are still even talking about climate change and that there are still people nominally assigned to that beat in the air office.” Enck said that EPA career staff are “frustrated” and “ashamed” about the new stance on climate change and urged her former colleagues to speak out. The administration also began taking the ax to climate change language across other government websites in the spring of 2017. “The EPA website is used by decision and policy makers, not just for high school student assignments,” she said. “The lack of timely, accurate information is part of a much deeper problem that the agency is on the sidelines of the most urgent environment issue of our time.” The EPA was contacted for comment."
"How to push green issues up the political agenda is a question that has exercised environmentalists for decades. Do dark warnings about the world that awaits us if we do not curtail carbon emissions and protect forests and oceans motivate people to act, or scare them off? Are apocalyptic visions such as that in Cormac McCarthy’s novel The Road what we need to open our minds, or an inducement to give up trying? Opinion is divided, as events of the past week have illustrated. In advance of his latest wildlife television series, Dynasties, David Attenborough said at the weekend that too many warnings about endangered species are a “real turn-off”. A few days earlier, the activist group Extinction Rebellion launched a campaign of civil disobedience by demanding a zero-carbon economy by 2025. Writing in advance of a protest in London that saw 15 people arrested, Green MEP Molly Scott Cato said she and others have been driven to break the law after spending years ringing alarm bells and being ignored.  Influenced by thinkers including Charles Eisenstein and Erica Chenoweth, whose ideas about peaceful protest have also been taken up by opponents of President Trump, and with a commitment to grassroots organising that is similar to 350.org (the anti-fossil-fuel organisation launched in the US by Bill McKibben in 2007), Extinction Rebellion aims to foment a mass movement that will change history. Elected politicians, goes the argument, have failed, as have businesses and other organisations including environmental charities. Carbon emissions and biodiversity loss are out of control. The “unimaginable horrors” of unchecked warming and habitat destruction mean more radical tactics are called for – and morally justified by the dangers, in the eyes of protesters. While the current focus on the extinction crisis is novel, and a contrast to more familiar warnings about emissions, the notion that environmental activism encompasses lawbreaking is not new. The Green party of England and Wales approves of civil disobedience in the statement of underlying principles known as its “philosophical basis”. Greenpeace has engaged in nonviolent direct action alongside the traditional NGO tools of lobbying and petitions since the 1970s. Activists have used occupations and blockades as techniques in protests against road-building, airports and coal-fired power stations. They have also mounted protests against sponsorship by oil companies in museums. Most recently, attempts to frack in Lancashire have been disrupted by protesters, three of whom were freed from prison last month after successfully appealing against sentences that judges found to be “manifestly excessive”. The heightened language of emergency and breakdown employed by this new grouping will not appeal to everyone. Nor is it intended to. It is rational to be sceptical about whether the protesters will achieve their aims. But on the basis of the most recent warnings about rising temperatures and species decline, and chancellor Philip Hammond’s failure to mention climate change at all in last week’s budget, it is not rational to deny that they are justified in rebelling against the government’s inaction. Their sense of urgency is welcome."

"Climate action is way off course in all but one of the world’s 20 biggest economies, according to a report that shows politicians are paying more heed to the fossil fuel industry than to advice from scientists. Among the G20 nations 15 reported a rise in emissions last year, according to the most comprehensive stock-take to date of progress towards the goals of the Paris climate agreement. The paper, by the global partnership Climate Transparency, found 82% of energy in these countries still being provided by coal, oil and gas, a factor which has relied on an increase of about 50% in subsidies over the past 10 years to compete with increasingly cheap wind, solar and other renewable energy sources. The G20 nations spent $147bn (£114bn) on subsidies in 2016, although they pledged to phase them out more than 10 years ago. Governments have said they will change, but on current commitments the world is on course for a 3.2C rise in average global temperatures, more than double the lower Paris threshold of 1.5C, which scientists have said represents the last chance to save coral reefs, the Arctic ecosystem and the wellbeing of hundreds of millions of people at risk of increased drought, flooding and forest fires. “The gap is still very big,” said Jan Burck, one of the authors of the report. “The G20 is not moving fast enough.” Comparing the goals and policies of different countries, the paper found that only India was on course to stay below the upper limit set by the Paris agreement of 2C, while the worst offenders – Russia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey – would take the world beyond 4C. China, the world’s biggest emitter, stabilised its releases of carbon for a couple of years by reducing dependency on coal, but this positive trend slipped last year. Indonesia, Brazil and Argentina have promised to cut deforestation but the destruction rate of forests shows no sign of reversing. Britain has made the fastest transition, with a 7.7% decline in the use of fossil fuels between 2012 and 2015, but the report warned that this could stall in the years ahead because the government had cut support for feed-in tariffs, energy efficiency and zero-carbon homes. The authors said political pressures in the G20 countries, with more subsidies for fossil fuels, were working against effective climate action. “There is a huge fight by the fossil fuel industry against cheap renewables. The old economy is well organised and they have put huge lobbying pressure on governments to spend tax money to subsidise the old world,” Burck said. These political pressures are likely to intensify as governments are called upon to extend emissions cuts to the transport and agriculture sectors. The report said G20 emissions needed to start declining in the next two years and halve by 2030 if the world were to avoid more than 1.5C of warming, though not one country in the group had set a credible target to do this. The UN climate talks in Katowice, Poland, in December –the COP24 conference – will start a two-year process for governments to deliver on their commitments to reduce emissions. Although there are national leaders hostile to tackling climate change, such as in the US and Brazil, there is still hope they will be open to taking their share of the responsibility. Christiana Figueres, former executive secretary of the UN framework convention on climate change, said: “Global emissions need to peak in 2020. The Brown-to-Green report provides us with an independent stock-take on where we stand now. This is valuable information for countries when they declare their contribution in 2020.” • This article was amended on 14 November 2018. An earlier version included figures from the report that were corrected after publication, when it said that fossil fuel subsidies in G20 countries have doubled between 2007 and 2016, from $75bn (£58bn) to $147bn (£114bn). The two figures were not comparable, because the 2007 figure did not include data for all G20 countries included in the 2016 figure. The increase over the past 10 years is about 50%, not double. In addition, an earlier version misspelled Jan Burck’s last name as Buerck. This has been corrected."

"Plans to build a huge new UK gas power station are facing a challenge from an environmental law group that argues the project would breach the government’s recommendations on climate change. ClientEarth, which has repeatedly defeated the government in court over its air pollution strategy, has submitted an objection to the planning inspectorate over Drax Group’s proposed 3.6GW plant in North Yorkshire.  The intervention is the first by the lawyers against a gas project in the UK. Sam Hunter Jones, a lawyer at the group, said it had acted because the Drax scheme marked a tipping point in the amount of new gas planned by energy firms in the UK. The UK has already given planning approval for 15GW-worth of large-scale gas plants, including at Eggborough, which is not far from the Drax site. Adding the Drax project would take the total to about 18GW, three times the 6GW of new gas the government estimates the country will need up to 2035. Hunter Jones said: “The UK government claims to be a climate leader, yet if major energy projects such as this from Drax are granted planning consent, the UK will risk carbon lock-in that would seriously undermine its ability to meet its climate change commitments.” The planning inspectorate is expected to make its recommendations to the government next spring, with ministers to decide later in the year. ClientEarth believes it has grounds for success under national policy statements that planners have to consider, which say such a major project’s impact must not outweigh its benefits. The group’s written submission said approval risked making the UK’s future decarbonisation significantly more difficult and expensive. Drax said future energy scenarios in the UK indicated the country would need more gas plants in the future to fill in the gaps around wind and solar power. The company also said that building the gas project would enable it to turn off its two remaining coal units in 2023, two years before the government’s coal phase-out deadline of 2025. Andy Koss, Drax Power’s CEO, said: “Our Repower project will deliver cost-effective, high-efficiency, flexible gas power to the grid. By reusing some of our existing infrastructure, including the grid connection and cooling towers, the development will be cost-effective and very competitive.”"
"The National Trust has invested tens of millions of pounds in oil, gas and mining firms – despite the conservation charity pledging to cut down its own use of fossil fuels and warning about the impact of climate change. An investigation by the Guardian has found that the trust – which aims to “nurse the environment back to health” – has more than £30m of investments in oil, gas and mining companies, including BP and Shell, held indirectly via a portfolio fund.  The trust has vowed to decrease its own use of fossil fuels across its estates in England, Wales and Northern Ireland in response to climate change, aiming to generate 50% of its energy from renewable sources by 2020. Hilary McGrady, the director-general of the trust, which has more than five million members and 61,000 volunteers, has previously said: “We are playing our part by ensuring we reduce our dependency on fossil fuels and at every property we are constantly looking at ways to seek out energy efficiencies.” A 2015 report by the trust warned: “It is abundantly clear to us from across the breadth of places we look after that the impacts of climate change are already increasing, and are a worrying threat to the fragile and venerable places of natural and historic importance that we care for.” The trust also opposes fracking, not allowing it on its 248,000 hectares of land, “because natural gas is a fossil gas”. However, it has millions of pounds invested through the fund in BP and Shell, both of which have fracking operations. In July, BP invested $10.5bn buying US shale assets from the mining company BHP Billiton. Fracking, which involves drilling into the earth before a high-pressure water mixture is used to break shale rock and release oil or gas, is highly controversial because of concerns over its environmental impact. Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP for Brighton Pavilion, has urged the trust to divest from fossil fuels. She said: “It’s disappointing to see a charity so dedicated to protecting our natural heritage undermining its good work with significant support for dirty fossil fuels. We are living through climate breakdown and ecological collapse – every organisation with money to invest must stop funding environmental destruction. “I’ve been working to persuade parliament to stop investing MPs’ pensions in fossil fuels for years, so I understand this is an uphill battle – but environmental charities should be leading the way. The National Trust must urgently set out a clear path to divesting these funds and supporting firms that make a positive contribution to society instead.” Mary Creagh, the Labour MP for Wakefield who chairs the environmental audit select committee, said: “Members of the National Trust will be shocked to learn about the scale of the charity’s investments in fossil fuels. My committee has highlighted the financial risks from climate change, and called on large companies to report on their exposure to climate risk. “National Trust must ‘green check’ its investments, and invest in the low-carbon and sustainable technologies of tomorrow.” The trust’s 2018 accounts show that it has £166.7m invested in Legal & General Investment Management’s CAF UK Equitrack Fund, up from £164.9m in 2017. As of July, the fund invested 8.89% of its portfolio in Royal Dutch Shell shares and 4.47% in BP. In addition, the fund has holdings in mining firms including 1.93% of the portfolio in Rio Tinto, 1.53% in Glencore and 1.44% in BHP Billiton. With at least 18.2% of the fund’s portfolio invested in oil, gas and mining firms, it means the trust indirectly invests in them to the tune of £30.3m. In 2010, BP was responsible for the worst environmental disaster in US history when the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico exploded, killing 11 people. A US judge ruled that BP was “grossly negligent” in the lead-up to the spill, in which an estimated 4.9m barrels of oil leaked into the Gulf. Earlier this year it was reported that BP was nearing the end of paying out $65bn (£50.6bn) in compensation. The trust looks after 780 miles of coastline, and more than 500 historic sites including houses, castles, ancient monuments, gardens, parks and nature reserves, as well as the land. It has an investment pool of £1.3bn, meaning the Legal & General fund accounts for roughly 13% of the total. In 2015, the charity said it was reviewing its investments in fossil fuels. A National Trust spokesman said: “It’s important to clarify we do not invest in the ‘fossil fuels and mining’ companies, but in the CAF UK Equitrack Fund, which is a UK equity index tracking fund run for charities. “We adopt a policy of not investing directly in companies which derive more than 10% of their turnover from the extraction of thermal coal or oil from oil sands. We also engage with companies to improve their environmental performance and see our role as one of actively influencing behaviour and driving environmental improvements.” • The headline on this article was amended on 19 November 2018 to more accurately reflect the story."
"Climate activists have caused serious disruption to rush-hour traffic in London with a series of “swarming” roadblocks at several different locations around the capital as police warned motorists that more protests were expected. From 8am on Wednesday groups of protesters coordinated by the group Extinction Rebellion walked on to roads in Westminster, Tower Bridge, Elephant and Castle, and Earl’s Court, blocking traffic for several minutes at a time in a plan to bring gridlock to the city. The Metropolitan police said that protests could continue until Saturday and advised against driving into the city. The Met also warned people that attempting to drive through the demonstrations was “very dangerous and illegal”. On the 22-24 Nov, there will be protests across London that may result in delays to your journey. We advise not to travel by car or motorbike. If you do drive into London please note attempting to drive through protestors in the road is very dangerous and illegal A spokesperson for Transport for London said Wednesday’s protests had caused serious disruption to traffic and buses. The action was met by an ambivalent response from some members of the public on their way to work, but others said they backed the demonstrations. The protests are part of a campaign of mass civil disobedience organised by Extinction Rebellion, which wants to force governments to treat the threats of climate change and species extinction as a crisis. As traffic began to back up around London, the group sent a letter to the business secretary, Greg Clark, outlining their demands. “We are writing to let you know that we intend to continue our support for rebellion against the UK government,” their letter said. “We would like to meet with you at your earliest convenience to work out ways in which you can exercise your responsibility as secretary of state to protect the ecosystems and people of this country.” Ronan McNern, a protest organiser and a signatory to the letter, said the plan was to cause as much disruption as possible with the smallest numbers. “The lights go red, they go into and sit down in the road, wait seven minutes,” he said. “If anybody needs to get past, we’ll let them through. Come off after seven minutes, take a break, let the angry drivers at the front go, then the light goes red and you go on again. “This is about causing economic disruption by slowing things down, bringing things to a gridlock. This is an experiment, really. I think that’s the most important word.” The Guardian met one group of about 35 protesters by the statue of Nelson Mandela at Parliament Square at 7am, then followed the group as they walked to the south end of Lambeth Bridge, the site of one of central London’s busiest junctions. Just before 8am they walked out into the road, chanting and carrying banners and placards. Traffic was soon backed up far down Albert Embankment, Lambeth Palace Road and Lambeth Road, as motorists found the way over the Thames blocked. Cars sounded their horns and one driver got out to remonstrate with police monitoring the protesters. Officers told him to be patient. Another passerby, who asked police why they could not clear the roadblock, was told the activists had a right to protest. “You’re part of the problem and all,” he shouted back at them. Demonstrators then moved on to Vauxhall Bridge and then Victoria Street, where they continued their rolling blockades. They allowed cyclists and emergency vehicles with blue lights to go past. At one point the comedian Jim Davidson became caught up in the demonstration and got out of his car to remonstrate with police for not forcing the protesters to move. Jim Davidson was stuck at the front - got out of his car shouted at the Police “Why aren’t you moving them?” - when a protestor tried to talk to him he said he didn’t talk to lefties. One gag: “Climate change ? Don’t they like being warmer!!” . pic.twitter.com/tOyNikdcvG James Page, 46, a decorator who stopped to watch a blockade close to Victoria, said he “couldn’t give a damn” about climate change. “It [the climate] all balances out,” he said. “It’s shown from time it balances itself out. It’s not something I would be bothered about anyway.” At Elephant and Castle, a major junction linking south London to the City financial district, protesters’ numbers were bolstered after lunch by the arrival of several dozen students from the nearby London College of Communication. With the #extinctionrebellion #Swarming protest in Elephant and Castle now, where numbers have been bolstered by students from South Bank Uni pic.twitter.com/Y0ZlmJJhb9 One student, Renee, 18, who declined to give her surname, said the protest was “incredibly impactful”. “It’s supporting issues that are very prevalent nowadays that people should know about. I don’t know if it’s the right way to do protest, but at the end of the day it has an effect.” Her friend, Ekene, 18, worried that the methods might alienate people, “so then obviously when they see the cause, they are going to associate it with anger. So I’m not sure if it’s the best way.” Nonetheless, both said they would join the next Extinction Rebellion protest, planned for Saturday. ""I don't know if it's the best way to do protest, but at the end of the day it has an effect."" Ekene, left, and Renee, right, students at London College of Communication, say they will attend #ExtinctionRebellion's next big protest on Saturday after #Swarming in Elephant pic.twitter.com/iQCB7MhvjZ Dr Larch Maxey, who was helping to coordinate the Elephant and Castle protest, said: “These students have just heard about it and jumped in, and this is what our movement is doing. “I’ve been on marches for decades about this. We’ve had massive marches and they’ve just been ignored. But you cannot ignore people shutting down the city.” As in Westminster, police facilitated the protest and tried to assuage the anger of motorists. Howard Rees, an organiser, said the actions had been a success. “Quite a lot of extra people have joined over the course of the day, because they’ve seen what’s going on on social media. We’ve got more people on board, and hopefully they will come along tomorrow.” A spokesperson for Transport for London initially said there had been significant disruption during rush hour, but later retreated from that assessment. “The demonstrators were blocking traffic, causing delays to roads and buses in the areas of protest,” the spokesperson said. “The delays are now clearing.” McNern added: “Three weeks ago no one knew the name Extinction Rebellion, then there was the declaration [of rebellion], there was the week of action, there was 6,000 people [on the bridges through central London on Saturday].” On Saturday, 82 protesters were arrested after occupying Southwark, Blackfriars, Waterloo, Westminster and Lambeth bridges, in one of the biggest acts of peaceful civil disobedience seen in the UK in decades. In the previous two weeks, police arrested more than 60 activists for taking part in acts of civil disobedience, ranging from gluing themselves to government buildings to blocking roads. Many activists were arrested more than once. McNern said all the activists were willing to be arrested. “So it’s very different from when you are dealing with people who are scared of being arrested.” He said the group had told the police of their plans and they were willing to abandon any blockade that hampered the movement of emergency vehicles. Organisers say they hope the campaign of “respectful disruption” will change the debate around climate change and signal to those in power that the present course of action will lead to disaster."

"A new study published in Nature has found evidence for 467 ways in which climate hazards due to global warming are making life on the planet harder for humans. It confirms that we are witnessing a shift in the functioning of the Earth system as a whole, a shift to a new state that is unsympathetic to the continued flourishing of human life. A changing climate is only one feature of a warming globe. Human activity has bounced the Earth into a state that has no equivalent in its 4.5 billion year history.  The Earth’s new trajectory as it spins into the future has led scientists to tell us we have entered a new geological epoch, the Anthropocene. We have crossed a threshold and the geological clock cannot be turned back. The disruption we have caused is increasingly unpredictable and uncontrollable, and it has no endpoint. There are, therefore, two questions humankind must face. What must we do to prevent serial disasters becoming existential catastrophe? And how can we make our social and economic systems flexible enough to cope with the new dispensation? There are several reasons an international agreement has proven so hard. The leading one is sabotage by climate science deniers. Can it be countered? Climate science denial was invented and propagated mainly in the United States by the fossil fuel industry in the 1990s and early 2000s. Activists know how to thwart an industry lobbying campaign. But then something calamitous happened – rejecting climate science became caught up in the culture war. The Tea Party and Fox News were largely responsible for the shift. Before then, even a conservative like Sarah Palin accepted the science and called for action. But after 2009, rejecting climate science became a badge of political identity for conservatives. From that point onwards, facts no longer mattered. So the challenge is no longer how to use information to change people’s minds. The challenge is how to change a culture. No one knows how to do that. Last week Donald Trump, who calls climate science a hoax, visited a California devastated by wildfires. When asked whether his visit would change his mind about climate change he said “No”. What else could he say? The journalist was asking him if he would change who he was. Yet it’s too easy to blame the world’s slowness to act on crazy American deniers. Because, in a way, we are all climate science deniers. The full truth of what humans have done is almost impossible to take in. To fully embrace the message of the climate scientists means giving up the deepest presupposition of modernity – the idea of progress. Relinquishing our belief in progress means we must let go of the future, because we have been taught from infancy that the future is progress. In our minds, replacing the old future defined by progress with a new future defined by endless struggle requires a period of grieving. Not many people have the stomach for that. While most people in most countries accept the truth of climate science, they don’t accept its implications. What can be done to change that? When it comes to communicating the science’s message to the public, there is no magic potion to be found. A lot has been tried and some of it works reasonably well, up to a point. The scientists must keep doing their research and putting it out. Accusing them of alarmism is a calculated political slander; in truth, they have consistently been too cautious in their warnings, especially in IPCC reports. Yet the meaning of their reports has not sunk in. It’s clear that an Earth warmer by four degrees – and after the unwinding of the 2015 Paris agreement that is the path we have returned to – will impose enormous stresses on all societies. In poorer countries, it will lead to mass migrations, many deaths and violent conflict. The effects in wealthy countries will depend on who holds power and how they govern. Disasters, food shortages and waves of immigration will magnify resentment against the rich, who will be attempting to insulate themselves from the turmoil around them. But they too depend on the infrastructure of urban life – electricity and water supply, sewerage and waste disposal, transport systems for food and so on. And they can’t insulate themselves from social upheaval. Some communities will learn to adapt more effectively. Smaller, cooperative communities will be best placed to adapt themselves to endure the troubles. But however humans live or die on the new Earth we have made, we are approaching the endpoint of modernity and must accept that it is finally true that man is the environment of man. • Clive Hamilton is professor of public ethics at Charles Sturt University in Canberra and author of Defiant Earth: The fate of humans in the Anthropocene"
"Democrats in the House of Representatives are likely to reopen an intelligence committee investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election – and begin assisting the criminal inquiry on the same subject by the special counsel Robert Mueller. Devin Nunes, the committee’s outgoing Republican chairman and a Trump ally, obstructed efforts by Democrats to investigate possible collusion with Russia by Trump’s campaign team, and closed the investigation with leads left unexplored. Nunes also declined to share information with Mueller. But Adam Schiff, Nunes’s likely Democratic replacement, has promised to resume the committee’s inquiries and pursue new avenues such as the Trump Organization’s business links to Russia. The extension of the Republican majority in the Senate, however, may embolden Trump to nominate a harder-line replacement for the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, fired the day after the election, in order to get rid of Mueller and shut down the special counsel’s investigation. If that happens, expect some Democrats to propose rehiring Mueller as an independent counsel to continue his investigation on behalf of the House. Jon Swaine Now that Democrats have the House, President Trump’s dream of a “big, beautiful wall” will be all the more elusive. Before the midterms, the outgoing House speaker, Paul Ryan, promised there would be a “big fight” over the border wall immediately after the election. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said this was still the plan on Wednesday morning, but Republicans now go into that fight against an emboldened Democratic party. By 8 December, Congress must reach a deal on Department of Homeland Security funding, including the wall – a narrow window for Republicans to secure significant wall funding before Democrats take control of the House in January. House Democrats have also said they will try to restore protections for Dreamers, undocumented immigrants who arrived in the US as children. Voters on both sides of the aisle have expressed broad support for creating a pathway to citizenship for this population and the Trump administration has used them as a bargaining chip since revoking their protections in 2017. Amanda Holpuch Unless Trump gets re-elected in 2020, it now looks certain his massive tax bill will be his last. That $1.5tn giveaway, Trump’s largest congressional achievement, mainly benefited the very wealthy and corporations and has polled badly with voters, so badly that Republicans barely mentioned it in the run-up to the midterms. He has since promised another tax cut aimed at the middle class. Now, with Democrats in control of the House, any legislation will be hard to pass. There are areas of common ground – Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway has already mentioned infrastructure – but given the partisan divide in Washington, striking a deal is going to be difficult. The picture on trade also becomes more complex as the president’s powers are curtailed. Politicians in China, Europe, Canada, Mexico and elsewhere will all be watching to see how his defeat will affect the trade disputes he has fueled. Trump can still use executive orders to force through change but the president’s chances of passing meaningful legislation were hobbled on Tuesday. Now he will be buffeted by the larger, outside forces that will decide the US’s economic forces – forces that are beyond his control. Dominic Rushe Republican efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act (ACA) at a national level are almost guaranteed to halt now that the House is in the hands of the Democrats. At the state level, Democratic governors-elect in Kansas, Maine and Wisconsin could expand ACA protections that Republican state leaders rejected. And in Idaho, Nebraska and Utah citizens voted to expand access to free or low-cost health coverage to the poor through Medicaid. Before the election, Nancy Pelosi, who is expected to return to her former role as House speaker, said a legislative priority would be lowering pharmaceutical drug costs – an issue that could have bipartisan support. And reproductive rights groups have called last night’s results a victory. Federal efforts to limit women’s reproductive rights will be challenged with Democrats in control of the House. And in Michigan, Kansas and New Mexico, the three governors-elect have a record for defending women’s reproductive rights. Amanda Holpuch Attempts to ramp up action to address climate change faltered, most notably in Washington state where voters rejected a proposal to implement a price on carbon pollution. The plan, which was vigorously opposed by oil and gas interests including BP, would have placed a $15 fee on each ton of CO2 and potentially acted as a springboard for other states to do likewise. Washington state voters have now rejected carbon pricing on three separate occasions, raising doubts as to whether the concept, backed by many economists as the best way to drive down emissions and avoid disastrous climate change, will gain traction in the US. Elsewhere, a ballot proposal to require that Arizona get half of its electricity from renewable sources like solar and wind was rejected by voters in the state. In Colorado, the fossil fuel industry spent $40m to successfully fend off an attempt to impose a half-mile buffer between drilling operations and people’s homes. In Florida, however, voters backed a measure to ban oil and gas drilling in state waters. Oliver Milman Democrats picked up seven governor’s seats by early Wednesday. The governor races are particularly important because of a once-in-a-decade redistricting process due to begin in 2021. States will be required to redraw congressional districts to make sure each one represents the same number of residents. That’s where gerrymandering – the process where a party draws often oddly shaped districts to best maximize their voters – can occur. State legislatures do the redrawing, but it is the state’s governor who has the ability to sign or veto the new congressional map in their state. That means a Democrat governor elected on Tuesday to a four-year term would have the power to prevent Republicans – who have become experts at gerrymandering, most notably in Pennsylvania – from redrawing districts in a way which would benefit them in upcoming elections to the House of Representatives. Florida was seen as particularly important as the state is expected to gain two congressional seats after the 2020 census. That’s down to a long-term population shift away from the north-east and midwest towards states like Florida and Texas. Unfortunately for Democrats, Andrew Gillum lost on Tuesday. Adam Gabbatt"
"Twenty years ago politicians who spoke about climate change talked about their duty to solve the problem for the sake of our grandchildren. With too little action since, Europe’s previously benign weather is getting less predictable and more dangerous. Europeans expecting to live another 30 years will see life get a lot more uncomfortable as a result. On current projections the global temperature will have risen to about 2C over pre-industrial levels by about 2050. The latest research from the European Commission predicts that unchecked carbon emissions will cause an extra 132,000 heat fatalities a year, a loss in food production, water shortages and droughts, particularly in southern Europe.  For the UK the warnings are about serious coastal flooding, with a five-fold increase in damage. Heavier rain will cause three times as many people to be affected by river flooding. Apart from the obvious disruption caused by floods, fires and other extreme events the economic consequences are also severe, with a 10 to 15% loss in productivity as it is impossible to work in extreme heat. The scientists say their predictions are probably underestimates and that politicians seem unprepared for the consequences. At this rate our current politicians’ grandchildren will be lucky to survive to old age. "
"Since his first day on the job, when he surrounded himself with a National Park Service police escort and rode through Washington DC on a white-nosed horse named Tonto, the US interior secretary, Ryan Zinke, has exhibited a flair for ostentation. Not long after taking office in March 2017, the new secretary started flying a special flag, adorned with the agency’s bison seal, above the interior department’s elegant New Deal-era headquarters. At a cost of more than $2,000, he also commissioned commemorative coins emblazoned with his name to hand out to visitors and staff. He replaced the doors in his office to the tune of more than $130,000, and installed a hunting-themed arcade game in the department’s cafeteria. Yet to some longtime civil servants working at interior headquarters, this flashy behavior was merely a distraction from graver concerns. “There was a lot of eye-rolling and embarrassment about the flag and the horse and all of the ridiculousness,” said a former senior employee who left last year and requested anonymity for fear of retaliation. For some, the dominant emotional tenor at the time was “fear and anxiety” as Zinke and his team ushered in “dramatic change” at the interior department. “All the new administration was interested in was their checklist for dismantling regulations and weakening environmental and land use protections,” said the former staffer. “Instead of asking why a senator or lobbyist or CEO was asking for a special favor and whether or not it was allowed under the law, this administration wanted to know why the special favor wasn’t already done and which deep state employee was standing in the way.” I have have seen different administrations from both sides of the aisle … but this is the worst Despite his public persona as a folksy Montanan with a Boy Scout’s penchant for pennants and horses, Zinke has taken shrewd and aggressive steps to transform from the inside a department whose 70,000 employees manage the country’s treasured national parks and its endangered species, in addition to overseeing vast energy and mineral deposits on at least 500m acres of public land. During Zinke’s first months in office, he reassigned at least 25 senior officials at the department, a move that led some of the affected staff to question whether they were being punished for past work on subjects such as climate change, and which prompted at least one high-profile resignation. He publicly questioned the allegiance of other of his newly inherited employees, saying he had “30% of the crew that’s not loyal to the flag”. Most importantly, Zinke rapidly installed a slew of conservative operatives and industry sympathizers in key positions throughout the agency. Because these senior advisers, counselors and other appointees are rarely subject to Senate approval, few people know their names. They nevertheless wield immense power and are responsible for much of the day-to-day work at the interior department. Hundreds of pages of correspondence and calendars reviewed by the Guardian and Pacific Standard show how Zinke and his top aides have favored corporate and conservative calls to prioritize resource extraction at the expense of conservation, while consistently delivering on industry desires – despite sometimes running afoul of conflict of interest rules. The interior department responded to only one of multiple inquiries made to it, saying through a spokesperson that “the Department has addressed these questions to you and other reporters on multiple occasions. Our position remains unchanged.” Zinke is now facing a swirl of misconduct allegations, and Trump has said he would make a decision on his future at the department as soon as this week. But whatever Zinke’s fate, he has stocked the department with a slate of committed conservative appointees who will continue to remake the agency in the image of the Trump administration. “They are undermining the department’s mission at every turn,” said one current high-level civil servant, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. “I have been here a pretty long time and seen different administrations from both sides of the aisle,” the civil servant added, “but this is the worst I have ever seen.” During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump made no secret of his ambition to exploit the American landscape. “A Trump administration will develop an American first energy plan,” he said in a 2016 speech before the North Dakota Petroleum Council. “American energy dominance will be declared a strategic, economic and foreign policy goal of the United States.” The US controls enormous publicly owned energy resources, from the underwater oil wells of the Gulf of Mexico to the gas fields of North Dakota and the uranium deposits of Arizona. The interior department is the agency that decides who can drill and mine these riches. Zinke has styled himself, at least superficially, after Theodore Roosevelt, the progressive-era president who helped create America’s modern conservation system. But Zinke has veered sharply from Roosevelt’s legacy. Where Roosevelt created the nation’s first national monuments, Zinke drastically reduced the size of Bears Ears national monument and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monument in Utah last year in what amounted to the largest rollback of protected public lands in American history. More broadly, over the last fiscal year, the department has sought to lease a stunning 12.8m acres of publicly-owned oil and gas parcels to private companies. And while Roosevelt railed against powerful special interests, Zinke has a cozy relationship with industry groups. The monument reductions occurred after Zinke was pressured by conservative groups such as the Koch brothers-affiliated Americans for Prosperity and energy companies such as the uranium firm Energy Fuels Inc. In fact, during Zinke’s first 18 months in office he met repeatedly with oil and gas industry organizations that have collectively given him more than $110,000 in political contributions over the course of his career, according to a report from the Western Values Project. Zinke’s top deputies also have a close relationship with extractive industries. During their first year and a half on the job, just seven of Zinke’s high-level political appointees collectively participated in at least 280 meetings, calls or gatherings with fossil fuel corporations, mining companies or related advocacy groups, according to calendars obtained via public records requests and analyzed by the Guardian and Pacific Standard. Meetings with conservative ideological organizations, agricultural and timber groups, and corporate lobbying and law firms also appeared regularly on the officials’ calendars. These extractive interests had more than twice as much access as conservation NGOs, which obtained at least 115 meetings and calls with the seven officials within the same timeframe. At a private energy summit that took place in Washington DC last December, a Zinke appointee named Timothy Williams articulated the department’s pro-industry agenda, according to documentation of his remarks reported here for the first time. Williams dismissively characterized the approach taken by the administration of Barack Obama: “Anything you want to do on public land, they want to see what the carbon footprint is and what the social cost is.” Under Zinke, “we’re not looking at this”, he said. The new administration was instead focused on “economic impacts”. It was bent on changing “the mindset of the bureaucrats”. From the very beginning, however, Zinke’s interior appointees appear to have violated Trump’s own ethics directives intended to “drain the swamp”. According to rules put in place by the Trump administration, officials are supposed to be prohibited for a period of two years from the date of their appointment from having meetings with former employers, with few exceptions, and interior department guidelines recommend that officials take steps to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest when performing their official duties. Williams, for instance, previously worked for Americans for Prosperity (AFP), a Koch brothers-funded organization committed to combating government regulations of all kinds, including environmental protections. But soon after joining the department as the deputy director of the office of intergovernmental and external affairs, his office contacted AFP to hold a meeting, according to records obtained by the investigative group Documented. “Happy to meet to discuss partnering on shared priorities,” Chrissy Harbin, then the AFP vice-president, replied in an email. In another case, the political appointee Douglas Domenech met twice in April 2017 with representatives of his former employer, the Texas Public Policy Foundation (TPPF), another Koch-linked conservative foundation. According to his work calendar, the subject of the meeting was a pair of active lawsuits the organization had filed against agencies within the interior department concerning endangered species and property rights – the meetings appear to be a glaring conflict of interest. Little more than six months after its meetings with Domenech, TPPF had what it described as a “major win” when it settled one of those lawsuits. There are “express prohibitions” on such meetings in the White House’s own ethics pledge, said Virginia Canter, the chief ethics counsel at the non-partisan Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics. “These high-level officials are supposed to be setting the tone for the entire department and this shows a complete disregard for the ethics rules put in place by the administration.” The Guardian and Pacific Standard have uncovered several instances in which interior department leadership has coordinated closely with industry-aligned groups on crucial legal and regulatory decisions, with profound consequences for efforts to combat climate change, wildlife management and other matters. Zinke’s department plays a major role in the regulation of methane which, for the first 20 years after it is introduced into the atmosphere, is over 80 times more effective at trapping heat than carbon dioxide. The interior department under Barack Obama moved to clamp down on a principal source of domestic methane pollution – the wasteful leaking, venting and flaring of methane by oil and gas companies. In late 2016, just before Obama left office, the interior department finalized a new federal regulation that required oil and gas drillers operating on public land to take stringent steps to detect and capture methane waste. Influential oil and gas industry trade groups like the Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA) were opposed to the measure, and sued in late 2016 to block what it considered a “regulatory onslaught on American producers”. During the first months of the Trump administration, Republicans led an industry-backed effort to repeal the methane rule using the Congressional Review Act, a law that enables Congress and the president to roll back recently issued regulations. It seems clear that the methane rule rollback was a foregone conclusion from day one The repeal effort soon ran into trouble, however, when Senate Democrats and a handful of Republicans, including Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, publicly came out against it in the spring of 2017. Emails reveal how the interior department and oil industry coordinated a response.  “Really?” wrote interior official Micah Chambers, in a frustrated March 2017 note to Ryan Ullman, the IPAA’s director of government relations, upon learning of Graham’s opposition. “I’m disappointed to put it very politely,” Ullman responded. Ullman asked whether the department would wheel out Zinke to make the case for getting rid of the regulation. Graham did not change his mind about the methane rule and the Senate ultimately voted against repealing the regulation. Zinke’s department soon took matters into its own hands. The department tried twice in 2017 to block methane regulation by itself, but both times it was stymied by legal challenges from environmentalist groups and state governments. A political appointee named Katharine MacGregor helped lead the department’s handling of the issue. Her calendar shows several meetings with fossil-fuel industry groups in the summer and fall of 2017, including one about methane just a few hours before an internal interior department meeting on the same subject. In September this year, MacGregor announced that the department had decided to rewrite the rule entirely, rather than merely block it. The revision effectively rolled it back. Chase Huntley, the energy and climate program director at The Wilderness Society, said his organization held several meetings with top interior officials, and it became apparent to him that their minds were already made up: the gutting of the methane rule was a preordained outcome. “It seems clear that the methane rule rollback, while arbitrary, was a foregone conclusion from day one of this administration,” he said. It was rooted “in a philosophical and policy allegiance to the industry’s best interests”. Extractive industries also seem to have had a hand in the department’s implementation of the Endangered Species Act, which is regarded as one of the strongest environmental laws in the world but is the bane of some industry groups because it limits development in sensitive habitat. The interior department energy counselor, Vincent DeVito, for instance, appears to have helped delay Endangered Species Act protections last year for an imperiled freshwater mussel species in Texas at the behest of oil and gas interests. In mid 2017, the government relations director for the Independent Petroleum Association of America wrote in an email to DeVito: “We really hope that you can intervene before this species gets listed next month.” When the species’ listing was delayed, the Guardian and Pacific Standard have learned from records, the IPAA sent DeVito an email with the words: “THANK YOU!” DeVito has since left the department to work for an oil and gas company. The department has taken a controversial stance, too, on sage grouse, a chicken-size bird that dwells among the sprawling sagebrush plains of the American west. Even the slightest disturbance can drive the animal from its breeding and nesting grounds, and populations have plummeted in recent decades as oil and gas drilling, mining and other development has fractured its habitat. In 2015, the Obama administration unveiled protection plans for the species, including a proposal to prohibit new mining on 10m acres of federal land in the hope of avoiding disturbance. But after Trump’s election, the mining industry suddenly found itself with committed sympathizers within the interior development. A striking email chain reviewed by the Guardian and Pacific Standard reveals that a mining industry advocate helped edit the wording of legislative language intended to block funding for these sage grouse conservation efforts. In one message from spring 2017, a Republican staffer with the Congressional Western Caucus named Jeff Small described producing the proposed text “after much discussion” with Laura Skaer, the executive director of the influential American Exploration and Mining Association (AEMA). He sent an email to top officials at the interior department to run the legislative language past them too. Kathleen Benedetto, a senior adviser at the department, replied: “It will need to be modified.” That very day, a modified version of the language was suggested to a house committee by the Republican congressman Paul Gosar. (A spokesperson for Gosar said that “it is common for us to solicit feedback from outside experts and impacted stakeholders”.) The Republican-led Congress ultimately failed to block funding for the proposed mining prohibition, however, and Zinke’s department once again took matters into its own hands. In June 2017, Zinke established a broad internal review of the Obama-era sage grouse conservation plans, naming Benedetto, previously the co-founder of the Women’s Mining Coalition, as “co-lead” of the effort. Over the course of the next four months, Benedetto’s calendar shows she had at least 16 meetings or calls with mining groups. In October 2017, the Bureau of Land Management, which Benedetto helps oversee, announced that the 10m acres would no longer be out of bounds for mining. The AEMA celebrated the victory, saying the interior department “has done the right thing by ending this epic federal land grab”. Since taking office, Zinke and his department have been subject to no fewer than 15 federal investigations. The interior department’s office of inspector general is investigating his involvement in a Montana land deal with the chairman of the oil services company Halliburton. It is also looking into his role in blocking the development of a proposed casino involving two Native American tribes in Connecticut. In late October, the Washington Post reported that the inspector general’s office referred one of its inquiries to the justice department for further investigation, though it did not specify which one. The secretary’s pro-fossil-fuel agenda, his team’s conflict of interests problems, and his own personal conduct are likely to draw intense scrutiny from Democrats once they take control of the House in January 2019. Already, congressman Raúl Grijalva of Arizona, who will probably take the reins as the chair of the House natural resources committee next year, has vowed to call Zinke before the committee in order to interrogate him about his “failures and scandals”. Whether Zinke sticks around at the department is an open question, though many press reports indicate that he is preparing to step down from office. His political appointees, nevertheless, will probably remain. But they too acknowledge that they have a short timeframe in which to finish their work of fulfilling Trump’s energy dominance agenda. At the private Washington DC energy summit back in December, Timothy Williams admitted as much to his audience of conservative operatives and fossil-fuel advocates. “Obviously we are not going as fast as everybody wants, but at some point there will be an administration in here, an administration that is not friendly to your values, to you guys,” he said. “So bear with us,” he added later. “You guys should know that if you have any questions or any problems you feel free to contact me. That is my job. To work with industry.” The Guardian’s This Land is Your Land series is focused on the threats facing US public lands, from celebrated national parks such as Yosemite, Yellowstone and the Everglades to vast western forests and deserts, Pacific coral reefs and Atlantic seamounts.

"In February last year, a week after Donald Trump had signed an anti-abortion executive order surrounded by seven men, Isabella Lövin posted a photograph of herself on Twitter signing a climate change bill alongside seven other women. Sweden’s then deputy prime minister remained enigmatic as the picture went viral and she was asked whether she had been “trolling” the US president. “It is up to the observer to interpret the photo,” she was quoted as saying. “We are a feminist government, which shows in this photo.”  The image made headlines around the world and, nearly two years on, is still what Lövin is best known for internationally. But the Swedish Green party leader and minister for international development is no mere social media politician. During her party’s historic first period in government she relentlessly pushed through an exhausting list of more than 50 policies, including a flight tax, the so-called Swedish Proposal, which tripled the price of EU emissions credits, and the carbon law she was signing in the picture that went viral. Lövin is one of the leading figures in what she says is a resurgence in environmentally conscious politics across the continent. “There is a green wave going on in Europe, in Germany, Luxembourg and Belgium, and in Finland as well,” she says. “I’m convinced that green parties offer a positive vision, and also the willingness to take on the huge challenges that we see in the world right now.” The slogan on her Twitter profile, “The climate can’t wait”, sums up the Lövin approach. “We’ve been very focused on results, and many of these issues have beenfundamental, long-term policies,” she says, sitting in her office in Sweden’s foreign ministry. “To work seriously on changing policies and setting long-term targets, and forming majorities and doing agreements with other parties, those things don’t pay off very easily in PR strategies.” It’s the same single-mindedness she as shown ever since bursting into public life 10 years ago following the 2007 publication of Silent Seas – The Fish Race to the Bottom, a rigorously researched, dramatic exposé of the crisis in global fisheries. “It totally changed my life,” she says of the book, published when she was 44. “But what really changed my life was the decision to write the book. I felt such a huge anxiety and anger about what we’re doing to our planet, and specifically when I understood the issue of overfishing – because we’re actually destroying our oceans with our eyes open.” I decided ... I will try to write about this topic, and then at least I’ve tried’.” The book was a sensation, winning Sweden’s two main journalism prizes, and launching a process which saw Lövin sent to Brussels as an MEP by the Green party with a single mission: to push through reform of fisheries policies. When I ask if she succeeded, she laughs. “Quite modestly I have to say ‘yes’. I was there for five years and we managed to get a majority in the European parliament to ban shark finning, overfishing and discarding fish, and to bring in a new common fisheries policy that sets the target that we must have sustainable fish stocks by 2020.” There’s a section in the book when she considers rescuing a dogfish, still alive at a fish auction, and releasing it into the sea. But she bristles when I ask if she sees herself as an eco-warrior. “No, no, no. Never. For me, it was extremely important to really do the research and see the facts,” she says. “I see the environmental challenges that we have now, they are existential. It’s that serious. It’s not just being like an image, that you’re an eco-warrior or whatever. This is really happening now.” That is why, when the Swedish Green party formed a coalition with the Social Democrats in 2014, Lövin took the next step and joined the national government, first as minister for international development cooperation, then, when her colleague Åsa Romson resigned, as deputy prime minister and climate minister. “It was tough for me personally,” she says. “But I felt if I don’t do this, I might regret for the rest of my life I didn’t try to do something about the problems I saw.” Government has also been a bruising experience for the party, particularly at the end of 2015 and the start of 2016, when a dramatic tightening of immigration policy was followed by a failure to stop Vattenfall, the state power company,selling, rather than shutting down, its German coal mines. “One of the mistakes we made … was maybe to say that we would succeed in certain issues where it wasn’t possible, and that has haunted us,” she says, of the coal debacle. As a result, the party lost roughly half of its 20,000 members, and then, in September’s election, a third of its seats. The party says, however, it always knew that power would come at a heavy price, and had aimed only to stay above the 4% threshold needed to keep its place in parliament. “It’s been a long-term strategy for the Swedish Greens to come into government and really take responsibility,” says Lövin. “We managed to do that and not be destroyed in the process.” The Greens may yet have a role in the future Swedish government. Coalition talks have failed to lead anywhere and, last week, Annie Lööf, the leader of the minority Centre party, failed to form a government, the second such doomed attempt. Lövin believes her party is now in a strong position and could find a place in coalitions dominated by the centre-right Alliance bloc or the Social Democrats, whose leader, Stefan Löfven, was on Friday announced as the next person to be put forward to parliament as prime minister. “It’s difficult to exclude any possibility at this point,” she says. “The Green party has been mentioned now as a very interesting partner for the more liberal rightwing parties, and of course we’re also included in what most people think would be a Social Democratic or more centre government.” While some other party leaders have spent the last two months locked in coalition talks, Lövin has instead been busy serving as a minister in the transitional government, leading preparations for next month’s Katowice Climate Change Conference. “I hope to be there,” she says. “I’m very concerned, actually, because with the Paris Agreement, everyone was very happy that we got to get an agreement, but now the logic of the climate negotiations is back to where it was before Paris, with the poor counties, including China and India, blaming the richer countries for what’s happening.” Lövin’s press secretary then chips in to warn her that it’s time for her next appointment, but she has one more thing she wants to say. “I think one of the most important things for all democracies around the world to contemplate is how we are going to develop and protect democracy when voters are so impatient and learn their news from social media, which can be very biased.” A viral tweet such as hers may get through to hundreds of thousands of people with a simple message about how wrong it is for a White House full of men to sign orders that affect women’s bodies and lives. It cannot, however, communicate more complicated, nuanced information. “The understanding of long processes, which is, very necessary if you are going to have a democracy, not a dictatorship, is very low,” she says. “I think just staying on very superficial messages and going with a populist movement is totally the opposite of what a green party should be.”"
"Donald Trump doesn’t believe his own government’s major report on climate change – which the administration tried to bury over the Thanksgiving break. It warns that rising temperatures are already harming America and will cause huge damage globally.  Climate change will exacerbate wildfires and droughts, causing particulate pollution from smoke and windblown dust and increasing smog that forms in higher temperatures. Worldwide, 5.5 billion people, or 75% of the population, live in places that don’t meet the World Health Organization standard for limiting particulate pollution, according to research by the University of Chicago. Air pollution shortens lives. In areas with the worst air, including in the Indian capital Delhi, people could live up to seven and a half years longer with less pollution. Aside from early deaths, air pollution also causes breathing and heart problems and worsens asthma. “In the last few years, we’ve seen enormous spikes in episodes where wildfires contribute to pollution,” said Janice Nolen, assistant vice-president of national policy for the American Lung Association. “It doesn’t have to be a continuous problem every day to be unhealthy. It can be that a spike happens for a few days of difficult breathing that shorten lives.” Rising temperatures and increased carbon dioxide levels will also make plant-based allergies worse by lengthening the pollen season and increasing the amount of pollen made by plants. Beyond air pollution, climate change is a threat to human health via extreme heat, reduced food and water quality, and population displacement. Depending on action taken to slow climate change, an additional 3,900 to 9,300 across 49 large cities in the US are predicted to die each year from extremely hot or cold days by the last two decades of this century, the report finds. Infectious agents will also spread wider with migrating mosquitoes and ticks. “Often people, when they’re affected by climate change, are affected by it in multiple ways,” Nolen said. “You’re affected by air quality, you’re affected by heat, you can be affected by a variety of things from allergens being increased, from mold from flooding, not to mention just stress.”"
"I strongly agree with George’s Monbiot’s comments regarding David Attenborough’s latest BBC series, Dynasties (Attenborough has betrayed the living world that he loves, 7 November). Why have most of his wonderful programmes been blind to the tsunami of environmental destruction we have unleashed? Some years ago I confronted Alastair Fothergill, series producer of many of Attenborough’s programmes, at a public meeting: “The Earth is in distress: why do you ignore human impacts?” His response: “Our audience does not want to be disturbed.” What about the mess that future generations will be left with?  In the 1980s I worked at Channel 4 for Fragile Earth, which broadcast some 20 environmental documentaries a year. But as soon as Michael Grade took over as CEO in 1988, he sacked the commissioning editor – advertisers did not like disturbing programmes. And so the global devastation continues largely unreported in TV documentaries.  British TV has also systematically deprived us of information about solutions to the world’s environmental problems. In some countries, major new green industries are flourishing, but viewers in Britain are being left uninformed. We need well-presented programmes helping us to make the right decisions – as consumers, as parents and as voters. Herbert GirardetAuthor and consultant; co-founder, World Future Council • If David Attenborough is unwilling or unable to offer potential solutions to the world’s environmental crisis, perhaps the Guardian should invite those who may have solutions to offer these in a series of features with global mass-media and social-media partners. Contributors could include people who understand that population can be lowered and welfare improved by global development based on justice and greater power for women: there are many examples of this which expose the intellectual poverty of neo-Malthusians. It could include the ideas of economists who reject conventional “growth” as the only way forward. It might tap into the “feasible utopia” ideas of red-green media and thinktanks plus the work of academics who lead the search for sustainability. NGOs and unions could have a role, and there would be space for scientists – but not the Tomorrow’s World types who promised cosy technological fixes for all our problems, passifying a bedazzled public. We must tap into the mass of talented but largely unheard folk who have ideas that begin with the understanding that “another world is possible”.Trevor PhillipsNorwich • The BBC has been guilty of ignoring or dumbing down important information about climate for a long time. Many other organisations that should know better are also guilty of not shouting loud enough about the consequences of global warming: there has been consistent fear among NGOs that frightening people would have adverse effects. They are all complicit in this cover-up.Maureen EvershedDorridge, West Midlands • I couldn’t agree more with George Monbiot. We are not children; we do not need to be protected from the truth because it may make us uncomfortable. Our planet is on the cusp of a downward spiral leading to monumental disaster unless we all do something very quickly. And yet the BBC appears to be more interested in audience numbers, still determined to make safe, appealing programmes with David Attenborough at the helm. He is in an almost unique position to make a powerful statement about the remaining wonders, which still exist, but will most certainly disappear in the not too distant future. And with their disappearance our own species will surely not survive. My generation, and David Attenborough, will be long gone when what’s left of the Earth’s future population will be struggling to stay alive on a very bleak, barren and silent planet. Will they look back and be glad that we were entertained?Carol KnightTisbury, Wiltshire • I sympathise with the concern that George Monbiot expresses. I think there is a problem that people are liable to be put off by all the warnings of the disastrous consequences. It is very difficult to tread the right line between very bad predictions and reassuring us that something can be done. Avoiding single-use plastics is something people can easily aim for and feel that they are preventing a whale from being killed by plastic. I felt sad to see the recent pictures of all the plastic that one whale had ingested. Then I thought of all the creatures that will never be born because of climate change, and that is even more sad.Janet PoliakoffNottingham • Your excellent article reporting the devastating effects of humans on other animals illustrates how important it is to avoid further increasing our environmental footprint (Annihilation of wildlife a threat to civilisation, scientists warn, 30 October). A policy promoted by the Guardian, and supported by its readers, requires a huge increase in our environmental footprint: reducing greenhouse gas emissions by replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy. For example, the late David MacKay showed that in order to meet UK energy needs, solar, wind and biomass “farms’ would need to occupy 5%, 10% and 75 % of our available land area, respectively. The required offshore wind turbines would occupy an area equivalent to a 13km thick strip around the entire UK shore. Wave machines would need to stretch across the entire 500km Atlantic coastline. Can we reduce greenhouse gas emission without increasing our footprint on this planet? Yes, by exploiting the densest form of energy: nuclear. Although feared by the public, nuclear has the best safety record of all forms of energy, and is far safer than fossil fuel. Even the most catastrophic nuclear accidents, such as the ones at Chernobyl and Fukushima, eventually caused very few deaths (43 after Chernobyl and none at Fukushima).If we want to protect other species from humans and avoid catastrophic climate change, we need to shift our focus from renewables and expand nuclear energy.

"For the fourth-generation crab fisherman John Beardon, the warming of Pacific waters off the coast of California has meant toxic crabs, shortened fishing seasons and a near decimation of his livelihood as a crab boat captain. Now he would like to see the industry he says is responsible pay for the damage. On Wednesday, associations representing California crab fishermen like Beardon filed suit against 30 fossil fuel companies seeking to make the companies pay for the harm global warming has caused to California’s fisheries. The suit demands that petroleum interests finance the changes that will be needed to sustain the crab fishing industry in the future.  “We just about can’t make a living fishing crabs any more,” said Beardon, who has seen the earnings he can make with his 35ft crab boat, Stormy II, cut in half in recent years because of the effects of ocean warming. “I’d like to see the industry that caused this take responsibility for that.” The lawsuit, filed in California state superior court by the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen’s Associations, is the first legal action by a private industry group seeking to hold the fossil fuel companies responsible for major losses attributed to global warming. It seeks unspecified damages from defendants including Chevron, ExxonMobil and BP. The suit also names 27 other petroleum companies. “We’re taking a stand for the captains and crew, their families and the business owners that support the fleet,” said Noah Oppenheim, the association’s executive director. “The fossil fuel companies named in our lawsuit knowingly caused harm, and they need to be held accountable.” The suit follows a slew of legal actions filed in the last 18 months by government agencies, including the cities of New York City and San Francisco and the state of Rhode Island, claiming that the petroleum industry has long known about the devastating effects their products cause to the climate but has done little to stop them. In June, a federal court judge threw out two suits from the cities of San Francisco and Oakland. Judge William Alsup of the US district court for the northern district of California wrote in his ruling that while he accepted the science behind global warming, “the problem deserves a solution on a more vast scale than can be supplied by a district judge or jury in a public nuisance case”. He also cited the benefits that have come from petroleum products. Early this month, the US supreme court refused to stop a lawsuit brought by a group of children and young adults, which seeks to force the US government to do something about climate change. Another federal court recently paused the case after the Trump administration requested a temporary stay. The fishermen’s suit raises the question of who should have to bear the costs of financing the major adaptions that industry – and society – will have to make to survive global warming. “Defendants have known for nearly 50 years that greenhouse gas pollution from their fossil fuel products has a significant impact on Earth’s climate, including a warming of the oceans,” reads the suit. Yet “defendants concealed the dangers, sought to undermine public support for greenhouse gas regulation, and engaged in massive campaigns to promote the ever-increasing use of their products at ever greater volumes”. Chevron, which has a major refinery in the San Francisco Bay Area, did not immediately return calls from the Guardian. But R Hewitt Pate, Chevron’s vice-president and general counsel, called for cooperation, not blame, after the dismissal of the San Francisco and Oakland cases in June. “Tackling the difficult international policy issues of climate change requires honest and constructive discussion,” he said. “Using lawsuits to vilify the men and women who provide the energy we all need is neither honest nor constructive.” Starting in 2015, crab fishermen have had to contend with dramatically shortened fishing seasons because the warming of ocean waters has caused huge algal blooms along the Pacific coast. The blooms were blamed for causing a buildup of a neurotoxin, domoic acid, in the crab population, making the crabs potentially poisonous to eat. The start of the 2015 crab season, usually in November, had to be pushed back until the following March. The season was shortened in 2016 and 2017 as well. This year, the crab season will be allowed to open as usual, on Thursday, but one section of the northern California coastline will be closed for fishing. The unpredictable and dramatically shortened seasons have taken a huge toll on the fleet of small fishing boats that usually supply a bounty of fresh Dungeness crab for the state’s restaurants and holiday tables. “For some of these fishermen, losing a season means having to sell the boat. And many of them did,” said Oppenheim of the disastrous 2015-16 season. “We’re talking about families having to go to the bread line.” In releasing the suit, the fishing association called for the petroleum companies to fund studies that will help crab fishermen survive ocean warming and suggested that money could be used to study new ways of making crab fishing viable, such as keeping crabs in holding tanks so that they could expel toxic acids. Beardon, who fishes for Dungeness out of Crescent City, California, said he has had to go to work as a logging truck driver during the summer months in order to sustain his family crabbing business. “The last three years have been really hard,” said Beardon, “Our community came together and held a fish fry to help our crew members. But fish fries and disaster relief are no solution to these closures we’re now seeing year after year after year.”"
"Six months ago, when I stood on this bridge over Waskerley beck, which flows from the head of the Tunstall valley, the reservoir that it supplies was brimful. A rapid thaw after late heavy snowfall, followed by torrential rain, had left a pair of great-crested grebes piling up water weeds in a desperate attempt to keep their nest site above rising flood water.  Today, after the driest summer I can remember, a third of what was 66 acres of deep water is still mud. The sluggish beck meanders through the sediment towards a shallow lake, its rate of flow akin to replenishing an empty swimming pool using an egg cup. It will take many weeks of heavy rain to recharge the groundwater in the surrounding fells to the point where a refilled reservoir will cascade over the dam wall spillway again. Tunstall reservoir, built in 1879 to store drinking water, is now relegated to the role of maintaining summer water flow in the River Wear, three miles downstream at Wolsingham. It has been stocked with rainbow trout and all summer they have become concentrated in a shrinking volume of water. I counted 12 fishermen this morning: only one was using a rod and line; six were cormorants and five were herons, taking full advantage of such easy feeding opportunities. The idiom “shooting fish in a barrel” came to mind. I walked home through Backstone Bank wood, ancient oak woodland on the eastern flank of the reservoir, across a wooden bridge over another stream, where the trickle of water barely disturbed the autumn leaves that spun down into its rocky bed. The morning’s climate change news had been of a Met Office report describing a pattern of wetter winters and longer, drier summers. The reservoir’s water level has sometimes been low in the past, but it seems likely that this year’s exceptional weather experience will become the new normal. I’ve known this secluded valley for most of my life, with its farms, fellsides, wetlands and woodlands, all interlinked. There is now a sense of urgency in appreciating the here and now, before too much changes too fast."
"Controversial plans to import liquefied natural gas into Australia to fill a shortfall as domestic gas is exported to Asia would significantly increase greenhouse gas emissions, AGL has conceded. Energy companies have proposed four LNG import terminals for the east coast to ensure gas supply and ease high prices. The imported natural gas would effectively replace the two-thirds of gas sold overseas from export plants in Queensland. One of the most advanced is proposed by AGL Energy, which wants to park a floating plant in Victoria’s Western Port Bay and connect it to the state’s gas network via a high-pressure pipeline. In an email to conservation group Environment Victoria seen by Guardian Australia, AGL said it could lead to a 20% increase in emissions compared with the same amount of gas extracted and used in Australia due to additional production, processing and transport of the LNG. Some of that increase would be counted as part of Australia’s emissions, and some in the country where the gas originated.  AGL said the project was critical to cutting emissions from the energy system as it would lead to coal plants, with higher emissions, being replaced by new renewable energy projects firmed by flexible gas plants that could be called on when required. “A marginal increase in the carbon intensity of the gas used to firm up new renewable energy projects does not materially impact the significant carbon savings achieved by replacing retiring coal plants in this way,” AGL senior manager for project engagement, Kelly Parkinson, said. There’s no scenario where [importing gas is] in the public interest or a good outcome for the environment. But Environment Victoria chief executive, Mark Wakeham, said the idea Australia needed to import gas to have a clean energy transition was ridiculous and outdated. He said the rise of renewable energy meant the country was already burning eight terawatt hours’ less gas to generate electricity than five years ago. Several coal-fired power plants having closed in that time. “There’s no doubt companies like AGL might be able to make some money importing gas, but there’s no scenario where that’s in the public interest or a good outcome for the environment,” Wakeham said. The dispute calls into question the idea that gas should be considered “cleaner” energy, the descriptor used by the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (Appea), which represents the LNG industry. In a recent submission to the Climate Change Authority, Appea said emissions from LNG were on average about half those from coal across its full life cycle, which includes extraction, processing, shipping, piping and burning for energy. An accompanying graphic suggested they were 39% lower. Opponents to gas industry expansion, including Environment Victoria, said further investment in the fossil fuel made little sense on environmental or economic grounds as it was more expensive than genuinely clean alternatives – solar or wind energy backed by batteries or pumped hydroelectricity. They said Australia could meet current domestic gas needs at electricity plants, for heating and cooking and as a feedstock for some industrial processes from existing developments, if there was a domestic reservation policy that limited the proportion sold to Japan and China. AGL’s proposal for a floating storage and regasification plant at Crib Point to operate from 2021 is before the Victorian government, which last month said it would have to undergo a full environmental effects inquiry. Some ministers have expressed support for the project. The company said it would make gas supply more certain, reduce the urgency to open more gas fields and put downward pressure on wholesale prices by increasing competition.  Analysts at Macquarie Bank disagree on the last point, finding importing LNG would not lower prices in Victoria and NSW due to the additional cost of processing and new infrastructure. But they said it seemed inevitable at least one terminal would be built to meet demand. The other relatively advanced proposal for an LNG import terminal is by Australian Industrial Energy at Port Kembla. Proposals by ExxonMobil in Gippsland and Venice Energy in Port Adelaide are at an earlier stage. Australia’s LNG industry has expanded rapidly since 2012 to be the world’s second largest. It is expected its value will reach $48bn and it will be responsible for 7% of national emissions by 2020, effectively wiping out the emissions saved from the renewable energy target. Gas bills on Australia’s east coast have skyrocketed as the export industry sucked up most of the available gas to sell at higher prices on international markets. Victoria uses 36% of the gas on the east coast, more than any other state. The state government is considering AGL’s proposal to import gas but has blocked further onshore gas exploration and development. It has a moratorium on conventional onshore gas exploration until 2020 and an outright ban on unconventional gas projects that involve fracking. With the state facing an election on Saturday, premier Daniel Andrews last week pledged to put the fracking ban in the state’s constitution if re-elected. Most analysts said there was no evidence Victoria has a significant onshore gas resource."
"“Wildfires don’t care about wealth or status,” began the New York Times this week, describing the celebrity homes obliterated by fire in California. But what the report didn’t add, leaving it instead to Neil Young’s website, was that climate change cares even less. As President Trump took time out of his busy schedule protecting his hair and insulting the French to blame poor forest management, Young laid it on the line: “As a matter of fact this is not a forest fire that rages on as I write this. We are vulnerable because of climate change.” In the early stages of the climate crisis, it often felt as if the opposite were true: floods, droughts and heatwaves were always somewhere else’s problem, usually the global south, where they could be chalked up to some pre-existing vulnerability, in a shoulder-shrugging: “OK, so earthquakes aren’t great, but if they’d had better building regulations …” Times moved on. This year, the global heatwave was so pronounced that even habitual climate sceptics – the Sun newspaper, for example – felt moved to point out that the world appeared to be on fire.  Yet nothing brings the environment closer to home than when it affects people who seem a world away, people such as Miley Cyrus and Cher, who you can’t imagine facing any problem more serious than which diamond shoes to pack. If they can’t escape this reality, then it must be real. Right? If Young was the first celebrity to explicitly name the new normal, there is a distinctive tone to most of the statements: an outpouring not of loss, but of care for the rest of the community, notably, those who have died; statements of gratitude to firefighters; a recognition of what is important – pets, loved ones and other people – versus what is not – bricks, mortar and money. Cyrus and her parter, Liam Hemsworth, have donated $500,000 (£384,000) to victims of the fire. I have no idea what that represents as a proportion of their wealth; still, it’s an unusual and laudable thing, if your first thought, in the face of the charred remains of everything you own, is to give more away. In short, this is a vivid inflection point in the world’s journey, like a public information film about climate change. If all the money in the world won’t protect you, what is the endpoint of any equation where profit is pitted against the environment? If every star’s first thought is of the people they love, and even Robin Thicke’s second thought is of people he only barely knows (“It’s a great community, it’s a community of wonderful people, a lot of parents whose kids go to the same school as my kid. It’s just devastating”), there is a parable here about priorities, and the hierarchy of needs, and the fundamental nourishment of the human spirit, and it’s delivered – unbelievably – by the people with the best tunes. The devil must be spitting feathers; he thought he had those guys sewn up. Climate-change denial is dangerous, not because it has major governments by the throat, but because it is shameless: it will reject the facts on a page, and the evidence before its own eyes. It will blame anyone but the real culprits, and marshal that blame to suit a narrative of scarcity and threat. But there does come a point when rhetoric runs out of road, is swallowed up by a more awesome spectacle; the authentic human response to the bite of a reality that can’t be denied for ever.  "
"On Saturday, at about 12.30pm, I was arrested for obstructing (thoughtfully sitting on) a public highway, namely Lambeth Bridge. I wasn’t alone. In fact, Lambeth wasn’t the only obstructed London bridge: thousands of people of diverse backgrounds and ages occupied five central London bridges for most of 17 November: Southwark, Blackfriars, Waterloo, Westminster and Lambeth. I believe that at least 80 other people were arrested. Climate is increasingly becoming one of the key subjects for artists as they hold their mirror up to society I am adding my support to Extinction Rebellion – a relatively new activist movement aimed at waking up the political system to the truth about the way that humans are responsible for a dramatic change in the world’s ecosystem. The IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) published its latest reports in October, which state that human activity is “likely” to push the average global surface temperature above 1.5C between the years 2030 and 2052. I’m planning on being around for both of these dates, but the problem seems to be that the warmer the planet gets, the faster the pace of climatic changes such as melting ice caps. This changes sea levels and currents, and results in less heat reflection from the lovely white caps – so the temperature goes up. This new heat releases the proverbial “methane dragon” currently partially trapped under the (melting) tundra ice. More frequent climate disasters are already happening across the globe, and these seem set to only increase. The international art world, to which I’m attached, requires the traffic of heavy art objects all over the globe – the cultural ebb and flow of images and ideas certainly has a huge carbon footprint. So I guess direct action is needed in this area too. And climate is increasingly becoming one of the key subjects for artists as they hold their mirrors up to society. We can get together to solve this, and every person has a moral imperative to be a part of the movement. Having myself arrested was like laying down a marker; an action that enables a quiet but resonant solidarity with those who want to see our government and the media wake up to the incontrovertible evidence that humans do have to deal with the issue of their effect on the climate … and can this start to happen ASAP, please? • Gavin Turk is an artist"
"Dozens of campaigners blocked the roads around Parliament Square to highlight concerns about the environment on Saturday. About 50 activists from Extinction Rebellion, a direct action group that has been coordinating a campaign of civil disobedience which has brought areas of the capital to a standstill in recent weeks, risked arrest by standing defiantly in roads in front of queueing traffic. An estimated 1,000 more demonstrators, many clad in black clothing, massed on the green in Parliament Square for what organisers labelled a “memorial service” to mourn the loss of life on the planet. Many waved banners emblazoned with slogans including “System change, not climate change” and “Rebel for life” as they listened to speeches. One older woman superglued her hands to a railing outside Buckingham Palace in protest. Scotland Yard confirmed that 14 protesters had been arrested for criminal damage during the day. Campaigners said the protest, named “Rebellion Day 2”, aimed to highlight “the government’s failure to recognise and act on the ecological and climate emergency”. It follows similar events last weekend, when 82 people were arrested following staged sit-ins on five bridges crossing the Thames. Among the campaigners blocking four roads entering Parliament Square on Saturday was Nicki Myers, 45, from Cambridge. Myers, who uses a wheelchair and suffers from the lung condition pulmonary fibrosis and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, said she was prepared to be arrested in the attempt to raise awareness about the environment. Sitting in front of traffic and clutching a banner with the slogan “Rebel for life cos we can’t breathe”, she said: “I’m mostly here for my granddaughter, Isabel. I’m terrified about of the prospect of society breakdown in her lifetime. I want the government to tell the truth and do something.” She said she was ready to be arrested to bring about a change in policy “if that’s what it takes”, adding: “I’ve never done anything like this before. It’s quite scary.” Lying down in the road nearby with his head resting on a backpack, 82-year-old protester Phil Kingston said he too was prepared to be arrested in the name of raising awareness for the environment. The pensioner, a retired university lecturer, said he had been arrested three times during Extinction Rebellion demonstrations in the past fortnight. “I have four grandchildren and nothing is more important to me than their security,” he said. “And that security is being eroded all the time by an economy that is pumping fossil fuels in the air when already we are heading for disaster. I’m not accepting it. I don’t mind going to prison.” A young woman called Zappi, who did not wish to give her second name, also said she was willing to be arrested despite acknowledging the potential for it to harm her future prospects. The student, holding one end of a large sign reading, “Tell the truth”, said: “I feel like getting arrested is very small compared to the fact that potentially we could destroy our planet.” Helen, 43, travelled from Ipswich with her four-year-old daughter, Lucy, to join the demonstration for the day. Sitting on a blanket in Parliament Square, the court transcriber said: “The truth is that the world is collapsing environmentally. The state of the world has become serious. The government seem almost insane in the way they are completely ignoring it. I’d like to see them treating it like it’s an emergency.” A second world war memorial in Whitehall, honouring the work of women during the conflict, was graffitied during the protest. Other campaigners later rubbed off the spray-painted message, which read “MOTHER”. Scotland Yard confirmed that a suspect had been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage in relation to the graffiti. The 6.7-metre (22ft) bronze sculpture, which cost £1.3m, was unveiled by the Queen in 2005 to pay tribute to the millions of women who contributed to the war effort. After spotting the graffitied war memorial, campaigner Catherine Jones rushed to a local shop to buy nail polish remover and cotton pads to clean it off. The hospital worker, who helps run arts activities for patients, told the Guardian she did not want the graffiti to detract from the message of the day. Jones, who brought her one-year-old daughter, Louise, to the demonstration, added that she did not agree with the graffiti. “I just don’t like it. It’s not helpful,” she said. “I think the day should be remembered by the performing element of it, which I thought was phenomenal. The message is strong. Yes, we are going to disrupt the traffic and yes, we are meant to get people a little bit annoyed at it.” Activists were also spotted daubing graffiti on the road outside Downing Street. During the protest, campaigners carried a mock coffin in a funeral-style procession and took part in a mass sit-down protest for around 10 minutes outside the gates of Downing Street, chanting: “Climate justice, when do we want it? Now.” Several protesters also lay down in front of the gates."
"France is pushing the UK to incorporate future European climate change directives into law automatically in return for an ambitious trade deal with the EU. A large number of member states fear that the UK could enjoy an economic advantage after Brexit if it were able to diverge from European laws and regulations, and they want to use their leverage now to force a commitment from future British governments. The demand by Emmanuel Macron for the UK to be tied into the EU’s Paris 2030 targets was just one of a series of interventions made by member states during recent meetings with Michel Barnier and his negotiating team. While a UK withdrawal agreement dealing with citizens’ rights, the £39bn financial settlement and the Irish border have been agreed in principle, the political declaration on the future relationship is yet to be finalised. A seven-page declaration published last week is set to become a much heavier document after member states made a series of interventions in meetings with the European commission for additional text. One EU diplomat said: “It’s a Christmas tree and all the member states are putting their baubles on it.” Olly Robbins, Downing Street’s Brexit adviser, was in Brussels this weekend for meetings with the commission. On Sunday, ambassadors for the 27 member states are to meet Barnier to discuss the text. Negotiations will have to be completed when ministers for the 27 meet on Monday, with a draft due to be made public on Tuesday. Downing Street is hopeful that the political declaration can be a “sweetener” to the withdrawal agreement, which has faced a storm of protest in Britain. On Saturday, Commons leader Andrea Leadsom insisted there was “more to be done” before a special European council meeting on Sunday 25 November to get “the best possible deal for the UK”. But the extra demands on the UK are likely to be unwelcome to Brexiters, who fear that the government is allowing the UK to be permanently sucked into the EU’s regulatory orbit. While the UK is a leading light among the EU member states on climate change, the French government is concerned that in a post-Brexit world there will be calls within Britain to undercut the rest of the continent. The EU has been steadily ratcheting up its targets as part of the 2015 Paris climate change accord, and France wants the UK to be bound to them. Last week the European parliament adopted energy-savings targets of 32.5% and a renewable energy uplift of 32% by 2030. That will put the bloc on course to cut emissions by 45% from 1990 levels by 2030. The most politically sensitive demand from the EU is likely, however, to concern the trade-off the bloc wants to make between access for the European fishing fleet to British waters and the wider trade deal. It is understood that a clause will be included in the political declaration making a link between British companies having access to the European market, and maintaining the “existing reciprocal access to fishing waters and resources”. The EU wants a deal on access to UK waters by July 2020, with the UK being tied to making its “best endeavour” to get an agreement, or British exporters will face a loss of access to its market for their own goods. A number of member states are also championing more positive language in the political declaration on the future trading relationship. One diplomat from a European country on the western fringe of the EU said: “The relationship as sketched out in the political declaration doesn’t do enough for us. It doesn’t protect the supply lines and we should aim higher, and lock ourselves in to achieve more.” Andrew Duff, a former MEP, and visiting fellow at the European Policy Centre thinktank, said: “The political declaration needs to do two things – corral the 27 behind a settled course of action leading to an unprecedented association agreement with the UK, and secondly to commit the British prime minister – and if possible her successor – in that same direction. “It can’t be too loose, therefore, but also can’t be so tightly drafted that it pre-empts the association agreement negotiations. It’s the first chance for the EU 27 to plot the future of Europe without the Brits – an important moment, therefore.”"

"It’s been a year of natural disasters. After Irma, Maria, Harvey, hurricane Florence left a devastating landscape in the Caribbean. Extreme temperatures across the northern hemisphere have caused devastating fires from Europe to the US. Dozens have been killed in the Philippines after typhoon Mangkhut triggered landslides. And the worst consequences of climate change are yet to come.  It is a huge challenge for rich countries and for developing nations, a sisyphean task: how to collect enough revenue to respond to major catastrophes, while at the same time trying to lift billions of people out of poverty? Look at Indonesia. Disasters are a familiar tragedy in the world’s fourth most populous nation, with its thousands of islands across hundreds of miles of ocean. This should make disaster risk planning crucial. It is not the case, as the latest earthquake and tsunami showed. Reports revealed that parts of the tsunami alert system didn’t work. In some areas, there were no sirens at all. The death toll is still climbing. Indonesia is the largest economy in south-east Asia and is projected to become the fourth largest economy in the world by 2050, behind China, the US and the EU. However, this prediction depends on its capacity to secure sufficient public revenue. It is the only way to finance, for example, the preparation and maintenance of earthquake-resistant buildings and infrastructure and warning systems. Natural disasters tend to worsen economic inequality in already critical situations, such as that in Indonesia. While many have been lifted out of poverty in the past two decades, the gap between the rich and the poor has grown faster than in any other south-east Asian country. The government now has an ambitious medium term strategy to deal with wide wage disparities and dramatically unequal access to infrastructure, education and health services. Addressing all these challenges requires revenue. At an average of 17.6% of GDP, tax collection in the Asia-Pacific region is among the lowest in the world, a level regarded by experts as totally insufficient to achieve sustainable development goals. And with big companies paying less and less taxes, most governments have the same answer: austerity. In the past decade, the average corporate tax rate in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) region has fallen from 30 to 22%, reflecting global trends. While these lower tax rates may attract higher levels of foreign investment, they come at a very high price: less fiscal revenues means less money to construct vital public services and infrastructure, not to mention less money to prepare for the effects of natural disasters. The only winners in this race to the bottom are multinationals, which end up paying almost no taxes. Vito Tanzi, the former head of the IMF’s Tax Policy Division, has branded such tax-avoiding companies “fiscal termites” for eating away the foundations of tax systems around the world. In his recent book, Termites of the State, Tanzi acknowledges that while no fiscal house is fully insulated from these tax pests, developing countries – especially those with mineral resources – are particularly vulnerable. Developing economies such as Indonesia rely heavily on corporate income tax bases. The IMF reports that the revenue lost from tax evasion in developing countries is 1.3 times larger, as a share of GDP, than it is in advanced economies. It’s a tough fight that involves tackling power elites, overcoming deep institutional resistance, pursuing inclusive forms of growth, eliminating unacceptable levels of poverty and building quality health and education systems for all. But the fight back is underway. The global debate about the tax dodging behaviour of unscrupulous multinationals is beginning to pay dividends. Civil society campaigning has led to the creation of a template for country by country reporting which could eventually expose the scale of tax avoidance in the region. The Independent Commission for the Reform of International Corporate Taxation (ICRICT), of which I am a member, is putting forward a bold agenda of international tax rules from a perspective of global public interest rather than advancing national corporate interest. In the last decade Indonesia has made great progress towards its sustainable development goals. What a tragedy it would be therefore if this emerging Asia-Pacific middle class fails to emerge because multinational companies continue to get away with dodging tax and ransacking these nations of their wealth. • Wayne Swan is the former treasurer and deputy prime minister of Australia and a member of the Independent Commission for the Reform of International Corporate Taxation (ICRICT)"
"Earlier this year the government announced plans for a new northern forest. Under the auspices of the Woodland Trust, an area that stretches 120 miles from Hull to Liverpool will be planted with 50 million trees over the next 25 years. In March, the first trees were put in the ground on hills above Bolton, in Greater Manchester, by an “army of planters” composed of local community members, volunteers, funding bodies and MPs. There is, certainly, an urgent environmental need to get trees back in our landscape. We lost more ancient woods – tens of thousands of them – in the 40 years after the second world war than in the previous 400 years. The UK has only 13% woodland cover, compared with the European average of 37%. Quite apart from being beautiful things, trees – like all vegetation – absorb CO2 from the atmosphere, and the northern forest is intended to help the UK government meet its carbon emissions target by 2050.  But there’s a much more effective way of re-establishing trees in the wider countryside than putting a spade in the ground – and one that has far greater benefits for biodiversity, carbon sequestration and the trees’ health, and that would save us a fortune in financial and environmental costs. And that is natural regeneration – let the trees plant themselves. The reason this doesn’t happen nowadays is our demonisation of thorny scrub. Hawthorn, blackthorn, dog-rose, gorse and bramble are nature’s barbed wire. These species provide saplings with protection from browsing by deer and rabbits; shelter from the wind; a buffer against drought and excessive rain; and nutrients via mutual mycorrhizal connections underground. Thorny scrub is also one of the most biodiverse habitats – providing a rich source of berries, seeds, nectar, pollen and nuts for small mammals, insects and birds, as well as protection from predators. But we’ve forgotten about this precious resource in recent times. In the days before plastics and mass manufacture, thorny scrub provided us with charcoal, medicines, dyes, food, fodder, thatching, furniture, gunpowder and tools. Above all, it was valued as a nursery for trees. “The thorn is the mother of the oak” is an ancient forestry saying. Thorny scrub was considered so valuable that a 1768 statute in the New Forest imposed three months’ forced labour and lashes of the whip on anyone found extracting it. Now, however, we consider scrub “wasteland” and eradicate it wherever it appears, and even on nature reserves, volunteers spend weekends“scrub-bashing”. The modern system of establishing trees relies entirely on humans, and saplings produced in nurseries. Even with a volunteer workforce this is expensive. Ultimately the northern forest is expected to cost £500m. And it is manifestly inefficient. Commercial saplings – bare-root “whips” – are vulnerable, and can easily dry out and die before, or even after, they’re planted. They are not as well connected to the soil as naturally established seedlings, and often lack the appropriate fungal associates. They need to be individually protected by tree guards, almost invariably carbon-intensive polypropylene cylinders tied with plastic ties to treated wooden stakes. Even if the areas to be planted are protected from deer by a perimeter fence, tree guards are poor protection against burrowing rabbits and voles, which cannot be fenced out. Humidity inside the tubes can induce rot and mildews. Using saplings from commercial nurseries also carries a risk of importing disease. Chalara, or ash dieback, was spread into the UK this way. And anyway, is one enormous plantation what we want for our northern forest? Closed-canopy woodland is remarkably species-poor. Even ancient woodland is not the biodiverse wonderland it is often held to be. Species monitoring in Lady Park Wood in the Forest of Dean and the Mens Nature Reserve in Sussex – considered to be some of our oldest surviving stands of trees – shows a downward trajectory for biodiversity. There may be saproxylic (dead-wood-specialising) fungi and beetles in these densely shaded woods, but there is precious little else. With no sunlight, there’s no birdsong, no thrum of pollinating insects, no wildflowers. Herein lies the great “forest” misconception. Underpinning the northern forest project is the idea that Britain was originally ubiquitous closed-canopy woodland. Before human impact, it’s said, a squirrel could have run from John o’Groats to Land’s End on the tops of trees. Dense forest tends to be the state we aspire to when aiming for nature restoration. But this is the stuff of fairytales. Many of our shrubs and trees – including hazel, wild apple, wild pear, wild cherry, rowan, dogwood, common privet, Scots pine and oak (that quintessentially English tree) – are light-demanding species that cannot regenerate in closed-canopy conditions. They point to a much more open landscape – a wood-pasture system driven by free-roaming herds of grazing and browsing animals, where trees regenerated out in the open, within thorny scrub. This is the landscape described by Oliver Rackham, our late, great woodland expert, as the “wildwood”. It is the landscape of the New Forest and all the other hunting forests of medieval England – a dynamic mosaic of gigantic open-grown trees and groves of all species and ages, grazing “lawns”, water meadows and thorny scrub. Paradise for wildlife. Far better for biodiversity and the taxpayer would be to allow small mammals, the wind and birds to do the tree planting for us. A single jay can plant 7,500 acorns in four weeks. Carrying these highly calorific oak nuts in its gullet, six at a time, the jay flies away to bury them a commodious distance from the parent oak tree, often in, or near, protective thorny scrub, as a store for feeding itself through the winter and its young in spring. The acorns that are not recovered by the jay end up developing into saplings. Rewilding – enabling natural processes to function as they are meant to – allows the jay and all the other seed dispersers to do their job. But this is not something that organisations like the Woodland Trust have embraced with any real enthusiasm. Their fundraising model depends on grant aid, and the messy, competitive, variable responses of nature do not fit within a grant system that requires precise costs, targets and predictability. The appeal of physically digging a hole and planting a tree is also a powerful way of recruiting donors and volunteers. If charities simply left it to nature, a major means of forging those relationships would vanish. It’s encouraging that in June the government appointed its first “tree champion”, William Worsley, the former president of the Country Landowners Association. As well as protecting existing trees he will spearhead the planting of millions of new ones. But I urge him to rethink how we do this – and to consider areas where we could return to the richer forest systems of old, to the wildwood, a landscape naturally imbued with spirit of place, where the thorn can once again be the “mother of the oak”. • Isabella Tree is the author of Wilding: The Return of Nature to a British Farm"
"Waste fish parts will be used to power ships in a new initiative to use green energy for polluting cruise liners. The leftovers of fish processed for food and mixed with other organic waste will be used to generate biogas, which will then be liquefied and used in place of fossil fuels by the expedition cruise line Hurtigruten.  Heavy fossil fuels used by ocean-going transport are an increasing problem as they are even more polluting than fuels for land-based vehicles, emitting sulphur and other contaminants. The fuels contribute to air pollution as well as to climate change. Converting vessels to use biogas will cut down on pollutants and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Hurtigruten operates a fleet of 17 ships, and by 2021 aims to have converted at least six of its vessels to use biogas, liquefied natural gas – a fossil fuel, but cleaner than many alternatives – and large battery packs, capable of storing energy produced from renewable sources. The 125-year-old company, based in Norway, is also banning single-use plastics in an effort to be more environmentally sustainable. It operates cruises in the Arctic and Antarctic, both highly sensitive environments. Biogas can be generated from most forms of organic waste by speeding up and harnessing the natural decomposition process to capture the methane produced. Organic waste is produced by all food industries but is frequently disposed of in landfill, where it contributes to greenhouse gas emissions as it decomposes. Shipping has come under increasing scrutiny as many vessels use heavy fuel oil, which is cheap but would be banned on land for its polluting qualities. The daily greenhouse gas emissions from the world’s largest cruise liners can be as great as those of a million cars on the road. Battery power is also a promising technology for ocean-going transport, but building batteries powerful enough has been a problem to date. Advances in battery manufacture are making it possible to install batteries big enough to last a voyage. Hurtigruten is currently building three new hybrid-powered cruise ships in Norway, to be delivered in the next three years. Daniel Skjeldam, the chief executive of Hurtigruten, said: “Norway is a large shipping nation, but fishery and forestry are also large sectors. They create jobs and produce income, but they also produce a lot of waste products. The steady access to high volumes of organic waste gives the Nordic countries a unique position on the biogas market. We are pushing for more innovation, more investment. I believe we have just seen the beginning of what in a few years will be a huge sector.”"
"When the semi-state company that harvests Ireland’s peatlands recently announced the closure of 17 bogs, the news was greeted as the end of an era. Turning the soggy landscape that covers much of Ireland’s midlands into a fuel source had been a great national project, an ambitious undertaking launched by the republic’s founding fathers in the 1930s. Draining and cutting hundreds of thousands of hectares of turf on an industrial scale generated desperately needed jobs and reduced dependence on oil imports for almost a century. So there was some nostalgia last month when Bord na Móna, the peat-harvesting company, announced it was closing 17 of its “active bogs” and would close the remaining 45 within seven years. Nostalgia but also acceptance, given the growing awareness that harvesting peat emits greenhouse gases that worsen climate change, requiring a shift to renewable energy. “Decarbonisation is the biggest challenge facing this planet,” said Tom Donnellan, the company’s chief executive.  The announcement followed promises by the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, to make Ireland a global leader in protecting the planet, backed by a €22bn (£19.5bn) government plan for climate action. A progressive force on social issues, Ireland would also become a beacon for the environment. The problem, according to environmentalists and academics, is that it is all hot air. Renouncing bog harvesting, they say, is too little, too late – a false solace because the ravaged peatlands will continue to emit greenhouse gases. And the government’s climate leadership pledge, they say, does not cancel out a dismal environmental record that has left Ireland potentially facing up to €600m in fines for missing emissions targets. John Sweeney, a climate expert and geography professor at Maynooth University, said: “Climate change requires long-term thinking but the political cycle is much shorter and that of economically vested interest groups is shorter still.” Peatlands, formed by the accumulation of decayed vegetation, help regulate the climate by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing carbon within the peat. As fuel, it is more damaging than coal, generating less energy when burned while producing higher carbon emissions. Depending on how it is calculated, the peat industry contributes between 3m and 6m of the 62m tonnes of greenhouse gases that Ireland emits each year. Bord na Móna appears to be morphing from climate villain to climate champion. Its annual peat harvest is forecast to tumble: from 3m tonnes in 2015 to an estimated 2m in 2020 and less than 1m by 2025. Its power plant in Edenderry, County Offaly, still burns peat, but relies increasingly on biomass. During the 2017-18 financial year renewable energy, including wind and solar, accounted for more than 60% of the company’s power generation. Pat Sammon, a spokesman at the company’s headquarters in Newbridge, County Kildare, on the edge of the 370 sq miles of the Bog of Allen, said: “We’re heading to a new era because the main business of the company had been extracting peat and that’s falling away now.” But environmental experts are unimpressed. “It’s a bit of a smokescreen. It’s all revenue-driven,” said Florence Renou-Wilson, a research scientist and peatland expert at University College Dublin. Bord na Móna was closing bogs that were exhausted and no longer profitable, she said. “They’re all done and dusted.” The company was seeking new markets for peat in horticulture, she said, and, worse, it seldom “re-wet” used bogs, so the ravaged land continued to emit greenhouse gases. “They’ve just been leaving them abandoned.” Harvested peatlands – Bord na Móna’s as well as those developed by private operators – produce about 2.6m tonnes of “fugitive” emissions a year. Rehabilitation could make many of the bogs carbon neutral or even carbon sinks. Catherine O’Connell, the head of the Irish Peatland Conservation Council, said Bord na Móna’s decarbonisation talk was spin. “It’s genius what they’ve done. They’ve come out of this looking green. But they’re miners – they remove the living surface of the bog and dig down. Death by a thousand cuts.” As an environmental policy goal, ending the cutting and burning of peat should have been “low-hanging fruit”, said Tony Lowes, the director of the group Friends of the Irish Environment. “But we have struggled to truly bring it under control because of its emotional attachment and cultural heritage.” Environmentalists say this fits a pattern of state authorities ducking climate commitments. Ireland emits 13 tonnes of greenhouse gases per person a year, the third-highest level in the EU. The UK emits eight tonnes per person. Under EU commitments, by 2020 Ireland is supposed to cut emissions by 20% from 1990 levels. The target for 2030 is 40%. Ireland is on track to exceed the first target by 16m tonnes and the latter by 50m tonnes, triggering fines estimated to range from €230m to €600m. Last month, David Boyd, a UN special rapporteur on human rights, said Dublin’s failure to tackle climate change breached human rights. He made the comments in a legal submission to support a court case brought by Friends of the Irish Environment, accusing the government of “knowingly contributing to dangerous levels of climate change”. Earlier this year, Varadkar raised expectations of a rise in carbon tax, widely seen as a basic, vital step to curbing emissions. But last month’s budget left it unchanged at €20 a tonne. Critics said the government flunked climate commitments for fear of a voter backlash, a pattern set when it backed a dramatic surge in dairy and beef farming, pleasing rural voters and business interests but derailing emission goals. Richard Bruton, the minister for climate action and environment, acknowledged last week that Ireland was “far off course” and announced a plan to make every department responsive to climate change. • This article was amended on 27 November 2018 because an earlier version mistakenly said the power plant in Edenderry no longer burns peat. This has been corrected. "
"A rare sighting of sperm whales in the Canadian Arctic is the latest sign of a quickly changing ecosystem, say scientists, as a growing number of species expand their range into warming Arctic waters. Brandon Laforest, a marine biologist with the World Wildlife Fund, and guide Titus Allooloo were working on a project monitoring the effect of marine traffic on the region’s narwhal population when they spotted the pair of large whales just outside Pond Inlet, a community at the northern tip of Baffin Island in September. Video of the incident, released at the end of October, captures the second known sighting of sperm whales in the region. In 2014, hunters from Pond Inlet spotted them in the area. At first, Allooloo and Laforest thought the dark shapes in the water were killer whales – another species that has become a frequent visitor to the waters as temperatures creep up. But the distinct shape of the dorsal fin surprised Allooloo – a veteran hunter. “They’re not known by us, we don’t know too much about them,” Allooloo told the CBC. While a number of whales species thrive year-round in the Arctic, including beluga, bowhead and narwhal, the physiology of a sperm whale makes it difficult for them to navigate colder waters. Their heads and upper parts of the body are soft and contain an oily fat – long prized by whalers – that turns waxy in cold waters. Their bodies – which can weigh as much as 125,000lb (56,700kg) – are also ineffective at breaking through ice. While they don’t represent a threat to the ecosystem, there are worries sperm whale could become trapped as winter approaches. “Inexperienced whales exploiting a northern habitat may not know to leave early enough before the sea ice forms,” Laforest told the CBC. The vast area of the Arctic waters – estimated by Canadian researchers to measure 5.5m sq miles - makes it difficult for scientists to effectively track changes in the ecosystem, including the arrival of previously unreported species. Baseline datasets are also rare, making trend gathering difficult. Increasingly, researchers are working with Inuit communities, which have a long oral history of species in the region. In recent years, killer whales, or orcas, have also become more frequent in a number, taking advantage of longer ice-free seasons. The whales, which feast on resident narwhal, have even started changing narwhal behaviour, according to a 2017 report by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. “I think the narwhal are scared to death,” report co-author Steve Ferguson told the Canadian Press. “Watching your brother or sister or mother get killed and eaten by a killer whale would cause a little post-traumatic stress in most of us.” A recent presentation by the department also highlighted a spike in chum salmon populations the western Arctic – in numbers far greater than previously recorded. Warming temperatures have also prompted interest in the potential for expanded commercial fishing in the Arctic. In response, nine countries have agreed to ban fishing in the region until a more thorough study of the ecosystem can be completed."
"China, Russia and Canada’s current climate policies would drive the world above a catastrophic 5C of warming by the end of the century, according to a study that ranks the climate goals of different countries. The US and Australia are only slightly behind with both pushing the global temperature rise dangerously over 4C above pre-industrial levels says the paper, while even the EU, which is usually seen as a climate leader, is on course to more than double the 1.5C that scientists say is a moderately safe level of heating. The study, published on Friday in the journal Nature Communications, assesses the relationship between each nation’s ambition to cut emissions and the temperature rise that would result if the world followed their example. The aim of the paper is to inform climate negotiators as they begin a two-year process of ratcheting up climate commitments, which currently fall far short of the 1.5-to-2C goal set in France three years ago. The related website also serves as a guide to how nations are sharing the burden of responding to the greatest environmental threat humankind has ever faced. Among the major economies, the study shows India is leading the way with a target that is only slightly off course for 2C. Less developed countries are generally more ambitious, in part because they have fewer factories, power plants and cars, which means they have lower emissions to rein in. On the opposite side of the spectrum are the industrial powerhouse China and major energy exporters who are doing almost nothing to limit carbon dioxide emissions. These include Saudi Arabia (oil), Russia (gas) and Canada, which is drawing vast quantities of dirty oil from tar sands. Fossil fuel lobbies in these countries are so powerful that government climate pledges are very weak, setting the world on course for more than 5C of heating by the end of the century. Only slightly better are the group of countries that are pushing the planet beyond 4C. Among them are the US, which has huge emissions from energy, industry and agriculture somewhat offset by promises of modest cuts and more renewables. Australia, which remains heavily dependent on coal exports, is also in this category. The wealthy shopping societies of Europe fare slightly better – largely because emissions on products are calculated at the source of manufacture rather than the point of consumption – but the authors of the paper say their actions lag behind their promises to set a positive example. “It is interesting is to see how far out some countries are, even those that are considered leaders in the climate mitigation narrative,” said the study’s author, Yann Robiou du Pont of Melbourne University. The study is likely to be controversial. Under the Paris agreement, there is no top-down consensus on what is a fair share of responsibility. Instead each nation sets its own bottom-up targets according to a number of different factors, including political will, level of industrialisation, ability to pay, population size, historical responsibility for emissions. Almost every government, the authors say, selects an interpretation of equity that serves their own interests and allows them to achieve a relative gain on other nations. To get around these differing concepts of fairness, the paper assesses each nation by the least stringent standards they set themselves and then extrapolates this to the world. In doing so, the authors say they can “operationalise disagreements”. Taking account of the different interpretations, they say the world needs to commit to a virtual 1.4C target in order to achieve a 2C goal. They hope their equity metric can be used in next month’s UN climate talks in Katowice and in climate litigation cases. The authors said the study could in future be extended to the subnational level, such as individual US states. They also note that a few key sectors are currently omitted, including land-use change (which is fundamental in rapidly deforesting nations such as Brazil, Argentina and Indonesia), international shipping and aviation. Although the study highlights the huge gap between political will and scientific alarm, Robiou du Pont said it should inspire rather than dispirit people. “The positive outcome of this study is that we have a metric to assess the ratcheting up of ambition. Civil society, experts and decision-makers can use this to hold their governments accountable, and possibly undertake climate litigation cases as happened recently in the Netherlands,” he said. “This metric translates the lack of ambition on a global scale to a national scale. If we look at the goal of trying to avoid damage to the Earth, then I am pessimistic as this is already happening. But this should be a motivation to ratchet up ambition and avoid global warming as much and as rapidly as possible. Every fraction of a degree will have a big impact.” Commenting on the study, other academics said it could be used by anyone to show how climate action can be navigated in a world in which each country ranks itself based on what they consider to be fair. “This paper provides a means for countries to check how their contribution might be perceived by other countries and thus judge whether they are perceived as a climate leader or laggard,” said Joeri Rogelj of Imperial College London."

"Spain has launched an ambitious plan to switch its electricity system entirely to renewable sources by 2050 and completely decarbonise its economy soon after. By mid-century greenhouse gas emissions would be slashed by 90% from 1990 levels under Spain’s draft climate change and energy transition law.  To do this, the country’s social democratic government is committing to installing at least 3,000MW of wind and solar power capacity every year in the next 10 years ahead. New licences for fossil fuel drills, hydrocarbon exploitation and fracking wells, will be banned, and a fifth of the state budget will be reserved for measures that can mitigate climate change. This money will ratchet upwards from 2025. Christiana Figueres, a former executive secretary of the UN’s framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC), hailed the draft Spanish law as “an excellent example of the Paris agreement”. She added: “It sets a long-term goal, provides incentives on scaling up emissions technologies and cares about a good transition for the workforce.” Under the plan, “just transition” contracts will be drawn up, similar to the £220m package announced in October, that will shut most Spanish coalmines in return for a suite of early retirement schemes, re-skilling in clean energy jobs, and environmental restoration. These deals will be partly financed by auction returns from the sale of emissions rights. The government has already scrapped a controversial “sun tax” that halted Spain’s booming renewables sector earlier this decade, and the new law will also mandate a 35% electricity share for green energy by 2030. James Watson, chief executive of the SolarPower Europe trade association, said the law was “a wake-up call to the rest of the world”. Energy efficiency will also be improved by 35% within 11 years, and government and public sector authorities will be able to lease only buildings that have almost zero energy consumption. Laurence Tubiana, chief executive of the European Climate Foundation, and former French climate envoy who helped draft the Paris accord, described the agreement as groundbreaking and inspirational. “By planning on going carbon neutral, Spain shows that the battle against climate change is deadly serious, that they are ready to step up and plan to reap the rewards of decarbonisation,” she said. However, the government’s hold on power is fragile. With just a quarter of parliamentary seats it will depend on the more leftwing Podemos and liberal Ciudadanos parties to pass the climate plan. No dates were included in the legislation for phaseouts of coal or nuclear energy, and a ban on new cars with petrol or diesel engines was delayed until 2040."
"The UN agency responsible for cutting shipping emissions to combat climate change has been accused of operating like a secretive closed shop. The charity Transparency International has condemned six countries, including the UK and the US, for opposing moves to open the International Maritime Organization to public scrutiny and hampering moves to combat climate change.  The IMO regulates global shipping and is coordinating a ban on high-sulphur shipping fuel by 2020. The Guardian reported this month that the IMO has allowed what critics call an “emissions cheat” system to be installed onboard ships to dodge the clean fuel regulations. But the system is likely to lead to pollutants being dumped at sea instead of stored in facilities on land, according to critics. The IMO set up a working group to tackle accusations earlier this year from Transparency International that it is secretive and disproportionately influenced by the private shipping industry and an unequal influence of certain member states. Transparency International said it was concerned that moves by the UK, the US, the Cook Islands, Marshall Islands, Panama and the United Arab Emirates could hamper reform at the UN agency and damage moves to tackle climate change and clean up the shipping industry. Last month these countries criticised moves to make the UN agency more transparent. They said “further expansion of access to information” about the agency “could lead to outside influence”, according to Transparency International. Rueben Lifuka, the vice-chair of Transparency International, said: “Unfortunately the IMO is far too susceptible to disproportionate influence from private interests and certain member states, meaning that there could be obstacles to meeting the targets for emissions reduction set earlier this year. “The agency needs to move towards a more open and transparent way of operating, with greater opportunities for public scrutiny and civil society engagement. The stakes are too high for the entire planet for the IMO to continue to operate as a closed shop.” A spokesperson for the IMO said it would decide the terms of reference for the working group on Monday. The working group would then meet and discuss the issues referred to it, reporting back to the IMO council by Friday. In April 2018, the IMO’s parine environment protection committee set a target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from shipping by at least 50% by 2050 compared with 2008, consistent with the goals of the Paris agreement. The global shipping fleet is rushing to meet the 2020 IMO deadline to reduce air pollution by forcing vessels to use cleaner fuel with a lower sulphur content of 0.5%, compared with 3.5% as currently used. The move comes after growing concerns about the health impacts of shipping emissions. A report in Nature this year said 400,000 premature deaths a year are caused by emissions from dirty shipping fuel, which also account for 14m childhood asthma cases per year."
"A milestone plan to impose America’s first ever price on carbon pollution failed to win enough votes in Washington state, on a tough night for environmentalists who had pinned their hopes on a number of climate change-related ballot measures across the country. A majority of Washington state voters in the midterm elections rejected a measure, known as Initiative 1631, that would have put a $15 fee on each ton of carbon dioxide emitted in the state, with the funds used to bolster various renewable energy projects. It is the third time an attempt to implement carbon pricing has been thwarted in Washington, a progressive state in the Pacific north-west with just one, soon-to-close coal power plant and a glut of hydroelectricity. The glaring ballot failure threatens prospects of moving quickly enough to avert disastrous climate change. “It’s a setback because nothing really happens at a federal level until it happens in the states – just look at gay marriage,” said Heidi Peltier, an expert in low-carbon policy at the University of Massachusetts. “If we are going to have a carbon tax nationally, we need to have enough states doing it. Washington state had a chance to be one of the leaders.” Carbon pricing has been backed by a broad range of economists as the most efficient way of driving down emissions, with the European Union and, more recently, Canada, embracing the idea. A recent UN report, which warned of dire consequences if planetary warming isn’t urgently curbed, suggested a fee much higher than $15 a ton. Initiative 1631, which followed a similar ballot measure that failed two years ago, aimed to raise $2.2bn over five years and help Washington slash its greenhouse gas emissions by a quarter by 2025.  However, voters rejected the initiative because “they understood it was a flawed initiative that would have raised consumer costs substantially while doing very little to meet carbon reduction goals in the state”, according to Catherine Reheis-Boyd, president of the Western States Petroleum Association, which spearheaded the no vote. Oil giant BP and others spent $30m opposing carbon pricing. Environmentalists vowed to persevere. “While we still believe that a carbon fee would be a helpful solution, we can and must do more to find and adopt other creative solutions to slow global warming,” said Bruce Speight, director of Environment Washington. A spokesman for the yes on the 1631 campaign said the group hadn’t conceded defeat yet.  “The oil industry spent the most money in our state’s history and were willing to lie to voters about their support and mislead them on the facts,” he said. The Washington vote was just one green-tinged measure rejected by voters. In Colorado, the fossil fuel industry spent more than $40m to help defeat a proposal requiring oil and gas wells to be half a mile from homes, schools and waterways. Meanwhile, Arizona voters said no to Proposition 127, which would have mandated the state obtain half its energy needs from renewable sources such as wind and solar by 2030.  Climate activists enjoyed a win in Florida, however, with voters backing a ban on all offshore drilling for oil and gas in state waters.  There was further encouragement for environmentalists at the prospect of a Democrat-held House of Representatives probing the activity of the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Interior, as well as the election of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Deb Haaland and Ilhan Omar – all House Democrats who favour a transition to 100% renewable energy. The current Democratic leadership is not, however, understood to have large-scale plans to tackle the climate change crisis. And the midterms highlighted the ongoing clout of the fossil fuel industry and the vast gulf between the current slow pace of emissions reduction and the action that scientists say is required to stave off the worst impacts of heatwaves, flooding, extreme weather and losses of animal species. “Environmentalists still have a challenge in their messaging, there’s still the impression that carbon pricing or regulations will make everything more expensive,” said Peltier. “Oil, gas and coal can put a lot of money into ballot initiatives they see as detrimental to their future and put out information on climate change that isn’t real. There’s a real disparity there.” Environmental advocates at a post-election press conference in Washington DC, largely claimed victory as Democrats won back the House and many governors pledged to phase out fossil fuels, but they acknowledged they are still in an uphill battle. “We didn’t win everywhere, and we know that,” said Wendy Wendlandt, senior vice-president for the Environment America Action Fund. “I think that’s on us as the environmental community to figure out how to connect the concern we know exists with environmental voters at the ballot box.” “It is true that we have been able to make progress over the last couple years,” said the Sierra Club executive director, Mike Brune, noting environmental successes. “But it is also true that we are in a fight. We are in a bitter fight, a divisive fight.” Tom Steyer, the California billionaire whose group financed the Arizona renewable power measure, said Democrats can’t wait for Republicans to come to the table as the science shows a need for immediate action. “If we want to succeed by 2030, it is completely unclear to me that there are Republicans that are willing to compromise on this,” Steyer said.

"Woodside Petroleum chief executive, Peter Coleman, has joined mining giants BHP and Rio Tinto in calling for a price on carbon to help with emissions reduction targets and the transition to renewable energy. But the energy minister, Angus Taylor, has claimed Australia doesn’t need a carbon price as emissions levels are coming down – a position at odds with the government’s official emissions data and independent modelling. He also claimed the companies would benefit economically from putting a higher price on carbon – but has not put forward any evidence to support that claim. “There is almost no other country in the world that has the credentials of Australia in reducing carbon emissions,” Taylor told ABC radio on Wednesday. “We are bringing emissions down, and we’re doing extremely well.” The latest government data showed overall greenhouse gas emissions climbed 1.3%, to their highest quarterly levels in eight years. Woodside Petroleum had been an outspoken opponent of carbon pricing under Julia Gillard’s former Labor government. However, its current chief, Coleman, says investors are increasingly concerned about the company’s sustainability measures, and the issue should be dealt with through an appropriate global approach. “We need a price on carbon. We need to ensure the most effective energy gets into the system,” he told the ABC on Tuesday evening. “We don’t want to have perversive outcomes where lowest-cost energy suppliers are competing against renewables, and we end up in a situation where we’ve invested a lot in renewables but in fact see no benefit from a carbon point of view.” Industries such as shipping need to be incentivised to transition to cleaner energy, he added. “If you believe in the science or not really doesn’t matter,” Coleman said. “By the time the science is proven, it will be too late to act. So it’s prudent to act today.”"
"It was a moment of the kind that changes lives. At a press conference held by climate activists Extinction Rebellion last week, two of us journalists pressed the organisers on whether their aims were realistic. They have called, for example, for UK carbon emissions to be reduced to net zero by 2025. Wouldn’t it be better, we asked, to pursue some intermediate aims? A young woman called Lizia Woolf stepped forward. She hadn’t spoken before, but the passion, grief and fury of her response was utterly compelling. “What is it that you are asking me as a 20-year-old to face and to accept about my future and my life? … This is an emergency. We are facing extinction. When you ask questions like that, what is it you want me to feel?” We had no answer. Softer aims might be politically realistic, but they are physically unrealistic. Only shifts commensurate with the scale of our existential crises have any prospect of averting them. Hopeless realism, tinkering at the edges of the problem, got us into this mess. It will not get us out. Public figures talk and act as if environmental change will be linear and gradual. But the Earth’s systems are highly complex, and complex systems do not respond to pressure in linear ways. When these systems interact (because the world’s atmosphere, oceans, land surface and lifeforms do not sit placidly within the boxes that make study more convenient), their reactions to change become highly unpredictable. Small perturbations can ramify wildly. Tipping points are likely to remain invisible until we have passed them. We could see changes of state so abrupt and profound that no continuity can be safely assumed. Only one of the many life support systems on which we depend – soils, aquifers, rainfall, ice, the pattern of winds and currents, pollinators, biological abundance and diversity – need fail for everything to slide. For example, when Arctic sea ice melts beyond a certain point, the positive feedbacks this triggers (such as darker water absorbing more heat, melting permafrost releasing methane, shifts in the polar vortex) could render runaway climate breakdown unstoppable. When the Younger Dryas period ended 11,600 years ago, temperatures rose 10C within a decade. I don’t believe such a collapse is yet inevitable, or that a commensurate response is either technically or economically impossible. When the US joined the second world war in 1941, it replaced a civilian economy with a military economy within months. As Jack Doyle records in his book Taken for a Ride, “In one year, General Motors developed, tooled and completely built from scratch 1,000 Avenger and 1,000 Wildcat aircraft … Barely a year after Pontiac received a navy contract to build anti-shipping missiles, the company began delivering the completed product to carrier squadrons around the world.” And this was before advanced information technology made everything faster. The problem is political. A fascinating analysis by the social science professor Kevin MacKay contends that oligarchy has been a more fundamental cause of the collapse of civilisations than social complexity or energy demand. Control by oligarchs, he argues, thwarts rational decision-making, because the short-term interests of the elite are radically different to the long-term interests of society. This explains why past civilisations have collapsed “despite possessing the cultural and technological know-how needed to resolve their crises”. Economic elites, which benefit from social dysfunction, block the necessary solutions. The oligarchic control of wealth, politics, media and public discourse explains the comprehensive institutional failure now pushing us towards disaster. Think of Donald Trump and his cabinet of multi-millionaires; the influence of the Koch brothers in funding rightwing organisations; the Murdoch empire and its massive contribution to climate science denial; or the oil and motor companies whose lobbying prevents a faster shift to new technologies. It is not just governments that have failed to respond, though they have failed spectacularly. Public sector broadcasters have systematically shut down environmental coverage, while allowing the opaquely funded lobbyists that masquerade as thinktanks to shape public discourse and deny what we face. Academics, afraid to upset their funders and colleagues, have bitten their lips. Even the bodies that claim to be addressing our predicament remain locked within destructive frameworks. Last Wednesday I attended a meeting about environmental breakdown at the Institute for Public Policy Research. Many people in the room seemed to understand that continued economic growth is incompatible with sustaining the Earth’s systems. As the author Jason Hickel points out, a decoupling of rising GDP from global resource use has not happened and will not happen. While 50bn tonnes of resources used per year is roughly the limit the Earth’s systems can tolerate, the world is already consuming 70bn tonnes. At current rates of economic growth, this will rise to 180bn tonnes by 2050. Maximum resource efficiency, coupled with massive carbon taxes, would reduce this at best to 95bn tonnes: still way beyond environmental limits. Green growth, as members of the institute appear to accept, is physically impossible. Yet on the same day, the same institute announced a major new economics prize for “ambitious proposals to achieve a step-change improvement in the growth rate”. It wants ideas that will enable economic growth rates in the UK at least to double. The announcement was accompanied by the usual blah about sustainability, but none of the judges of the prize has a discernible record of environmental interest. Those to whom we look for solutions trundle on as if nothing has changed. As if the accumulating evidence has no purchase on their minds. Decades of institutional failure ensures that only “unrealistic” proposals – the repurposing of economic life, with immediate effect – now have a realistic chance of stopping the planetary death spiral. And only those who stand outside the failed institutions can lead this effort. Two tasks need to be performed simultaneously: throwing ourselves at the possibility of averting collapse, as Extinction Rebellion is doing, slight though this possibility may appear; and preparing ourselves for the likely failure of these efforts, terrifying as this prospect is. Both tasks require a complete revision of our relationship with the living planet. Because we cannot save ourselves without contesting oligarchic control, the fight for democracy and justice and the fight against environmental breakdown are one and the same. Do not allow those who have caused this crisis to define the limits of political action. Do not allow those whose magical thinking got us into this mess to tell us what can and cannot be done. • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"
"The British artist Gavin Turk has said every member of the public will feel the impact of the climate emergency sooner rather than later, after he was arrested during mass civil disobedience in central London. Turk, who was among 82 people arrested during a coordinated occupation of five bridges in the capital, said the pressure to force governments to act to reduce climate change was “the new future”. He was among scores of people arrested for the obstruction of a public highway on Lambeth Bridge on Saturday in a mass protest to force governments to take action on climate change. He was held for several hours and released later the same day. Turk, one of the generation of young British artists who became art superstars in the mid-90s, said he had no regrets about taking part in one of the biggest acts of mass civil disobedience for decades, organised by activists known as Extinction Rebellion.  “It seems like everyone is in an odd sense of denial about climate change,” said Turk. “I was in a quandary about what I could do. I felt taking part was a way of putting my name down and doing something for the environment. It was an incredibly peaceful demonstration and I think we put down some kind of marker. The message is really very slow to get through to people, but it will come to us all, we will all have to deal with the impact of this climate emergency. “I hope this kind of action has caught the public imagination. It is the new future.” The civil disobedience in London was matched by other demonstrations elsewhere in the UK, including in Cambridge. The organisers, Extinction Rebellion, want to force governments to treat the threats of climate breakdown and extinction as a crisis. Five bridges in London, Waterloo, Westminster, Lambeth, Southwark and Blackfriars were occupied for several hours. Organisers said between 4,000 to 6,000 people attended the demonstration. Extinction Rebellion went public with its message at the end of October. Its growth is a sign that it has caught the public imagination and is offering people the chance to make their voices heard about the need to act to stop global warming, said Tiana Jacout, one of the organisers. “To get 4,000 plus people on the streets after such a short time is extraordinary,” said Jacout. “We are saying we don’t need to sit back and watch the slow car crash of humanity. We can do something about it. That has sparked something in people.” The Metropolitan Police said 85 people were arrested on Saturday across the demonstration. That figure was later reduced due to duplicating reports made by officers. In the past two weeks more than 60 people have been arrested for taking part in acts of civil disobedience organised by Extinction Rebellion, ranging from gluing themselves to government buildings to blocking major roads in the capital.  Extinction Rebellion cites the civil rights movement, suffragettes and Mahatma Gandhi as inspirations for its campaigns. The group is calling on the government to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025 and establish a “citizens’ assembly” to devise an emergency plan of action similar to that seen during the second world war. Organisers say they also hope the campaign of “respectful disruption” will change the debate around climate breakdown and signal to those in power the present course of action will lead to disaster. The world’s leading climate change scientists have warned there is only 12 years for global warming to be kept to a maximum of 1.5C, beyond which even half a degree will significantly worsen the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people. The authors of the landmark report by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released last month said urgent and unprecedented changes were needed to reach the target."
"David Attenborough is probably guilty of assuming that his viewers will usually be intelligent enough to join the dots and work out for themselves the implications of what he shows them (George Monbiot: Attenborough has betrayed the living world he loves, 7 November). The people who have a much more serious responsibility for the threadbare coverage the BBC has given to climate change and other environmental crises are the editors who for many years refused to treat climatology as a serious branch of science, and whose notion of “balance” led them to insist on equal airtime for people who, for whatever reason, have denied and often sought to discredit the scientists who say human activities are warming the Earth.Alex KirbyBBC News environment correspondent, 1987-1996 • In David Attenborough’s Dynasty programme he pointedly emphasised the diminishing number of chimpanzees and the threat that gold mining poses.

"Young Australians are frustrated about inaction on climate change – more so when the older generations don’t appear to be doing much about it. From the death of the national energy guarantee to the news the world is “nowhere near on track” to limit warming to less than 1.5C, the concerns of our youngest Australians often find it hard to be heard. Later this week, hundreds of school students are planning to go on strike to protest, and the thousands who aren’t are wondering what they can do instead. On Tuesday 27 November, Guardian Australia will be running My Climate Questions – a live online Q&A for school students and young Australians. You can share your thoughts, discuss your future, and ask leading experts the questions you want answered – whether you are striking or not. It’s your future and your platform to ask about climate science, energy policy and what actions young people can take. My Climate Questions will run from 4pm to 6.30pm AEDT. A panel of experts – including climate scientist Bill Hare, energy expert Simon Holmes à Court, Piper Albrecht from Castlemaine secondary school, the chief executive of the Climate Council, Amanda McKenzie, and Australian Youth Climate Coalition’s Laura Sykes – will be on hand. Submit your questions to myclimatequestions@theguardian.com or on Twitter or Instagram using #MyClimateQuestions. For Twitter or Instagram, you must be over 13 or have a parent or guardian ask on your behalf. The questions, answers and discussion will all be posted on our liveblog for you to follow. If you’ve every wondered: “What is a carbon tax, and why don’t we have one?” or “What will Australia look like when I’m 30?” then write in, film a video with your question, tweet and spread the word. We’re excited to get the conversation going."
"Longer bushfire seasons in Australia and the US threaten to disrupt the sharing of vital personnel and equipment between the two countries, fire experts and coordinators have revealed. At least 50 people have lost their lives in California’s deadliest wildfires, which continue to rage. Fire authorities and scientists say climate change has made the conditions worse.  In July the US requested help from Australia and New Zealand, which sent 188 personnel to help fight the blazes. That group has now returned. For about 20 years, Australia and the US have exchanged personnel and equipment during major fires. But there are fears that, as climate change drives more severe blazes and lengthens fire seasons, those arrangements could be strained.  A fleet of aircraft, including six adapted helicopters and two Hercules water bombers, are also shared – spending the Australian winter fighting fires in the northern hemisphere before being contracted to fight bushfires in Australia’s summer months. “It’s an issue for us,” said Stuart Ellis, the chief executive at the Australasian Fire and Emergency Service Authorities Council – the group responsible for coordinating with other countries to share firefighting personnel and equipment. The problem had “arisen in discussions between ourselves and the US”, he said. “In the US there’s less and less talk of a ‘fire season’ and more a consideration that fire impacts them all through the year.” The arrangement to contract and share the specialist aircraft, which supplement a fleet owned by Australian authorities, had “worked well for many years”. “There’s no question [the aircraft] make a very positive contribution [to fighting fires],” Ellis said. But he said the arrangement “could be challenged in the future and we are considering alternatives – whether that’s using more local aircraft or sourcing others”. This year’s deployment of 188 Australian and New Zealand firefighters followed a group of 240 who crossed the Pacific in 2017. Most of the Australian team is made up of “incident management specialists” – staff trained in a common system used to coordinate and deploy firefighting units.  “In California there are about 4,500 firefighters deployed or available and, at the height of the fires in the western US, there were about 29,000,” Ellis said. “Where we can help is that they tend to have large numbers of firefighters but they run out of incident management specialists.” Ellis has been in the US and Canada during recent deployments and said the intensity of this year’s fires and the conditions that fed them were “unprecedented”. “I think there’s no other plausible explanation than climate change,” he said. “It’s not up to the fire services to say what the cause of that is, but the issue of climate change is one we are applying our minds to because it can have an impact on our resources.” Dr Richard Thornton, the chief executive of the Melbourne-based Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre, said there was already an overlap in the times spent fighting major fires in the US and Australia. “We are now seeing regular fires in the United States – and in California – running into November, and there were fires last year in December that led to mudslides and deaths. In Australia, it appears there’s more fires occurring outside of what we would call the fire season. Clearly then, there’s already an overlap.” The Bureau of Meteorology says Australia’s bushfire season has lengthened, and increasing temperatures and drier conditions have increased the risk of blazes. Thornton said the sorts of conditions that led to catastrophic fire events such as the 2009 Black Saturday fires were “becoming more likely due to climate change”. The lengthening of fire seasons also meant there was less time to carry out controlled burning, he said. He called the loss of life in the California fires “truly tragic” and said there were important lessons to be learned for other parts of the world, including Australia. “We have a lot of people living in that rural-urban interface,” he said. “Some people have lived there for a long time and others have moved there, and we see urban planning schemes that open up those areas for new dwellings. “Then we see very high fuel loads close to those populated areas and changes in demographics, with more vulnerable people there, or getting older there. “Combined with all that, we see conditions for fires occurring more frequently. There’s an increase in the risk, an increase in the exposure to the risk and all that leads to a challenge that countries need to grapple with.”"
"Donald Trump has told reporters he doesn’t believe his own government’s climate change findings that the US economy will suffer substantially with continued warming from greenhouse gas pollution. “I’ve seen it, I’ve read some of it, and it’s fine,” he said outside the White House on Monday. “I don’t believe it.” The report, called the National Climate Assessment, was quietly released the day after Thanksgiving. Also last Friday, the government slipped out another environment internal report with bad news about emissions from oil and gas drilling on federal lands. The Trump administration has tried to downplay the dire findings of the consensus analysis, which concludes climate change could cost the US economy hundreds of billions of dollars and thousands of lives each year in future. A White House spokeswoman said the assessment was “based on the most extreme scenario”, although the report explores the differences in the impacts of climate change based on pollution levels and other factors. “With continued growth in emissions at historic rates, annual losses in some economic sectors are projected to reach hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century – more than the current gross domestic product (GDP) of many US states,” the report says. Regional economies and industries that depend on natural resources and a favorable climate, including agriculture, tourism and fisheries, will suffer, the report finds. As other countries see even worse impacts than the US, Americans will feel the burden through import and export prices and in businesses that have overseas supply chains. The report puts a dollar figure on the economic damages from unmitigated climate change. If greenhouse gas pollution from power plants and cars continues to rise through the 21st century, the US could then see $155bn a year in damages to labor and $118bn a year in damages to coastal property. Lives lost to extreme heat and cold could cost another $141bn a year and the consequences from worsened air quality could equal $26bn a year. Curbing globe-heating pollution would significantly reduce those costs, but the Trump administration has consistently reversed government efforts to slow climate change. The Trump administration also published another report on climate change on Friday, laying out that oil and gas produced from drilling on public land accounted for almost a quarter of carbon dioxide pollution in the US between 2004 and 2015. The information from the US Geological Survey, in the first such report, was requested in 2016 under Barack Obama’s administration.Trump officials have since moved to make it easier for companies to drill on federal land and rescinded standards for the globe-warming methane released by oil and gas operations."
