"The British town of Wainfleet in Lincolnshire is underwater. After two months rain in two days, the River Steeping burst its banks, and 580 homes were evacuated. Curiously, the advice to the town’s remaining residents is to avoid flushing the toilet or using the washing machine whenever possible – advice that is more usually associated with drought rather than flood. The request suggests that Wainfleet’s sewer system is dangerously close to capacity. Using the loo and washing machine not only puts a demand on the water supply system, but it also adds to the flows in the local sewer, which is likely to be very full. Like most towns in Europe, Wainfleet’s town centre was constructed before the 1950s, and will be served by a “combined sewer” that takes both the waste water from toilets and showers, and the rainwater from roofs and roads. This resulting dilute waste water  then needs to be treated before it is discharged into the environment. If the volume of water is too much for the treatment plant to handle then a “combined sewage overflow” will release dilute sewage into rivers and oceans.  It is because of combined sewage overflows that it’s not a good idea to bathe in rivers or beaches after there has been rainfall.   An additional problem in Wainfleet (and many low-lying areas like London, much of the Netherlands or New Orleans in the US) is that the sewer system is lower than the level of the river or sea. This means that the wastewater/rainwater combination does not just need treatment, but it also needs pumping. If there is too much water for the treatment works or pumps to process at any one moment, then water from streets or homes will be unable to enter the sewer system, and dirty water, including dilute sewage, can overflow into rivers, streets and homes. A dramatic example of this happened in Hull in 2007. Just like in Wainfleet, heavy summer rainstorms put pressure on treatment systems and pumps. More than 8,000 homes were flooded, and some people were out of their homes for over a year. Such flooding causes huge physical disruption and challenges people’s mental health. Imagine unexpectedly losing most of your possessions, simultaneously needing to find a new place to live for an unpredictable length of time, having to manage the family routines from a different location, and meanwhile having to negotiate with insurers and builders about the renewal of your home. As climate change threatens to bring more sudden rainstorms, many places are becoming more vulnerable to problems like those in Wainfleet and Hull. One way to address these problems is to slow down the flow of rainwater. The hard surfaces of roads, pavements and pipes, for example, speed up the flow of water. Some agricultural drainage practices may also encourage water to flow rather than waterlog the land. What this all means is that all the water from the rainstorm arrives at the treatment and pumping facilities at the same time. We can address these problems – in Wainfleet as elsewhere – but it will take many small changes to the way people manage their water. All over the world, local authorities are exploring how they can repurpose parks and other open spaces to help to store the water from heavy rainfall. In Firs Farm Park in the London borough of Enfield, for example, playing fields have been raised and others transformed into wetland to hold back the water and prevent flooding downstream. This work has helped to stimulate the involvement of local people in maintaining the park, while the wetlands provide a nature resource for schoolchildren.  Similar projects are being explore as far apart as Bergen, Norway, and Belo Horizonte, Brazil. On a smaller scale, water can be held back in street rain gardens. These small patches of planting combined with dropped kerbs offer opportunities for infiltrating water and greening the streets. Residents may have to sacrifice some local parking spaces, but such investments can make a neighbourhood more pleasant for everyone, as well as reducing the flows downstream. The request to minimise household inputs to the sewer system is one small immediate way to mobilise local residents to help address the threat of flooding. But residents with a garden can help in other ways too. Most UK houses have gutters that discharge directly to the sewer. Depending on the local geology, garden soakaways (stone-filled ditches which can soak up water if it rains), retain the water so it drains more slowly to the ground or the sewer. Another way to accomplish this task is with a raintank. Most people think of raintanks (or water butts) as a way to protect against droughts. But as long as a tank has some space in it, it also has the potential to provide added protection for a neighbourhood from flooding. My research team is currently exploring whether we can make “leaky raintanks”. The idea here is that as well as storing water for use in the garden, the tank will also have a space which is able to fill up in a storm and then drain slowly into the sewer. If every household in a neighbourhood had a “leaky raintank”, it could make a significant difference to the amount of water storage during a storm. Whether helping to replan the local park, participating in discussing which parts of the street can form a rain garden, or through managing a soakaway or raintank on your private land, water management is increasingly seen as something which is too big and too important to leave just to technical experts. We are all part of the water system, and those that manage water are recognising that people are able and willing to undertake actions to improve the water system.   Meanwhile, technical experts more widely need to recognise that water is part of lived in and natural landscapes – and this must be reflected in sewers and streets. In a time in which water-related threats are worsening, society needs to look beyond isolated problems of floods or droughts, and to consider how wise water management can deliver local benefits as well as a more resilient landscape for everyone."
"Summer is here – for many, a time for holidays and travelling, often by plane. Air travel has risen steeply on a global level. Since 2004 alone, passenger numbers have more than doubled, from two billion to 4.4 billion in 2018, with new record numbers forecast for 2019. Emissions from global air travel are predicted to double or even treble again by 2050 if no action is taken. Universities play a role in this with a high and rising air travel footprint. Academics are frequent air travellers – to present at international conferences, conduct and review research, network and collaborate. “International recognition” forms an important criterion for academic job descriptions and promotions, and universities increasingly benefit from international student fees and international research funding. Many academics see travelling to far-flung places as the perk of the job – to compensate for long hours and performance pressures.  Some might argue that extensive academic travel is justified by the positive contribution that academic research and teaching make to society. But in a world which needs to reduce emissions down to net-zero by 2050 at the latest to stay within planetary boundaries, the sector will need to engage in a more open debate about its air travel carbon footprint and options to reduce it.

      It's time to wake up to the devastating impact flying has on the environment


 The problem starts with a lack of precise data on the air travel footprint of the higher education sector. In the UK, the first port of call should be data collected by the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA). Currently, UK universities are asked to submit data on flight emissions to HESA, either based on destinations or on spending on flights. This is not obligatory – in the past three years only 43% have done so. Unfortunately, the data show likely errors which compromise their usefulness. For instance, the database records extremely high figures for a small number of universities which skew the calculation of mean emissions. This may be because calculating carbon emissions from expenditure is not very reliable. The database also does not distinguish between flights taken by academic and non-academic staff, even though their flight behaviour is likely to be different. Clearer reporting standards and data checks are urgently required so we can examine the sector’s flight carbon footprint more precisely. To create an estimate, let’s instead cautiously assume that the average academic in the UK attends just one international conference or meeting per year by plane, for instance one in the US, with a CO₂ emissions footprint of about five tonnes. Based on one of my earlier studies, this is over ten times as much as the average UK person’s carbon footprint from leisure flights, and nearly 20% more than the average UK person’s total annual carbon footprint from travel and home energy combined.  With 211,980 academic staff in UK higher education in 2017/8, this would add up to a total of nearly 1.1m tonnes of CO2 emissions per year – equivalent to the average total annual consumption-based carbon footprint of over 120,000 people in the UK. Since most academics fly multiple times per year, this could easily be an underestimate.  What about global figures? If we scale up the estimated CO₂ emissions from academic staff air travel in the UK per higher education institution (around 6,583 tonnes CO₂ for each of the 161 institutions in 2017) to the at least 28,000 universities globally, it would amount to 184m tonnes of CO₂ globally - nearly 50% of the UK’s total CO₂ emissions in 2017. Add to this the carbon footprint of international student air travel. In 2017/18, 458,490 international students were enrolled in UK higher education institutions. Of those, nearly 70% came from outside of the EU, especially from China with 23%.  If each student takes just one return flight per year to visit home, this would add up to around 1.8m tonnes of CO₂ emissions per year (assumed averages based on the atmosfair calculator of 0.8 tonnes per return flight for EU, 5.4 tonnes for China, five tonnes for the rest of the world). Both staff and international student numbers in the UK have been rising over the last few years. If this trend continues, the carbon footprint from academic air travel is also likely to increase.  Demand reduction will need to play an important role in bringing air travel emissions down to zero by 2050. This is because technological options for decarbonising air travel, such as carbon-neutral electrofuels, are very expensive and extremely challenging to scale up. Meanwhile ,carbon offsetting schemes are often thought to be insufficiently effective as many fail to deliver additional carbon reductions.

      Aviation emissions are rising – and industry solutions are just technological myths


 But university management and academics can do various things to reduce flying. Environmental assessments of travel and research project plans should become a requirement as part of already existing ethics and risk assessments. For every suggested flight, it would be important to assess a number of things. Is the journey really necessary, or can a meeting be held online instead? Can fieldwork abroad be conducted by remotely supervised local teams? If the journey is necessary, can it be made by train (which emits about a seventh of the emissions per passenger compared to air travel)?  Every journey booking should be submitted to a carbon calculator to raise awareness and collect better data. Academic job application and promotion criteria would need to be amended such that environmentally conscious academics are not punished for reducing or giving up flying.  The need to reduce air travel also raises very difficult questions in relation to student internationalisation agendas, and global mobility more generally. Online teaching for students abroad would need to expand considerably to minimise travel emissions. Of course, this would have the lamentable effect of removing the beneficial experience of living abroad and immersing oneself in a new culture. In many ways, structural incentives for air travel have become established within the higher education sector. This means neither university management nor academics will show much appetite for reducing flights. But if it wants to lead by example, the sector – like many others – urgently needs to collaborate globally to agree on reducing its impact from business travel."

Richard Muller and the good folks over at the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature (BEST) project have released their temperature analysis back to 1750, and are making their usual unsupportable claims. I don’t mean his risible statements that the temperature changes are due to CO2 because the curves look alike—that joke has been widely discussed and discounted, even by anthropogenic global warming (AGW) supporters. Heck, even Michael Mann jumped on him for that one, saying
It seems, in the end–quite sadly–that this is all really about Richard Muller’s self-aggrandizement 🙁
And if anyone should know about “self-aggrandizement”, it’s Michael Mann … but I’m not talking about Muller’s claim that humans caused the warming. No, I mean the following statement:

The historic temperature pattern we observe has abrupt dips that match the emissions of known explosive volcanic eruptions; the particulates from such events reflect sunlight and cool the Earth’s surface for a few years.

In support of this statement, Richard Muller offers up the following chart:
Figure 1. BEST claims about temperature and volcanoes. SOURCE
So what’s not to like?
Well, first it appears he has included and excluded volcanoes depending on whether they show up in his temperature record. If we look at big eruptions, eruptions with a “volcanic explosively index” (VEI) of 6 or above, since 1750 we have the following volcanoes:
Mount Pinatubo, 1991
Novarupta, 1912
Santa María, 1902
Krakatoa, 1883
Mount Tambora, 1815
Grímsvötn and Laki, 1783
So Muller has left off Santa Maria and Novarupta, and included El Chichon and Cosiguina. But that’s not the real problem. The real problem is that many of these occurred after or during the temperature drop that they are supposed to have caused … here’s the BEST data including all relevant volcanoes, without the style of overlay that they have used that obscures the actual timing:
Figure 2. BEST temperature data and dates of volcanoes. Red line is a four-year centered Gaussian average of the temperature data. Photo shows Mt. Redoubt in Alaska.
So let’s look at the volcanoes, one by one:
LAKI, 1783: Occurred near the end of the fall in temperature that it is supposed to have caused.
TAMBORA, 1815: Occurred at the end of the fall in temperature that it is supposed to have caused.
COSIGUINA, 1835: Occurred near the middle of the fall in temperature that it is supposed to have caused.
KRAKATOA, 1883: Occurred at the end of the fall in temperature that it is supposed to have caused.
SANTA MARIA, 1902: Occurred in the middle of the fall in temperature that it is supposed to have caused.
NOVARUPTA, 1912: I can see why Muller omitted this eruption, which occurred just before a rise in temperature …
EL CHICHON, 1982: Occurred during the fall in temperature that it is supposed to have caused.
PINATUBO, 1991: This is arguably the only one of the eight volcanoes that could legitimately be claimed to cause a detectable fall in temperature … a whopping fall of 0.15°C or so.
So while volcanoes certainly may cause a minor drop in global temperature, the claim of Richard Muller and the BEST folks that there are “abrupt dips that match the emissions of known explosive volcanic eruptions” is simply not true. There are abrupt dips, but they don’t match up with the volcanic eruptions.

[Update] Further reading:
Prediction is hard, especially of the future discusses the GISS analysis of Pinatubo.
Missing the Missing Summer is about the eruption of Tambora.
Dronning Maud Meets the Little Ice Age investigates a claim that the Little Ice Age was triggered by vulcanism.
Volcanic Disruptions plays the game “Spot the Volcano”
[Update] Another way to investigate the question is to look at the average temperature anomaly during the two years before and the two years after the eruption. Figure 3 shows that result.
Figure 3. Average temperature anomaly two years before and two years after the eruptions. Black lines show the standard error of the mean.
After some eruptions it cooled a bit, after some it warmed a bit, and after some there was no change … go figure.

"**England's national lockdown has helped to bring coronavirus ""back under control"" but vigilance is still needed, the health secretary has said.**
Matt Hancock hailed the restrictions a success and said infections in England dropped by about 30% in the last week.
The lockdown ends on Wednesday and will be replaced with tiered restrictions.
Mr Hancock stressed the need for the regional system, saying ""while we can let up a little, we can't afford to let up a lot"".
Speaking at a Downing Street news briefing on Monday, he said people following the lockdown rules meant ""we've reduced pressures on the NHS, we've brought down the number of coronavirus cases, we've got this virus back under control.""
He added: ""The success of our collective efforts means that from Wednesday, everyone in England, even those in tier three, can have some greater freedoms - but we don't have much headroom.""
Mr Hancock pointed to a major study from Imperial College London that has suggested that the number of infections has fallen by a third since the lockdown was introduced a month ago.
However, the health secretary called for vigilance and said the country could not risk Covid cases rising again as we head towards Christmas.
Prof Stephen Powis, national medical director of NHS England, told the same briefing that it was ""crucial"" to have infection rates under control ahead of January, when the NHS is at its busiest.
He said he was ""confident people will act sensible over Christmas"" - when restrictions are to be relaxed for five days - and the country will go into the new year with the number of infections staying down and falling.
Prof Powis also said that the NHS had ""started to turn the corner"" as the number of people in hospital with coronavirus is falling, but said it was ""critical"" that cases remained low.
He said: ""We have the evidence that infection rates are now falling and have been falling during this period of lockdown.
""And we are now just beginning to see that translate through into hospital admissions, which have been falling, and into the overall number of people in hospital which in recent days has started to turn the corner, and is now falling.""
Mr Hancock pointed to the government's newly-published impact assessment in needing the toughened tiered approach in England, following criticism from some Tory MPs.
He said it ""clearly"" demonstrated the move was ""necessary to avoid a much worse outcome"", and called for vigilance.
Asked whether Conservative backbenchers considering voting against the government's proposed new tier system for England during a Commons vote on Tuesday are being irresponsible, Mr Hancock said he urged all MPs to vote for the measures.
He said the tiered system was the ""best way to avoid a third lockdown"" and the ""most proportionate way to take the action that we need to keep people safe, and to stop the NHS being overwhelmed"".
Meanwhile, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer confirmed his party's MPs would be encouraged to abstain from Tuesday's vote - meaning it is likely to pass, even as Tory backbenchers threaten to rebel.
Sir Keir said he remained ""deeply concerned that Boris Johnson's government has failed to use this latest lockdown to put a credible health and economic plan in place"".
The health secretary repeated the government's earlier pledge to roll out mass community testing in tier three areas, including testing people without symptoms, after the lockdown ends.
Mr Hancock said mass testing had successfully brought down infections in Liverpool \- where 300,000 people were tested for Covid-19 - and would give tier three areas a ""faster way out of the toughest restrictions"".
He appealed to anyone who was offered a test to take one, as ""you might just save a life"".
However, health leaders have warned that mass testing plans in England threaten to be a ""distraction"" from other priorities such as the rollout of a vaccine.
Mr Hancock said mass testing and vaccination needed to ""run alongside each other"", which had already been happening in vaccine trials to find out if people who are vaccinated have caught Covid-19.
Community testing is being seen as a crucial development to get the UK through winter until the vaccines arrive.
This refers to the use of rapid testing to spot asymptomatic cases - people who do not have symptoms.
It is what the government was referring to as the ""moonshot"" programme a few months ago.
Local authorities are being given access to these tests to try to root out the virus among people who do not know they have it.
It was one of the tools that Liverpool has used over the past month or so during which infection levels have been reduced three-fold.
Councils across the country are likely to offer it to people in neighbourhoods with high infection rates and to target high-risk workplaces like food factories.
Nationally it is being used to test care home visitors and help university students return home for Christmas.
But despite the optimism among ministers, there are words of caution.
These tests were never intended for community use like this.
They may only pick up three quarters of positive cases, dropping to a half if carried out by untrained people.
The government is pushing the boundaries.
That may be understandable in a pandemic, but the effectiveness of this programme is far from certain.
Mass coronavirus testing of students, so they can safely return home for the Christmas break, has already begun at many UK universities.
Mr Hancock urged students to take a test if they are offered one but defended the fact that the scheme is not mandatory.
Meanwhile on Monday, the government recorded another 12,330 daily coronavirus cases and a further 205 deaths within 28 days of a positive test."

Call me a cynic, but every time some new environmental or climate change moral panic suddenly grips the legacy media – and especially its wagging-tail, social media – I immediately check to see if there’s either another big environmental-political circus due or a left-wing politician in trouble.



So when the social media Chicken Little screeching about the Amazon supposedly burning to the ground began, with the legacy media rushing to fall into line, it was no surprise to find the following triple-whammy. Not only is the G7 elite excursion week about to begin, but the UN is about to chill the champagne and rev up the private jets for yet another climate gabfest. More tellingly, the whole Amazon kerfuffle was kicked off by failing Frog lefty, Emmanuel Macron.



Well, colour me surprised.



Imagine my shock, too, to find that the whole circus doesn’t even stand up to the scrutiny of a two-minute Google search or even to basic arithmetic. Jo Nova has summarised the basic fact-checking that Twitter hysterics are plainly incapable of. To sum it all in one line: **The whole thing is a political beat-up and the Amazon is experiencing nothing but average dry-season forest fires**.



Global Fire Data shows this year is unequivocally a low fire season in the Amazon. But social media tears and outrage is running at 1000% driven by old photos and fake facts of the Amazon producing “20% of our planet’s oxygen” […] Based on hyperbolic twitter pics French leader Macron is threatening to cancel a foreign trade deal. The hype serves the purpose of attacking the right wing Brazilian leader Jair Bolsonaro in the lead up to a G7 summit this week.



The photo he used? **It’s a stock photo** from Loren McIntyre, a photographer who died in 2003.



That should have set everyone’s bullshit meters clanging. But if that’s not enough, here are the numbers:



The tally of fire counts here is up to data for August 22, 2019. Emissions are preliminary estimates based on fire counts, but the graph shows just how ordinary, normal and boring 2019 is expected to be when the final numbers are done.



 **Whenever someone starts gibbering about the Amazon, the first thing to keep in mind is just how freaking big the Amazon actually is.** For instance, the once-respectable _National Geographic_ shrieked that more than 7,000 square miles has been “razed”. Well, that **does** sound pretty scary. Except that the Amazon covers more than **two million square** miles. So, the area “razed” amounts to just 0.3%. Suddenly, it’s less scary.



Nonetheless, the legacy media obediently jumped to the crack of the Twitter whip. Yet, even the hacks struggled to beat this non-event up. From the thoroughly alarmist BBC:



“US space agency Nasa, meanwhile, has said that overall fire activity across the Amazon basin this year has been close to the average compared to the past 15 years.”



Remember when it comes to climate change, NASA are the definitive last word, but when it comes to Amazon fires, they’re just a casual addendum. “No comment”.



Jonathon Watts at _The Guardian_ carefully words the panic. It’s almost as if he is aware of what is going on but not happy to make it too clear.



In fact, the whole ruckus is such obvious bullshit that even **Michael Mann** is calling time-out. Yes: Michael freaking Mann. Mann particularly responded to hysterical claims about “the lungs of the planet” (a claim that was debunked almost as soon as it dribbled from Sting’s smug, overpaid gob, back in the 80s).



The hype is so over the top even Michael Mann is watering it down. This might be the first time Michael Mann is on the same side as skeptics?



Do we need to worry about oxygen?



No. Although some reports have claimed the Amazon produces 20% of the world’s oxygen, it is not clear where this figure originated. The true figure is likely to be no more than 6%, according to climate scientists such as Michael Mann and Jonathan Foley. Even if it were accurate, the crops being planted in the cleared forest areas would also produce oxygen – quite likely at higher levels. So although the burning of the rainforest is worrying for many reasons, there is no need to worry about an oxygen shortage.



When the Hockey Stick guy is calling b.s., you **really** know it’s a complete non-event.

"Rocky shorelines and weathered saltbox homes dot the landscape of South Thomaston on the coast of Maine. Lobster traps take up frontyard real estate and lobster shacks, still shuttered for the season, are common sightings. Back from a day of scalloping, lobsterman Bob Baines has docked his boat, the FV Thrasher, at the Spruce Head Fishermans Co-op. His sternman, David McLellan, clad in waterproof overalls like Baines, shucks the last few hauls, tossing the meats into a bucket and the shells overboard. It’s the last week of scallop season, but there is a new venture on the horizon. Baines, 64, steers the Thrasher back out toward Hewett Island on Penobscot Bay to check on the underwater kelp farm that he “planted” in December. It’s a willowy structure made up of moorings, buoys and ropes that hovers 7ft underwater and spans 1,000ft wide, like a monster cat’s cradle. The only indicator that there is anything happening below the surface are the buoys that outline a hidden plot, with 13 parallel lines criss-crossing back and forth, each wrapped in a helix of twine impregnated with kelp seed that has grown into translucent brown ribbons. Baines is among the latest of 19 veteran lobstermen along the Maine coast who are applying their hard-earned expertise to kelp farming. It’s boom time for lobster in Maine – 2019 was the fourth most profitable year in the history of an industry that accounts for $1bn in state revenue, second only to tourism. But a variety of factors, most of which can be traced to climate change, have left lobstermen more vulnerable than ever. The lobster industry’s unprecedented growth may sound like a good thing, but the cause of it is alarming. According to a 2015 Science magazine study, the Gulf of Maine is heating up faster than 99% of the world’s oceans. This, in addition to proactive conservation efforts implemented over the years, has accounted for the flourishing of the lobster population; lobster are thriving in the slightly warmer waters. But lobstermen know better than to celebrate. All they need to do is look at what happened in the early 2000s in places like Connecticut, Rhode Island, and the Long Island Sound, where once-robust lobster fisheries have become commercially extinct due to the continually warming waters. “I think we have a long time before that happens in Maine,” says Susie Arnold, a marine scientist at Maine’s Island Institute, who works with fishermen to diversify their businesses by including aquaculture, like kelp farming. “But the changes that are occurring are undeniable.” Those changes aren’t good, but kelp farming has the potential for environmental good. “The ocean is a sponge for carbon dioxide,” says Nichole Price, senior research scientist and director of the Center for Seafood Solutions at the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in Maine. Carbon dioxide is the cause of ocean acidification, one of the myriad stressors responsible for destroying coral reefs and preventing mollusks from building their shells. Price has found evidence that sugar kelp has an especially high capacity for absorbing CO2 and thus lowering the acidity of the surrounding water. Investing in kelp farming now could potentially benefit marine life in the future. “The Maine coast is almost all lobster now, and it didn’t used to be that way,” says Baines, who has a close-cropped white beard, chiseled cheekbones and hazel eyes so deep-set that it often looks like he’s squinting. “When I was a teenager, in summertimes I worked in a lobster boat that went long-lining for ground fish – cod, haddock, hake – that were dominant in the Gulf of Maine.” The way Baines says “cod” sounds more like “caught”, as one might expect of a New Jersey native who spent his childhood summers in Maine and has lived his adult life here. While Baines still goes out scalloping and sometimes fishes for halibut, most Maine lobstermen these days rely entirely on lobster to survive. If it’s a bad year for lobster, it’s a very bad year for lobstermen. And, in general, profit margins are lower than they were years ago, due to fuel costs and the rising price of bait and gear, in addition to regulations placed on lobster fishing by the federal government to protect the endangered right whale. Federal restrictions due to the trade war with China and the economic fallout caused by Covid-19 have further devastated their bottom line. If it’s a bad year for lobster, it’s a very bad year for lobstermen Kelp farming is positioned as a form of insurance, offering lobstermen such as Baines some of the financial security off-season fishing once did. He is one of the 24 “partner farmers” working with Atlantic Sea Farms, which was founded in 2009 under the name Ocean Approved as the first commercial seaweed farm and nursery in North America. (Baines’s daughter, Jesse, works for the company.) Atlantic cultivates seeds and gives them to partner farmers, assists with the design and layout of the kelp farms, and coaches farmers throughout the season – from setting up the farm in the winter to the harvest in spring, complementary to lobster’s summer to fall season. Because Atlantic Sea Farms seeks experienced lobstermen who already have equipment and know-how, start-up costs tend to be lower than those who are beginning from scratch. The farmers grow two types of kelp – ripply sugar kelp and ribbon-like skinny kelp – which Atlantic then processes into a line of goods they sell online, to grocery stores, fast-casual chains, meal kit companies such as Daily Harvest, and national restaurants. Kelp grows 3-8lbs per foot of line, which means a farm with 13,000ft, the average size of Atlantic Sea Farms’ partner farmers’ lines, can potentially generate around $20,000 to $57,000 at harvest time. In Southport, Maine, an hour down the coast from Baines’ kelp farm, husband and wife Alex Hutchins and Jodi Brewer are coming up on the end of their latest season growing kelp for Atlantic Sea Farms. This will be their third harvest – though last year an errant dock tore through their lines, sweeping their entire farm away. “We were getting ready to harvest,” says Hutchins, 35, wearing a weathered baseball cap, wisps of sandy brown hair poking out from underneath. “There were 18,000 feet of line, 3 ½ to 4lbs of kelp a foot, about 5 to 8ft long – we would have had 90,000lbs of kelp. We spent three days cleaning it up.” After last year’s debacle, Hutchins babysits the plots regularly to see that the lines haven’t crossed, which would rub the kelp right off, and otherwise make sure that everything is looking right. If all goes well, he is projecting a 48,000lb harvest. “I’m not much of a quitter,” says Hutchins. “When Jodi and I met, the price of lobster went down and I was washing windows for $10 an hour.” Hutchins, who comes from a long line of lobstermen, is no stranger to the turbulence of the trade. His family started fishing in Maine in the 1600s; he himself has been lobstering since he was eight, and started in earnest as a 20-year-old, with his father as his sternman. Until a few years ago, Hutchins fished for shrimp during the lobster off-season. He had invested in hundreds of shrimp traps right before the state closed the shrimp fishery in 2014, due to the warming waters. That is when he and Brewer turned to kelp. “We wanted to fill the void where we had lost shrimping,” says Brewer, who wears a fleece pullover embroidered with her name, and punctuates her speech with nervous giggles. “The price of lobster is so volatile anyways,” adds Hutchins. “What we have going on right now with the coronavirus and the prices dropping. Normally this is the highest price time of year. I got $10.50 to $11 per lb this time last year. And now we’re at $4, $4.50. So it’s nice for me to have something else to fall back on besides lobstering.” Back in South Thomaston, Baines cruises toward his kelp farm, pointing it out on a chart plotter, where it looks like a stick drawing of a rectangle on a digital screen. It appears straightforward enough, but creating a three-dimensional rope structure in the ocean is as challenging as you’d think. “When you’re seeding the farm, you’re working out of a skiff, not out of a big lobster boat,” says Baines. “In a 14ft skiff in choppy waters, you’re bouncing all over the place. When I got home that first day of seeding, I hadn’t been that tired in I don’t know how many years of fishing.” But the effort seems to be paying off. Baines lifts a line out of the water, from where kelp the color of a Budweiser bottle dangles like streamers and offers a sample. The flavor is fresh and vegetal, like underripe peas, and, surprisingly, not salty. No wonder it has gastronomic appeal. Atlantic Sea Farms’ kelp has been championed by the likes of Alice Waters, renowned chef, and made an appearance last March in a salad created by chef David Chang for the fast-casual chain Sweetgreen. At Chaval, a French and Spanish-influenced restaurant in Portland, kelp has found its way into the glass – dried and powdered, in a salted cocktail rim that tasted like the beach – and onto the plate – in an ethereally crisp churro stuffed with lemon cream, where kelp is integrated into the dough and blended into the sugar mixture that is sprinkled on top. Despite the multifold promise of kelp, not everyone is on board with seaweed aquaculture. “Kelp farming is so new that for many fishermen, the initial reaction is ‘I don’t want that around here, that’s where I go lobstering’,” says Baines. At a community hearing last year to review the lease for Baine’s kelp farm, other lobstermen complained that the aquaculture lease would somehow hamper their ability to catch lobster, even though kelp farming occurs from winter to the spring, during lobster’s off-season. “It’s not a reasonable argument,” says Baines. “Once they see that my lease didn’t bother anyone or take anything away from them, it will all settle right down.” Meanwhile, Atlantic Sea Farms powers ahead. They have plans to move into a larger facility and there is a waitlist of fishermen who want to farm with them. They want to expand their network of partner farmers, which currently numbers 24. But due to the coronavirus outbreak, the waters have become choppy. In late March, Atlantic Sea Farms lost most of their food service clients, which made up about 50% of their accounts. Simultaneously, they saw increased retail and meal kit demand, and a surge in online sales. In the short term, they hope to shift the ratio of their contracts toward retail, with a Wegmans rollout and an expansion into Whole Foods in New England and other regions scheduled for the summer. Bob Baines, Alex Hutchins and Jodi Brewer, and the rest of the partner farmers received an email in late March from Briana Warner, the chief executive of Atlantic Sea Farms, assuring them that the company is still committed to buying their kelp. “Lobster prices dropped dramatically and we are heading into the lobster season very soon, so this kelp income matters more than before,” says Warner. “It could be a very hard season.” To meet the CDC standards for social distancing, Atlantic Sea Farms will not be bringing in their usual seasonal workers who commute from Massachusetts each day during harvest to process the kelp. Instead, it will be done with a local skeleton crew made up mostly of the company’s management team. “It hurts but we’ll get through it,” says Warner. As for the farmers, they are happy to have work they can rely on. “This is the hardest time of year for commercial fishermen,” says Hutchins of the winter-spring season. “And this year, not knowing what will happen with the lobster market as a whole, it’s nice to know I have something coming in.”"

It is quite depressing to live in a country where there is such hostility towards free speech. A Radio NZ article covering the Free Speech trial in Auckland did not even try to hide its bias.



One of the people involved in the trial who is standing up for free speech was smeared with an incredible litany of adjectives. The bit at the end highlighting the man’s work was disgusting and is as low a blow as it was malicious.



would-be Dunedin Mayor, climate change denier, Donald Trump supporter and rare books dealer



Of course, there was no string of adjectives for Mayor Phil Goff although there is much to criticise about him. Imagine if he had been described like this…



Current Auckland Mayor, Free speech denier, Karl Marx supporter and terrorist hand holder Phil Goff.



The headline for the thoroughly biased news article started the way it intended to finish with a general stereotype and smear for all the New Zealanders who dared to turn up in large numbers to support the Free Speech Coalition.



 **Free Speech is not controversial.** Wanting to censor free speech is controversial but that is not what the headline meant. 



Straight away the article claims that New Zealand’s “notable right-wing figures” were at the Auckland High Court but it then slyly fails to make clear which of the people it then mentions actually fits that description. Ask yourself if you have ever heard Phil Goff or Jacinda Ardern or even Helen Clark described by the media as left-wing figures recently. The media rarely if ever describe lefties as left-wing but when they use the right-wing description it is meant as a negative slur.



[…] Representing the Free Speech Coalition is the Queen’s Counsel Jack Hodder, who was recently snapped up by the Council of Licensed Firearms Owners to oppose changes to the country’s gun laws.



What a dirty little paragraph that is. It is a clear attempt to try to link one court case to another in the reader’s mind. 



[…] They claim Mayor Phil Goff “ordered or dictated” this decision, for which they say there was no lawful basis.



The council claims the plug was pulled on the event entirely on health and safety grounds, after the strength of opposition to the speakers became apparent.



But Mr Hodder spent much of yesterday looking for holes in this assertion, claiming the decision was made without consulting police and with no credible evidence of a security risk.



This, Mr Hodder said, created a concerning precedent – “the thug’s veto”.



[…] The council’s lawyers steered clear of addressing the controversial views held by Ms Southern and Ms Molyneux,[…]



Of course, they steered clear of them. Phil Goff in his public tweet made it very clear that he wanted them banned because he disagreed with their views but the council now have to clean up his mess (an expensive legal battle) by attempting to make a case that the speakers were banned for a completely different reason.



To the average person on the street Goff’s tweet clearly conveyed the impression that he had banned the two Canadian speakers from an Auckland Council-owned venue.  




Speaking outside of court, Mr Williams told RNZ he […] was only taking this action to overturn what was a dangerous precedent.



“This is somewhat unusual in New Zealand but pretty common around the world – it’s **public-interest litigation,”** he said.



“We’re not seeking money from Auckland Council, **we’re seeking a declaration that what the council did was wrong** so that in the future councils must take into account freedom of association, freedom of speech and freedom of thought before they use health and safety as a trump card to cancel a speaker.”



[…]”The whole point of free speech is protecting speech you don’t agree with,” he said.

Quote of the Week: 
Moral certainty is always a sign of cultural inferiority. The more uncivilized the man, the surer he is that he knows precisely what is right and what is wrong. All human progress, even in morals, has been the work of men who have doubted the current moral values, not of men who have whooped them up and tried to enforce them. The truly civilized man is always skeptical and tolerant, in this field as in all others. His culture is based on “I am not too sure.”-H.L. Mencken, writer, editor, and critic (1880-1956)

THIS WEEK:
By Ken Haapala, Executive Vice President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP)
Heartland Conference: The Heartland Institute’s Seventh International Conference on Climate Change (ICCC-7) will take place in Chicago, Illinois from Monday, May 21 to Wednesday, May 23, 2012 at the Hilton Chicago Hotel, 720 South Michigan Avenue. The event will follow the NATO Summit taking place in Chicago on May 19–21. The Theme is Real Science, Real Choices. Open to the public, registration is required. http://climateconference.heartland.org/
******************
The Royal Society: The Royal Society has taken another step from being a scientific society to becoming an advocacy organization. It has published a lengthy study, People and the Planet, which calls for a redistribution of wealth, reduction in consumption by wealthy countries, and population control (by voluntary means). Of course, a key component of the report is controlling carbon-dioxide emissions. According to the press release, this report was in advance of Rio + 20, which is being used to create additional UN bureaucratic control of nations. 
If there is an agreement reached at Rio + 20, western nations will dutifully follow it, but most nations will ignore it. Certainly, the leadership of economically fast-growing Asian nations has demonstrated a lack of enthusiasm for punishing their citizenry by curtailing growth.
An examination of fertility rates reveals that Western Nations plus Japan have far lower birth rates, even below replacement rates, than many other nations, particularly Muslim nations. It is doubtful that the leadership of Muslim nations will embrace the call for population controls.
It appears that the Royal Society desires to become a new Club of Rome, with its “Limits to Growth,” based upon fallacious assumptions and errors in key definitions such as resources. Similar to the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the Club used the latest computer technology to make dire predictions. Subsequent economic growth falsified the assumptions and exposed the errors. An article in the Telegraph by Tim Worstall, a dealer in the metal scandium, discusses one of the fundamental errors in defining reserves of resources. Reserves are an economic concept, not a physical one.
The theme is familiar, Western democracies must punish themselves for their prosperity and share their wealth with nations controlled by kleptocracies, small groups who enrich themselves at the expense of the citizenry. The UN, of course, will take a cut of the cash flow. There is no objective reason to believe the report is scientific or even sensible. Please see links under “The Royal Society.”
*****************
Supernovas and Life on Earth: Scientists at the National Space Institute, University of Denmark, have hypothesized that high-energy cosmic rays, modulated by the sun, influence cloudiness on earth, which may cause climate change. Increasing cloudiness increases the reflection of visible light from the sun which results in cooling. Conversely, decreasing cloudiness reduces the reflection this solar energy, which results in warming. Even though these effects have been demonstrated by experiments, the hypothesis is not popular among those who declare that carbon dioxide is the main cause of global warming / climate change.
One of the main proponents of the hypothesis, Henrik Svensmark has extended the hypothesis to suggest that exploding nearby stars, supernovae, may affect the diversity of life on the planet as measured by marine biodiversity. He proposes the other major contributor is plate tectonics. The relationships he establishes are statistical and, of course, correlation does not prove causation. However, the idea is bold and if fleshed out may prove to be a major contribution to scientific understanding of life on this planet, or it may not.
The paper is lengthy and dense. The accompany press release states:
“In the new work, the diversity of life over the last 500 million years seems remarkably well explained by tectonics affecting the sea-level together with variations in the supernova rate, and virtually nothing else. To obtain this result on the variety of life, or biodiversity, he [Svensmark] followed the changing fortunes of the best-recorded fossils. These are from invertebrate animals in the sea, such as shrimps and octopuses, or the extinct trilobites and ammonites.
They tended to be richest in their variety when continents were drifting apart and sea levels were high and less varied when the land masses gathered 250 million years ago into the supercontinent called Pangaea and the sea-level was lower. But this geophysical effect was not the whole story. When it is removed from the record of biodiversity, what remains corresponds closely to the changing rate of nearby stellar explosions, with the variety of life being greatest when supernovae are plentiful. A likely reason, according to Prof. Svensmark, is that the cold climate associated with high supernova rates brings a greater variety of habitats between polar and equatorial regions, while the associated stresses of life prevent the ecosystems becoming too set in their ways.”
Physicist Roger Cohen comments:
“The key step of the aerosol formation has been verified in lab experiments and in the CERN cloud chamber. http://thegwpf.org/science-news/3699-cern-experiment-confirms-cosmic-rays-influence-climate-change.html.
I think it is rare that we see well presented arguments for a truly new scientific idea. We don’t know at this point whether we are looking at one of those things that changes the way we think about things, or just another idea that didn’t pan out.”

*****************
Sea Ice: A new study states that the western Antarctic ice sheet is losing mass from underneath due to changes in ocean currents. The study also speculates this loss will trigger land glaciers to slide down and melt, causing sea levels to rise. The latter remains to be observed. The study ignores that the sea ice extent in Antarctica is growing, and in some places is thickening as well. http://arctic.atmos.uiuc.edu/cryosphere/IMAGES/current.anom.south.jpg. [H/t James Rust] As reported in a prior TWTWs, the GRACE satellites show very little loss of ice mass in both polar ice caps. http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v482/n7386/full/nature10847.html. Please see link under “Changing Sea Ice.”
*****************
Acidic Waters: Another alarmist study reports that acidification of ocean waters from increased C02 is resulting in larval oyster failures in hatcheries. The report states: “the scientists found that increased seawater carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, resulting in more corrosive ocean water, inhibited the larval oysters from developing their shells and growing at a pace that would make commercial production cost-effective.”
The abstract of the study states that pH varied between 7.6 and 8.2 – alkaline not acid. The larval oysters did not die, but grew more slowly in mid-stage. The slow growth may have been a result of varying alkalinity of the water rather than the water staying at a particular pH. For example, a sudden lowering of pH can shock an aquarium and reduce growth or even kill animals in it, while a gradual lowering may cause no change whatsoever. The research was funded by the National Science Foundation. Please see links under “Acidic Waters.”
*****************
EPA: The EPA continues to make outrageous statements. It has been brought to light that in testimony to Congress last September, Administrator Lisa Jackson claimed that further controls of soot would be as beneficial to public health as finding a cure for cancer. There is little question that prolonged exposure to high concentrations of soot cause health problems such as in lungs and eyes. However, already soot in the US is tightly controlled. To equate additional benefits of additional controls with finding a cure for cancer is outrageous.
A senior EPA official described his view of enforcement of oil and gas regulations as similar to the practice of Roman soldiers crucifying natives of a village they just occupied. Please see Article # 1, and links under “EPA and other Regulators on the March.”
*****************
Number of the Week: Patrick Michaels points out that total annual global emissions of mercury (both natural and human) is estimated to be 7,520 metric tons while total from US power plants that actually lands on US soil is estimated to be 12 metric tons (about 0.16% of total emissions). Human emissions are estimated to be 2,320 tons and natural emissions to be 5,200 tons, more than twice human emissions. US power plants emit about 49 metric tons, of 0.65% of total emissions.
According to the EPA web site its new regulations of mercury and other air toxins will save 4,200 to 11,000 Americans from premature deaths, prevent 4,700 heart attacks and 130,000 asthma attacks. In total this would result in financial benefits of $37 billion to $90 Billion. Permit us to be skeptical. The web site includes soot which, as mentioned above, is already regulated. Please see link under “EPA and other Regulators on the March” and http://www.epa.gov/mats/health.html

Thus, while the authors claim that they [the models] are useful for multidecadal water resource planning in the Tampa Bay region, this planning can be directly done with the original real world data. The model downscaling, other than documenting systematic biases, does not provide added information beyond what is already available from observed data and reanalyses without the model.

Extended Range Forecast of Atlantic Seasonal Hurricane Activity and Landfall Strike Probability for 2012
By Philip Klotzbach and William Gray, Colorado State University, Apr 4, 2012 [H/t WUWT]
http://tropical.atmos.colostate.edu/forecasts/2012/apr2012/apr2012.pdf
[SEPP Comment: As compared with the 1981 to 2010 record, below normal activity and below average probability for major hurricanes making landfall. However, if you happen to be where one makes a landfall, it could ruin your day. Please note that last December Klotzbach and Gray announced that even though their models for earlier forecasts hindcast well (performed well with existing data) the models did not forecast well. Thus, they dropped their quantitative December forecasts.]

Review of Recent Scientific Articles by NIPCC
For a full list of articles see www.NIPCCreport.org
Effects of Ocean Acidification on Deep-Sea Corals and Seamount Megabenthos
Reference: Thresher, R.E., Tilbrook, B., Fallon, S., Wilson, N.C. and Adkins, J. 2011. Effects of chronic low carbonate saturation levels on the distribution, growth and skeletal chemistry of deep-sea corals and other seamount megabenthos. Marine Ecology Progress Series 442: 87-99.
http://www.nipccreport.org/articles/2012/apr/24apr2012a4.html
Data from a new study clearly suggest, in the words of the researchers, that “a change in carbonate saturation horizons per se as a result of ocean acidification is likely to have only a slight effect on most of the live deep-sea biogenic calcifiers,” which is a most reassuring result.
[SEPP Comment: This research contradicts testimony by Penn State researchers to a Congressional Committee on the subject.]
Whither ENSO?
Reference: Vecchi, G.A. and Wittenberg, A.T. 2010. El Nino and our future climate: where do we stand? WIREs Climate Change 1: 10.1002/wcc.33.
http://www.nipccreport.org/articles/2012/apr/24apr2012a3.html
“the ENSO variations we see in decades to come may be different than those seen in recent decades,” and admitting that “we are not currently at a state to confidently project what those changes will be.”
The Hawaiian Corals of Oahu’s Kaneohe Bay
Reference: Shamberger, K.E.F., Feely, R.A., Sabine, C.L., Atkinson, M.J., DeCarlo, E.H. and Mackenzie, F.T. 2011. Calcification and organic production on a Hawaiian coral reef. Marine Chemistry 127: 64-75.

http://www.nipccreport.org/articles/2012/apr/25apr2012a3.html
Genetic Study Reveals the Polar Bear is Old Enough to Have Survived Several Glacial Cycles
Reference: Hailer, F., Kutschera, V.E., Hallstrom, B.E., Klassert, D., Fain, S.R., Leonard, J.A., Arnason, U. and Janke, A. 2012. Nuclear genomic sequences reveal that polar bears are an old and distinct bear lineage. Science 336: 344-347.
http://www.nipccreport.org/articles/2012/apr/25apr2012a5.html
An analysis of nuclear genes suggests that the polar bear is old enough to have survived through several periods that were warmer than today between the Middle Pleistocene and the early Holocene.

"Today, cynicism is treated as a rite of passage. At some point, every kid with an interest in politics and social justice is encouraged to temper their passion in favour of a more “pragmatic” outlook on the world. We repeat truisms to each other. Trump will be re-elected. We’re going to hit the two-degree threshold for climate catastrophe. We are going to hell in a handbasket. There is value to this: simply pretending bad things won’t happen is called blind optimism for a reason. More importantly, bad news and the righteous rage it can induce can provide the necessary cataclysm for action. Like so many young people, the publication of the IPCC’s special report moved my friends and me to attend the school strikes for climate last year. But there was a degree of desolation in my feelings on the day. As I snapped a selfie with my friend in Sydney’s Domain last September, a part of me thought that I would at least have a picture of me there, poster in hand, to look back on one day. “See! I was on the right side of history!” I would say to myself as I floated off somewhere west of Sydney after the coast had been submerged by rising seas. Like many of my peers, I don’t expect to have children, as I fear the world might be uninhabitable by the time they grow up. And even if I do, we certainly won’t be going on overseas holidays, with flights either exorbitantly expensive or unfeasible for all manner of emerging reasons. But where might we go in Australia? Another summer from hell has left vast stretches of our beautiful country smouldering and it won’t be the last. Who’s to say I’ll even have a job in the midst of all of this? The nature of work might be vastly different from how we imagine it to be now, and the growing concentration of wealth in the hands of a dwindling few means there might not be much to work for at all. I like the idea of hope, but I haven’t been hopeful myself and was rather cynical of people my age who’ve remained optimistic about their future. Only a fool would actually believe that maybe we would solve the climate crisis, avoid another catastrophic bushfire season or make our society more equitable. Like many of my peers, I don’t expect to have children; the world could be uninhabitable by the time they grew up When Covid-19 hit, I was three weeks into my first semester of my first year at my dream university, studying for the degree I’d worked desperately hard to get into. I was sad when the university shut and we went online, but I also knew that – right then at least – I was one of the lucky ones. The pandemic and the ensuing economic downturn was robbing people of their lives and livelihoods around the world. Australia had fewer than a thousand cases back then but I had already accepted that, yet again, we would be failed by our leaders and that we were destined to become the next Wuhan or Italy. We were all watching the devastating impact of the pandemic unfold as the curve sped towards Australia. As you know, that hasn’t happened. A combination of luck and mostly effective government policies, along with the terrified Australian public mostly abiding by social-distancing and isolation rules, have helped us avoid the worst of this pandemic – so far at least. Our experience is the exception, not the norm: the most prosperous nations on Earth have been ravaged by this virus. And yet, it is clear that my pessimism-fuelled anger was misplaced. Frustration and rage has an important place in the psyche of my generation, and it has driven substantial progress. The global #MeToo movement, the national climate strikes and the decriminalisation of abortion here in New South Wales could not have got off the ground without it. And yet amid this crisis, I’ve come to worry that rage is conflated with cynicism; that in order to protest the system, we have started to somehow believe it has completely failed. It took a pandemic for me to realise how pessimistic I and many of my friends had become. There is much anticipation for previously common joys: the promise of seeing our friends, or going to a gig, or eating out at our favourite restaurant. I think many Gen-Zers now realise the power of the opposing force to rage and cynicism: hope. Many in the media will tell you that the young are the true victims of this crisis: we will inherit a terrible job market, a declining economy, a traumatised health system, and will remember the devastation Covid-19 unleashed on us for the rest of our lives. My parent’s friends delight in thanking me and my generation for taking on paying off the previously unimaginable level of debt. And herein lies the paradox of hope: it is the times when it is the hardest to find that we need it most. Hope cannot make the problems we face go away, nor can it solve them. But it gives us something even more enduring: the motivation to keep going, in spite of it all. And as we begin to look beyond the immediate crisis, hope is the one commodity our generation must harness. I now know, for myself at least, that it won’t be in short supply. • Grace Lagan is a university student in Sydney"

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee:



Thank you for inviting me to testify today on the important subject of capital formation and SEC regulation. I am Richard W. Rahn, a Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute and a syndicated weekly economic columnist. My testimony today reflects my own opinions and views and not necessarily those of any organization with which I have an affiliation. 



Over the last few decades, I have served as head of a graduate school of business, a professor of economics, executive director of the American Council for Capital Formation, Vice President and Chief Economist of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, an economic advisor to political leaders in a number of countries, including the U.S., and as a financial regulator. In addition, I have been an entrepreneur and raised capital for several start‐​up companies, one of which, Sterling Semiconductor, was sold to a publicly‐​held company. 



In my view, the Securities and Exchange Commission is in need of a drastic restructuring and downsizing, because it has done considerable damage to the U.S. economy:



In the meantime, the SEC’s budget has exploded, increasing an extraordinary five‐​fold in the past 15 years, with no objective indication that investors or financial markets are more protected or improved. Countries compete not only in the production of goods and services but also in regulatory efficiency, and by this measure the SEC should receive a failing grade. 



In sum, the SEC has provided _negative_ value added. If the SEC was a private company with this kind of track record, it would have long since gone out of business.



A major problem with the SEC is that it does not do proper cost‐​benefit analysis for both new and existing regulations. Many outside observers, who are familiar with what the SEC calls cost‐​benefit analysis, view it as joke in that it often is not up to professional standards. This is not surprising given the inherent conflict of interest within the SEC. Those who are hired to write regulations know that if they ever say they have written all of the regulations that really need to be written, they will no longer be needed; hence, no job.



The currency among those in government is not so much money as it is power, number of staff, and visibility. Thus, the people at the SEC, from the Chairman on down, have an incentive to grow the agency and get it into new areas – whether needed or not – in order to justify more staff and a bigger budget. There is an entire field in economics, known as “public choice,” which is devoted to the study of the problem of those in government having different goals from those of the citizens they are supposed to be serving. The office responsible for doing cost‐​benefit analysis will not be considered a “team player” if it does approve most new regulations. A conflict of interest exists as long as those doing cost‐​benefit analysis report to those who have an interest in making the agency bigger. A partial solution to this problem is to make the office of the chief economist separate from the existing organization, much like the offices of the various “inspector generals” in government departments. One of the jobs of the office of the chief economist is to say “no,” which requires independence.



In this testimony, I will give examples of the problems caused by inadequate cost‐​benefit analysis. I shall start with a personal example. I was one of the founders of a start‐​up semiconductor company. We grew rapidly, required more capital, and were faced with a choice of selling a major share of the company to a venture capital group, selling the company to a publicly‐​listed company, or doing an IPO. Our preferred solution was an IPO because we viewed that as the best alternative to maximize existing shareholders’ value. However, once we had evaluated the cost of going public – much of it due to excessive SEC regulations – we had to settle for second best, which was a sale to a publicly‐​owned, listed company. This turned out to be an inferior solution that denied our initial investors much of the upside potential that they may have obtained with an IPO. SEC’s overregulation did not protect our initial investors, but cost them dearly. Such overregulation, requiring excessive time by accountants, lawyers, and others, diverts needed capital away from new enterprises which have the most potential to create jobs and increase productivity.



Another example of SEC overreach is in the whole area of “accredited investors.” The concept of the “accredited investor” was originally created as a “safe harbor” for those seeking investments in new or small enterprises, and not as a restriction on other perfectly suitable investors. The SEC took this constructive concept and turned it into a minimum requirement by making the registration process so expensive that small companies have almost no choice but to restrict themselves to only soliciting “accredited investors.” By requiring minimum net worth and income standards for investors in start‐​ups, etc., the SEC now prohibits perfectly suitable potential investors from enjoying the profits of new and small companies. These standards appear to be totally arbitrary and rule out all but a couple of percentage of the entire population. Under the existing SEC definitions of an “accredited investor,” a rock musician or football player with a high income and net worth but no knowledge about investments is “accredited.” On the other hand, a young professor of finance or tax lawyer who has not yet met the income and net worth requirements is not allowed to invest. This policy is “stupid,” destructive, and discriminatory. Wealthy people are allowed to invest in things that can make them much more money, but poorer people (98%+ of the population) are prevented from the same opportunity.



The SEC’s rationale for this destructive, discriminatory policy is to protect the less sophisticated investors from a potential loss. If it is really considered public policy to protect people from decisions causing financial loss, why does not government require everyone who gambles in Las Vegas, Atlantic City or wherever to become an “accredited gambler.” When one studies the mathematics of probability, one learns that even in a fair game (with even odds) eventually it does not matter how much money a player has; he or she will lose it all; this is known as “the gambler’s ruin theorem.” Casino gambling is not a “fair game” in that the house must have its “take.” It even gets worse with the state lotteries, which often give terrible odds (if they are not financial fraud, I don’t know what is). Yet, anyone, no matter how poor or incompetent, is allowed, and often even encouraged by government, to gamble his or her entire net worth and then some. 



Unlike gambling, including state lotteries, we know that most people who invest in the stock market make money over the long run. There are already plenty of statutes on the books to punish misrepresentation and fraud by stock promoters and boiler shop operators; and so the “accredited investor” concept is just not needed, and, in fact, it has now become destructive. It would be interesting to know how many people who were prohibited from investing in start‐​up companies instead gambled away part of the money. In sum, the SEC is engaged in an activity that reduces productive capital formation and denies most people the opportunity to improve their well being, which has the side effect of encouraging people to engage in irrational and destructive gambling. If the SEC had a serious and independent office for doing cost‐​benefit analysis, the existing “accredited investor” nonsense would have been deep‐​sixed many years ago. In a free society, people should be free to spend and invest their money as they see fit, and for the nannies at the SEC to pretend they know better is nothing more than what the great economist and Nobel laureate F. A. Hayek referred to as the “fatal conceit.”



In has long been an article of faith at the SEC that trading on “inside information” is evil and must be stopped at all costs. This has led the SEC to create broader and broader definitions of both what is “inside information” and who is an “insider.” The war on insider trading has much intuitive appeal; but like many things that seem obvious, it just does not stand up under rigorous analysis. The esteemed law and economics scholar Henry Manne wrote a classic book on the subject back in 1966 where he challenged the conventional wisdom on insider trading by observing that the attempts to stop insider trading had adverse effects on price discovery, thus disadvantaging investors who were not insiders. Over the years, more and more law and economics scholars have come to understand that Manne was correct. In recent years, Manne (who is dean emeritus of the George Mason University Law School) has continued to make his case, which is now increasingly obvious, of the almost impossibility of containing information in the age of instant information everywhere. To think that valuable information about relevant matters within a corporation is not going to leak out deliberately or accidently is the ultimate naivety. Here we have the SEC demanding that companies keep secrets from their investors and the outside world until the time when the SEC suddenly declares that now is the moment it can be released. Does this not contradict the self‐​proclaimed goals of openness and transparency?



The U.S. government cannot keep its most sensitive military and diplomatic secrets from leaking out, yet it expects thousand of companies with less sensitive information to keep it from leaking. Company officers and directors can be fined or go to jail for a mere momentary slip of the tongue or lapse in judgment. Yet, how often do we see high‐​level government officials go to jail or pay fines for far more serious breaches? Never!



The SEC continues to try to stretch the definition of an insider, even attempting to go after securities’ analysts whose job it is to ferret out information in order to serve investors. The Supreme Court in the Dirks case made it clear that, in the absence of a fiduciary duty to keep information secret, the law favors a free flow of information to the market. Yet, the SEC continues to ignore the Dirks case in its never‐​ending zeal to restrict free speech and legitimate information flow. The 1st Amendment’s protection of free speech should always trump demands by regulatory bureaucrats for more speech restrictions. This is particularly true since Manne and others have shown that the SEC’s information restrictions actually impede price discovery and hence deny investors the information they need to both protect and benefit themselves.



What is valuable to me as an investor is to know if the officers and directors of a company are buying or selling shares. With modern technology, this could be available to me within a few seconds of an “insider” buying or selling, allowing me to act on this information. Instant information on insider sale or purchases is likely to be much more useful to an investor than some long‐​held, sterilized press release overseen by those at the SEC about what they consider to be a change in the material condition of a firm. When I buy stock, I understand that those within the company are going to have more information than I do and will have an advantage over me – and that is the nature of life. To assume that a regulatory agency can somehow ensure that all investors have all of the relevant information, with the same level of understanding, at the same time is utopian non‐​sense and again evidence of the “fatal conceit.”



Trying to define an “insider” is an almost impossible task. During this past year, there were press stories about how a number of Senators appeared to have consistently made outside returns in their investment portfolios, and the implication was that they had information the rest of us did not have in making their investment decisions. I expect that was both true and not‐​illegal. Members of Congress make decisions all of the time that materially affect companies and, as a result, stock prices. An intention to place a costly regulation or tax on an industry or company, or give an industry or company a subsidy before it is announced to the public provides a perfect selling or buying opportunity for those members of Congress and their staffs in the know. There are many people in Washington who make their livings by trying to ferret out the intentions of the elected representatives. 



As a result, there have been calls to place trading or other restrictions on members of Congress and their staffs. In my view, such restrictions would be largely unenforceable and counterproductive because there are too many ways to get around them; and with human nature being what it is, ways would be found to circumvent any restriction. Members could give a wink and a nod to key campaign contributors about intended actions to benefit or hurt particular companies. As a practical matter, it is not possible to prevent members of Congress, their staffs, their families, and their contributors, etc. from having prior information which will hurt or benefit companies. And having such prior information provides such an incentive to act upon it that some will. This may not necessarily be bad, because, to the extent such actions affect the stock price, non‐​inside investors will then obtain information that may influence their own buy and sell decisions. 



If it is impossible to control what members of Congress will do or say, even though it may have a major impact on companies, why should only employees of companies and their relatives, friends, etc. be subject to insider trading restrictions? To penalize what should be the right of free speech by corporate executives, and not penalizing the similar speech of others in the know which may be even more damaging or beneficial to a corporation is both hypocritical and grossly unfair. There have been all too many cases of rouge prosecutors and regulators – some even from the SEC — making untrue charges (which were later thrown out of court) about companies and their executives that greatly and unfairly damaged investors. Corporate officers are subject to prosecution for making untruthful statements that hurt investors. Perhaps, investors who have suffered losses by untruthful statements or regulatory excesses by SEC personnel should be allowed to recover their losses from these miscreants in the same way that corporate executives are fined. This would encourage SEC personnel to be more responsible. The SEC and too many other agencies have abused the privilege of sovereign for far too long.



The SEC has almost completely ignored the arguments of many law and economics scholars in regard to insider trading. It has ignored the mile wide loop holes in its regulations, as noted above. It has failed to do adequate cost‐​benefit analysis. And it has failed to recognize the hypocrisies and practical unenforceability of its own rules in regard to insider‐​trading. 



Again, public choice theory explains the behavior of the SEC in regard to insider trading regulations. If there are few restrictions, and if these restrictions are clear and enforceable, only a few people will be necessary to enforce them; hence, a smaller agency. Congress is going to have to force the SEC to make these necessary changes because the agency will never make them on its own because it does not think the changes are in its self‐​interest.



I have only touched on a few of the issues where the SEC needs to be radically restructured and downsized. The SEC has strayed far from its core mission, allowing Madoff, Enron, and others to completely elude the agency, while the SEC has chased never‐​ending new missions. The SEC does not need more staff and budget to do its job. The problem is that its staff and budget have grown so large and the agency is so‐​dysfunctional it is no longer doing its core job. The SEC has become a major drag on the economy by increasing uncertainty and risk for businesses, and by saddling businesses with costly and non‐​productive regulations.



The current budget crisis should be used as an opportunity to force the SEC to downsize and restructure. Companies that get into trouble are forced, at times, to lay off many of their staff in order to both survive and prosper. 



Congress should say to the SEC:



“You have failed to do adequate cost‐​benefit analysis so we will no longer give you the funds to enforce regulations that have not or do not pass a rigorous independent cost‐​benefit test. The overregulation has reduced productive capital inflow to the corporate sector, hurting productivity growth and job creation.



You have in effect denied 98%+ of the population the opportunity to participate in new ventures without excessive cost. This has driven needed productive capital out of start‐​up companies. Thus, we will no longer fund the enforcement of the existing “accredited investor” restrictions. Investors will continue to be protected by laws and rules against misrepresentation and fraud.



Your insider‐​trading rules are inconsistent and in many ways destructive, so we will not provide you with the funds necessary to enforce these rules until you develop satisfactory alternatives, which are both economically sound and legally enforceable without trampling on basic Constitutional rights of the citizens.”



Thank you very much.

Religious dialogue is worthwhile endeavor. In particular, Christians and Muslims should engage one another. While miracles are unlikely to result, greater familiarity may reduce unintended misunderstanding and insult.



However, any dialogue must be based on truth. Including the pervasive Islamic persecution of Christians, Jews, and other religious minorities.



Unfortunately, truth apparently is not a concern of the Muslim side of one well‐​publicized engagement process with Catholics. The al‐​Azhar Islamic Research Council, Sunni Islam’s highest seat of learning, held an emergency meeting and decided to suspend its bi‐​annual meetings with the Vatican.



The reason: “repeatedly insulting remarks issued by the Vatican Pope towards Islam and his statement that Muslims are discriminating against others who live with them in the Middle East.” The Cairo‐​based Council also criticized Pope Benedict XVI’s “unjustified claim that Copts are persecuted in Egypt and the Middle East.” Indeed, added the Council, the Pope had “repeatedly addressed Islam negatively.” Sheikh Ahmed el‐​Tayeb, the grand imam of al‐​Azhar University, further denounced the Pope’s “unacceptable interference in Egypt’s affairs.”



Even before the Council acted, the Egyptian government had attacked the Vatican’s “unacceptable interference in its internal affairs” and recalled its ambassador from the Holy See. Ambassador Lamia Aly Mekhemar, who returned to Cairo for “consultation,” explained that “We do not share the views that Christians are persecuted in our part of the world.” Nor, he added, does his government agree that “some governments in the area have not provided protection for the Christians in the Middle East.” Moreover, Arab leaders gathered for an economic summit in Sharm al‐​Sheikh expressed “total rejection” of foreign interference regarding Christian minorities in the Middle East.



The Council, Egyptian government, and other Middle Eastern states are angry because the Pope denounced the murder of Christians in Egypt, Iraq, and Nigeria. He spoke of “the urgent need for the governments of the region” to protect religious minorities and urged Christian communities to maintain a nonviolent response to “a strategy of violence that has Christians as a target.”



Apparently the al‐​Azhar Islamic Research Council believes in inter‐​faith dialogue, but only so long as it does not include the fact that members of one side of that dialogue are busy killing members of the other side. Indeed, pointing to ongoing attacks constitutes “insulting remarks.” Moreover, America’s Arab allies enjoy cashing big checks from Uncle Sam, but are outraged, simply outraged, that the latter has the temerity to mention the lack of religious liberty in those same nations.



Almost makes you wonder whether adherents of the “religion of peace” think it really is the “religion of peace.” Or at least that being the “religion of peace” actually requires believing in, well, “peace.”



The reaction of the Council and Arab governments is extraordinarily revealing because Islamic brutality, both discrimination and violence, against Christians is so pervasive. The Pope spoke out after a bombing in Alexandria outside a Coptic Church on New Year’s Eve which killed 25 people and injured more than 90 others. Christians continue to be killed in Iraq and Nigeria. 



Christian converts risk judicial murder in Afghanistan. Pakistan is threatening to execute a Christian “blasphemer” in Pakistan. Iran recently initiated a campaign against Christians. Even in relatively liberal Muslim states, like Kuwait, where Christians can worship openly, proselytism is forbidden.



Egypt is a particularly apt case since the number of Christians is relatively large, constituting as much as 15 percent of a population of more than 80 million.



Violence is common. In mid‐​November an off‐​duty police officer boarded a train and opened fire, murdering a 71‐​year‐​old Copt and injuring five other Christians. Last November Muslim mobs destroyed a score of homes and shops in Qena Province. Earlier in the year six Copts along with a Muslim guard were killed and another nine Copts wounded in a drive‐​by shooting in the town of Nag Hammadi. Kathryn Cameron Porter of the Council for Human Rights observed afterwards: “Copts in Egypt continuously face ongoing discrimination and outright persecution, either by the Egyptian government or through its tacit approval.”



Although Cairo routinely discriminates against non‐​Muslims, it does not directly engage in what we typically think of as persecution. But it does little to prevent private violence. Unfortunately, the effect is basically the same.



Dina Guirguis of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy testified last week before the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission of the House Foreign Affairs Committee: “Egypt’s native Christians … are the Middle East’s largest Christian minority but in the past decade have faced an alarming escalation of violence as state protection has dwindled.” Yet when the Copts attempt to protect themselves, as in the city of Giza last November, the police do intervene — against the victims.



Guirguis pointed to one case where a judge and his two sons, who were prosecutors, led a mob in destroying a Greek Orthodox church. “At least half a dozen murders of Christians by Muslims in the last four years were rendered crimes without punishment due to the refusal of the state to follow the requirements of the rule of law in prosecuting felonies,” she added. The complicity of security forces and legal officials in violence as well as discrimination demonstrates to all Egyptians that “sectarian violence is a crime to be committed with impunity,” Guirguis warned.



The government also routinely interferes with Copts simply seeking to live out their faith. The state often refuses to allow construction or repair of churches or other buildings, even those for social functions. Christians have been ordered to take down crosses outside of churches and even charged for private worship without a permit. Moreover, the government has discriminated against Copts when fulfilling its civil role, such as issuing identification cards.



Egypt’s wretched record is well established. In its report last year on international religious freedom, the State Department observed: “Christians and members of the Baha’i faith, which the government does not recognize, face personal and collective discrimination, especially in government employment and their ability to build, renovate, and repair places of worship. The government also sometimes arrested, detained, and harassed Muslims such as Shi’a. Ahmadiyas, Quaranists, converts from Islam to Christianity, and members of other religious groups whose beliefs and/​or practices it deemed to deviate from mainstream Islamic beliefs and whose activities it alleged to jeopardize communal harmony.”



For the same reasons the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom placed Egypt on its “watch list.” The Commission pointed to widespread “discrimination, intolerance, and other human rights violations against members of religious minorities, as well as disfavored Muslims.” Last year’s Commission report cited “a significant upsurge in violence” against Copts as well as “a growing climate of impunity” for those who commit such crimes.



The group International Christian Concern placed Egypt in this year’s annual “Hall of Shame.” Explained ICC: “While Egypt escaped being included in the Hall of Shame in 2010, escalating atrocities committed against the Arab world’s largest Christian minority forced us to include Egypt in this year’s report.” Indeed, last year, reported ICC, was “one of Egypt’s worse years of persecution in recent memory.”



One can’t help but wonder where Pope Benedict came up with the silly idea that Christians face discrimination and persecution in the Middle East. No wonder the al‐​Azhar Islamic Research Council was upset. Tsk, tsk.



Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi responded to the Council decision: “The pontifical council for inter‐​religious dialogue’s line of openness and desire to dialogue is unchanged.” That’s a truly “Christian” response, but the Vatican obviously should not expect the same in return, at least not from its Islamic counterparts.



There is much to criticize in the policies of Western governments, including of the U.S. But that has nothing to do with an inter‐​faith dialogue. It certainly has nothing to do with how Christians, Jews, Baha’is, and other religious minorities are, or at least should be, treated in majority Muslim nations.



Moreover, until Muslim governments treat all of their people, irrespective of faith, with respect and dignity, they have no credibility to complain about the treatment of Muslims elsewhere. As Jesus explained, we should take the plank out of our own eye before seeking to pull a speck out of someone else’s eye (Matthew 7:3–5). His advice should be widely shared and, more importantly, heeded in Cairo and throughout the Muslim world.

"**Video conferencing company Zoom has said annual sales will be even higher than expected as the pandemic drives demand for its software.**
The California firm said revenue could hit more than $2.5bn (Â£1.9bn) - more than twice what it forecast in March.
The prediction comes as Zoom, once a niche tech name, has shot to prominence during the pandemic.
Millions have turned to the app to socialise with family and friends, teach and meet with colleagues.
Zoom founder and chief executive Eric Yuan said the company was converting more and more businesses to paying customers, as they adapt to ""a new world of work from anywhere"".
At the end of October, Zoom had nearly 434,000 business customers that had more than 10 employees - up approximately 485% from the same quarter a year ago.
The surge has lifted revenue and profits and sent the firm's stock soaring.
Zoom said sales in the August-October period hit $777m, up 367% year-on-year. Profits were $198.4m in the quarter, compared to $2.2m in the same period a year earlier.
On Monday, the company revised higher its full-year forecast for a third time, telling investors it expected full-year sales of more than $2.5bn, up from $2.37bn it forecast in August.
That would compare to just $622.7m in the prior financial year.
Despite the gains, shares in the firm fell in after-hours trade, after Zoom said it expected sales between $806m and $811m in the last three months of its financial year, implying a slight slowdown in the firm's blockbuster growth rate.
Investors are eager to see how Zoom will fare as coronavirus concerns fade.
Zoom chief financial officer Kelly Steckelberg said the firm remained ""optimistic on Zoom's outlook"", but cautioned investors to remember that ""the impact and extent of the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated economic concerns remain largely unknown"".
""Our higher outlook for FY21 is based on our current perspective of the business environment,"" she said.
She said while many smaller businesses and individual users may leave Zoom as life returns to normal, she expected remote working to remain more common than it was.
""Remote work trends are here to stay,"" she said on a conference call to discuss the firm's results."

Are Winters Getting Colder?
 By Ed Caryl
There is much denial disbelief going around about our ever changing world. Are the winters getting colder? Are the summers getting hotter? Are the ice-caps melting? What’s going on?
Fortunately there are systems keeping track. And there are simple ways of plotting the data. One plot, available from Goddard Institute of Space Science (GISS), is a temperature trend plot by month of the year. Here is a plot of temperature trend by month of the year (horizontal) by latitude (vertical) for the last 17 years. 

Figure 1 is a zonal trend plot by month for the period 1995 to the present. Horizontal axis = months of the year Jan – Dec; vertical axis = latitude.
Note that temperatures for latitudes 40 to 60 degrees north are trending colder for most of the winter, from mid-November to mid-February, the coldest period for a month centered on the 1st of February. On the rim of Antarctica, the trending-colder month is June, the Antipodes mid-winter.

So, yes, winters are getting colder. Here is the corresponding map showing precisely where the winters are getting colder.

Figure 2 is a global map of the trends plotted in Figure 1.
Note that nearly all the continental areas in the northern hemisphere where people actually live, with the exception of India, are experiencing colder winters. The chart also shows Europe’s Alps region is getting significantly colder in the winter time, too, just as German meteorologist Dominik Jung found when evaluating data from the Austrian Weather Service, read: Austrian meteorologists stupefied.
I will leave it as an exercise for the reader to look at the cooling pattern in the Southern Hemisphere winter. Note that it looks a lot like the pattern for the southern hemisphere summer. Now ask why the Antarctic sea ice is expanding.
Now for those who get all excited about Arctic warming, I would like to point out the dearth of weather stations in that region, and my previous article about bias in the surface measurements. There are exactly three weather stations used by GISS that are north of 80 degrees. Alert on Ellesmere Island is one of them. It is that light blue rectangle at the top just left of center in Figure 2. It is getting cooler in the winter. One other is a Russian station on Hayes Island in the Franz Josef Archipelago. It is getting cooler in the summer. The third is Nord on northern Greenland. It is getting warmer in all seasons. I believe it has siting issues.
The continents warm and cool faster than the oceans. The continental cooling we are observing will be followed by ocean cooling. It is already happening in the southern ocean in all seasons and in the summer tropics.

Fun fact for a Tuesday: There is no professional standard low enough, none, that _Stuff_ cannot plunge beneath. They are positively subterranean news-disseminators, Media dung-beetles.



Saturday’s offering _“As fires rage in the Amazon, international pressure mounts on Brazil to take action”_ is a perfect exhibit of their mendacious outlook to all things climatey and begs the question; if the world is truly facing imminent climate cataclysm, why do they lie about it and exaggerate so much?



 _Stuff_ , August 24, **2019:**



“The Amazon rainforest is one of the world’s best defenses against climate change and it’s burning at an alarming rate.” 



_Otago Daily Times_ , December 5, **1912:**



“Forest fires destroy thousands of trees every year in Amazonas.” 



Yes; it’s over a century since New Zealanders were informed about the yearly fires in the Amazon. But it’s all ‘new’ and ‘alarming’ to _Stuff._



In an attempt to highlight the gravitas of the fires _Stuff_ reproduces a NASA-supplied satellite image but neglects to include the NASA-supplied caption stating **“fire activity was slightly below average in the Amazon Basin”.** Perhaps the omission was an honest [cough] mistake but; methinks not:



Trained and skilled journalists might have fact-checked the screed, it’s easy enough to do because there’s a lot of publicly available data accessible, available almost instantly, at the click of a button:



But that’s not _Stuff’s_ style. Tis far easier to wallow in a permanent state of ‘alarm’ than to seek the truth, even if the truth means as little as lifting a finger.

"Species introduced by humans to areas where they don’t naturally occur are a worldwide problem. These “alien species” can cost a lot of money to deal with, and they’re the number one driver associated with recent extinctions worldwide. The rate at which new populations of alien species are establishing is increasing rapidly, and ideally we’d like to stop the process in its tracks.  But first we need to answer two key questions: firstly, what features of species make them good at becoming alien? For instance why has the Indian myna bird managed to establish itself across the world while its relative the crested myna has not? And, secondly, what is it that makes some locations more susceptible to aliens establishing there? While we have made progress in answering the first question, we haven’t done nearly so well with the second. The reason for this is that the environment is very complicated and so many elements of it might be important for an arriving alien species. For instance the climate at a new location is likely to matter, not just in absolute terms, but in how well it matches what the alien is used to back home. Climatic extremes may be as or more important than averages in this regard.  Which species are already present at the location is also likely to be important. Too many and the alien may get easily outcompeted or eaten, too few might mean there wasn’t enough food in the area. Again, the identity of the alien matters in these regards. Habitat will matter, as will the extent to which humans have modified it. Finally, all of these features of the location vary over space and time, and which species get introduced as aliens also is not random, all of which introduces a range of complications. In collaboration with colleagues in Australia and the US, my research group set out to attempt a rigorous global analysis of why some locations are more susceptible to alien establishment. We first assembled a catalogue of more than 4,000 alien bird introductions, featuring everything from Australian magpies in New Zealand to Southeast Asian zebra doves in Hawaii. We then overlaid it with information on features of the local environment, species traits, and how many individuals got introduced (important because small founding populations can easily fail by accident), and used complex statistical methods to assess the impacts of all these different factors. Our results are now published in Nature. Overall, we found that environmental features were the most important, particularly human impacts on the environment – how many other alien species groups were already present, for example – and how well the new environment matched what the species was used to from its native range.  The matching effect is not surprising – introduce a tropical parrot to the Arctic and it’s probably not going to do very well – but it is reassuring, as it gives us confidence in our analysis. This makes the anthropogenic effects more worrying though, in particular that alien birds are more likely to establish populations in areas that already have more aliens of other sorts. This is consistent with the “invasional meltdown” hypothesis that previous invasions help facilitate future alien arrivals. The meltdown result does not simply reflect general environmental disturbance, as we also found that alien birds are more likely to establish themselves in less disturbed habitats – for example, areas where lots of habitat had been converted to cropland in the run up to the introduction.  Another sort of disturbance that matters is bad weather – a big storm in the period immediately following introduction can cause the alien population to disappear. There was already anecdotal evidence for this – for example, the initial extinction of the alien house crow population from Mauritius following a storm – but our analysis shows that this is a general effect. We did find some evidence that lots of native bird species meant alien birds were less likely to establish themselves, but alien birds do slightly better in areas with at least some similar native species rather than none. This makes sense – for example, an alien bird that eats insects might be expected to do better in areas where native insectivores live, as long as there aren’t too many for the aliens to make a living. Overall, however, the types of native plants and animals had a relatively weak effect on alien bird establishment success. While the environment explained most variation in alien bird establishment overall, we also found large effects of species traits and number of individuals introduced. Founding population size needs to be large enough (more than about 50 birds) to avoid the alien population failing simply by chance (the same reason we worry about very small populations of threatened native species). Assuming there are enough birds, then it helps if they breed fast but don’t die too young. It also helps if they are not too fussy about what they eat or where they live. Taken together, our results show how features of the environment, the species, and the founding population size have all influenced the global history of alien bird establishment. They also suggest reasons to worry. The world is showing signs of a global invasion meltdown, while ever more alien species are being introduced to new locations and getting the chance to test their environmental matches. Increasingly, the future is looking alien."
"It’s been nearly two years since Hurricane Irma devastated the tiny Caribbean island of Barbuda. Gusts of 150mph or more damaged or destroyed almost every structure on the island, and its 1,600 residents were evacuated. Around 1,300 people soon returned, but since then, most have lived without routine public services or safe housing, and they face increasing pressure from the government to migrate off the island so it can be redeveloped for mass tourism. Antigua and Barbuda are a twin island state. Barbuda, the smaller and less built up of the two, has until now escaped overdevelopment and has been largely left to its natural state of mangroves and scrub brush. Its residents make a living from sustainable fishing and the export of lobster, along with low-key tourism.  Since emancipation from slavery in 1834, Barbudans have governed their land in common, without private ownership. Residents and their descendants can confirm their claim for parcels of land with the democratically elected, 11-member Barbuda council.  Following Hurricane Irma in 2017, the prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda – Gaston Browne – has sought to revoke this centuries-old system of communal land rights, stating that freehold tenure will allow Barbudans to secure bank loans to rebuild their houses.  Earlier in 2019, the photographer Tamzin Forster and I travelled to Barbuda to see what this meant in practice. We spoke to many local residents in order to understand how the island is – or isn’t – recovering, and what their visions were for the future of Barbuda.

      'Land grab' on hurricane-hit Barbuda could leave the island almost entirely owned by banks


 “After Irma the Antiguan side of government has been calling us all sorts of names, like inhabitants and squatters. But this is our land and we have lived here all our lives,” said Barbudan resident and resident DJ, Ordrick. Browne’s rhetoric that Barbudans are “squatting” on the land has been met with collective resistance from locals who argue that the Antiguan side of government wants to establish freehold tenure to free up the island for purchase by international interests to establish private resorts for mass tourism, as in Antigua. Locals, including secretary of the island’s council, Paul Nedd, have argued that Barbudans legally own land communally.  The situation in Barbuda has been described as an example of “disaster capitalism”. As Naomi Klein argued in The Shock Doctrine, disaster capitalism describes how wealthy elites exploit crises, such as major natural disasters, to reap profits and deepen inequality, while affected populations are still in shock.  Barbudans are highly suspicious of the Antiguan government’s intentions. As only one out of 17 parliamentary members represent Barbuda, political power is concentrated in Antigua. This adds to the often tense relationship between the two islands since unification in 1981, following independence from the British.  As local resident Byron told us: “I don’t think the government is doing the best for the people. They are doing what is best for Antigua – to profit from our land. They just want a quick fix for development.”  Yet residents have stoically remained on the island despite difficult living conditions and a cripplingly slow disaster recovery process. There is only one bank and one post office on the island, and neither are fully functioning. The bank in Barbuda remains derelict with an ATM that only dispenses EC$100 (US$37) at a time, if it works at all. This prompted 30 Barbudans to travel to Antigua to protest about the time it is taking the Antigua Commercial Bank to return banking services. Visitors cannot access money for tours and accommodation, which is stifling the local economy.  Most Barbudans we spoke to were opposed to mass development for tourism, epitomised by controversial plans – backed by Browne and Hollywood star Robert De Niro – to build a large luxury resort called Paradise Found. George Jeffreys, a 72-year-old who has been living in a tent ever since Irma, said that plans for mass tourism threaten Barbudan culture: “The Antigua side of government is against our lifestyle. We as Barbudans don’t want automatic development – we want control. It has to be developed according to our own population’s needs.” Disasters are often viewed as an opportunity for societies to build back better. However, Barbudans have alternative visions of what better means for the island. “Mass development means you need more employees than the Barbudans on the island, which undermines the whole Barbuda concept of lifestyle,” resident Joycelin told us. “What needs to happen is small, effective hotels. Small effective restaurants and shops that can accommodate our community.” Ida has lived on Barbuda for more than 70 years. “We ain’t against the hotels,” she said, “but we need new industries where people can learn skills instead of us always being the cleaners in the hotels”. Others we spoke to wanted to amend regulations to allow Barbuda’s seaport to directly trade with other islands. Currently, imports and exports must go via Antigua, which means that profits from trade tariffs go directly to Antigua.  Recovery is progressing painfully slowly on Barbuda, and the Antiguan side of government continues to mount pressure for people to leave the island. For now Barbudans are continuing to fiercely defend their system of communal land rights."

 **Introduction**



It is galling to hear administration officials characterize the auto bailouts as “successful.” The word should be off‐​limits when describing this unfortunate chapter in U.S. economic history. At most, bailout proponents and apologists might respectfully argue — and still be wrong, however — that the bailouts were necessary evils undertaken to avert greater calamity.



But calling the bailouts “successful” is to whitewash the diversion of funds from the Troubled Assets Relief Program by two administrations for purposes unauthorized by Congress; the looting and redistribution of claims against GM’s and Chrysler’s assets from shareholders and debt‐​holders to pensioners; the use of questionable tactics to bully stakeholders into accepting terms to facilitate politically desirable outcomes; the unprecedented encroachment by the executive branch into the finest details of the bankruptcy process to orchestrate what bankruptcy law experts describe as “Sham” sales of Old Chrysler to New Chrysler and Old GM to New GM; the costs of denying Ford and the other more deserving automakers the spoils of competition; the costs of insulating irresponsible actors, such as the United Autoworkers, from the outcomes of an apolitical bankruptcy proceeding; the diminution of U.S. moral authority to counsel foreign governments against similar market interventions; and the lingering uncertainty about the direction of policy under the current administration that pervades the business environment to this very day.



In addition to the above, there is the fact that taxpayers are still short tens of billions of dollars on account of the GM bailout without serious prospects for ever being made whole. Thus, acceptance of the administration’s pronouncement of auto bailout success demands profound gullibility or willful ignorance. Sure, GM has experienced recent profits and Chrysler has repaid much of its debt to the Treasury. But if proper judgment is to be passed, then all of the bailout’s costs and benefits must be considered. Otherwise, calling the bailout a success is like applauding the recovery of a drunken driver after an accident, while ignoring the condition of the family he severely maimed.



This testimony provides a more comprehensive assessment of the costs and lasting implications of the GM bailout than the administration has been willing to undertake publicly.



 **Crisis Mongering**



On November 5, 2008, the Center for Automotive Research, a Detroit‐​based consulting firm, released the results of a study warning that as many as three million jobs were at stake in the automotive sector unless the U.S. government acted with dispatch to ensure the continued operation of all of the Big Three automakers.1 Detroit’s media blitz was underway. It was timed to remind then‐​President‐​Elect Obama, as he contemplated his victory the morning after, of the contribution to his success by certain constituencies now seeking assistance themselves. The CAR report’s projection of three million lost jobs was predicated on the fantastical worst‐​case scenario that if one of the Big Three were to go out of business and liquidate, numerous firms in the auto supply chain would go under as well, bringing down the remaining two Detroit auto producers, then the foreign nameplate U.S. producers and the rest of the parts supply chain. The job loss projections animating the national discussion were based on an assumption of a total loss of all automobile and auto parts production and sales jobs nationwide. Importantly, the report gave no consideration to the more realistic scenario that one or two of the Detroit automakers might seek Chapter 11 protection to reorganize.



The subsequent public relations effort to make the case for federal assistance was pitched in a crisis atmosphere with an air of certainty that the only real alternative to massive federal assistance was liquidation and contagion. The crisis‐​mongering was reminiscent of former‐​Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson’s and Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke’s insistence six weeks earlier that there was no time for Congress to think, only time for it to act on a financial sector bailout (i.e., TARP), lest the economy face financial ruin.



About the economic situation at that time, incoming White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel said, “You never want a serious crisis to go to waste … [t]his crisis provides the opportunity for us to do things that you could not do before.“2



The mainstream media obliged the script, elevating the automobile industry “crisis” to the top of the news cycle for the next month, and helping to characterize the debate in the simplistic, polarizing dichotomy of “Main Street versus Wall Street.” The notion that some financial institutions took risks, lost big, and were rescued by Washington became the prevailing argument for bailing out the auto companies, and the specific facts about viability and worthiness were all but totally ignored.



But public opinion quickly changed when the CEOs of GM, Ford, and Chrysler laid waste to months of public relations planning and millions of dollars spent trying to cultivate a winning message when they each arrived in Washington, tin cups in hand, aboard their own corporate jets. That fateful episode turned the media against Detroit and reminded Americans — or at least opened their minds to the prospect — that the automakers were in dire straits because of bad decisions made in the past and helped convince many that a shake out, instead of a bailout, was the proper course of action.



A few weeks later, on the same day that the CEOs returned to Washington, attempting to show contrition by making the trip from Detroit in their companies’ most eco‐​friendly cars, a new automobile assembly plant opened for business in Greensburg, Indiana. Although the hearing on Capitol Hill received far more media coverage, the unveiling of Honda’s newest facility in the American heartland spoke volumes about the true state of the U.S. car industry — and provided another example of why the bailout was misguided. The U.S. auto industry was not at risk. Two companies were suffering the consequences of years of incompetence and inefficiency exacerbated by persistent overcapacity and a deep recession. Normal bankruptcies for the two automakers were viable options, but certain stakeholders didn’t like their prospects under those circumstances.



Today, when President Obama contends that his administration saved the auto industry, he evokes memories of those CAR projections of 2–3 million job losses in the absence of government intervention. Without those inflated figures concocted during a time of “crisis,” the 225,000 jobs lost in the auto sector since November 2008 seem quite mild — even worthy of praise.3



 **That Which is Seen**



While bailout enthusiasts hail GM’s first‐​quarter earnings as proof that the administration saved the auto industry, President Obama should know better than to gloat. No such feat was accomplished and the imperative of extricating the government from GM’s operations has yet to be achieved.



With profits of $3.2 billion, the first quarter of 2011 was GM’s best performance in ten years and its fifth‐​consecutive profitable quarter. That’s good for GM, and predictably those earnings have been hailed by some as a validation of government intervention. _The Washington Post_ ’s E.J. Dionne asserted: “Far too little attention has been paid to the success of the government’s rescue of the Detroit‐​based auto companies, and almost no attention has been paid to how completely and utterly wrong opponents of the bailout were when they insisted it was doomed to failure.”



Former Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm tweeted: “To all of you in the strangle‐​government crowd, who said the bailout would never work — I’m just sayin.”



Dionne and Granholm have created a straw man, contending that bailout critics thought that the government couldn’t resuscitate GM. But the most thoughtful criticism of the bailout was not predicated on the notion that GM couldn’t be saved by the government marshaling the vast resources at its disposal. That opposition was borne of concern that that the government would do just that, and in the process impose many more costs and inflict greater damage. And that’s what it did.



But Dionne and Granholm, like others before them, stand slack‐​jawed, in awe, ready and willing to buy the Brooklyn Bridge, donning blinders and viewing just a narrow sliver of the world, oblivious to the fact that related events have been transpiring in the other 359 degrees that surround him. They are the perfect Bastiat foils, incapable of discerning the costs that are not immediately apparent.4



But only the most gullible observers would accept GM’s profits as an appropriate measure of the wisdom of the auto bailout. Those profits speak only to the fact that politicians committed over $50 billion to the task of rescuing a single company. With debts expunged, cash infused, inefficiencies severed, ownership reconstituted, sales rebates underwritten, and political obstacles steamrolled — all in the midst of a cyclical U.S. recovery and structural global expansion in auto demand — only the most incompetent operation could fail to make big profits. To that point, it’s worth noting that more than half of GM’s reported profit — $1.8 billion of $3.2 billion — is attributable to the one‐​time sales of shares in Ally Financial and Delphi, which says nothing about whether GM can make and sell automobiles profitably going forward.



In the process of “rescuing” GM, the government opened a Pandora’s Box. Any legitimate verdict on the efficacy of the intervention must account for the costs of mitigating the problems that escaped the box.



 **That Which is Not Seen**



 _Spoils of Competition Denied — Market Process Short‐​Circuited_



The intervention on GM’s behalf denied the spoils of competition — the market share, sales revenues, profits, and productive assets — to Ford, Honda, Hyundai, and all of the other automakers that made better products, made better operational decisions, were more efficient, or were more responsive to consumer demands than GM, thereby short‐​circuiting a feedback loop that is essential to the healthy functioning of competitive market economies.



Corporate bailouts are clearly unfair to taxpayers, but they are also unfair to the successful firms in the industry, who are implicitly taxed and burdened when their competition is subsidized. In a properly functioning market economy, the better firms — the ones that are more innovative, more efficient, and more popular among consumers — gain market share or increase profits, while the lesser firms contract. This process ensures that limited resources are used most productively.



It has been suggested that I view GM’s fate as a matter of national indifference. That’s correct, because I have not made the mistake of conflating GM’s condition with that of the U.S. auto industry. Whether or not there are so‐​called “national interests” in ensuring the existence of a healthy domestic auto industry (and I’m not convinced there are), health comes through an evolutionary process in which the companies that have made the right decisions survive and grow, and those that have made bad decisions contract and sometimes even disappear.



It is not only fair, but efficient and wise that the market rewards companies that make better products at better prices with higher profits and larger market shares, while the companies that make undesirable products at high cost lose profits and market share.



There is still enormous overcapacity in the U.S. auto industry, reconciliation of which the bailout of GM (and Chrsyler) has deferred at great cost to the other firms and their workers.



 _Weakening of the Rule of Law_



Although legislation to provide funding for an auto bailout passed in the House of Representatives in December 2008, the bill did not garner enough support in the Senate, where it died. Prospects for any form of taxpayer bailout seemed remote and the proper course of action for GM and Chrysler, reorganization under Chapter 11, appeared imminent. An interventionist bullet, seemingly, had been dodged.



But then, just days after then‐​Secretary Paulson claimed to have no authority to use TARP funds to support the auto companies, President Bush announced that he would authorize bridge loans from the TARP of $17.4 billion to GM and Chrysler. That opened the door to further mischief and, ultimately, another $60 billion was diverted from TARP by the Obama administration for unauthorized purposes related to the auto bailout.



Likewise, the Obama administration treated the GM (and Chrysler) bankruptcy as a Section 363 sale, which are known among bankruptcy lawyers as “Sham” sales. These 363 sales are intended to sell assets out of bankruptcy from one company to another, but are not intended as vehicles to facilitate entire corporate restructurings. In a reorganization process, all creditors are given the right to vote on the proposed plan, as well as the opportunity to offer competing reorganization plans. A 363 asset sale has no such requirements, and is being used increasingly by companies seeking to avert paying legitimate claims to creditors.



That the U.S. executive branch would pretend that the restructuring of GM was nothing more than an asset sale and deny creditors the right to vote or to offer competing bids wreaks of crony capitalism.



Though it is a difficult cost to quantify, executive branch overreach — to put it mildly — is a threat to the U.S. system of checks and balances and an affront to the rule of law.



 _Executive Encroachment into Bankruptcy Process_



General Motors was a perfectly viable company that could have been restructured through normal bankruptcy proceedings. The big question was whether GM could have received financing to operate during bankrupt, given the problems in credit markets in 2008 and 2009. Instead of commandeering the bankruptcy process as a condition of providing debtor in possession financing, the Obama administration could have provided the funds and allowed an apolitical, independent bankruptcy process to take place. But the administration’s rationale for a hand‐​on approach was that it wanted to ensure that taxpayers weren’t just throwing good money after bad, chasing empty promises made by executives with credibility problems. Yet, even with the administration’s plans for GM’s post‐​bankruptcy ownership thrust upon the company without allowance for consideration of competing plans, taxpayers will lose between $10–20 billion (without considering the $12 to $14 billion costs of the unorthodox tax breaks granted GM by the administration).



The administration’s willingness to insulate important political allies, like the UAW, from the consequences of their decisions, to shift possession of assets from shareholders and debt‐​holders to pensioners, and to deny “deficiency” claims to creditors who were short‐​changed, will make it more difficult for companies in politically important industries to borrow from private sources when they are in trouble, thereby increasing their reliance on the government purse.



The government’s willingness to intervene in the auto market under false pretenses to pick winners and losers is a significant cause of the regime uncertainty that has pervaded the U.S. economy, deterred business investment and job creation, and slowed the economic recovery ever since.



 **Outstanding Financial Costs**



As Washington has been embroiled in a discussion about national finances that features figures in the trillions of dollars, one might be tempted to marginalize as paltry the sum still owed taxpayers from the GM bailout. That figure is estimated to be about $27 billion, which accounts for the $50 billion outlay minus approximately $23 billion raised at GM’s IPO last November. But that is a very conservative figure considering that it excludes: $12-$14 billion in unorthodox tax breaks granted to GM in bankruptucy; $17 billion in funds committed from the TARP to GM’s former financial arm GMAC (which was supported to facilitate GM sales); GM’s portion of the $25 billion Energy Department slush fund to underwrite research and development in green auto technology; and the $7,500 tax credit granted for every new purchase of a Chevy Volt. There may be other subsidies, as well.



With respect to GM, taxpayers are on the line for much more than is commonly discussed.



The administration wants to put maximum distance between the episode of GM’s nationalization and the 2012 campaign season, which is nearly upon us. In that regard, the administration would like to sell the Treasury’s remaining 500 million shares as soon as possible. But the administration would also like to “make the taxpayers whole.” The problem for the president on that score is that the stock price — even with all of the happy news about the auto industry turnaround — isn’t cooperating. As of this morning, GM stock is hovering just under $30 per share. If all of the 500 million remaining publicly‐​owned shares could be sold at that price, the Treasury would net $15 billion. Add that to the $23 billion raised from the initial public offering last November, and the “direct” public loss on GM is about $12 billion — calculated as a $50 billion outlay minus a $38 billion return. (And not considering all of the extra costs identified above.)



To net $50 billion, those 500 million public shares must be sold at an average price of just over $53 — a virtual impossibility anytime soon. Why? The most significant factor suppressing the stock value is the market’s knowledge that the largest single holder of GM stock wants to unload about 500 million shares in the short term. That fact will continue to trump any positive news about GM and its profit potential, not that such news should be expected.



Projections about gasoline prices vary, but as long as prices at the pump remain in the $4 range, GM is going to suffer. Among major automakers, GM is most exposed to the downside of high gasoline prices. Despite all of the subsidies and all of the hoopla over the Chevy Volt (only 1,700 units have been sold through April 2011) and the Chevy Cruse (now subject to a steering column recall that won’t help repair negative quality perceptions), GM does not have much of a competitive presence in the small car market. Though GM held the largest overall U.S. market share in 2010, it had the smallest share (8.4%) of the small car market, which is where the demand will be if high gas prices persist. GM will certainly have to do better in that segment once the federally mandated average fleet fuel efficiency standard rises to 35.5 miles per gallon in 2016.



Reaping what it sowed, the administration finds itself in an unenviable position. It can entirely divest of GM in the short term at what would likely be a $10-to-$20 billion taxpayer loss (the stock price will drop if 500 million shares are put up for sale in short period) and face the ire of an increasingly cost‐ and budget‐​conscious electorate. Or the administration can hold onto the stock, hoping against hope that GM experiences economic fortunes good enough to more than compensate for the stock price‐​suppressing effect of the market’s knowledge of an imminent massive sales, while contending with accusations of market meddling and industrial policy.



The longer the administration retains shares in GM, it will be tempted to meddle to achieve politically desirable results.



 **Redefining Success**



Or, the administration can do what it is going to do: first, lower expectations that the taxpayer will ever recover $50 billion. Here’s a recent statement by Tim Geithner: “We’re going to lose money in the auto industry … We didn’t do these things to maximize return. We did them to save jobs. The biggest impact of these programs was in the millions of jobs saved.” That’s a safe counterfactual, since it can never be tested or proved. (There are 225,000 fewer jobs in the auto industry as of April 2011 than there were in November 2008, when the bailout process began.)



Second, the administration will argue that the Obama administration is only on the hook for $40 billion (the first $10 billion having coming from Bush). In a post‐​IPO, November 2010 statement revealing of a man less concerned with nation’s finances than his own political prospects, President Obama asserted: “American taxpayers are now positioned to recover more than _my administration_ invested in GM, and that’s a good thing.” (My emphasis).



 **Lasting Implications**



The lasting implications of the bailout will depend on whether or not Americans ultimately accept the narrative that the bailout was a success. If it is considered a success, the threshold for interventions will have been lowered and Americans will have the opportunity to judge similar bailouts in the future. If it is considered a failure — as it should be — the lasting implications will be less destructive because the threshold that tempts interventionists will be higher. On that score, contrary to what the administration would have the public believe, gauging the “success” of the GM bailout requires consideration of more than just the ratio of finances recouped over financial outlays.



There are numerous other costs that don’t factor into that equation.



If the bailout is considered a success, some of the likely lasting implications will include the following:



 **Conclusion**



The objection to the auto bailout was not that the federal government wouldn’t be able to marshal adequate resources to help GM. The most serious concerns were about the consequences of that intervention — the undermining of the rule of law, the property confiscations, the politically driven decisions and the distortion of market signals.



Any verdict on the auto bailouts must take into account, among other things, the illegal diversion of TARP funds, the forced transfer of assets from shareholders and debt‐​holders to pensioners and their union; the higher‐​risk premiums consequently built into U.S. corporate debt; the costs of denying Ford and the other more worthy automakers the spoils of competition; the costs of insulating irresponsible actors, such as the autoworkers’ union, from the outcomes of an apolitical bankruptcy proceeding; the diminution of U.S. moral authority to counsel foreign governments against market interventions; and the lingering uncertainty about policy that pervades the business environment to this day.



GM’s recent profits speak only to the fact that politicians committed more than $50 billion to the task of rescuing those companies and the United Auto Workers. With debts expunged, cash infused, inefficiencies severed, ownership reconstituted, sales rebates underwritten and political obstacles steamrolled — all in the midst of a recovery in U.S. auto demand — only the most incompetent operations could fail to make profits.



But taxpayers are still short at least $10 billion to $20 billion (depending on the price that the government’s 500 million shares of GM will fetch), and there is still significant overcapacity in the auto industry.



The administration should divest as soon as possible, without regard to the stock price. Keeping the government’s tentacles around a large firm in an important industry will keep the door open wider to industrial policy and will deter market‐​driven decision‐​making throughout the industry, possibly keeping the brakes on the recovery. Yes, there will be a significant loss to taxpayers. But the right lesson to learn from this chapter in history is that government interventions carry real economic costs — only some of which are readily measurable.

This illustration from a recent article in Science magazine shows that CO2 is plant food.  It is based on both empirical data and model results (not “data”).  I know that looking at empirical data might seem like a novel idea to some people, but for some perverse reason, I find it more compelling.

On the right: Empirical Data. Growth of 21-day-old rice and S. viridis seedlings at different ambient CO2 concentrations ranging from 30 to 800 parts per million. NOTE: The very last set of pots on the extreme right is out of sequence. They are for 390 ppm, while the next to last pots are for 800 ppm.
On the left, Modeled Data:

Modeled changes in CO2 assimilation rate in response to changes in leaf intercellular CO2 partial pressure for C3 and C4 photosynthesis and for a hypothetical C4 rice. Curves 1, 2, and 4 have Rubisco levels typically found in a C4 leaf (10 μmol m−2 catalytic Rubisco sites). Curve 3 shows a typical response for C3 leaves with three times the Rubisco level of C4 leaves. Curve 1 shows the response of a C4 leaf with C4 Rubisco kinetic properties. Curve 2 models how a C4 leaf with C3 Rubisco kinetic properties would respond (a hypothetical C4 rice with C3 Rubisco kinetics). The comparison of these two curves shows the increase in CO2 assimilation rate achieved with C4 compared with C3 Rubisco kinetic properties within a functional C4 mechanism. Arrows to curves 1 and 3 show intercellular CO2 partial pressures typical at current ambient CO2 partial pressures for C4 and C3 photosynthesis. To generate the curves, model equations were taken from (11) and comparative Rubisco kinetic constants from (12). (B) [Reference numbers per source.]

Finally, note that the top photograph on the right is for rice.  According to Wikipedia, not always a reliable source, but in this case probably trustworthy:
[Rice] is the most important staple food for a large part of the world’s human population, especially in Asia and the West Indies. It is the grain with the second-highest worldwide production, after maize (corn), according to data for 2010.
Since a large portion of maize crops are grown for purposes other than human consumption, rice is the most important grain with regard to human nutrition and caloric intake, providing more than one fifth of the calories consumed worldwide by the human species.
In other words, not only is CO2 plant food, CO2 makes human food.  Guess some folks skipped that biology class.

Matt Drudge has been riveting eyeballs by highlighting a London Telegraph piece calling the “fiddling” of raw temperature histories “the biggest science scandal ever.” The fact of the matter is some of the adjustments that have been tacked onto some temperature records are pretty alarming—but what do they really mean?   
  
One of the more egregious ones has been the adjustment of the long-running record from Central Park (NYC). Basically it’s been flat for over a hundred years but the National Climatic Data Center, which generates its own global temperature history, has stuck a warming trend of several degrees in it during the last quarter-century, simply because it doesn’t agree with some other stations (which also don’t happen to be in the stable urban core of Manhattan).   
  
Internationally, Cato Scholar Ross McKitrick and yours truly documented a propensity for many African and South American stations to report warming that really isn’t happening. Some of those records, notably in Paraguay and central South America, have been massively altered.   
  
At any rate, Chris Booker, author of the _Telegraph_ article, isn’t the first person to be alarmed at what has been done to some of the temperature records. Others, such as Richard Muller, from UC-Berkeley, along with Steven Mosher, were so concerned that they literally re-invented the surface temperature history from scratch. In doing so, both of them found the “adjustments” really don’t make all that much difference when compared the larger universe of data. While this result has been documented by the scientific organization Berkeley Earth, it has yet to appear in one of the big climate journals, a sign that it might be having a rough time in the review process.   




That’s quite different than what was found in 2012 by two Greek hydrologists, E. Steirou and D. Koutsoyiannis, who analyzed a sample of weather stations used to calculate global temperature and found the adjustments were responsible for about half of the observed warming, when compared to the raw data. Their work was presented at the annual meeting of the European Geosciences Union, but has not been published subsequently in the scientific literature. That’s not necessarily a knock on it, given the acrimonious nature of climate science, but it seems if it were an extremely robust, definitive paper, that it would have seen the light of day _somewhere_.   
  
But, before you cry “science scandal” based upon the Greek results, it’s a fact that one of the adjustments that has been commonly used—taking into account the biases introduced by the time of day in which the high and low temperatures for the previous 24 hours are recorded—in fact does induce warming into most records, a change that in fact is scientifically justified.   
  
In sum, I’d hold fire about “the biggest science scandal ever.” The facts are:

Share this...FacebookTwitterFor whatever reason the following Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) press release was nowhere mentioned in the mainstream media.
And I was not able to find the report in an English version. So what follows is a professional translation. It’s indeed something the alarmists can put in their pipes and smoke on for awhile. My emphasis added:
==========================================
“Never so much sea ice at Antarctica in the last 30 years
15 October 2013
With respect to global warming it seems to be a paradox that this year sea ice in the Southern Ocean has reached the highest extent in the last decades. It was only in the mid 1970s that a similar sea ice extent had been observed.

Automatic measurement station for recording snow thickness on sea ice (snow buoy) in the polar night. Installed during the winter experiment (photo: Sandra Schwegmann, AWI).
The mean sea ice cover for September 2013 was 19.48 million square kilometers, an area that is 50 times the size of Germany. The absolute maximum of 19.65 million square kilometers was reached on September 18. And even if this maximum in sea ice cover area cannot be viewed similarly as a maximum in total volume or the total mass, sea ice physicist Marcel Nicolaus and Stefan Hendricks of the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI): “There was more sea ice this winter than we’ve seen in a long time, if there ever was so much ice since the start of regular satellite observations.“
In order to be able to make more certain statements in the future, scientists of the Alfred Wegener Institute are currently working together with other colleagues of different institutes to also derive the thickness of the sea ice in the Antarctic from satellite observations. Recently this has become possible in the Arctic, but there are significant differences between the Arctic and Antarctic. The snow is thicker, more non-homogenous and it also does not melt completely in the summertime. Moreover much sea ice forms on the upper side, a phenomenon that takes place considerably more seldom in the Arctic. In the future it will be possible to calculate the volume of the sea ice there from the thickness and the extent.

The ice covered area of the Antarctic Ocean grows by a factor of 5 or 6 every year from its minimum of 3 to 4 million square kilometers to a maximum at the end of the winter (September) at the end of the Antarctic summer (February). However here there are large regional differences so that the Antarctic sea ice must be considered and evaluated as a puzzle made up of various ice covers.
Although over the last years an increase in ice cover has been observed in winter and summer as a whole, the tip of the Antarctic peninsula, for example, has been losing ice considerably, especially in the summer. While the Antarctic peninsula has warmed considerably over the last decades, the temperature in other regions remains stable.
These differences and the general increase in sea ice in many regions are for the most part the result of changes in the wind, which is spreading the ice apart. On the other hand, temperatures and winds from the Antarctic continent have a strong influence on the surrounding sea ice belt. That’s also a difference from the Arctic, and thus contributes to the sea ice in both polar regions behaving so differently.
To be able to better understand these interrelationships, over the last months, the AWI has conducted two winter experiments with the Polarstern research ice breaker in the Weddell Sea. In these expeditions the scientists encountered ever thicker and more compact ice which supports the claim of maximum ice mass. In addition to the measurements made during the journey, a number of automatic measurement stations were placed on the sea ice. These are now continuously measuring the thickness, temperature, and movement of the sea ice, as well as its snow cover, and they send the data via satellite to the AWI and its other project partners.
Reports, photos, maps and data of these experiments will shown and commented on here. More information is also available via the Steckbrief on the subject of sea ice as well as at the internet pages of the Sektion Meereisphysik (Section Sea Ice Physics).”
And in the AWI Fact Sheet Sektion Meereisphysik link, on page 2, they write:
“Even if there are no large area long-term measurements of sea ice thickness in the Antarctic, we conclude from various studies that the total volume of the Antarctic sea ice has grown over the last years.
The causes for these surprising observations are still the subject of various research projects. The main reason is currently suspected to be because of a strong natural variability as well as changes in the wind.”

Libertarians have mixed feelings toward Ronald Reagan. When we’re feeling positive, we remember that he used to say, “Libertarianism is the heart and soul of conservatism.”



Other times, we call to mind his military interventionism, his encouragement of the then‐​new religious right (“I know you can’t endorse me, but I endorse you.”), and his failure to really reduce the size of government. But the more experience we have with later presidents, the better Reagan looks in retrospect.



After a dispiriting era of stagflation, he revived American spirits and our faith in free enterprise. He slashed marginal tax rates and ushered in a “long boom.” Along with Margaret Thatcher, he both symbolized and galvanized a renewed enthusiasm for entrepreneurship and free markets. He shocked the



chattering classes in Washington and New York when he told the truth about communism: that it was a world of “totalitarian darkness” and a “sad, bizarre chapter in human history whose last pages even now are being written.” Even we anti‐​communists thought he was overly optimistic when he said that in 1983.



Edward H. Crane, the president of the Cato Institute, wrote in the _Wall Street Journal_ in 1988 that Reagan never paid much attention to the people he appointed to important positions in his administrations in Sacramento and Washington, thus undercutting his own efforts to implement his goals and policies. He appointed a lieutenant governor of California he’d barely met. He promised to abolish the departments of Energy and Education, then appointed secretaries who had no interest in carrying out that mission. And most particularly, he chose George Bush as his vice president and then endorsed him for the presidency. Perhaps Ronald Reagan’s worst legacy is 12 years of Bush presidencies.



Reagan had his faults. But he was an eloquent spokesman for a traditional American philosophy of individualism, self‐​reliance, and free enterprise at home and abroad, and words matter. They change the climate of opinion, and they inspire people trapped in illiberal societies. And these days, when people claiming the Reagan mantle push for wars or military involvement in Iraq, Iran, Georgia, and other danger spots, we remember that Reagan challenged the Soviet Union mostly in the realm of ideas; he used military force only sparingly. George W. Bush, whom some call “Reagan’s true political heir,” increased federal spending by more than a trillion dollars even before the financial crisis. We watch the antigay crusading of today’s conservative Republicans and remember that Reagan publicly opposed the early antigay Briggs Initiative of 1978 (featured in the movie _Milk_ ).



And in those moments we’re tempted to paraphrase the theme song of _All in the Family_ and say, “Mister, we could use a man like Ronald Reagan again.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterPerhaps some leading opinion-shapers in Germany have become aghast at the hysterical and hyper-irrational reaction coming from “climate scientists” in the wake of typhoon Yolanda, a single, destructive storm supposedly brewed by the misdeeds of darker forces, e.g. the 90 top carbon emitters of the world.
Despite the progress science and technology we’ve seen since the European Dark Ages centuries ago, the very same kind of madness seen back then seems to have found fertile ground in the minds of today’s leading figures – at least that’s what one leading book reviewer seems to be telling us.
A book review authored by Claudius Seidl appearing in Germany’s influential political daily, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) on Sunday, carries the title: Witch hunting and climate change – The winter of the world. The book: The Victims of the Franconian Witchhunts.
The FAZ describes how a trove of 17th century records from the Franconian town of Bamberg survived and allowed a detailed reconstruction of the horrifying madness that terrorized one of Europe’s most idyllic settings, a region that had yet to escape old archaic structures and where the Renaissance had yet to arrive.
FAZ book reviewer Claudia Seidl writes:
In the 17th century in the middle of Germany, witches burned. The story of the bishop who initiated the witch hunt is of amazing relevance today.”
The accused had little chance of escaping the death sentence
The madness created an atmosphere of intense fear that pitted citizen against citizen, neighbor against neighbor. Not denouncing others meant the risk of being denounced by others.
The woman, who was viewed as a well-liked neighbor suddenly found herself accused of fornification with Satan, of having cooked children into a witch’s potion, and of having flown through the night sky on a broom as a storm blew. … Whoever stood accused had little chance of escaping the death sentence.”
As a result, in the early 17th century hundreds of “witches” met their fate at a fiery stake.

Witchhunts always occurred in times of extreme weather
Although the causes of the widespread madness are still debated today, one fact is clear:
The ‘witches’ were always accused of freezing the wine and wheat. They conjured up frosts and destructive hail, cold rains and storms that were so terrifying that no one could recall anything like it before.”
Today’s scientists are embarrassed to talk about it
During these dark times of madness and paranoia, the climate had changed almost instantly from the relatively pleasant conditions of the Medieval Warm Period to the deadly harshness of the Little Ice Age. Seidl writes:
The relationship between climate change and witch-hunting is evident. In all accusations, bad weather explained by magic – but when today’s scientists mention this relationship, they do so shamefacedly, discreetly, as if the whole matter is highly embarrassing. This is so because also with us, where we are studying and measuring climate change … we have gotten used to blaming the severity of storms and rains and the size of hail on global warming.”
Seidl asks today if in these more rational times we are “unable to exorcize these questions of faith and irrationality“.
Horrifying that people prefer subjugating themselves to madness rather than questioning it
Seidl concludes, writing, “it is horrifying when madness reigns how people prefer to subjugating themselves to it rather than questioning its basis.”
And he reminds us: “It was also the wealth of those burned that filled the coffers of the Church to the brim.”

"Global leaders must heed the lessons of the financial crisis of 2008 when they look to repair the damage from the coronavirus pandemic, leading experts have warned, to avoid entrenching disastrous social, health and environmental inequalities and hastening climate breakdown. The 2008 global financial crisis and recession marked the last time the world experienced a convulsion comparable in scale to the coronavirus crisis, though starkly different in its nature. Governments responded first with economic rescue and stimulus packages worth trillions in taxpayer cash, followed in many cases by austerity programmes to cut back public spending.  But the past decade has produced far greater levels of inequality than has been seen since before the second world war, producing starker contrasts between the extremely rich and the rest in health, job security, education and other measures, with poorer people suffering worst and the middle classes squeezed while the income of the top 1% soared. Greenhouse gas emissions have also risen, despite warnings from scientists and the Paris agreement of 2015, threatening an even worse crisis if governments do not rapidly change tack. The rise came despite some efforts to “green” the post financial crisis recovery, with low-carbon and environmental measures accounting for about 16% of the stimulus. To avoid a similar outcome this time, leaders must ensure their response to the Covid-19 crisis looks to the good of the whole of society, rather than just the economy, and addresses the climate emergency as well, said Sir Michael Marmot, who led the landmark UK review of public health that found life expectancy fell following austerity. “The scale of what is happening in the economy now is hugely greater than in 2008,” he told the Guardian. “We need to bring the climate agenda and the health agenda together. If we are not careful, the steps we take now will increase inequalities further. Enough people are saying now that austerity is not an experiment we want to repeat.” Marmot is one of the leading voices calling for a “green recovery” that would direct any economic stimulus towards measures that reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well as generating jobs and repairing the economy. The economic stimulus in the years after 2008 did produce some environmental improvements such as investments in renewable energy, which have cut the cost of solar and wind power. But the push to cut emissions was stymied by factors such as the sharp fall in the carbon price under the EU’s emissions trading scheme, and China’s construction push. This time can be different, argues Lord Nicholas Stern, one of the world’s leading climate economists and author of the landmark 2006 review of the costs of climate change. “Technology is completely different now. We have seen the costs of key technologies such as renewable energy come right down. We have altogether superior electric vehicle technology. And we know more about air pollution, and how many people it kills.” Putting money into the fossil fuel economy would be a waste, he added. “That produces insecurity. If we do things that leave stranded assets [in fossil fuel businesses], we also have stranded jobs.” Yet talking about environmental measures in the midst of an economic crisis may not be popular, and could be seized on by populist opponents of climate action. The gilets jaunes protests in France were sparked by a rise in fuel taxes that had a particular impact on poorer workers in rural areas. Those protests had roots far deeper than just the fuel tax, some extending back to the response to the 2008 financial crisis, but some experts fear they show how green measures can be presented as contrary to working people’s interests. “The gilets jaunes show there is a lesson to learn,” says Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, and one of the most influential global voices on energy economics. “I am afraid there will be a divergence among policymakers – they will see [a choice between] either jobs or climate change. It’s very important that we put policies in place that help to create jobs and stimulate a clean energy transition.” Leading economists are hopeful, however, that those mistakes can be avoided and that the world will turn to “build back better” instead of pouring resources into fossil fuels. “Focus on what we already know works,” said Birol. That means clean energy, such as wind and solar power, and energy efficiency. “Then focus on technologies that are ready for the big time – hydrogen [energy] and batteries. Third, we need sustained political support.” The green recovery now has a rigorous intellectual underpinning, in the form of a paper by Nobel-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, Stern and others, published earlier this month. The paper examined the aftermath of the 2008 crisis and found that putting public money into green projects produced greater returns in both the short and long term than pouring cash into conventional high-carbon projects. That is crucial, according to Brian O’Callaghan, of the Smith School for Enterprise at Oxford University and co-author of the study, because governments want “shovel-ready” projects that produce a lot of jobs quickly, that do not need too high levels of existing skills or extensive training, and that provide infrastructure that benefit the economy. Retrofitting buildings, working on cities to make them more friendly to cyclists and pedestrians, digging trenches for broadband connections, putting in networks for charging electric vehicles, and planting trees are all examples of “shovel-ready” projects that could create jobs in the short term and reduce emissions permanently, according to Stern. “These are things that can be done quickly, and they are labour intensive.” “Policymakers have time to design policy that both accelerates our economic recovery and reduces inequality,” said O’Callaghan. “It is time to rethink economic stimulus. This spending should be about more than just increasing next year’s GDP. Once-in-a-generation government spending could be used to reduce inequality and set up new industries for the coming decade.”"

Mike Smith (Ngapuhi, Ngati Kahu), of Change Iwi Leaders Group, has lodged proceedings in the High Court against seven companies he claims are failing to protect Maori from climate change (never mind about the rest of us). 



“Maori are particularly vulnerable to climate change, being Disproportionately represented amongst the poor, who will be the hardest hit. Rising sea levels, coastal erosion, flooding and storm surges will irrevocably damage low lying coastal communities, and warming oceans and ocean acidification will damage traditional resources, including fisheries.”



  
Waah waah, waah. This would be funny if it wasn’t such a waste of time and money. As dear ol’ dad would say, some people have more dollars than sense, and to drive this point home, Smith dropped his legal action bomb before swanning off to Mexico for an indigenous people’s talkfest. Talk, talk, talk, spend, spend, spend.



Defending themselves against the trumped up charges are Fonterra Co-operative Group Ltd, Genesis Energy Ltd, Dairy Holdings Ltd, NZ Steel Ltd, Z Energy Ltd, The NZ Refining Company Ltd and BT Mining Ltd. 



Already on the receiving end of legislation from a government hostile to farming and mining, these companies must now fund their defence, which they need as much as anyone needs another hole in their head.



Strange isn’t it, that government and Iwi have endless money to fund their trivial pursuits that include attacking the lifeblood of the country, biting the hand that feeds them.



“While Smith acknowledged the Government’s efforts in enacting the Zero Carbon Act, he said steps to tackle climate change do not go far enough and he is asking the Courts to intervene.



The urgency of climate change means we need far greater action and we need it now, and not just from government but also across the private sector” he says. 



“It’s not good enough just to set far off targets, especially ones  
that let our biggest polluters like the agricultural sector off the  
hook so they can have a bit more time to turn a profit. The fact is  
we are out of time and are now looking at damage control.” 



The litigation seeks relief including a declaration that the companies have acted unlawfully, and an injunction requiring each of them to reduce total net greenhouse gases by half by 2030, and to zero by 2050, or to otherwise cease their emitting activities immediately.” 



Smith has money (and hopes for a great deal more from his court case) but no scientific leg to stand on after a landmark climate change court case was decided in favour of scientist and climate change sceptic Dr Tim Ball of Canada.



Ball was sued for libel for claiming the “hockey stick” graph, crucial to the IPCC climate change doom and gloom predictions, is scientific rubbish. Just over a week ago [Ball was exonerated from the libel charges and awarded court costs](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2019/08/22/breaking-dr-tim-ball-wins-michaelemann-lawsuit-mann-has-to-pay/). The case hinged on the pro-climate change scientists refusing to cough up the data supporting their argument which Ball claimed did not stand up to scrutiny. 



The news that climate change is officially a hoax will take some time to topple the huge financial industry of climate change, and reach our green and not so tranquil shores of mainstream media gullibility. Until it does, we can take pleasure in mocking the fools still cashing in on the myth of rising sea levels and the death of life as we know it. Idiots.

"**Staff in the Belfast Health Trust are being asked whether or not they want to receive the Covid vaccine.**
The BBC has seen an email and questionnaire sent to all employees telling them workers will receive the Pfizer vaccine.
Trade unions say they are encouraging front-line workers to get the vaccine but everyone should be given a choice.
Another 10 Covid-related deaths and 290 new cases were reported by Stormont's Department of Health on Monday.
It brings the department's death toll - which consists of deaths from any cause within 28 days of a positive test - to 996.
The email sent to all staff at the Belfast Trust goes on to say that further guidance will be issued in the coming days on how to book a time and venue to get the first jab.
""It is crucial we plan our clinics appropriately to ensure everyone is able to receive both vaccinations,"" the trust says.
Vaccinating up to 100,000 health care staff is going to be one of the biggest civilian healthcare operations that Northern Ireland has ever seen.
If the Pfizer vaccine gets the official go-ahead this week, staff could receive the first of their jabs within a fortnight.
That vaccine requires two separate injections a number of weeks apart.
Kevin McAdam, Unite's regional officer, said: ""The whole concept of what we are trying to do is frankly scary, but doable. We need all shoulders to the wheel.
""I don't think it's helpful to make it mandatory for health service staff. That would not be helpful. We have always resisted that for flu vaccine.""
The roll out of Northern Ireland's Covid-19 vaccination programme could begin by mid-December, BBC News NI understands.
It is widely anticipated that the regulatory body will approve two vaccines this week, which will allow the plans to become official.
A digital booking system for healthcare workers is also being set up.
Timings will be critical as people receiving their vaccine will have to socially distance and be monitored for 15 minutes afterwards.
This is to ensure there are no physical reactions.
Rolling out any Covid-19 vaccine is a ""large logistical operational challenge,"" the Health Minister Robin Swann told MLAs on Monday.
""One of the biggest challenges being the AstraZeneca vaccine comes in batches of 975 vials per pack. And it will be highly challenging if not impossible to break that down into smaller packs,"" said Mr Swann.
""So, it is a vaccine that is designed for mass vaccination and mass vaccination centres which are going to put that initial challenge on the delivery of our vaccine programme in Northern Ireland.""
Undoubtedly there remains a raft of unknowns about the rollout of the vaccines but BBC News NI understands health officials are using mid-December as a working date in their attempts to pull plans together.
Once the regulatory medicines body, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), gives the vaccines the go-ahead, a move widely anticipated to happen this week, plans around accepting, storing and delivering them will be firmed up.
It is thought Oxford's AstraZenica vaccine - the more easily stored of the two - will be used by GPs to vaccinate those aged 80 and over, while Pfizer's vaccine will be rolled out among healthcare staff and residents of care homes.
It requires much tighter controls around storage and, while healthcare staff will be required to attend the likes of leisure centres to be vaccinated, it is thought that visiting pods in care homes could be used to vaccinate residents.
By starting vaccinations mid-December, the required three-week gap means the second boost will be delivered around the first week of 2021.
In order to roll out the programme, a lot more vaccinators are required.
They will be able to administer the vaccine and may come out of medical retirement to boost numbers.
A background in healthcare, however, is not thought to be required.
It has also emerged that several doctors in Northern Ireland have taken part in the Oxford vaccine trial."

What is faith?



A dictionary definition is, “ _The assent of the mind to the truth of a proposition or statement for_ ** _which there is not complete evidence_** _; belief in general. Specifically, firm belief based upon_ ** _confidence in the authority and veracity of another,_** _rather than upon one’s own knowledge, reason, or judgement._ “



The biblical definition of faith is given in Hebrews 11:1, “ _Faith means being sure of the things we hope for and_ ** _knowing that something is real even if we do not see it_** _._ ” (NCV) 



Dr Roy Spencer looks at faith in the context of the current ‘climate emergency’ in a post on his blog. He sets out three basic fundamentals:



So the tool the climate scientists use are computer models.



When computer climate models are first constructed, these global-average energy flows in and out of the climate system do not balance. So, modellers adjust any number of uncertain processes in the models (for example, cloud parameterizations) until they do balance. They run the model for, say, 100 years and make sure there is little or no long-term temperature trend to verify balance exists.



Then, they add the infrared radiative effect of increasing CO2, which does cause an energy imbalance. Warming occurs. They then say something like, “See? The model proves that CO2 is responsible for warming we’ve seen since the 1950s.”  




 **But they have only demonstrated what they assumed from the outset.** It is circular reasoning. A tautology. Evidence that nature also causes global energy imbalances is abundant: e.g., the strong warming before the 1940s; the Little Ice Age; the Medieval Warm Period. This is why many climate scientists try to purge these events from the historical record, to make it look like only humans can cause climate change. 



His conclusion is that we cannot say whether or not CO2 causes global warming or how much it may or may not cause because we simply have we have no idea what natural energy imbalances exist in the climate system. The modellers simply assume they do not exist. 



There is no possible way to distinguish ‘natural’ warming from ‘human induced’ warming. Warming is warming – it does not come in different colours or flavours.



The whole global warming / climate change / climate emergency issue is an article of faith.

EPA Compromises the Integrity of Science 
Dear Colleague:
“Which do you find more shocking: that the Environmental Protection Agency conducts experiments on humans that its own risk assessment would deem potentially lethal, or that it hides the results of those experiments from Congress and the public because they debunk those very same assessments?” 
This critical question forms the basis for the attached Washington Times article: “Did Obama’s EPA relaunch Tuskegee experiments?” By Steve Milloy.
Moreover, this is one more piece of evidence that EPA uses science to play games, manipulate data, and generate faulty outcomes to justify their regulations. Here is a compelling example that highlights faulty science: “EPA researchers who conducted the experiments published the case study of the 58-year woman in the government journal Environmental Health Perspectives in which they casually disregard the woman’s preexisting conditions and blame her atrial fibrillation on PM2.2. They also failed to disclose the existence- let alone the results – of the other 40 experiments.”
If you are interested in understanding how the EPA continues to compromise the integrity of science, please read the full article here: http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/apr/24/did-obamas-epa-relaunch-tuskegee-experiments/.
In Freedom,

"A new Australian green steel industry could create tens of thousands of jobs in regional areas reliant on coalmining, particularly in central Queensland and the Hunter Valley, giving them a future as demand for carbon-intensive goods falls. That is the conclusion of a report by the Grattan Institute, a thinktank linked to the University of Melbourne, which examined claims Australia has the potential to become a green energy “superpower”.  Assessing the viability of clean manufacturing possibilities, the institute found green steel made with renewable hydrogen could become a multibillion-dollar export industry employing 25,000 people in regions likely to be hardest hit by global steps to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Tony Wood, the institute’s energy program director, said Australia had not typically been good at globally competitive manufacturing, succeeding instead at “digging stuff out of the ground”. But he said the rapid fall in the cost of solar and wind energy and the country’s world-leading clean energy resources was a “fundamentally significant change”. “We have the potential for competitive renewable energy to drive manufacturing in a way in which we wouldn’t have imagined not long ago,” Wood said. “If we get this right, we will resolve the great climate conundrum that has stretched our political fabric for more than a decade.” Options for diversifying Australia’s fossil fuel-intensive energy industries as the globe aims to cut emissions include exporting renewable energy, either as electricity by sub-sea cable or as hydrogen, and developing low-emissions commodities, such as metals, chemicals or biofuels. Rather than exporting renewable hydrogen, the analysis found the most economically viable path appeared to be to use it within Australia to produce steel with near-zero emissions. “Green steel” is created using hydrogen to trigger a chemical reaction with the oxygen in iron ore to create iron metal and water. The metal is then refined and cast into steel. Hydrogen-based direct reduction of iron ore is not yet commercial, but the report says it is based on a proven technology involving gas. Pilot plants are being built or planned in Germany and Sweden, where steelmaker SSAB recently has set a target of green steel production by 2026, a decade earlier than was previously considered possible. German manufacturer Thyssenkrupp made headlines in November when it demonstrated that a steel blast furnace could in part run on hydrogen. The institute’s report focuses on the future of “carbon workers” – people and communities in fossil fuel-reliant industries whose jobs will be threatened by global steps to tackle the climate crisis to meet the goals of the Paris agreement. There are nearly 100,000 carbon workers in Australia, 55,000 of them in “carbon-intensive regions” likely to face more acute social and economic challenges than people in major cities. More than 23,000 live in central Queensland, where they make up 15% of the workforce, mostly mining coal. Another 16,300 are in the Hunter Valley. The report says carbon-intensive electorates recorded bigger swings than average to the Coalition at the 2019 federal election, when it was emphasising it would do less to combat the climate crisis than Labor. While it may have helped it last year, it says the Morrison government’s approach of supporting only modest climate targets cannot protect jobs in the face of global climate action, and does not help the country seize new low-carbon opportunities. Wood and co-authors Guy Dundas and James Ha conclude this stance – stressing the short-term costs for those affected by climate policy while ignoring the cost of inaction – ultimately works against Australia’s national interest. It says both Coalition and Labor leaders have claimed Australia should and will continue to export fossil fuel products for decades while committed to the Paris agreement. In reality, the future for coal, gas, oil and products created with them was much less certain. “Australian governments need to be honest with carbon workers: their attempts to protect carbon jobs from global forces will ultimately fail,” the report says. “You don’t have to be a card-carrying climate activist to think this is a good idea. You just have to be someone making an assessment about risk,” Wood added. “Our practical plan could be a win-win-win. It would create a new export industry, support carbon workers and cut emissions.” The report is published as global institutions, industry groups, investors and civil society leaders call on governments to use stimulus programs needed to drive the economic recovery from Covid-19 to also address the climate crisis. Wood said a green steel industry would take time to develop, but unlike other options being considered was an area in which Australia had a competitive advantage. Currently, Australia mostly ships the raw iron ore and metallurgical coal used in steel production to Asian countries, where it is processed. But the institute found Australia was likely to have a cost advantage in manufacturing iron metal, and possibly refined steel, in a low-emissions world due to its access to cheap clean energy and the high cost of shipping hydrogen. Creating a green steel manufacturing industry at a global scale would demand big industrial workforces, such as those found in coalmining regions in central Queensland and New South Wales. The report says lower labour-costs meant it would be cheaper to make green steel in those places than in the Pilbara in Western Australia, even once shipping iron ore from the west to east coast was factored in. It says investment would need to come from the private sector, but calls on the federal government to fund a low-emissions steel “flagship” program to build local skills and capability over the next decade, possibly by using low-cost gas from WA to make steel with lower emissions as green steel developed, or by helping existing steel plants at Port Kembla and Whyalla modernise and survive. Other government support could include federal funding for studies into the geological potential for hydrogen storage and, at a state and local level, programs to help workers retrain. There has been optimism about the possibility of exporting hydrogen, but the report says its prospects are uncertain, in part because it is hard to transport. It must either be liquefied by cooling it to -253C or converted into a chemical such as ammonia. For exports to be viable, Australian hydrogen would need to be far cheaper than from other countries. The report says while an industry may develop, “the uncertainties mean that it is unlikely to be Australia’s most significant clean energy opportunity”. In terms of jobs, there were likely to be far more if Australia used its cheap clean energy to produce commodities for export than if it just sent renewable energy offshore. Manufacturing is far more labour-intensive than electricity generation, and its jobs generally better paid. The report says green steel is likely to cost more than fossil fuel steel for the foreseeable future, but if the cost of renewable hydrogen was to reach US$2 a kilogram it would add only 1% to the cost of a typical car or house, and 0.5% to a railway or road. It said there were also attractive, but probably smaller, opportunities in creating a sustainable biofuels industry and, to a lesser extent, development in renewable ammonia and exporting electricity via sub-sea cables, as proposed by the $20bn Sun Cable project backed by billionaires Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest and Mike Cannon-Brookes, which hopes to sell solar energy from the Northern Territory to Singapore. It said the federal government should consider requiring a share of domestic aviation fuel come from non-food biofuel sources, saying it could create hundreds of jobs in Collie, Portland and the Latrobe Valley. “These opportunities are not certain and will generally rely on either international policies to reduce emissions, or customers being willing to pay a ‘green premium,” the report says. “But these opportunities are credible, particularly if the world moves away from fossil fuels.” Partnering with competitors Tennant Reed, from the Australian Industry Group, said the report did a great job fleshing out the abstract idea of the advantages Australia may have in a clean energy world, and laying the foundations for future policy and development work. He said people had different views of where future opportunities would lie, with some excited by exporting bulk hydrogen, others aluminium, others steel, but the report illustrated how big the latter opportunity could be. He said the Grattan Institute envisaged a huge increase in Australia’s share of global steel production, a shift that would not be easy in a world in which countries may look to increase domestic manufacturing. It would require working closely with other nations. “It will be a lot harder if we are just trying to cut these countries and their companies out of the global steel industry rather than partnering with them,” Reed said. The energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, did not mention steel specifically when asked for his response to the report, but said clean commodities made with hydrogen would help the country become a world leader in that industry. He said the government had committed $370m to developing it through the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Australian Renewable Energy. Labor’s climate change and energy spokesman, Mark Butler, said the report showed the jobs and industry benefits of embracing a clean energy future, and accused the prime minister, Scott Morrison, of actively opposing going in that direction. “A Covid-19 recovery plan which brings forward investment in new renewable projects like green hydrogen will create tens of thousands of new jobs, stimulate regional economies and deliver cheaper power prices,” he said."

It’s time to give all mankind a real chance to enjoy genuine development
Guest post by Dr. Kelvin Kemm
The Rio+20 World Environmental Conference has come and gone. The “Plus 20” comes from the fact that it took place twenty years after the first such conference, held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1992. Between these dates, I was a delegate at the 2002 world environment conference in Johannesburg, South Africa. Ever since 1992 I have watched the eco-evolution taking place.
There is a good side and a bad side. The good side is that general world environmental awareness has been enhanced. That is definitely good. But there is still so much to be done, especially in poor countries where many people are always on the edge of survival, people must eke out a living off the land, and many will do whatever it takes to earn a little cash, to just survive another day.

Here in South Africa we see the daily international poaching attacks on our elephants and rhinos. It’s disgraceful. For us in the south, on midwinter’s day in June (our winters are the opposite of those in the Northern Hemisphere), the total rhinos shot this year stands at 251, just to get their horns, which are still viewed as aphrodisiacs and medicine in many Asian countries. Last year’s total was 448, more than one a day – so it’s getting worse. Poachers are now using helicopters and machine guns, and often taking chainsaws to still living rhinos.
There is much to do to sustain and protect the world’s natural environment. That should be done – but done well, and honestly. The bad side of Rio+20 is the degree of scientific dishonesty and economic manipulation that has crept into the international debate. That is shocking.
In recent years we have heard a great deal about “climate change.” I am on record as saying I do not believe human activities that produce carbon dioxide (CO2) are making any significant contribution to climate change – certainly not anything dangerous or catastrophic.
Observed climate change appears to be in line with past historic meteorological cycles – and likely linked to natural cosmic rays interacting with the magnetic fields of the earth and the sun’s interactive magnetic screening system.
But there are organisations in the world that want mankind to be at fault, so that there is someone to blame and attack, someone to tax and control, and someone to encourage to be “traditional” and “sustainable” – and consequently in a state of perpetual primitive poverty and disease … on the edge of survival.
It was noticeable that Rio+20 moved away from the theme of “climate change.” It would appear that the disastrous climate change, which green extremists predicted with such great relish, has not been occurring. So climate change is dying as a “marketable concept.” They can’t use it to scare enough people anymore.
Thus the Rio+20 summit focused on the concepts of “biodiversity” and “sustainable development,” as the main themes, and therefore the main “worries.” If people can be made to worry, they can be made to fear, and then they can be controlled.
Rio+20 was all about international control. Certain green organisations clearly want to exert direct control over world governments, and want to impose their brand of world government on our planet, communities, businesses and families. The concepts of biodiversity and sustainable development give them the leverage.
The greens claim that our plant and animal species, our natural resources, our air and water, and our planet are in such desperate trouble that the extreme greens must take control. They will then defend “biodiversity,” and to do this they will decide what “sustainable development” actually means and how it must be implemented.
They will decide how, when and where any community will be permitted to “develop.” It is interesting to take another look at the Johannesburg Declaration on Sustainable Development, which came out of the 2002 world environment conference in Johannesburg. It included language asking that the world pay attention to “the worldwide conditions that pose severe threats to the sustainable development of our people, which include: chronic hunger; malnutrition … and endemic, communicable and chronic diseases, in particular HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.”
What happened to all these human issues at Rio+20? They were gone. For some reason, the Rio version of “biodiversity” and “sustainability” did not include humans.
In Rio the head of the WWF stated that the WWF wanted “transparent annual reporting and review on subsidy reforms, leading to the elimination by 2020 of all environmentally harmful subsidies, in particular fossil fuel subsidies.” Who do these people think they are? And why have they said nothing at all about the nearly $1 trillion that Bloomberg New Energy Finance reports has been spent worldwide just since 2004 on wind, solar, biofuel and other “renewable” energy schemes that any objective observer would understand are simply not “sustainable” on economic, environmental or any other grounds.
Moreover, this WWF statement is intended to give authenticity to some “world government,” to tell sovereign nations how to care for their own citizens.
In many African countries building a coal-fired power station will reduce CO2 emissions. How? Because there are millions of families who have no electricity, and so cook on wood or dung fires. These fires burn inefficiently and produce not just carbon dioxide, but many airborne pollutants that harm or even kill people. If thousands of these fires are replaced by a modern coal-fired power plant, the net effect would be to lead to improved air quality and less CO2 per unit of energy.
Such an action would be a significant advance, even if the CO2 actually were a problem, though much scientific evidence shows that it is not. This evidence of course is shouted down by those with vested interests in perpetuating “dangerous manmade climate change” as a thesis, and as a professional sinecure. Such an approach is not honest, and it is not science.
Meanwhile, however, European countries have introduced a carbon emissions tax on passenger aircraft flying over their airspace. The tax, per passenger, is calculated on total miles flown, so passengers flying to Europe from faraway places like South Africa and Australia pay much higher emissions taxes to the Europeans to clean up Euro air than do the EU’s own citizens, who collectively fly far more cumulative miles around Europe. Despite appeals from South Africa to spare us the tax, we were turned down. We are getting sick and tired of this high handed First World attitude.
Now from Rio+20 we are told that a goal for development is to move away from “outdated” concepts like measuring national growth using Gross Domestic Product (GDP) – and to rather use more “modern” and “equitable” measures like the “Happy Planet Index” (HPI), under which some world authority or bureaucrat is going to place an “environmental value” on keeping our environment “pristine” and “traditional.” Those values will be built into the HPI. Meantime, many people in Africa will continue to cut down habitats to burn wood and dung, and we will fight elephant and rhino poachers all by ourselves.
In Rio, eight of the world’s largest development banks announced the largest monetary commitment to come out of Rio+20, a US$175 billion initiative to shift investment away from roads to public transport. They want to use the money to promote the use of buses, trains and bicycles, instead of cars and aeroplanes.
In many parts of Africa they don’t even have a road yet. No electricity either, nor school nor clinic.
It is time for UN, EU, US and other green do-gooders to get off their anti-development high horse. It’s time to give all of mankind a real chance to enjoy genuine development. It’s time to stop using a “preserving biodiversity” ruse to keep the world’s most impoverished people forever in poverty.

You really do have to wonder with this government if the left hand knows what the right hand is doing. They axed our lucrative oil and gas industries, citing the fact that they want to concentrate entirely on renewable energy sources. New Zealand is already a great place for this, with the majority of our electric power coming from hydro sources. The government is also pushing hard for people to take up driving electric vehicles, introducing plans to make the government fleet consist entirely of EVs, and proposing significant discounts for the purchase of EVs, compared to gas-guzzling petrol and diesel vehicles. 



Then yesterday, David Parker axed a planned hydro scheme in Waitaha, in Westland.



The Government has declined a hydro-scheme that would have tamed a ferocious stretch of water known as the “Mt Cook of rivers”.



The $100 million scheme would have generated enough electricity to power about 12,000 households.



Westpower, a 100 per Cent community-owned company, had applied for a Department of Conservation (DOC) concession for the scheme on the Waitaha River in Westland, one of the country’s most spectacular and untamed landscapes. 



**The final decision rested with Minister for the Environment David Parker, who declined the application despite DOC granting approval in principle.**



Westpower chairman Mike Newcombe said the decision has “shattered West Coasters’ ambitions for the sake of environment interests”. 



The Mokihinui Dam was the same story. It would have been situated in a pristine river where nobody ever goes, except a few kayakers. The kayakers won the day, and in 2012, the plan was cancelled. Now, the same thing has happened again.



“We are utterly stunned by this decision. West Coast interests and long-term benefits have been swept aside,” Newcombe said.



He questioned the Government’s commitment to regional economic growth and addressing the significant threats from climate change through renewable energy projects.



Yes. It would have been a good project to commit some of Shane’s $3 billion that he can’t seem to spend, along with providing a new source of renewable energy in a place that needs the investment. But no.



“It certainly seems so when a great opportunity to create a renewable energy project and enduring benefit for the community and broader region – developed through more than a decade of planning and consultation – has been knocked back in capitulation to minority interests intent on locking up the West Coast forever to the detriment of the local community.” 



He said the proposal was for a “run of the river” hydro scheme that would have offered West Coasters increased energy supply, reliability, self-sufficiency and ultimately resilience in the event of a natural disaster.



It would have provided jobs and increased business confidence as a result of a more reliable and cost-effective energy supply, he said.



“We put up a proposal that ticks all the boxes: renewable, sustainable energy, long-term regional economic development boost, careful environmental stewardship – and yet it was declined. It is an alarming decision not just for the Coast but for regional New Zealand.” 



And David Parker is heralded as a champion of New Zealand business? Don’t make me laugh.



Environment Minister David Parker said the application was declined because establishing the power scheme in this location would have significant impacts on the natural character of the area, the intrinsic value of the area and people’s enjoyment of it. 



Yep. Same as Mokihinui. About 3 people go there every year, and only in the summer.



 **He said by law he was not allowed to take economic impact on the Coast into consideration.**



 **Which just shows how badly this law needs to be repealed.** He is ONLY allowed to take into consideration the environmental impact, so the project never would have gone ahead, come hell or high water (pun intended). Exactly why he allowed everyone to waste so much time and money when the outcome was a foregone conclusion is a total mystery.



West Coast Labour MP Damien O’Connor said he was “disappointed from a local perspective” and Westpower were proven to be responsible environment managers. 



It is your government, Damien. Putting the interests of a few kayakers ahead of jobs and prosperity for your own voters is a risky strategy.



Westland mayor Bruce Smith said he was “gutted” with the decision.



“I am completely in disbelief. I read the reports the Minister relied on and can’t see anything useful in making the decision. I look at it from Westpower’s point of view which is owned by the West Coast community. They spent $2m and 10 years on this thing that would have made us self-sufficient in electricity. If we want economic growth we need to be self-sufficient,” he said.



“It’s not good for the West Coast economy. It’s just another move by this Government to lock up the West Coast as a playground for others.”



 **Fewer than a dozen people have successfully paddled the Morgan Gorge, the most challenging part of the river, and no-one has traversed its entire length.**



  
So as the demand for power increases exponentially, as a result of a growing population and increased power usage for things like electric cars, what will we do?



We will end up using coal-fired power stations. That’s what we will do.



Smart move for the environment and the country’s emissions, David Parker. Another senior minister joins the ranks of the idiotic and incompetent in this government. The list is growing very long indeed.

Temperature predictions from some climate models assuming the SRES A2 emissions scenario. (Photo credit: Wikipedia)
Guest post by Christopher Monckton of Brenchley
Abstract
Global CO2 emissions per unit increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration provide an independent constraint on climate sensitivity over the timescale of the available data (1960-2008), suggesting that, in the short term and perhaps also in the long, climate sensitivity may lie below the values found in the general-circulation models relied upon by the IPCC.
Introduction
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2001, p. 358, Table 6.2), citing Myhre et al. (1998), takes the CO2 forcing ΔF as 5.35 times the logarithm of a proportionate change Cb/Ca in CO2 concentration, where Cais the unperturbed value. Warming ΔT is simply ΔF multiplied by some climate sensitivity parameter λ.
Projected 21st-century anthropogenic warming, as the mean of values on all six IPCC emissions scenarios, is 2.8 K (IPCC, 2007, table SPM.3: Annex, Table 0). Of this, 0.6 K is stated to be in the pipeline. Of the remaining 2.2 K, some 0.65 K is attributable to non-CO2 forcings, since the CO2 fraction of anthropogenic warming is 71% (the Annex explains the derivation). Thus the IPCC’s current implicit central estimate of the warming by 2100 that will be attributable solely to the CO2 we emit this century is only 1.56 K.
Projected CO2 concentration C2100 in 2100, the mean of the values on all six IPCC emissions scenarios, is 713 ppmv (Annex, Table 3), 345 ppmv above the 368 ppmv measured in 2000 (Conway & Tans, 2011). Therefore, the IPCC’s implicit climate-sensitivity parameter for the 21st century is 1.56 / [5.35 ln(713/368)], or 0.44 K W–1 m2. This value, adopted in (1), is half of the IPCC’s implicit equilibrium value 0.88 K W–1 m2 (derived in the Annex).

Global warming from 1960-2008
The IPCC’s implicit central estimate of CO2-driven warming from 1960-2008 is at (1):

The CO2 forcing coefficient 5.35 was given in Myhre et al. (1998). Initial and final CO2 concentrations were 316.9 and 385.6 ppmv respectively (Tans, 2012). Since the 0.46 K warming driven by the CO2 fraction is 71% of anthropogenic warming, use of the IPCC’s methods implies that, as a central estimate, all of the 0.66 K observed warming from 1960-2008 (taken as the linear trend on the data over the period in HadCRUt3, 2011) was anthropogenic. However, attribution between Man and nature remains problematic: an independent approach to constraining climate sensitivity produces a very different result.
An independent constraint on climate sensitivity
Since few non-linearities will obtrude at sub-centennial time-scales, to warm the Earth’s surface by 1 K the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere must increase by 345/1.56 = 223 ppmv K–1. From 1960-2008, the trend in the ratios of annual global CO2 emissions to annual increases in atmospheric CO2 concentrations does not differ significantly from zero (Fig. 1). The mean emissions/concentration-growth ratio over the period was 15.5 Gt CO2 ppmv–1, which, multiplied by 223 ppmv K–1, gives 3450 GTe CO2 K–1, the quantum of CO2 emissions necessary to raise global temperature by 1 K.

Figure 1. Near-zero trend in annual emissions/concentration-growth ratios, 1960-2008. Data and methods are described in the Annex. Spikes caused by volcanic eruptions are visible. Excluding effects of major eruptions makes little difference to the outcome.
Total global CO2 emissions from 1960-2008 were 975 Gte CO2 (Boden et al., 2011). Accordingly, CO2-driven warming expected over the period, by the present method, was 975 divided by 3450, or 0.28 K. Allowing for the non-CO2 fraction, some 0.40 K warming over the period, equivalent to 61% of observed warming, was anthropogenic, not inconsistent with the estimate in IPCC, 2007 that at least 50% of observed warming from 1950-2005 was anthropogenic. However, inconsistently with (1), this method yields a CO2-driven warming that is only 61% of the central estimate derived from the IPCC’s general-circulation models.
Implications
On the assumption that the coefficient in the CO2 forcing function, cut from 6.3 to 5.35 in Myhre et al. (1998), is now correct, one implication of the present result is that the climate-sensitivity parameter λ appropriate to a 50-year period is not 0.44 K W–1 m2, as the models suggest, but as little as 0.27 K W–1 m2. Since the value of the instantaneous or Planck sensitivity parameter λ0 is 0.31 KW–1 m2 (IPCC, 2007, p. 631 fn.), temperature feedbacks operating during the period of study may have been somewhat net-negative, rather than appreciably net-positive as implied by (1).
If feedbacks operating over the short to medium term are indeed net-negative, there is no warming in the pipeline from past emissions; in the rest of this century CO2-driven warming may be little more than 1 K; anthropogenic warming from all sources may be less than 1.5 K; and supra-centennial-scale warming may also be significantly less than currently projected. If so, all attempts at mitigation will prove cost-ineffective, and the cost of adaptation to future warming will be well below current estimates.

Annex: supplementary material
Values of the climate sensitivity parameter λ
If net temperature feedbacks exceed zero, the climate sensitivity parameter λ is not constant: as longer- and longer-acting feedbacks begin to act, it will tend to increase between the time of a forcing to the time when equilibrium is restored to the climate 1000-3000 years after the forcing that perturbed it (Solomon et al., 2009). Illustrative values of λ are given below.
The sensitivity parameter derived from the present result and applicable to the 49 years 1960-2008 is 0.27 K W–1 m2.
Where temperature feedbacks sum to zero, the instantaneous value λ0 is 0.31 K W–1 m2 (derived from IPCC (2007, p. 631 fn.: see also Soden & Held, 2006).
Garnaut (2008) talks of keeping greenhouse-gas rises to 450 ppmv CO2-equivalent above the 280 ppmv prevalent in 1750, so as to hold 21st-century global warming since then to 2 K, implying λ262 = 2 / [5.35 ln{(280 + 450) / 280}] = 0.39 K W–1 m2. 
As explained in the text, the IPCC’s implicit climate-sensitivity parameter for the 21st century is λ100 = 1.56 / [5.35 ln(713/368)] = 0.44 K W–1 m2.
On each emissions scenario, the IPCC’s estimate of the bicentennial-scale transient-sensitivity parameter λ200 is 0.49 K W–1 m2 (derived in Table 0), a value supported by IPCC (2001, p. 354, citing Ramanathan, 1985).
The implicit value of the equilibrium-sensitivity parameter λequ is the warming currently predicted in response to a CO2 doubling, i.e. 3.26 K (IPCC, 2007, p. 798, Box 10.2), divided by the forcing of 5.35 ln 2 = 3.71 W m–2 at that doubling. Thus, λequ = 0.88 K W–1 m2.

"Fossil fuel industry groups and companies have applauded new climate change measures proposed by the Morrison government, including support for carbon capture and storage developments. The government has agreed to 21 of 26 recommendations made by an expert panel review headed by the former gas industry executive and business council president Grant King, who was asked to come up with new ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at low cost.  Recommendations included paying big industrial companies to keep their emissions below an agreed limit, and allowing the government’s main climate policy, the $2.5bn emissions reduction fund, to support carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects. Angus Taylor, the energy and emissions reduction minister, said the government agreed in-principle that two publicly owned clean energy agencies, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, would be given a “technology neutral remit” – a proposal that has been interpreted as allowing more funding for projects that do not involve renewable energy. The government’s response was welcomed by the gas and coal sectors, received qualified support from industry groups and was criticised by environmentalists, who said it directed emissions reduction funding to polluting companies and did not address Australia’s lack of an overarching climate policy. CCS, which involves capturing industrial carbon dioxide as it is released and injecting it underground, has been a contentious area of public policy in Australia, having been promised billions of dollars in public funding for little result. The first significant project in Australia, Chevron’s Gorgon liquefied natural gas development in the Pilbara, started operating last year after years of delay. Supporters say CCS can play a role in cutting emissions at industrial sites, if not power plants, and both the International Energy Agency and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have acknowledged it has a role to play. Opponents say it has failed to deliver on scale over two decades and takes funding away from cheaper clean technology. The plan to include CCS in the emissions reduction fund follows oil and gas giant Santos saying access to carbon credits or a similar revenue stream would be critical if it was to invest in a joint CCS project with BHP in South Australia. The Moomba CCS project, in SA’s remote north-east, is promised to capture 1.7m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year released during gas processing. Santos’s chief executive, Kevin Gallagher, applauded the government for supporting “sensible, job creating recommendations that will cut through red and green tape” to accelerate investment in “real” emissions reduction opportunities. “Just as private investment in renewable energy deployment was accelerated through public policy and funding over the last two decades, we now need to focus on accelerating CCS in similar ways,” Gallagher said. Andrew McConville, the head of the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, representing oil and gas companies, said the review had proposed sensible steps on climate change. “Importantly, the report underlines the key role the oil and gas industry can play in cutting emissions,” he said. Tania Constable, the head of the Minerals Council of Australia, said it provided “a clear path” for cutting emissions while keeping the country’s “core industries” including mining and minerals processing competitive. Coal21, an organisation created to research low-emissions technology that used funding for pro-coal advertising, said the support for CCS was a “win for the environment and industry”. The King review’s recommendations include changing the “safeguard mechanism” – a policy that was promised to stop industrial emissions rising but that in practice has led to a significant increase – so that companies that emitted below a baseline would receive carbon credits they could sell. Speaking on ABC radio on Tuesday, Taylor said the proposal was not a form of voluntary carbon trading, then said that trading already happened and was “nothing new”. Richie Merzian, from thinktank the Australia Institute, said the changes backed by the government would increase fossil fuel industries’ access to a limited pool of funding for climate action, and criticised the lack of process behind the review. He said King’s four-person expert panel was commissioned in October without public visibility, run without public consultation, and its report was held back by the government until it was ready to also release its response. “Australians have a right to be frustrated by this, not just because of the support for fossil fuels, but by the appalling process,” Merzian said. “We should wake up to the fact that this is happening at a much larger scale with the National Covid-19 Coordination Commission, which will involve the investment of hundreds of millions of taxpayers’ dollars.” Suzanne Harter, a campaigner with the Australian Conservation Foundation, said the emissions reduction fund was ineffective and the King review recommendations would make it weaker. “Australia has virtually no effective climate policy and no pathway to achieve net zero emissions by 2050,” she said. The Australian Industry Group said the review included several useful steps to help reduce emissions, but would need to be backed by significant funding and a strategy to reach net zero emissions by 2050. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found global emissions need to fall 45% below 2010 levels by 2030 and reach net zero by about 2050 to give the world a chance of limiting global heating to 1.5C. Taylor said it was not the government’s policy to reach net zero emissions by 2050. He said the Coalition was committed to cutting emissions without imposing new costs on households. He has said the recommendations aligned with a soon-to-be-released “technology investment roadmap”, and would position Australia to beat the 2030 target it set at the Paris climate agreement. Analyses have previously found the government is not on track to meet the 2030 target, a 26-28% cut below 2005 levels, without using a carbon accounting loophole. Labor’s climate change and energy spokesman, Mark Butler, said the opposition would take time to consider its response but criticised the Coalition’s policy for failing to cut emissions since 2014. Adam Bandt, the Greens leader, accused the government of engaging in “greenwashing”. “Minister Taylor’s huffing and puffing about CCS is the same failed fossil fuel industry pipe dream they have been promoting for years,” he said."
"Ten years ago, when Australia’s climate and energy botch-up was still in its infancy, politicians and their advisers used to talk up the virtues of gas as a transitional fuel, and they used to talk about carbon capture and storage (CCS) as technology that governments needed to invest in to drive the transition to low-emissions economies. The great botch-up is now well past infancy, and Australia’s record on climate and energy is a disaster so profound it’s still traumatising backstage protagonists years after the stadium rock wreckers have left the crime scene.  Yet people in power are still talking within the same parameters. Gas. CCS. As if these might be new discoveries – as if the economics of the transition have remained immutable in the decade we spent watching the political class execute inter-generational failure at our expense. Just in case you’ve missed the Morrison government warming up the talking points about Australia’s great gas-led recovery from the economic shock of Covid-19, allow me to bring this winter marketing offensive to your attention. The prime minister, several ministers, and some prominent corporate advisers, like the former Fortescue boss Nev Power, are out, banging that drum. We are told cheap gas will help restart an economy hit for six by coronavirus. Cheap gas will boost flagging growth, create jobs, and make projects considered uneconomic five minutes ago suddenly economic. It is gas nirvana, as far as the eye can see – except it is unclear to me where this cheap gas will come from. Gas prices have fallen recently, but will these falls be sustained? Are falling gas prices really the environment in which companies will pursue new investments? Won’t they worry about stranded assets? Won’t they worry about carbon risk – that being a real thing. Ask the Reserve Bank. Or the banking regulator. Or the corporate regulator. Australia’s gas industry needs to be able to extract and sell the resource at a rate of return that justifies any new investments accompanying the opening up of new supply. That’s a basic rule of business, unless there’s some undisclosed fine print. Unless, of course, the real story is taxpayers are going to be saddled with the risks of marginal investments, which makes gas nirvana sound more like a billion-dollar boondoggle dreamed up by a kitchen cabinet of vested interests. But that doesn’t sound nearly as exciting, does it? Just while we are on this, gas nirvana also has another dimension. It is being invoked, in part, to justify the reworking the miserable suite of alleged emissions reduction policies that the Coalition has kept on life support since the Abbott era. If the future is gas and CCS, then the policies will need another tweak to make them fit for purpose, because low emissions are just a matter of definition. The government says we need to look at CCS because all the sensible people are technologically neutral, not ideological. The goal should be emissions reduction, never mind the means. Fine as far as it goes, except that parable lacks some context. The real story is this: Australia has failed to take meaningful action to reduce emissions, because the Coalition has wrecked progress at every turn for more than 10 years. The truth is the Liberal and National parties have blown the critical decade. That failure is now an implicit justification for more taxpayer support for CCS, because the need may become so pressing that all options will have to be on the table to try and stave off the worst-case scenario – not that the arguments will ever be framed in such frank terms. The talking point says this: Australia can sequester emissions, we can have our fossil fuel cake and eat it too. Cue applause track. I need to make a couple of things clear because the climate and energy debate has become so toxic and so polarised that all nuance has departed the stage. I have no profound objection to gas as a transitional fuel – the operative word being transitional. If we pursue gas peaking to firm renewables, that’s one thing. If we bolt gas into the system as a permanent substitute for coal, and justify that substitution on the basis that gas is marginally less emissions-intensive, that’s quite another. I also don’t object to CCS, because as I flagged a minute ago, we might actually need it. If Donald Trump somehow manages to convince Americans to re-elect him in November despite the fact the president represents a clear and present danger to his own citizens, we are going to need a whole lot more than CCS to get the world out of the climate hole it will fall into because of the sustained absence of US leadership. What I’m saying today is two things: resources are finite, and the government has options. Let’s call them option A and option B. Option A sees the Morrison government choose not to make a mockery of the international climate commitments it signed up to, voluntarily, in 2015. It can use the economic recovery from Covid-19 as an opportunity to drive a low-emissions transition, which will drive sustainable jobs and growth. The government can choose to set Australia up for half a century, not another election cycle. Plenty of smart people think that’s a viable option. Then there’s option B. The government can use the recovery from Covid-19 as cover to lock in fossil fuels for another couple of decades. It can dress up the gas-led recovery as an act of enlightened national sovereignty, a downpayment on enhancing strategic capability, knowing that concept will resonate at a time when Australians are feeling insecure about their economic prospects. Morrison and his ministers and advisers can gamble that a majority of Australians will care more about having a job today than saving the planet tomorrow – and the worst of it is, that’s not much of a gamble. This sensibility broadly reflects community sentiment. This is how a majority of Australians have voted at every federal election since 2013 – and that was before we all endured the greatest economic shock since the great depression – before a global pandemic rendered community-minded activism a second-order issue, a luxury that might be resumed in due course. To be clear: right now, on current indications, the Coalition is limbering up for option B, and trying to make a virtue of it."

Note: the temperature data was evaluated by meteorologist Jung, and not the Austrian weather service, as was mistakenly reported. The result, however, remains unchanged. 
==============================
Perhaps you’ve been wondering why the alarmists have been so shrill lately? It’s not because the climate is overheating, to the contrary it’s beginning to cool – and so their sham is about to be blown out into the open for everyone to see.

Austrian meteorological data show that European Alps have been cooling, at times massively, over the last 20 years. Public domain photo.
Evaluated data from the Austrian ZAMG meteorological institute now unmistakably show that the Alps have been cooling over the last 20 years and longer, “at some places massively” thus crassly contradicting all the loud claims, projections, and model sceanrios made earlier by global warming scientists.
German meteorologist Dominik Jung reports on the data he himself evaluated from the European Alps and concludes at the German-language Huffington Post here:
We are obviously very far away from milder winters. The trend actually is moving in the opposite direction! A few years ago climatologists advised winter sports locations in the Alps to reduce their investments in winter sports facilities – because of the ever increasing mean temperatures, they soon would not be worth it. So we ask ourselves, which increasing temperatures are the ladies and gentlemen even talking about?”
Some places have seen “massive cooling”

According to an expert review conducted by Dominik Jung of data from the Zentralanstalt für Meteorologie und Geodynamik (ZAMG), the Austrian state weather service, using weather data going back 20 years, or more: “Winters there indeed are shown to have gotten colder over the last 20 years, and in some places quite massively. The last two winters at Kitzbühel were in fact the coldest of the last 20 years.”
Jung then writes that also four other high elevation stations in the Alps were assessed: Zugspitze in Germany, Schmittenhöhe in Austria, Sonnblick in Austria and Säntis in Switzerland. Result:
They all yielded the same amazing result: Winters in the Alps over the last decades have become significantly colder, the data show.”
Jung writes that data from extra long datasets from 20 to 30 years were examined, “just like climatologists always insist.”
Jung then informs readers that he asked the Austrian meteorological experts on site what they thought of the results. According to Jung, the reaction was either dead silence induced by shock, or attempts to downplay the results. Had the data shown warming instead, then of course we would be hearing just the opposite of silence and downplaying…we’d be hearing the hysterical screams of bloody climate murder!
Humiliated science
Jung speculates that the reason meteorologists and climatologists don’t want to hear about the results is because “it doesn’t fit with their world view.”  After all, just a few years ago they were cock-sure about their predictions of winters without snow and that skiing was only going to be possible at extremely high elevations. Science just possibly could not be humiliated to a greater extent.
Near the end of his Huffington Post essay, Jung comments that it appears that “climate warming has become a religion. Those belonging to it do not tolerate new findings“, even those that stem from solid observations and measurements.
Meteorologist Jung concludes that it’s almost scandalous that the responsible authorities are simply ignoring these findings.

"**The wearing of face masks in Jersey shops will be legally required from Tuesday at 10:00 GMT.**
Anyone older than 12 years old going into an indoor workplace as a customer must wear one, unless exempt for medical or disability reasons, the Government of Jersey said.
Failure to wear a mask could lead to a fine of up to Â£1,000.
The States Assembly voted to give ministers the power to introduce laws mandating masks on 24 November.
Mask-use will be compulsory in indoor public spaces which cannot guarantee physical distancing or other public health measures, including:
Mask exemption cards will be available for people whose health conditions mean they cannot wear them safely.
Application forms will be available online and in public locations, including parish halls, larger supermarkets and the bus station.
The law also includes a provision requiring passengers and drivers in taxis to wear masks, except where their use might impede safe driving.
This is also advised for car journeys involving people from different households, but is not required.
Masks remain strongly advised when close contact between people who do not live together is likely, particularly if it is likely to be for longer than 15 minutes, the government said.
Health minister Richard Renouf argued the law was needed to combat rising winter case numbers and the ""mixed success"" of the government's ""strong recommendation"" for indoor mask use.
He said: ""We are doing all we can to protect islanders and our health care system, while also keeping the island functioning as far as possible.""
Ministers have also been given the power to impose restrictions on gatherings of more than 10 people but ministers have not yet enacted this - current guidance suggests a limit of 10 for indoor gatherings.
An order to limit gatherings in the island in some capacity will be ""signed as soon as it is ready"", the government said."
"**Mass testing is set to be introduced in England's tier three ""high risk"" coronavirus areas, following a successful pilot in Liverpool.**
Universities have also begun mass testing students ahead of their return home for Christmas.
Mass testing means asking everyone to be tested, whether or not they have symptoms.
The idea is to find people who may be infected, but not yet displaying symptoms.
They can then be told to isolate and be prevented from spreading the virus.
Mass testing can be used in more targeted ways, including:
Currently, most people can only have a test if they already have symptoms.
But under England's new, stricter tier system, which applies after lockdown ends on 2 December, the government says mass testing will be widened out to the tier three areas, home to 23.3 million people.
It follows the success of the Liverpool pilot, with everyone living or working in the city offered a voluntary test.
More than 300,000 people have been tested since the pilot began, from a population of about half a million.
Cases there have fallen from 635 per 100,000 people in mid-October to 106 in the week to 26 November, helping Liverpool move from tier three to tier two.
In addition to testing the general population, local authorities in tier three areas could also target high-risk workplaces and hard-to-reach communities.
This could be similar to the Liverpool pilot, which has mobile testing sites in care homes and schools.
People might be invited to have a test, but they can also book their own online. Whole families can also just turn up in their car.
NHS staff will also be tested for coronavirus twice a week. Routine testing of health workers already happens in hardest hit areas.
Many universities have started mass testing students ahead of the Christmas break.
Students are being asked to take two tests, three days apart. If they test negative, they can leave university in the ""travel window"" starting on 3 December.
But testing is voluntary and not available in all universities.
The Liverpool pilot offers two types of testing, both involve swabbing the nose or throat.
The **PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test** is regarded as the ""gold standard"" by epidemiologists, but takes up to a day or longer to produce a result because the sample is sent off to a laboratory.
The **lateral flow test** involves a handheld kit that gives a result - a bit like a pregnancy test - in about 20 minutes. There's no need for a lab. Fluid from a nasal swab or saliva goes on one end, then a marking appears if you are positive.
Anyone who tests positive must immediately self-isolate for at least 10 days. Their contacts will be traced by NHS Test and Trace.
All other people in their household must also self-isolate for 14 days from the day the person first became ill, or from the day of the test, if they have no symptoms.
Self-isolating means staying at home and not leaving it even to buy food, medicines or other essentials, or for exercise.
People should order online groceries, or ask friends and family to get supplies and leave them outside the front door.
Anyone in England who fails to self-isolate after a positive test can be fined up to Â£10,000.
Anyone on low income who was instructed to self-isolate in a phone call from NHS Test and Trace should be able to claim a Â£500 payment from their local authority.
In September, Prime Minister Boris Johnson outlined his ""moonshot"" plan to control the virus with mass testing, possibly by next spring.
He said that ""in the near future"" he wanted to start using testing to let people who tested negative ""behave in a more normal way"".
Other countries have already introduced mass testing programmes."

Phil Quin’s opinion piece in _Stuff_ should have a written warning to alert the reader to the verbal vomitus hazard. Stand back reader! Avoid Phil’s regurgitated stinky stuff all over your shoes. Feeling better now, Phil?



“ ** _Why is it so hard_** for us to say out loud the blazingly obvious about the president of the United States: **_that he has utterly lost his mind_**.”



  
There’s a wee hint for the reader in your opening gambit, isn’t there? Personally attacking Trump and spewing lies isn’t hard for you at all, plus you have the added bonus of relieving that pressure build-up in your sick mind that’s driving you crazy. If you say something often enough people will believe you, even if it’s not true. This is sick, Phil, and not in a good way.



Trump hasn’t actually lost his mind but you’re seriously at risk of losing yours by making this stuff up. Crazy is what happens to people who disconnect from reality.



“Sure, there have been terrible presidents before – **_corrupt, cruel and boorish ones; mendacious, vain, ignorant ones; racists, misogynists, and warmongers; incompetents and dilettantes –_** **but only Trump embodies each and every one of those qualities with such unbridled ferocity** _ **.**_ ** _He disgraced the Oval Office by ever setting foot in there; he has been disgracing himself, and anyone that supports him, every day since.”_**



Facts, Phil, facts. Remember, back in the good old days, when journalism meant facts reported without bias? Next time, when you feel the urge, spare the reader and use a bucket for your angst. 



Breathe, Phil, in two-three, out two-three. Now… go away and read some actual facts about Donald Trump. Hopefully, it will restore whatever good sense you had before it got overwhelmed by emotive rage.



“Trump announced he was rolling back Obama-era regulations on methane leaks that will result in the equivalent in climate damage of eight million additional vehicles on the road. **_That’s the whole of New Zealand’s climate change agenda negated multiple times over in one fell swoop.”_**



You might want to sit down about now, okay? Big breath, Phil, big deep breath.



Climate change is a very elaborate hoax. I know! Who knew, right? So, here’s a simple climate change fact for you: there’s not enough CO2 (carbon dioxide) and CO (carbon monoxide) in the atmosphere to cause the warming that the UN and warmist liars would have us believe. The atmosphere is 99.96% CO2 free. Carbon monoxide even less, the atmosphere is 99.9998% carbon monoxide free. So, dude, stop worrying about those eight million extra vehicles because they’ll make bugger-all difference.



“He did so not because the industry demanded it – in fact, most oil and gas giants had come to accept the regulations – but because **_he will do anything within his powers to claw back the [reduction in C02 emissions] legacy of Obama.”_**



Here’s the thing, Phil: Obama’s legacy isn’t what you think it is. Obama was a nutbar who got it wrong on climate change and a whole lot else. American voters are not stupid. Take for instance, a look at some of his foreign policy gaffes. Remember Benghazi? The Iran nuclear deal? The US abstaining from the Security Council resolution which declared the Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem illegal and invalid? And how that stance alienated Bibi Netanyahu?



“ ** _America and the world are paying a heavy price for Trump’s multifarious psychopathologies_**. Neuropsychiatrists are bound by ethics not to bandy about terms like “ ** _rapidly advancing dementia_** ” when it comes to the nuclear button guy, but I’m not.”



Ooh Phil, despite the big words, you’re on a losing streak here. No neuropsychiatrist would risk his career over diagnosing dementia of the democratically elected president of the most powerful country in the free world, without a single personal consultation! 



Now Phil, take your own finger off that nuclear button right now – speaking metaphorically of course. Seriously though, Phil step away from your keyboard; you’ve gone way too far.



“It takes one idiot to make a fool of himself every day he defaces the Oval Office. **_It takes tens of millions to elevate him there.”_**



Yup, tens of millions of people, Phil. People, not fools. People who voted for Trump in 2016 and will do the same thing in 2020 because, strangely enough, they didn’t believe the MSM lies back then and they don’t now. In 2016, voters thought they would be better off with Trump in the White Office than they were with Obama or his sidekick ‘crooked Hillary.’ They were proved right and the MSM was proved wrong. 



I know it hurts Phil, but you have to let it go. You are coming unglued and looking foolish because facts always trump emotional garbage, pun intended.



A word from the wise, Phil; take a media break until after 2020 or maybe, forever. Your mental health could use it and it’d be a shame to see you disintegrate when Trump gets re-elected. You don’t have to keep doing this. I’m not sure your mind can take it and there’s a limit to the verbal vomitus readers will endure. So here’s the Don with a few final words for you to mull over.



“The LameStream Media has gone totally CRAZY! They write whatever they want, seldom have sources (even though they say they do), never do “fact checking” anymore, and are only looking for the “kill.” They take good news and make it bad. They are now beyond Fake, they are Corrupt.



The good news is that we are winning. Our real opponent is not the Democrats, or the dwindling number of Republicans that lost their way and got left behind, our primary opponent is the Fake News Media. In the history of our Country, they have never been so bad!”

"**Jersey has seen a ""surge"" of 84 new Covid-19 cases since Friday, according to the latest figures.**
This takes the island to 247 active infections, nearly three quarters of which are symptomatic.
Further public health measures and guidance are now due to follow the introduction of mandatory masks use in shops from Tuesday.
The updated government advice suggests islanders work from home where possible.
Those over the age of 70 will be advised to avoid socialising indoors with people they do not live with.
Public health officials explained the changes were needed as the island was experiencing ""complex, multiple clusters"" and a rise which cannot be attributed to a particular event.
More than 2,000 people, nearly 2% of Jersey's population, are isolating as a result of contact tracing, Chief Minister John Le Fondre confirmed.
The full list of measures to be introduced include:
Senator John Le Fondre said: ""This surge in cases is not down to one cluster.
""Health officials are seeing case clusters on a larger scale, and we are worried that the number of positive cases being picked up may indicate an increase in hospitalisation as we move forward.
""In the coming weeks we will see large numbers of returning students, family members and friends visiting for Christmas and enhanced social activity.
""Action is needed now to protect the vulnerable, to identify more cases earlier on and to slow the spread.""
Health Minister Richard Renouf said: ""If this doesn't bring down the numbers of positive cases we may, ultimately, have to move to another lockdown.""
""That's something none of us want to see,"" he added."
"Wolves are returning to their former ranges across Europe and North America, resurrecting a centuries’ old war with humans over land, hunting opportunities, and livestock. While protected in many areas, the wolf is fighting a losing battle, because in the war against them we’ve recruited something much more deadly than guns, traps, or poison, a more powerful and effective tool for wolf extermination than all of these things combined: the human imagination. Even though we’re all aware of what real wolves are like and can picture them very clearly, perhaps even find them majestic and beautiful, lurking within our collective psyche is the nightmarish Big Bad Wolf whom we came to know so well as children, and who stays with us into adulthood with the fictionalised killers of television and film. I am fiercely pro-wolf and strongly advocate for their return, but I can’t pretend that there isn’t a little part of my brain that sends out danger signals whenever I think about them actually being on my doorstep. Rationally, we know from scientific evidence that wolves pose very little threat to humans (in fact, because of our long-standing persecution of them they tend to avoid us – so much so that even sightings are rare, let alone attacks). Yet it is as if a primal fear of wolves is simply built into human DNA. So as much as I want this aspect of my feelings to go away, it’s just not something that I think ever will.  It’s easy for those who are anti-wolf to capitalise on this fear in order to perpetuate the war between the species. Using the image of the wolf as a bloodthirsty, uncontrollable killer, and the synonymity between wolves and the “wilderness” to great effect, wolf opponents are able to convince others that wolves and people cannot co-exist, especially where farming is concerned. For example, when wolves were spotted in one national park in the Netherlands for the first time in more than a century, the park’s director, Seger Emmanuel baron van Voorst tot Voorst, argued that: Once a wolf has tasted sheep meat it won’t be running after deer. Grazing sheep will be impossible if wolves are in the area, and fences won’t keep them out… We live in a country of 17 million people, not the Serengeti. This indignance at the expectation that humans should adapt to live alongside wolves (“we have been farming in this way for centuries, why should we change that now because of something we don’t even want here?”), epitomises an attitude that is problematic not only for wolves, but for all species of animals: that humans should have primacy over the earth. Humans act as though wolves should respect “our” spaces – that they should recognise areas where they should not go. But wolves don’t know about the imaginary borders between countries, states, inhabited and uninhabited land, “civilisation” and “wilderness”. They don’t know which areas have been designated for their use and protection and which haven’t, and they don’t know that what they’re doing when they step outside these boundaries is “wrong”. Nor do they know that hunting sheep is an offence that is often punishable by death. They are just trying to eat, which is much more difficult than is often thought: fewer than 20% of wolf hunts are successful. Can we really blame them for trying to snag an easy meal?  No wonder they’d rather hunt sheep. (Source: BBC Earth) Realistically, wolves do need management if they are to co-exist with humans.  Unfortunately, we live in a human-dominated world, so we call the shots – literally, if we decide to shoot wolves – but management does not have to be lethal. Fences, auditory and visual defences, guard dogs and even guard llamas can be used in order to deter wolves from attacking livestock. Wolves might even be able to help us in fixing some of the damage that we have inflicted on the earth, by restoring the ecological balance in areas where deer, unchecked in number by a lack of natural predators, have decimated the native plant life. While “rewilding” is sometimes seen as radical (relinquishing our control over nature is simply unthinkable for some) it’s in fact the opposite – it’s putting nature back to the way it was before humans altered its course. Before that happens though, we need to put the Big Bad Wolf to bed. Wolves are not bad – they’re just wolves, trying to survive in a world where they are increasingly unwelcome. In fact, it’s worth considering what a human would look like to a wolf. To them, we’re the killing machines (armed with further killing machines). We’re stealing from their larder when we hunt, displacing them from their homelands, tearing apart their families, and killing their new-born children in their dens. They’re as frightened of us as we are of them, if not more so, and for good reason. While the human-wolf war rages on, perhaps we should consider the possibility that the Big Bad Wolf does not exist, but the Big Bad Human is alive and well."
"When 110 people gathered at a hotel in Birmingham in January for the UK’s first citizens’ assembly on the climate crisis, the world was a very different place. The assembly culminates this weekend after its final meeting in March was postponed and moved online due to the coronavirus outbreak, bringing a host of logistical challenges.  “We decided to split the same content over three weekends – I don’t know how you’re finding lockdown, but I’m certainly finding there’s a limit to how much time I want to spend on an online video call in one day,” said Sarah Allan, the head of engagement at Involve, the public participation charity that is running the assembly. “Also it’s hard for people, for example with young children, to be on a call all day rather than for shorter periods of time.” Fundamentally, however, the format is the same, with assembly members hearing from expert speakers, asking questions and discussing issues in small groups, and using a secure online system to cast their votes. “In some ways, it’s surprising how little has changed,” added Allan. Those without internet access were able to join via their landline, with printed resources sent in the post. But as with the many other aspects of life that have moved online in recent weeks, there have been hiccups. One participant, Ellie, a 21-year-old trainee teacher living in north London, moved back to rural Devon to be with family before the lockdown, and had some technical problems while joining the virtual meetings. “That made discussion quite challenging,” she said. “And people have families coming in and out, and pets – sometimes it’s a little bit chaotic, but quite endearing and lovely to see where everyone is from.” The assembly is made up of 110 people selected by computer to be representative of society from a pool of 1,500, who asked to be considered after invitations were sent out to 30,000 households chosen at random. Over the past few weeks, experts have talked to them about a wide range of topics, including energy production, transport, agriculture and consumerism, with participants voting on a series of propositions related to each with a view to determining how the UK could best achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. On this final weekend the assembly will be discussing how the coronavirus pandemic affects the climate crisis, and members will be given an opportunity to raise any issues they do not feel have been addressed throughout – for instance, whether the UK deadline of 2050 for meeting net zero should be brought forward. Ellie said she was aware of the urgency of the issue before joining the assembly, and her views have remained pretty consistent throughout the process. “My feelings as it’s coming to an end reflect how I felt when I initially found out I was going to be taking part,” she said. “I’m really thrilled that we got to make a contribution and I was able to be a part of it.” But 52-year-old Adrian from Belfast, who works in the legal sector, said he had become much more aware of the effects of his individual actions. “I think having children makes you more aware of how you behave and the shadow that you cast across,” he said. “It’s the things that I can do, and the things I can change – in your routine, the way you live, how you travel – that’s the great takeaway for me.” The assembly does not aim to provide a definitive consensus on issues, but to provide a snapshot of public opinion: if the participants are divided on an issue, the final report will reflect that. It is due to be published before the parliamentary summer recess starts in July, an exciting but also nerve-racking prospect for the participants. “I think I’m cautious about the impact it will have politically,” said Ellie. “I definitely hope this will have a tangible impact and it will gain some kind of recognition. I’m sure it will gain some criticism as well.” It is not yet known whether the report will be debated in parliament, although it will be used by the six select committees that commissioned it – and perhaps in other organisations as well. “I think it will be really interesting to see how it’s used by other people beyond parliament once it’s published,” said Allan. Assembly members said they were aware the coronavirus pandemic had completely transformed society, and perhaps shifted public focus away from the climate crisis. But Covid-19 had also created a unique opportunity for a national and global reset. “We would hope that [when] restarting the economy, some of the decisions made will be influenced by some of the suggestions we make here,” said Adrian, noting the rise in cycling and walking since the lockdown. “Sometimes after these events [such as the coronavirus crisis] people have a greater community consciousness, and perhaps now is the time to use the recommendations to ignite that.” The participants are hopeful that, now or in the future, their recommendations do help shape the country in a way that benefits the environment in the long term. “I think the change will happen. It’s the speed at which it happens which is the key,” said Adrian. “But as I see those changes being made, I’ll be able to smile and look at them and say, ‘Well, I did that’.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterDavid Robert Grimes of the Irish Times latest piece pretty much tells us all we all need to know about the state of mind of climate alarmists nowadays: it’s one of mounting frustration that’s on the verge of exploding anger. Are calls for anger what one typically sees from the winning side of a debate? Certainly not.
What we are actually seeing appears to be the frustration one sees from the losing side, a side that had gone in thinking victory was sure. Like an 8-year old losing a checker game to a brighter 4-year old.
The humiliation is evident.
He writes: “If greenhouse emissions continue their steady escalation, temperatures across most of the earth will rise to levels with no recorded precedent by the middle of this century, researchers say.” Notice here how Grimes writes “temperature will rise” and not “temperature is rising“. He is telling us not look at the current model performance, but to just wait another 40 years. He has to do this because all the models have been dead wrong. And what Grimes fails to understand is that if the models are wrong today, then they can’t be used for the future. In fact neither Grimes nor any scientist has even a single scrap of data that would allow them to predict the future. It’s all scenario and speculation.
Misinterprets the warming stop as “bleak”
He writes: “The findings are bleak, but not unexpected.” False. The findings are unexpected. Not a single IPCC model got the temperatures for the last fifteen years correct. All overstated the temperature rise. So this is good news and certainly not “bleak”. Only psychologically abnormal persons would not feel some sense of relief. The stop in temperature rise is unexpected and thus can be nothing but good news – period.
Obsessive catastrophe wishers
Clearly Grimes comes across as an obsessive and irrational catastrophe-wisher. No data, news, or even therapy, are going to change the mindset of the obsessive alarmists. They seem to have an acute, unexplainable allergy to the bearers of good news, especially from “publications like the Daily Mail, the Wall Street Journal and numerous Murdoch press.” All good news that gets presented absolutely has to be defeated.
Grimes denies real data, embraces model scenarios
Grimes also accuses the skeptics of denialism, claiming they are practicing a “stubborn and persistent refusal to acknowledge what the evidence shows beyond all reasonable doubt.” All we can say here is that Grimes only needs to look at the performance of the models, storm statistics, Antarctic sea ice trends, the missing tropospheric hot spot, and especially the ABANDONED hockey stick. Who’s really in denial? Which scientists are puzzled by the missing heat and are scrambling to make up excuses for it?

Alarmist journalists qualified, skeptic ones not?
In his rant, Grimes gripes about the skeptic politicians and press, even attacking columnists James Delingpole and David Rose for challenging the science and claiming they have “no qualification to do so.” Such a stupid argument. Delingpole and Rose are just as qualified to challenge the science as Grimes and Borenstein are qualified to endorse it. In the end data decide, and not the scientists with the longest resumes. This guy went to Oxford?
Concedes complexity that skeptics claimed for years
Grimes also hints that climate science is too complex to be decided by the public: “Climate is a deeply complex system, not a simple thermostat.” Unfortunately this is not what the alarmist climate scientists told us for more than 20 years. In fact they told us just the opposite: Climate and global temperature boil down to the concentration of trace gas CO2. Even Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber said so on camera. And all their simple climate models told us the same. It is us skeptics who have been telling the world that the climate is far more complex and that the simple CO2-global temperature correlation was preposterous. And now that there has not been any warming in 15 years, the alarmists are now finally waking up and coming around to this reality.
Calls for anger, emotionalization have no place in science
Grimes is emotional and frustrated, and thus cannot be taken seriously anymore. His scientific understanding has been fatally compromised by his increasingly emotional state. Calls for mob anger and emotionalization have no place in science.
Finally Grimes writes: “Worse than this, depleting ice-sheets increase tectonic and volcanic activity as the confining loads on these systems are stripped away, increasing seismic activity.”
Now that I’m done laughing, to this I can only say that it amazes me that Oxford University would actually graduate people capable of such flaming nonsense. Grimes actually confuses far-fetched raw hypotheses as settled science.
From a science point a view, Grimes offers nothing. All we can do is give him high marks for entertainment. His behavior is exactly what us skeptics were looking forward to seeing from the spoiled elitist losers 10 years ago when were pretty sure we were going to win this debate. The entertainment begins.

"Norway’s gigantic sovereign wealth fund has dumped its stake in the Australian energy company AGL, which owns coal-fired power stations including the carbon-intensive Liddell plant in New South Wales, after tightening up its rules on fossil fuels. Norges Bank, which manages the US$1.1tn Government Pension Fund Global, has also put Australian mining giant BHP on an “observation list”, placing it at risk of divestment in the future.  The fund, which is so big it owns an estimated 1.5% of shares listed on the global stock exchange, invests the spoils of Norway’s own North Sea oil bonanza. However, over the past few years it has adopted progressively stricter rules about investing in fossil fuels. Its latest rules, brought into force in December, allow it to exclude or put on observation companies that get 30% or more of their income from thermal coal, base 30% or more of their operations on thermal coal, produce more than 20m tons of thermal coal a year or produce power of more than 10,000MW from thermal coal. It is believed AGL has been disqualified because of its coal mine at Loy Yang in Victoria. The company had hoped to close its elderly Liddell coal-fired plant in 2022 but after a political bunfight has pushed the date into the following year. Glencore, which has assets in Australia and produces more than 130m tons of coal a year, has also been struck from the fund’s list of permitted investments. BHP also holds extensive thermal coal assets, although it has recently been moving towards selling them. Norges Bank said the fund had sold out of companies it has put on the banned list. At the end of last year it owned a 0.46% stake of AGL, worth roughly A$65m. “For several of the companies of which exclusion is now being made public, the market situation, including the liquidity of individual shares, has meant that it has taken a long time to sell the shares in a reasonable manner,” Norges Bank said.  “That explains why a long period of time has passed between some of the decisions and the publication.” Activist shareholder group the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility said it showed that AGL and BHP, which it described as “iconic” Australian companies, were both “well behind the times”. The group’s executive director, Brynn O’Brien, said the companies did not have credible strategies to move to more climate-friendly business models. “Sophisticated investors like the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund look past the feelgood advertising and flimsy climate commitments of companies like AGL and BHP and see that coal businesses have no future,” she said. “They also know that coal investments are a direct threat to the profitability of other sectors in which they invest, like agriculture, property and tourism. The Norwegian fund has clearly not seen enough progress from either of these companies, and in the case of AGL has reached the decision that continuing to invest poses too great a risk.” O’Brien said it was part of a trend of investors expressing their concern about the policies of Australian fossil fuel companies. More than 50% of investors in the oil and gas company Woodside recently supported a non-binding motion calling on it to adopt climate targets consistent with the Paris agreement not just for its own greenhouse gas emissions, but for the “scope 3” emissions released when its customers use its products.  Similar motions were backed by 43% and 37% of shareholders of Santos and Rio Tinto, respectively."

 _The Current Wisdom_ is a series of monthly posts in which Senior Fellow Patrick J. Michaels reviews interesting items on global warming in the scientific literature that may not have received the media attention that they deserved, or have been misinterpreted in the popular press.   
  
_The Current Wisdom_ only comments on science appearing in the refereed, peer-reviewed literature, or that has been peer-screened prior to presentation at a scientific congress.   
  
**********   
  
The recent publication of two articles in _Nature_ magazine proclaiming a link to rainfall extremes (and flooding) to global warming, added to the heat in Russia and the floods in Pakistan in the summer of 2010, and the back-to-back cold and snowy winters in the eastern U.S. and western Europe, have gotten a lot of public attention. This includes a recent hearing in the House of Representatives, despite its Republican majority. Tying weather extremes to global warming, or using them as “proof” that warming doesn’t exist (see: snowstorms), is a popular rhetorical flourish by politicos of all stripes.   
  
The hearing struck many as quite odd, inasmuch as it is much clearer than apocalyptic global warming that the House is going to pass meaningless legislation commanding the EPA to cease and desist from regulating greenhouse gas emissions. “Meaningless” means that it surely will not become law. Even on the long-shot probability that it passes the Senate, the President will surely veto, and there are nowhere near enough votes to override such an action.   
  
Perhaps “wolf!” has been cried yet again. A string of soon-to-be-published papers in the scientific literature finds that despite all hue and cry about global warming and recent extreme weather events, natural climate variability is to blame.   
  
Where to start? How about last summer’s Russian heat wave?   
  
The Russian heat wave (and to some degree the floods in Pakistan) have been linked to the same large-scale, stationary weather system, called an atmospheric “blocking” pattern. When the atmosphere is “blocked” it means that it stays in the same configuration for period of several weeks (or more) and keeps delivering the same weather to the same area for what can seem like an eternity to people in the way. Capitalizing on the misery in Russia and Pakistan, atmospheric blocking was added to the list of things that were supposed to be “consistent with” anthropogenically stimulated global warming which already, of course included heat waves and floods. And thus the Great Russian Heat Wave of 2010 became part of global warming lore.   
  
But then a funny thing happened – scientists with a working knowledge of atmospheric dynamics started to review the situation and found scant evidence for global warming.   
  
The first chink in the armor came back in the fall of 2010, when scientists from the Physical Sciences Division (PSD) of the Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) presented the results of their preliminary investigation on the web , and concluded that “[d]espite this strong evidence for a warming planet, **greenhouse gas forcing fails to explain the 2010 heat wave over western Russia**. The natural process of atmospheric blocking, and the climate impacts induced by such blocking, are the principal cause for this heat wave.”   
  
The PSD folks have now followed this up with a new peer-reviewed article in the journal _Geophysical Research Letters_ that rejects the global warming explanation. The paper is titled “Was There a Basis for Anticipating the 2010 Russian Heat Wave?” Turns out that there wasn’t.   
  
To prove this, the research team, led by PSD’s Randall Dole, first reviewed the observed temperature history of the region affected by the heat wave (western Russia, Belarus, the Ukraine, and the Baltic nations). To start, they looked at the recent antecedent conditions: “Despite record warm globally-averaged surface temperatures over the first six months of 2010, Moscow experienced an unusually cold winter and a relatively mild but variable spring, providing no hint of the record heat yet to come.” Nothing there.   




Then they looked at the long-term temperature record: “The July surface temperatures for the region impacted by the 2010 Russian heat wave shows no significant warming trend over the prior 130-year period from 1880 to 2009…. A linear trend calculation yields a total temperature change over the 130 years of -0.1°C (with a range of 0 to -0.4°C over the four data sets [they examined]).” There’s not a hint of a build-up to a big heat wave.   
  
And as to the behavior of temperature extremes: “There is also no clear indication of a trend toward increasing warm extremes. The prior 10 warmest Julys are distributed across the entire period and exhibit only modest clustering earlier in this decade, in the 1980s and in the 1930s…. This behavior differs substantially from globally averaged annual temperatures, for which eleven of the last twelve years ending in 2006 rank among the twelve warmest years in the instrumental record since 1850….”   
  
With regard any indication that “global” warming was pushing temperatures higher in Russia and thus helped to fuel the extreme heat last summer, Dole et al. say this: “With no significant long-term trend in western Russia July surface temperatures detected over the period 1880-2009, mean regional temperature changes are thus very unlikely to have contributed substantially to the magnitude of the 2010 Russian heat wave.”   
  
Next the PSD folks looked to see if the existing larger-scale antecedent conditions, fed into climate models would produce the atmospheric circulation patterns (i.e. blocking) that gave rise to the heat wave. The tested “predictors” included patterns of sea surface temperature and arctic ice coverage, which most people feel have been subject to some human influence. No relationship: “These findings suggest that the blocking and heat wave were not primarily a forced response to specific boundary conditions during 2010.”   
  
In fact, the climate models exhibited no predilection for projecting increases in the frequency of atmospheric blocking patterns over the region as greenhouse gas concentrations increased. Just the opposite: “Results using very high-resolution climate models suggest that the number of Euro-Atlantic blocking events will decrease by the latter half of the 21st century.”   
  
At this point, Dole and colleagues had about exhausted all lines of inquiry and summed things up: 



Our analysis points to a primarily natural cause for the Russian heat wave. This event appears to be mainly due to internal atmospheric dynamical processes that produced and maintained an intense and long-lived blocking event. Results from prior studies suggest that it is likely that the intensity of the heat wave was further increased by regional land surface feedbacks. The absence of long-term trends in regional mean temperatures and variability together with the model results indicate that it is very unlikely that warming attributable to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations contributed substantially to the magnitude of this heat wave.



Can’t be much clearer than that.   
  
But that was last summer. What about the past two winters? Both were very cold in the eastern U.S. with record snows events and/or totals scattered about the country.   
  
Cold, snow, and global warming? On Christmas Day 2010, the _New York Times_ ran an op-ed by Judah Cohen, a long-range forecaster for the private forecasting firm Atmospheric and Environmental Research, outlining his theory as to how late summer Arctic ice declines lead to more fall snow cover across Siberia which in turn induces atmospheric circulation patterns to favor snowstorms along the East Coast of the U.S. Just last week, the Union of Concerned Scientists held a news conference where they handed out a press release  headlined “Climate Change Makes Major Snowstorms Likely.” In that release, Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center, laid out his theory as to how the loss of Arctic sea ice is helping to provide more moisture to fuel winter snowstorms across the U.S. as well as altering atmospheric circulation patterns into a preferred state for big snowstorms. Weather Underground’s Jeff Masters chimed in with “Heavy snowstorms are not inconsistent with a warming planet.”   
  
As is the wont for this _Wisdom_ , let’s go back to the scientific literature.   
  
Another soon-to-be released paper to appear in _Geophysical Research Letters_ describes the results of using the seasonal weather prediction model from the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) to help untangle the causes of the unusual atmospheric circulation patterns that gave rise to the harsh winter of 2009-2010 on both sides of the Atlantic. A team of ECMWF scientists led by Thomas Jung went back and did experiments changing initial conditions that were fed into the ECMWF model and then assessed how well the model simulated the known weather patterns of the winter of 2009-2010. The different set of initial conditions was selected so as to test all the pet theories behind the origins of the harsh winter. Jung et al. describe their investigations this way: “Here, the origin and predictability of the unusual winter of 2009/10 are explored through numerical experimentation with the ECMWF Monthly forecasting system. More specifically, the role of anomalies in sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice, the tropical atmospheric circulation, the stratospheric polar vortex, solar insolation and near surface temperature (proxy for snow cover) are examined.”   
  
Here is what they found after running their series of experiments.   
  
_Arctic sea ice and sea surface temperature anomalies_. These are often associated with global warming caused by people. Finding: “These results suggest that neither SST nor sea ice anomalies explain the negative phase of the NAO during the 2009/10 winter.”   
  
(NAO are the commonly used initials for the North Atlantic Oscillation – and atmospheric circulation pattern that can act to influence winter weather in the eastern U.S. and western Europe. A negative phase of the NAO is associated with cold and stormy weather and during the winter of 2009-10, the NAO value was the lowest ever observed.)   
  
_A global warming-induced weakening stratospheric (upper-atmosphere) jetstream_. ""Like for the other experiments, these stratospheric relaxation experiments fail to reproduce the magnitude of the observed NAO anomaly.""   
  
_Siberian snow cover._ “The resulting [upper air patterns] show little resemblance with the observations…. The implied weak role of snow cover anomalies is consistent with other research….”   
  
_Solar variability._ “The experiments carried out in this study suggest that the impact of anomalously low incoming [ultraviolet] radiation on the tropospheric circulation in the North Atlantic region are very small… suggesting that the unusually low solar activity contributed little, if any, to the observed NAO anomaly during the 2009/10 winter.”   
  
Ok then, well what did cause the unusual weather patterns during the 2009-10 winter? 



The results of this study, therefore, increase the likelihood that both the development and persistence of negative NAO phase resulted from internal atmospheric dynamical processes.



Translation: Random variability.   
  
To drive this finding home, here’s another soon-to-be-released paper (D’Arrigo et al., 2001) that uses tree ring-based reconstructions of atmospheric circulation patterns and finds a similar set of conditions (including a negative NAO value second only to the 2009-10 winter) was responsible for the historically harsh winter of 1783-84 in the eastern U.S. and western Europe, which was widely noted by historians. It followed the stupendous eruption of the Icelandic volcano Laki the previous summer. The frigid and snowy winter conditions have been blamed on the volcano. In fact, Benjamin Franklin even commented as much.   
  
But in their new study, Roseanne D’Arrigo and colleagues conclude that the harshness of that winter primarily was the result of anomalous atmospheric circulation patterns that closely resembled those observed during the winter of 2009-10, and that the previous summer’s volcanic eruption played a far less prominent role:   
  
Our results suggest that Franklin and others may have been mistaken in attributing winter conditions in 1783-4 mainly to Laki or another eruption, rather than unforced variability.   
  
Similarly, conditions during the 2009-10 winter likely resulted from natural [atmospheric] variability, not tied to greenhouse gas forcing… Evidence thus suggests that these winters were linked to the rare but natural occurrence of negative NAO and El Niño events.   
  
The point is that natural variability can and does produce extreme events on every time scale, from days (e.g., individual storms), weeks (e.g., the Russian heat wave), months (e.g., the winter of 2009-10), decades (e.g., the lack of global warming since 1998), centuries (e.g., the Little Ice Age), millennia (e.g., the cycle of major Ice Ages), and eons (e.g., snowball earth).   
  
Folks would do well to keep this in mind next time global warming is being posited for the weather disaster _du jour_. Almost assuredly, it is all hype and little might.   
  
Too bad these results weren’t given a “hearing” in the House!

Yesterday, the governors of California and New York signed legislation to raise their states’ minimum wage over the next few years to $15 an hour throughout California and much of New York. Similar proposals are percolating in other state and local governments, and Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has called for a national minimum wage of $15/hour.   
  
Predictably, critics of raising the minimum wage are arguing that the higher wage floor will hurt employment for low-skill workers, the very people the wage floor is intended to help. A worker will be employed only if the value of his output is greater than the cost of employing him—a cost that includes wages, employer payroll taxes (e.g., Social Security, Medicare, unemployment insurance), training and outfitting costs, the new health care mandate and other benefits, etc. According to these opponents, the higher wage floor will reduce employment for low-skill workers and encourage employers to find non-labor ways to accomplish low-skill tasks (e.g., ATM machines, self-serve gas pumps, vending machines, automated phone answering systems).   
  
Wage-increase supporters dismiss this concern, claiming there’s no proof that a higher wage floor hurts employment. A very large body of empirical research indicates otherwise, however, with the negative effects falling mainly on workers below age 25 (which isn’t surprising, as 77% of workers earning the federal minimum wage are below age 25, and they have few demonstrated work skills). Wage-increase supporters can argue the research isn’t unanimous, but given the one-sidedness of the extensive empirical evidence, that argument sounds a bit like climate change denial—if not creation science.   
  
More thoughtful wage-increase supporters have begun offering a different argument: Yes, they concede, raising the minimum wage can hurt low-skill employment. But that harm is a worthwhile tradeoff for better wages for the remaining low-skill work: some workers may lose their jobs or some work hours, but others will get a raise.   
  
This argument is important and interesting—in a Marie Antoinette* sort of way.   




Consider this snippet from a recent _Washington Post_ “Wonkblog” post, “The $15 Minimum Wage Sweeping the Nation Might Kill Jobs—And That’s Okay”:   




""Why shouldn’t we in fact accept job loss?” asks New School economics and urban policy professor David Howell, who’s about to publish a white paper on the subject. ""What’s so bad about getting rid of crappy jobs, forcing employers to upgrade, and having a serious program to compensate anyone who is in the slightest way harmed by that?""   
  
""The problem with having a criterion of 'no job loss' is that it guarantees that the minimum wage will always be at a level so low that it won’t come close to achieving [a] living wage standard,” Howell says.   
  
… “It could be that [low-skill workers] spend more time unemployed, but their income is higher overall,” says David Cooper, an economist with the Economic Policy Institute. “If you were to tell me I could work fewer hours, and make as much or more than I could have previously, that would be okay.”   
  
Cooper still thinks there’s a lot more research to be done to understand how higher minimum wages affect the bottom of the labor market. He does think the risk of job loss is worth factoring into the decision of where to set the wage floor. But he also agrees that it’s worth forging into those uncharted waters to see what might await.



This thinking raises two questions: who decides what a “crappy” job is, and who decides what particular tradeoff between less employment and a higher wage floor is “okay”? Howell says the decider is “we,” but it’s unclear who “we” is and what qualifies him/her to make that decision for all workers and employers. Cooper says the decider should be he, but what entitles Cooper to make that decision for everyone? Of course, the decider will be politicians, but are their decisions really made out of concern and understanding for the well-being of low-skill workers (not to mention all other people)?   
  
Howell and (apparently) Cooper think such decisions are justified because they’d ensure that every worker earns a “living wage.” Beyond the obvious problem that “a living wage” is a nonsensical term—a living is provided by income, not rate of income—there likely are plenty of workers who would trade their labor for less than whatever Howell and Cooper stipulate is an acceptable wage: pre-teens who will babysit for Mall money, teenagers who want to buy their first car, college students who want an internship, first-time workers who are willing to “pay their dues” in pursuit of higher ambitions, young workers who have low living costs, people who want to work for some high-minded cause, family members who want to make a little money while helping an entrepreneurial relative, seniors who want some extra cash (and responsibility), and so forth.   
  
Howell and Cooper would reply that such workers should be assisted by social programs to help “anyone who is in the slightest way harmed by” their stipulated wage floor. But students who want opportunity-providing internships, or first-time workers who want to build and demonstrate work skills, or relatives who want to lend a hand in the family business in return for a little money, or seniors who want a little extra cash don’t want a handout and some vocational training—they want a job.   
  
One of the great things about free labor markets is that, because employment is voluntary, each worker can set his own wage floor. That’s why few workers—especially full-time workers—work for the minimum wage: they demand higher compensation, though each makes his or her own tradeoff between wage demands and employment.   
  
Of course, some workers do work for the minimum wage, and many of them think that wage is lousy. But what’s even lousier is _not_ being able to work for the minimum wage, and _not_ being able to gain the work experience that would help them move on to better-paying jobs. That’s why it’s hard to accept the idea that workers would be better off if they were prohibited from deciding those tradeoffs for themselves, and instead have Cooper or “we” decide it for all of them.   
  
And that’s why this argument sounds an awful lot like “Let them eat cake”: Howell and Cooper believe they--or politicians--should stipulate the minimum that each and every worker should receive for his or her labor--even if some of those workers would have accepted less, and even if some (and perhaps many) of those workers end up getting nothing. Though Howell and Cooper undoubtedly are motivated by noble intentions, it’s hard to see how their idea is all that noble.   
  
* In fairness to Marie Antoinette, the “Let them eat cake!” tale is almost certainly apocryphal.

"Ever since the issue was highlighted in shows like “Blue Planet 2”, plastic pollution in the world’s oceans has generated a wave of concern among the public. It might surprise people to learn that despite comparably less attention, many of the world’s rivers are just as polluted, if not more so. Around 80% of marine litter starts on land and rivers help transport it out to sea. In this way, plastic pollution is not just a problem for the distant open ocean – it’s an issue on our doorstep. For this reason, I chose to focus on the River Thames and the impact that plastics are having close to home. There are currently no estimates for the amount of plastic in the Thames, but the world’s rivers are estimated to carry up to 4,000 kg of plastic out to sea every day. Despite much of the plastic in the Thames making it to the North Sea, a portion is permanently accumulating in the catchment. Researchers recovered nearly 8,500 items from the Thames riverbed over three months in 2012. After 20 river cleans on the foreshore of the Thames in 2019, nearly 9,000 plastic items were recovered, almost all of which were single-use. These were most often wet wipes, sanitary products and food packaging, which accumulate in the sediment or are deposited on the inside of bends in the river. Several members of our lab group helped with a cleanup with local environment charity Thames21. On the Thames foreshore at Hammersmith in early 2019, 23,000 wipes were collected, averaging 201 wipes per square metre. You may have heard of wet wipes forming “fatbergs” in sewers, but on the banks of the Thames there are wet wipe reefs that are slowly changing the shape of the river itself. As plastics move through the aquatic environment they break up. Eventually, these particles reach a microscopic scale. I have been researching microplastics, which are items smaller than 5 mm – roughly  the size of a grain of rice – since 2015 and every study I have undertaken has found plastic. I have studied two UK rivers, the Thames and the Clyde, and fish in both estuaries have ingested plastic. As part of my PhD, I’m researching the accumulation of microplastics in the Thames food web. When I trawl in the Thames for fish the nets are full of plastic, especially tangles of wet wipes. It’s extremely rare that we bring in a net with no litter at all. Despite its murky appearance, the Thames is a diverse ecosystem that’s full of life. It supports over 120 species of fish as well as many marine mammals, such as grey seals, common seals, dolphins and porpoises. Even a beluga whale was once spotted. Microplastics in the river can be ingested by all animals in the food web. Negative impacts on one part of this system can potentially cause a cascade which affects other species.  Microplastics contain chemical additives which are released as they degrade and can act as harmful pollutants in water. These toxic chemicals can be transferred to organisms if they ingest them. This forces the animal to use their energy to treat the problem, rather than growing, feeding or reproducing. The amount of plastic in an animal’s gut is likely to increase higher up the food web that the animal feeds. If amphipods near the base of the foodweb ingest a few pieces of plastic then fish eating large numbers of amphipods – each likely to contain small amounts of plastic – would gradually accumulate more as they feed. Then seals at the top of the foodweb, which ingest lots of fish, would be exposed to a greater concentration still. Though plastic straws and other single-use items have taken much of the blame, the plastic most commonly eaten by flatfish – a species often caught by fishers – are fibres. These are long threads of plastic which originate in our fabrics. Straws may flow out to sea quicker but during my research in the Thames, I found that 80% of all plastic extracted from animals there were fibres. Hundreds of thousands of these tiny plastic fibres can drain into rivers with every use of our washing machines. Wastewater treatment plants catch the majority of these fibres, but with so many people washing their clothes in the Thames catchment area, a vast number of fibres are still entering the river and making their way out to sea.  Washing clothes less often and using products designed to capture fibres in the wash can prevent them getting to rivers or the sea, such as the guppy friend bag and coraball. We may rightly fret about the impact of our plastic on life in the ocean, but it’s time we realised that the plastic pollution crisis is a lot closer to home than we care to think."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe strategy of scaring people into action on climate change has backfired totally, so writes Kathrin Burger of the German leftist TAZ daily in a piece titled: Horror Scenarios Promote Depression.

Psychologists say that many who have been listening excessively to climate alarmists are now ready for therapy. Photo: public domain – Marc NL 
It turns out the alarmists, with all their climate doom and gloom, have only succeeded in spreading depression among themsleves and those around them.
It’s only normal that people who surround themselves with incurable pessimists also eventually become pessimistic themselves, and eventually get depressed or mentally ill. This is what’s happening within the climate movement in Germany, enviro-psychologists say.
Alarmism as a mental disorder
It can be convincingly argued that mental illness is indeed a chronic problem among many climate alarmists and their followers. Many are paranoid that a trace gas is causing a climate catastrophe. They even blame bad weather on the Co2 trace gas, with some even going so far as to blame earthquakes and war on the man-made CO2 molecules in the air. Seemingly educated scientists are obsessed with a coming climate catastrophe to the point where they even refuse to believe any data showing to the contrary.
And now that many western societies have been exposed to climate pessimism and alarmism for a good 25 years, it’s little wonder we are finding reports confirming that all the climate doom-saying is causing more depression globally, so writes the German leftist online TAZ. The problem with the environmental movement, experts are finding out, is that it is making everybody mentally sick and depressed rather than making them more environmentally aware and responsible. People are becoming complacent when it comes to climate-related action.
“Doomer Depression”
In the TAZ article, author Kathrin Burger admits that all the fear-mongering indeed has been a very poor method of motivating people to change their lives:
Florian Kaiser, environmental psychologist at the University of Magdeburg says: ‘With threatening scenarios you’ll likely not get anyone to change their views.'”
The TAZ writes that all the scare scenarios are in fact leading to a phenomenon dubbed: “Doomer Depression“.
The TAZ, of course, takes the position that the planet is in big trouble, and that this message needs to be communicated in a new way – in a way that makes the message less depressing and more effective at motivating people to change their lives. Nowhere does the TAZ write that the alarmism itself may have its very roots in mental disorder, i.e. the CO2 paranoia and obsession mentioned above.
Here’s an excerpt of what the TAZ claims:
One problem is that climate change is hardly detectable and so people have a psychological distance to it. Apocalyptic scenarios are, however, of little help in overcoming that distance. The overly drastic prognoses that were used especially in the 1980s only amplified the sense of helplessness. ‘Because stability is a fundamental desire of every person, thoughts that have to do with situations of collapse often get suppressed,’ states a strategy paper of the Greens in Saxony.”

//-->




The TAZ writes that communicating the message that climate change is real and that humans need to accept drastic lifestyle changes remains a major challenge for the movement. Many people just are not reacting to it.
People are not responding to the message
The real challenge is to find a way to shape people’s perception so that they do embrace the message communicated by the environmental cause. Psychologist Kaiser is quoted by the TAZ as saying:
Pro-social people, those who are inclined to help others, are more accessible for ecological argumentation and are thus more open to dedicating themselves to the environment. However, those who do not count themselves as being among the altruistic are very difficult to reach.”
From the social engineers’ point of view, the problem lies with the human raw material that they have to deal with. The movement would be far easier if only everyone had the right mindset and political view from the start. Consequently many believe that the place to start is to shape the young minds of schoolchildren at an early stage.
School indoctrination has failed
One strategy used by social engineering experts is the indoctrination of children at schools…the farms for growing future environmentalists. Germany for example has attempted in schools for 25 years to indoctrinate its children to become more environmentally aware and responsible. For the results of that experiment, the TAZ quotes Ulrich Gebhardt, child development researcher at the University of Hamburg (emphasis added):
After 25 years of environmental education at schools, the conclusion is sobering: ‘Education for sustainable development‘ has had no effect.'”
And all this time we thought schools were for teaching things like reading, writing, and mathematics. For once in my life I’m glad that schools have, in a way, failed. If anything, this shows that parents are by far the most important force in bringing up children. Good news.
Alarmists Anonymous
So if horror scenarios and indoctrination are failing to motivate people into action and are only causing the side effect of people getting depressed, what strategy is now being pursued in Germany to combat the environmental movement’s side effects, i.e. depression and complacency?
Rather than re-examining the climate data and concluding there really isn’t an imminent catastrophe coming, the alarmists still continue to insist it’s real and are now coming together to produce “positive visions” in group therapy – a sort of Alarmists Anonymous. The TAZ quotes psychologist Gerd Weßling of the Transition Town Bielefeld:
The inner and outer transition depend on each other. In this initiative it’s about meeting on a regular basis, often with psychologists, where the members have the chance to express their desperation and hopelessness.”
For the rest of us who have avoided the doom of gloom of the climate alarmism, my advice is that you continue doing so. Visiting skeptic sites like this one will keep you optimistic about the future and a lot happier.

On the same day that my article [Coverage of Free Speech Trial Illustrates Media Bias](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/09/coverage-of-free-speech-trial-illustrates-media-bias/) was published, Karl du Fresne[ ](https://karldufresne.blogspot.com/)on his blog tackled the same topic. His article had the headline [Activism disguised as journalism](https://karldufresne.blogspot.com/2019/09/activism-disguised-as-journalism.html), and it analysed the Radio NZ hit jobs against both Pregnancy Counselling Services and the Free Speech Coalition.



Radio New Zealand continues to exhibit utter contempt for its obligation of impartiality.   
[…] on the RNZ website yesterday under the headline _NZ’s right wing turn up in force for controversial free speech case_ , reporter Matthew Theunissen painted a lurid picture of “notable right-wing figures” turning up at the Auckland High Court, where the Free Speech Coalition was challenging Auckland Council’s right to deny a public speaking venue to Canadians Lauren Southern and Stephan Molyneux. 



Theunissen reported that Don Brash, “the man behind the Orewa speech”, made an appearance and Jordan Williams from the Taxpayers’ Union was listening intently in the gallery, “a few seats down from a man wearing a MAGA (Make Ardern Go Away) hat”.   
He added that “old” Conservative Party leader Colin Craig (I think Theunissen meant “former”, but hey – who expects journalists to have a command of correct English?) “poked his head around the door at one point”. 



There you have it, then: as sinister a collection of shadowy right-wing rogues and conspiratorial schemers as you could wish for. **Theunissen seemed intent on making it sound like a clandestine meeting of the Ku Klux Klan** […]  
  
Theunissen went on to describe one of the applicants appearing in support of the Free Speech Coalition’s case as “would-be Dunedin mayor, climate change denier, Donald Trump supporter and rare books dealer […] (whose name Theunissen misspelt, but hey – who cares about getting names right when it’s the sneering tone that matters?).   
The relevance of […] views on climate change and Donald Trump wasn’t clear, but never mind; the important thing was **to convey the impression that this was a court action brought by a bunch of crazy and possibly dangerous old men.**



Even Jack Hodder QC, who represented the Free Speech Coalition, didn’t escape. Theunissen’s assiduous research had established that Hodder also acted for the Council of Licensed Firearms Owners in opposing aspects of the recent changes to the gun laws.   
No further evidence needed, then. It was left to readers of Theunissen’s piece to conclude that the disreputable figures congregating in the Auckland High Court were racists […], religious cranks […], champions of heartless free-market capitalism […] and probably white supremacists […]. Oh, and possibly gun nuts too […]. 



The unmistakeable **purpose of the article was to denigrate** those involved in the Free Speech Coalition’s case and by doing so, to discredit the court action.[…]  
RNZ followed that up […]with the results of an obviously laborious investigation (pun not deliberate) into Pregnancy Counselling Services, an organisation that offers support to pregnant women facing a choice between having an abortion or carrying their baby to full term. 



It’s no secret that PCS is loosely affiliated with Christian churches and tries to encourage women to at least consider having a baby rather than immediately taking the abortion option, so that was hardly a “stop the presses” exclusive. RNZ reporter Susan Strongman concentrated instead on portraying PCS as dishonest in the way it promotes its services and highlighting the fact that it has received modest financial support under the government’s Community Organisations Grants Schemes (Cogs). 



Trouble was, Strongman’s credibility as an impartial journalist was fatally compromised when **she was sprung collaborating with pro-abortion activist group ALRANZ.** As reported on this blog last month, Strongman used the ALRANZ Facebook page to seek information from women who had sought counselling from PCS “only to find they [the counsellors] are pushing a pro-life agenda”.[…]  
  
It’s one thing for journalists to use contacts to go on a fishing expedition for information, but another to align themselves so closely with one side of a divisive and contentious political debate, especially when the reporter is working for **a state-funded broadcaster with an obligation of neutrality.**  
Certainly, pro-life groups were convinced that Strongman was out to do a hatchet job on PCS **with the aim of cutting off an important source of funding**.   
[…] there’s no concealing the article’s partisanship. As with Theunissen’s piece on the Free Speech Coalition’s court action, it can only reinforce concerns about the increasing incidence of activism disguised as journalism, and further undermine public confidence in Radio New Zealand as an impartial source of information on matters of vital public interest.

Thousands Petition Gov. Brown To End Cap And Trade
By Amy Quinton, California Capitol Network
Californians Against Higher Taxes and business groups delivered the petitions against
what they call an illegal and hidden energy tax. The cap and trade program would
limit greenhouse gas emissions by requiring polluters to purchase pollution credits
at auction.

But John Kabateck, with the National Federation of Independent Businesses,
says it amounts to an illegal tax that would kill businesses.  “Experts say that this tax could drain 30-billion dollars from California employers by the year 2020, those costs will have to be passed onto someone and that means small business owners and consumers are going to be hit with higher prices.”
Opponents also say the program is unconstitutional without a vote
by the people or a two-thirds vote in the legislature. Assembly Speaker John Perez has said spending and regulating auction revenues doesn’t constitute a tax.

It’s difficult enough to take a cynical look at a teenage superstar and harder still when the star’s social media page simply announces a “16 year old climate activist with Aspergers”. Grappling with such disability elicits much more goodwill from the community; Greta Thunberg has become the ‘Susan Boyle of Global Warming’.



Gifted teenagers are nothing new to society in the fields of science, mathematics and literature, but in the more visible, high-publicity and high earning fields of sport and entertainment they have to be handled carefully lest the resultant fame become ruinous. Often such youngsters’ careers are handled by parents who are assumed to have the teens’ interests closest to their own hearts. While some people may be disparaging of the juvenile success stories, especially if the performance genre or physical activity is not suited to the heckler’s personal taste, they generally get a smile, a wave and a ‘good on you’ by the community at large unless thrust into the limelight by politics.



We got a dose, earlier this year, of how much slack is cut for a teenager embroiled in political shenanigans, even if thrown into the arena unintentionally, in the case of 16-year-old Nicholas Sandmann of Covington Catholic High School. His nervous grimace and every action, indeed micro-action, were thoroughly dissembled, discussed and distorted by the mob-rule media in unaffectionate (to say the least) terms. This included our very own rat-pack who excoriated the lad, abusing him, calling him the face of evil, uneducated, racist and bigoted before even attempting to grasp a simple, objective, factual view of what had transpired at the Lincoln Memorial that day. For days after the sober facts emerged, publishers in New Zealand still put the boot into the innocent young fellow like an out-of-control Jake ‘the Muss’ beating the daylight out of poor Beth. They loved it. I was disgusted.



So it with a sense of caution that I consider the political acts of Greta Thunberg, and the influence that her parents may have on her public profile.



In late June Greta walked into a recording studio to tape a message for a track on British band _1975’_ s new album. In [that message](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/25/time-to-rebel-greta-thunberg-makes-musical-debut-on-the-1975-track) she makes an extraordinary statement:



“We have to acknowledge that the older generations have failed. All political movements in their present form have failed.”



Whatever does she mean? She follows that up with:



“So, everyone out there, it is now time for civil disobedience. It is time to rebel.”



Thunberg announced, in a tweet following the recording, that all proceeds from the piece would be donated to the far-Left ‘Extinction Rebellion’ movement, which is not nearly as controversial in New Zealand as it is in her homeland of Sweden. Doubling the indignation of her compatriots she included a photograph of herself wearing a top emblazoned with the extreme-Left ‘Antifa’ logo with the message.



The tweet provoked a storm of negative reactions. In Sweden **Antifascistisk Aktion** (or AFA) is widely known as an [out-and-out criminal organisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifascistisk_Aktion) involved in much violence. Extinction Rebellion’s Swedish subsidiary is led and heavily influenced by veteran AFA member Jonathon Pye, a convicted criminal sentenced to four years jail time for his part in attacking police during the Gothenburg riots, a man who advocates violence and reportedly would not ‘rule out’ killing to further his political cause.



Greta (very responsibly) realised her mistake and deleted the message. It’s what happened next that’s the intriguing part. Responding to her chastisement ‘Greta’ issued a new tweet which seems more defiant than apologetic, calling on one hand to forgive her naivety, but on the other offering a condescending and callous retort to her detractors:



Are those the authentic words of a ’16 year old climate activist’, or someone else projecting her voice?



“ **Apparently** ” suggests young Greta is not aware of Antifascistisk Aktion’s notorious public image. Is that really credible from such a politically-engaged young lady? A search of Swedish-language newspapers throws up a deluge of stories, over 1,200 of them, more than 200 from this year so far. Are we to simply assume Greta’s gullibility in implied but innocent endorsement of the violent extreme-Left? 



“ **According to some** ” is simple condescension, as if it’s somehow in dispute, a minority view.



“ **Can be linked to violence** ” implies that a long stretch of the bow is required to come to such a conclusion, when the truth is quite the opposite.



Call me cynical, but I doubt the authenticity of the young lady’s response. Further driving my suspicion is the “expect me to know everything about a T-shirt” throwaway. I’ve had teenaged daughters, there’s not a thing of screen-printed fabric they would put on they didn’t endorse, but, at the risk of seeming mean-spirited, could I suggest Greta do what many teenagers do when attempting to understand the meaning of something beyond her years; she could simply ask her parents.

Just a quick note to bring this to attention of readers. I have not been able to locate a copy of this paper other than the paywalled one at Springerlink, so I can’t comment much about it, but it looks interesting. The question is what is the mechanism? The abstract really doesn’t give a hint of that and just saying that “anomalously low solar activity” is the cause really isn’t definitive enough. – Anthony
The dynamics of solar activity and anomalous weather of summer 2010: 2. Relationship with the active longitude zone; effects in the west and east
(Geomagnetism and Aeronomy, Volume 52, Number 1, pp. 1-15, February 2012)
– K. G. Ivanov, A. F. Kharshiladze
Abstract: 
“We confirm the close synoptic relationship of the sectoral structure of the Sun’s magnetic field of the with the near-Earth tropospheric pressure with a case study of three European points (Troitsk, Rome, Jungfrau) in the period of the anomalously hot summer of June–August 2010.
We substantiate the position that such a relationship was fostered by the anomalously low solar activity as a result of superposition of the minima of the 22- and 180-year cycles. Sectoral analysis of the solar-tropospheric relationships has shown that the appearance of a blocking anticyclone in the Moscow suburbs, its expansion to Rome and Jungfrau, and subsequent retreat at first from these points, and then from the Moscow suburbs was closely related to solar activity phenomena producing, according to contemporary notions, cyclonic activity, shown by simulation of the Earth’s electric field.”
http://www.springerlink.com/content/km64487726781347/
UPDATE: Thanks to readers, I have a copy of the paper, which I forwarded to Dr. Leif Svalgaard for inspection.In the introduction of the paper there is this:
1. INTRODUCTION
More than 40 years ago, a statistically significant relationship was discovered between the sectoral struc ture of the IMF and the zonal circulation in the atmosphere of the Earth’s Northern Hemisphere; it was suggested that so-called natural synoptic periods to
some degree were determined by the structure of the interplanetary medium (Dimitriev et al., 1978). Recently it was shown that in one important particular case, the anomalously hot weather of summer 2010, a synoptic relationship took place between the sectoral
structure of the solar and interplanetary magnetic field (SMF and IMF), on the one hand, and the surface atmospheric pressure in the suburban Moscow city of Troitsk, on the other (Ivanov and Kharshiladze, 2011).
Svalgaard writes:
The Russian paper “confirms the earlier conclusions on the
reality of a relationship between the sectoral structure of the IOMFS and the Earth’s troposphere (Mansurov et al., 1974; Wilcox, 1979; Wilcox et al., 1974;… Wilcox, J.M., Svalgaard, L., and Scherrer, P.H.,
Seasonal Variation and Magnitude of the Solar Sector Structure Atmospheric VorticityEffect, Nature, 1974, vol. 55, no. 5509, pp. 539–540.
We have long since abandoned the finding as spurious.
So it seems, they are chasing an old discarded theory, and their findings may be nothing more than coincidental – Anthony

"**A Â£200,000 support package has been granted to the Royal Welsh Agricultural Society (RWAS), it has been announced.**
The RWAS organises the Royal Welsh Show, which was cancelled this year due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Earlier on Monday, Steven Hughson, the chief executive of RWAS, said the organisation had lost about Â£5m this year due to events being called off.
The Welsh Government said the funding would help cover costs and help future events go ahead.
Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Mr Hughson said: ""The impact on us is huge, we've lost nearly 80% of all of our income this year and the events sector has been in restrictions right from the very start of this pandemic.
""Some hospitality sectors have gone in and out of restrictions, but for the events sector we've never been able to trade at all since March, April, and we continue to look forward to an uncertain 2021.""
Mr Hughson said the number of cancelled events throughout the year at the Builth Wells showground in Powys had cost the RWAS Â£5m in income and about Â£50m to the overall economy of Wales.
The Royal Welsh Show, its largest event, typically attracts about 250,000 visitors each year.
Rural affairs minister, Lesley Griffiths, said: ""I am pleased to announce a financial support package for the Royal Welsh Agricultural Society for 2020/21 reflecting the unprecedented circumstances they have faced this year.Â
""I have always said we are seeing the perfect storm as we face the twin challenges of Covid and the impact leaving the transition period brings.Â This funding will help support the RWAS resilience at this difficult time for the sector.""
Deputy minister for culture, sport and tourism, Dafydd Elis-Thomas, said: ""It is important we support major events through these challenging times, so they are still there when we begin returning to normal."""

Federal Emergency Management Agency (Photo credit: Wikipedia)
From the we’ve been telling you so department, comes this honest briefing to the White House:
(CNSNews.com) – Federal Emergency Management Agency Director Craig Fugate said the frequency of tornadoes and hurricanes is cyclical, and he doesn’t know if global warming has anything to do with it.

“If you look back for the amount information we have going back to about 1850s, you’ll see a cycle, and it’s over decades of increased activity and decreased activity,” Fugate said. “And so that cycle has been there. As far anything driving that, I’d really defer to climate scientists.”
“Well, I’m not a meteorologist. I’m not a climate scientist, and hurricanes are cyclic,” Fugate responded. “I do know history, and if you look at history and you look at hurricane activity, there are periods of increased and decreased activity that occurs over decades,” Fugate said. “Throughout the ‘60s, ‘70s, early ‘80s, up until about ’95, the Atlantic was actually in a period of below-average activity, even though you had significant storms like Andrew, Frederic, and David.”
“Beginning about 1995, we saw an uptick in activity that has been sustained, and about the only variation is whether or not we’ve had El Niños or La Niñas, depending upon that for a factor,” Fugate continued. “But if you look back for the amount information we have going back to about 1850s, you’ll see a cycle, and it’s over decades of increased activity and decreased activity. And so that cycle has been there. As far anything driving that, I’d really defer to climate scientists.”
“But the reality is the history says we’ve had this period of activity, we’ve had a period of quiet,” Fugate said. “We’ve had a period of activity; we’ve had a period of quiet. And so what we’ve seen is not what we — we’ve seen this in history before.”
Fugate spoke Wednesday at a White House press briefing on the 2012 hurricane season that begins June 1.

Share this...FacebookTwitterFirst they told us that we would soon run out of fossil fuels. But now we are starting to hear that we have too much, so says Bill McKibben in an interview with utlra-warmist German site Klmaretter (Climate Rescuer).
Right now McKibben seems to be on a sort of trash-America tour in Europe, flying around in a fossil fuel burning jet, and telling eager US-hating leftist Europeans that America is a sort of backwards country.
Here are some excerpts of that interview:
Klimaretter: What do you about the electricity price going up because of investments in renewable energies or that the stability of the energy supply is being jeopardized? 
McKibben: I don’t think that it’s going to be without costs. But the costs are going to be far less than if we don’t do it. The costs from climate change are so enormously high that the costs of the transformation are affordable by comparison.
Klimaretter: What about the storage problem with renewable energies?
McKibben: It’s a problem. But increasingly thoughts are emerging that energy can be stored in unexpected places, […] like in auto batteries.

Klimaretter: What do you think of Obama’s plan of reducing emissions from coal power plants?
McKibben: The real test for Obama is coming when he decides on the Keystone Pipeline and the tar sands. If he makes the right decision, then he’ll be one of the first politicians of global ranking who will stop a project with such a big impact on the climate. That would be a good thing for the negotiations at an international level.
Klimaretter: Some people say that Americans are far more optimistic about climate change and see more opportunity being brought on by new technologies and new jobs. What do you think?
McKibben: I think Americans have their heads stuck in the sand when it comes to climate change. That’s especially strange because we’ve learned an incredible amount about climate change from American scientists. But our political system is in no way on par with the challenge. That is crushing.  […] The Germans and many others have done a much better job  […] But as you know from observing from a distance, political life in the USA has pretty much failed.

Somm first describes the AR5 SPM as a 40-page document pieced-together from 2000 pages “by climate scientists and representatives from numerous countries over four days behind closed doors in Stockholm.”
Then he describes the desperate straits which the proponents of anthropogenic global warming find themselves in, especially since numerous errors were uncovered in the earlier reports and observed temperature data have long since departed from the model projections. He describes the AR5 SPM (my emphasis):
It appears defensive. It is a masterpiece of dosed prophecy. Had Moses taken the same approach, he would not have convinced a single Jew to leave Egypt … In no paper from science or politics have I read the word ‘probable’ or ‘improbable’ so often.”
In Somm’s view the authors of the report appear less confident with their science than ever. He writes:
For some scientists boldness (and cockiness) have long disappeared since unliked climate skeptics uncovered some embarrassing errors in the last report: You can practically smell the authors’ perspiration of fear – and from time to time you even feel a little pity. With all computer models and measurements and simulations on which they fall back on: Things aren’t developing as they imagined a few years ago. […] For some scientists this inconvenient fact has pulled the rug from under their feet…So what to do?”
Somm calls the failed models a “fiasco for the scientists” and describes the efforts they expended to gloss over all the inconvenient facts.

In addition to citing failed models, Somm discusses the fact that CO2 concentration increased strongly over the last 15 years, yet failed to increase the global temperature and that climate scientists are exasperated in finding an explanation for this. In the report, Somm writes that they blame the oceans for absorbing more heat than assumed and that “the consensus with this question is merely ‘medium’“.
And thus Somm thinks it’s tragic that ambitious politicians would force expensive things like large scale renewable energy on such “rather volatile findings“.
Somm concludes:
In the latest IPCC report the scientists overall are significantly reducing their long-term forecast. For the first time. And probably not the last”.
Probabilities everywhere.

"Carbon dioxide emissions have fallen dramatically since lockdowns were imposed around the world due to the coronavirus crisis, research has shown. Daily emissions of the greenhouse gas plunged 17% by early April compared with 2019 levels, according to the first definitive study of global carbon output this year. The findings show the world has experienced the sharpest drop in carbon output since records began, with large sections of the global economy brought to a near standstill. When the lockdown was at its most stringent, in some countries emissions fell by just over a quarter (26%) on average. In the UK, the decline was about 31%, while in Australia emissions fell 28.3% for a period during April. “This is a really big fall, but at the same time, 83% of global emissions are left, which shows how difficult it is to reduce emissions with changes in behaviour,” said Corinne Le Quéré, a professor of climate change at the University of East Anglia, and lead author of the study published in the journal Nature Climate Change. “And it is not desirable – this is not the way to tackle climate change.” The unprecedented fall is likely to be only temporary. As countries slowly get back to normal activity, over the course of the year the annual decline is likely to be only about 7%, if some restrictions to halt the virus remain in place. However, if they are lifted in mid-June the fall for the year is likely to be only 4%. That would still represent the biggest annual drop in emissions since the second world war, and a stark difference compared with recent trends, as emissions have been rising by about 1% annually. But it would make “a negligible impact on the Paris agreement” goals, Le Quéré said. Emissions must fall to net zero by mid-century or soon after to meet the goals of the Paris agreement and keep global heating from reaching catastrophic levels, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The fall in carbon resulting from the Covid-19 crisis reveals how far the world still has to go, said Le Quéré. The experience of the crisis so far has shown that changes in behaviour by individuals – such as not flying, working from home and driving less – can only go part of the way needed to cut emissions, as even the lockdown measures left the bulk of emission sources intact, she said, adding that bigger shifts are needed to the way people produce and use energy. “Just behavioural change is not enough,” she said. “We need structural changes [to the economy and industry]. But if we take this opportunity to put structural changes in place, we have now seen what it is possible to achieve.” Emissions from aviation showed a dramatic decline, of about 60%, as international flights between many countries were grounded. Emissions from surface transport fell less sharply, by about 36%. Power generation and industry accounted for about 86% of the total decline in emissions. Despite such an unprecedented fall, the impacts on the climate are likely to be small. Stocks of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which reached 414.8 parts per million last year, will rise further towards the danger threshold of 450ppm this year, though perhaps at a slightly slower pace. “Carbon dioxide stays in the air a long time, so although emissions are smaller, they are still happening and so carbon dioxide is still building up, just a little more slowly,” said Richard Betts, the head of climate impacts research at the Met Office Hadley Centre, who was not involved in the paper. “If we want to halt the build-up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, we need to stop putting it there altogether. It’s like we’re filling a bath and have turned down the tap slightly, but not turned it off.” The lockdowns have caused steep falls in energy demand, but energy production has hardly been changed by the crisis, noted Mark Maslin, a professor of climatology at University College London, who was also not involved in the paper.  “The real lesson of this pandemic is that we must globally shift our energy production away from fossil fuels as quickly as possible if we are to ensure sustained year-on-year cuts to our global emissions,” he said. “The good news is that both of these will help to maintain the clean air and clear skies we have all rediscovered during lockdown, saving many lives.” The comprehensive analysis was conducted by scientists from the University of East Anglia, Stanford University in the US, the Cicero Centre in Norway, as well as scientists in the Netherlands, Australia, France and Germany. The researchers used measurements of economic activity, energy generation, industrial production, transport and other proxies to estimate carbon dioxide output. They concentrated their analysis on six areas: power generation, surface transport, industry, public buildings and commerce, residential sources, and aviation. Estimates were taken from 69 countries, 50 US states and 30 Chinese provinces, representing 97% of global carbon emissions. Although the rising concentrations of carbon in the atmosphere are regularly measured, they are subject to large natural fluctuations so are unsuitable to the kind of snapshot analysis required to observe what is happening to global carbon output over a relatively short period."

"**Welsh pubs, restaurants and cafes will be banned from serving alcohol from Friday and will be unable to open to customers beyond 18:00 GMT.**
First Minister Mark Drakeford announced the new rules to tackle a rise in coronavirus cases.
Business groups said the move would devastate Wales' hospitality industry, with closures ""guaranteed"".
Indoor entertainment and visitor attractions, including cinemas, museums and galleries, will also have to shut.
Businesses can offer a takeaway service after 18:00, and if they have an off-licence can sell takeaway alcohol up until 22:00.
The Conservative leader in the Senedd, Paul Davies, said the national approach from the Welsh Government was unfair on areas with low Covid rates.
Plaid Cymru said hospitality was ""paying the price"" for a lack of stricter measures after the firebreak lockdown ended on 9 November.
Mr Drakeford said without changes there could be between 1,000 and 1,700 preventable deaths over the winter.
The first minister said firms hit by the restrictions would be offered Â£340m in support which he claimed was ""the most generous package of financial assistance anywhere in the UK"".
Mr Drakeford told a press conference: ""I know these new restrictions will be difficult, coming as they do at the one of the busiest times of the year for the sector.
""Unfortunately, we continue to face a virus which is moving incredibly quickly across Wales and a virus that will exploit every opportunity when we spend time with one another.""
The case rate has risen from 187 per 100,000 people over seven days on Friday, to 210 cases per 100,000 people, Mr Drakeford added.
The restrictions come into effect at 18:00 on Friday, and are similar to the restrictions on hospitality within level three areas in Scotland.
However the rule allowing four people from four different households to meet indoors in pubs and restaurants will stay in place.
The decision will be reviewed on 17 December.
Bingo halls, bowling alleys, soft play centres, casinos, skating rinks and amusement arcades will also have to close.
Meanwhile current restrictions on travel into England, implemented while a lockdown is in place over the border, are being reviewed.
The first minister said he would make a further announcement later this week.
The chief executive of one of Wales' largest breweries says she wants the Welsh Government to prove that Covid is being spread in pubs and restaurants.
""Where is the scientific evidence that you are more at risk in a pub than you are at home or in a supermarket?"" said Connie Parry of Tomos Watkin brewery in Swansea.
Ian Price, director of business lobby group CBI Wales, warned closures and job losses were ""all but guaranteed"" in pubs and restaurants.
""The first minister's announcement is devastating for a Welsh hospitality sector that's already reeling from a damaging cycle of restrictions,"" he said.
Dai Dearden, general manager of The Grange pub in Cardiff, said the announcement was a ""hammer-blow"".
""I think it will close us for the time being at one of the busiest times of the year"", he said, adding it would have ""a massive effect on the health and well-being, and mental state, of my staff and our customers"".
Tom Simmons, the chef and co-owner of Thomas in Pontcanna, Cardiff, said: ""The spend in our restaurant is around 70% on food and drink - and we will lose customers who know they can't have a drink with their meal. Many won't come back because of that.""
""I don't see any reason or logic behind this. All it will do is lead to people gathering at home and drinking instead - it would be structured with restaurants and pubs, not in people's homes.""
Joanne Cooney runs the Irish Bar in Llandudno in Conwy county, which currently has the lowest coronavirus case rate out of Wales' 22 counties.
She said: ""The numbers are high in big towns and we're being penalised for them. Our numbers are low. We should've been able to open and trade.""
""People are not going to come in. You've just turned us into a coffee shop, the town has loads of coffee shops - that's not what we are.""
Ben Francis, of the Federation of Small Business, said it was ""incredibly important"" that promised funding ""can be rolled out as a matter of urgency"".
""There is no getting away from the fact that today's announcement will come as a devastating blow to those indoor entertainment and hospitality firms that have fought tooth and nail to protect jobs, remain viable and provide a safe environment for their staff and customers this year.""
Meanwhile, Folly Farm adventure park and zoo in Pembrokeshire announced it would be closing, saying it was ""heavily reliant"" on the indoor part of the business.
A spokesman for the Welsh Association of Visitor Attractions, which represents more than 70 family attractions in Wales, said the Welsh Government did not consult with tourism leaders before deciding the new rules.
""The health of Wales is paramount, but the way tourism decisions are now being taken is scandalous.
""Some members have stated that the stop-go, no-consultation policy of the Welsh Government is affecting both their health and well-being, and that the Welsh tourism industry is in a state of utter despair at the way it is being treated,"" it said.
The first minister told the press conference that the evidence ""is there"" that the virus is spreading in hospitality - and said it could be seen from a series of reports from the Welsh Government's Technical Advisory Cell.
""When people meet together in a hospitality setting, you're not just having a glancing encounter with somebody as you do if you're going round a supermarket,"" he said.
""You're sitting together with people for a significant period of time.""
BBC Wales has asked to see the evidence cited by Mr Drakeford.
A Welsh Government spokesman referred to a report from the scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage) in September which estimated that closing bars, pubs, cafes and restaurants would have a ""moderate impact"" on Covid transmission.
Hospitality businesses were allowed to open after the firebreak ended earlier in November.
Mr Drakeford said scientific and medical experts had warned that by 12 January, the total number of people with Covid in hospital could rise to 2,200 ""unless we respond now"".
According to the House Of Commons Library there are 2,190 pubs in Wales.
Paul Davies, Welsh Conservative Senedd leader, said: ""This blanket approach across all of Wales is disproportionate and will unfairly affect parts of the country where infection rates are significantly lower than others, and will harm the sector to such an extent that large parts of it may not recover.""
Plaid Cymru said it had called for stricter measures as Wales came out of its firebreak lockdown.
""The Labour Welsh Government failed to do that and now hospitality is paying the price,"" Helen Mary Jones, Plaid's economy spokeswoman, said.
Caroline Jones, of the Independent Reform Alliance in the Senedd, said the national approach would ""strangle the hospitality sector further at the very time of year in the run up to Christmas where many pubs, cafes and restaurants make their profits"".
The Â£160m ""Restrictions Business Fund"" will offer firms in the hospitality, tourism and leisure sectors that pay non-domestic rates (NDR) grants of up to Â£5,000.
The Welsh Government estimated around 60,000 businesses with a rateable value of under Â£150,000 would receive the support.
A ""sector-specific"" Â£180m Economic Resilience Fund would be made available for hospitality, tourism and leisure businesses.
The Welsh Government said small and medium sized businesses meeting the criteria could receive up to Â£100,000, while larger firms could receive up to a maximum of Â£150,000.
The financial support for the hospitality industry is significant and much more than it has been given before.
But coming just a month after the two-week firebreak, these restrictions will be a deadly blow for some traders.
Once again the Welsh Government is having to walk a fine line, beating the virus by reducing the amount we meet others, while at the same time trying to protect the businesses we usually go out to.
Urban pubs may still attract shoppers for a ""dry"" lunch but they are unlikely to spend nearly as much as usual.
Rural pubs, often a community's main place to meet, are more dependent on their evening trade.
The money they are getting from the Welsh Government might well pay overheads like rent and insurance but these are businesses that have already taken a huge hit this year."

Share this...FacebookTwitterHans von Storch’s Klimazwiebel site here presents a just released video featuring some IPCC lead authors that is designed, it appears, to promote alarmism and the myth that the science is settled and that it is now time for policymakers to act decisively.

At 2:05 mark of video, we clearly see the above graphic. Note it only goes back 100 years or so and already the last 15 years show a glaring divergence – lack of correlation. If they had gone back 1000 years, there would be no correlation at all. There’s a clear attempt to deceive viewers here. That’s just one example.
Klimazwiebel asks readers to comment on the video. So far some early comments have been critical of the video’s haughty underlying message, some sharply critical. Here are some excerpts:
Richard Tol thinks the video appears “policy prescriptive”.
Marcel Crok: “not an attempt to present a neutral picture of the state of the science”

Werner Krauss: “This video tells a myth of power and superiority, and it only uses climate change to illustrate it.”
Eduardo Zorita: “I think the IPCC shoots itself in the foot. Climate models are by far not as perfect as it is suggested in the video – in fact most climate models cannot even reproduce the observed annual global mean temperature – let alone provide accurate regional projections for the future.”
Nice piece of propaganda with all the vital elements. What stands out to me is the one-sidedness of the video, ignoring the inconvenient truths from Antarctica, failed models and the 15-year warming pause (see 2:05 mark above). And note how these scientists try to come across as prophets who can see centuries ahead. Just the overall air of know-it-all arrogance these scientists take on makes you want to puke on your keyboard.
In summary, any scientist believing the nonsense needs a doctor, or an education in science – beginning from first grade.

Almost every major American daily newspaper picked up an article published earlier this month by _New York Times_ scribe Justin Gillis entitled “A Warming Planet Struggles to Feed Itself.”



How many times have we read, in the last 50 years, that this or that environmental apocalypse is going to starve the world? I got my doctorate on the wings of one; at that time it was called “global cooling,” after a 1974 CIA report leaked to the _Times_ said that rapidly cooling planetary temperatures could usher in an era of heightened global instability caused by food shortages.



In my lifetime there have been a large number of predicted nutritional apocalypses, caused by overpopulation, lack of biological diversity in our food supply, genetic engineering run amok, acid rain, too little ozone, too much ozone and, finally, global warming. If there were futures on the end of the world, I’d go short. The wrong bet won’t matter anyway.



Facts: Global surface temperature rose about three‐​fourths of a degree Celsius in the 20th century. U.S. corn yields _quintupled_. Life expectancy _doubled_. People got fat. Global warming didn’t cause all of this, but increased atmospheric carbon dioxide directly stimulated plant growth. Further, greenhouse warming takes place more in the winter, which lengthens growing seasons. With adequate water, plants then fix and yield more carbohydrate.



While doing my dissertation I learned a few things about world crops. Serial adoption of new technologies produces a nearly constant increase in yields. Greater fertilizer application, improved response to fertilizer, better tractor technology, better tillage practices, old‐​fashioned genetic selection, and new‐​fashioned genetic engineering all conspire to raise yields, year after year.



Weather and climate have something to do with yields, too. Seasonal rainfall can vary a lot from year‐​to‐​year. That’s “weather.” If dry years become dry decades (that’s “climate”) farmers will switch from corn to grain sorghum, or, where possible, wheat. Breeders and scientists will continue to develop more water‐​efficient plants and agricultural technologies, such as no‐​till production.



Adaptation even applies to the home garden. The tomato variety “heat wave” sets fruit at higher temperatures than traditional cultivars.



However, Gillis claims that “[t]he rapid growth in farm output that defined the late 20th century has slowed” because of global warming.



His own figures show this is wrong. The increasing trend in world crop yields from 1960 to 1980 is exactly the same as from 1980 to 2010. And per capita grain production is rising, not falling.



Gillis more rightly could have blamed any loss in per capita consumption on the stupid (I choose my words carefully) global warming policy that greens once touted: ethanol production from corn.



Even Al Gore now admits that corn‐​based ethanol produces more carbon dioxide than it saves. But as a result of recent ethanol policy, we are the first nation in world history to burn up its food supply to please a political faction.



Indur Goklany, a much‐​published scholar on the consequences of global warming policies, recently calculated that in 2010 alone, diversion of grain to biofuels (like ethanol) caused nearly 200,000 excess deaths in the developing world because of increased prices.



Roger Pielke, Jr., another noteworthy student of global warming science and policy, concurs. Regarding Gillis’ piece, he says: “The carbon dioxide‐​centric focus on the article provides a nice illustration of how an obsession with ‘global warming’ can serve to distract attention from factors that actually matter more for issues of human and environmental concern.”



Ever since people noticed how robust the increase of crop yields is, others have been saying that it must soon stop. This “limits to growth” argument is as tired as a farmer at the end of harvest. Two weeks ago, it was announced at the Global Wheat Rust Symposium that scientists are now producing “super varieties” of pathogen‐​resistant grain, which will tack another 15% onto yield. As the new strain is adopted, it will continue the linear upward trend in wheat yield for at least another decade.



I continue to be amazed at how little the facts are checked on global warming, even when writing for the so‐​called newspapers of record. Crop yields have increased at a constant rate despite changes in global temperature. Per capita grain production is going up, and stupid policies — not global warming — are putting people’s food security at risk.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA major part of Germany’s SPD socialist party, Germany’s second largest party behind Angela Merkel’s CDU conservative party, is coming to its economic and social senses on the issues of climate change and renewable energy. The threat of social unrest and lack of warming are gradually changing minds.

SPD boss Hannelore Kraft says industrial jobs are more important. Photo: SPD Landtagsfraktion NRW, public domain.
Hannelore Kraft, Minister President of Germany’s most populous state North Rhine Westphalia, the heartland of Germany’s heavy industry, has seriously upset the formidable green wing of her SPD party and companion Greens in claiming that preserving heavy industry jobs in her state is more important than the rapid transition over to renewable energies.
The Ruhr region of North Rhine Westphalia employs tens of thousands of jobs in the traditional sectors of coal, steel, and energy. But the continued massive subsidization of renewable energies is a real threat to these jobs and to trade union members who are a major traditional voting block the SPD. The situation reminds us of Senator Joe Manchin in West Virginia.
Germany’s center-left online Süddeutsche Zeitung reports that “North Rhine Westphalia Minister President wants to fight to preserve jobs in steel and power companies. That’s more important than the rapid transition to renewable energies, the SPD politician said in an SZ interview. …’It’s important that we preserve the industrial jobs in our state.'”

Kraft’s words send a clearsignal that a new grand coalition government between Angela Merkel’s CDU/CSU conservative parts and the SPD party are poised to abandon any plans for continuing the rapid transition to renewable energies like we’ve seen over the last years. This would be a massive blow to the climate alarmism movement and to renewable energies. Moreover with Germany’s two major parties being in agreement on the issue, there would be very little political opposition to stop the major scale back.
Recently German energy behemoth RWE announced that it is considering closing its massive Garzweiler II open-cast lignite mine earlier than planned. The Süddeutsche writes this would cost 10,000 jobs. The Süddeutsche also adds, “Thyssen-Krupp director Heinrich Hiesinger has made its steel production staying at it traditional location in Duisburg dependent on that the energy intensive steel sector being exempt through the hardship clause from having to pay the energy feed-in tariffs.”
Clearly renewable energies have reached a point in Germany where energy intensive companies are presenting politicians with real a ultimatum: Either you lighten up on the renewable energy craze, or we’re gone! The mass social unrest that would potentially be caused by a mass industrial exodus is something no responsible politician in power wants to risk having to deal with.
The Green party and the green wing of the socialist party have reacted angrily to Hannelore Kraft’s compromise with heavy industry, assuring plenty of internal conflict ahead.

Arabic records allow past climate to be reconstructed
The study has been published in Weather, a publication of the Royal Meteorological Society
Corals, trees and marine sediments, among others, are direct evidence of the climate of the past, but they are not the only indicators. A team led by Spanish scientists has interpreted records written in Iraq by Arabic historians for the first time and has made a chronology of climatic events from the year 816 to 1009, when cold waves and snow were normal.
The Arabic historians’ records chronologically narrate social, political and religious matters, and some of them mention climate. A study led by researchers from the University of Extremadura (Spain) has focused on ancient meteorological notes of the Iraqi city of Baghdad. 
“We have recovered an interesting chronology of climatic events, such as droughts, floods, rain, frost, heat and cold waves as well as strong winds during the period between 816-1009 in the areas now known as Iraq and Syria” Fernando Domínguez-Castro, lead author and researcher in the Physics department at the University of Extremadura, informed SINC.
This study, which has been published in the Weather journal, highlights a high number of cold waves. “The period between 902 and 944 had a high number if we compare them to current weather data. Examples of this are the six snowfalls that occurred in that period, whilst in our era, we only know of one snowfall in Baghdad on 11 January 2008” Domínguez-Castro highlights.
More cold days due to volcanic eruptions
The research team was especially surprised by the “unexpected” drop in temperatures in July 920. According to the documents analysed, the people of Baghdad had to come down from their roofs (where they would usually sleep in the summer) and go inside their houses and even use blankets. The temperatures could have dropped 9ºC compared to the current average for the month of July.
“It is difficult to identify the cause of this drop in temperature, but it could be due to a volcanic eruption the year before, as it is common for summer temperatures to drop in these cases” the expert points out and says that during some of those nights in July 920, temperatures did not exceed 18ºC.
There were two significant volcanic eruptions during that period, which could be the cause of the cold waves, “although there is a lot of doubt surrounding the dates”, the researcher states. One of those was the Ceboruco volcano (Mexico), around 930, and the other was the Guagua Pichincha (Ecuador), around 910. Nonetheless, “more evidence is necessary to confirm this hypothesis” the expert warns.
The research shows that during the first half of the tenth century, the cold climatic events in Baghdad were more frequent and more intense than today. Although in the Iraqi city only two days with temperatures below 0ºC were registered between 1954 and 2008, there were at least six very cold days in a 42 year period in the tenth century.
According to the researchers, “the Arabic records are very useful for reconstructing the climate in eras and places about which we know very little”. Thanks to the synergy of humans and science ‘robust climate information’ has been extracted” they conclude.
Baghdad, the centre of the empire
In 762, Abu Ja’far Abdallah al-Mansur, the second Abbasid Caliph (the second Islamic dynasty), founded the city of Baghdad and established it as the capital of the empire. The city soon became the most prosperous place at the time, and the centre of international trade and agricultural development, which attracted a growing population.
Historians of the era debated reasons as to why the Caliph gave so much importance to Baghdad. As well as its strategic location between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, the city had good weather conditions. “There was plenty of water, the weather was very warm in the summer, very cold in the winter, and moderate in spring and autumn,” Al-Ya`qubi described, author of a geographical treatise in 891.

The first Earth Day took place in 1970, when I was a high school senior, and that day set the course of my life for the next 25 years. Convinced of the need to protect the environment and realizing that forests were a key part of the environment in my home state of Oregon, I elected to attend forestry school, graduating in 1974.



Over the next two decades, I helped almost every major environmental group in their efforts to save public forests from what we thought were the rapacious hands of timber companies. But I soon realized that the real problem was that Congress had inadvertently given public land agencies budgetary incentives to lose money harming the environment, and disincentives to either make money or do environmental good.



This insight helped me see that creating markets for all resources would allow them to compete on a level playing field. Recreation fees, for example, could reward public land managers for protecting things that recreationists care about, such as scenery, diverse wildlife habitat, and clean water. Though economists estimated that recreation was worth more than any other public land resource, Congress didn’t allow managers to charge for most recreation.



Many environmentalists in the 1970s and 1980s were receptive to my ideas of reform. Our common goal was to protect the environment, and they happily accepted any tools that would solve a particular environmental problem best. Soon, Congress passed a law allowing federal land agencies to charge recreation fees and to keep those fees.





Giving government power to solve a problem is not the same as actually solving the problem.



Unfortunately, things changed in the early 1990s because of two events: the fall of the Soviet Union and the election of Bill Clinton to the White House.



Polls showed that the fall of the Soviet Union persuaded most Americans that government was a poor solution to most problems. One of the few exceptions was environmental protection, which many Americans still believed needed government regulation. This led many self‐​described “progressives,” who believe in more government control, to push their agenda by joining the environmental movement.



Meanwhile, Clinton’s election changed the financing of the environmental movement. From 1981 through 1992, environmental groups raised much of their money by charging that Republicans in the White House threatened the environment. With a Democrat as president, grassroots funding for environmental groups plummeted.



To make up the difference, most groups turned to foundation grants. But foundations demanded that the groups they funded all adopt the same strategy. Progressives took this opportunity to demand that their strategy — transferring power from on‐​the‐​ground forest managers to political appointees – be the one that was adopted. For example, they opposed recreation fees because, with everything controlled from Washington, they didn’t think they needed to rely on incentives.



The progressive goal was not environmental protection but government control. They believed they knew how every acre of land in the country should be managed, which forests should be cut, which crops should be planted on which farms, and how many urbanites should live in apartments instead of single‐​family homes.



The constitutional rights and personal desires of property owners, the expertise of public land managers, and the housing preferences of homebuyers were unimportant compared with the greater good that could be achieved through central control of our natural resources.



When free‐​market environmentalists showed that most environmental problems could be solved with better incentives, progressives latched onto climate change as the one issue that demanded complete government control. “Climate change is a collective problem that demands collective action,” enthuses Naomi Klein, and it “supercharges the pre‐​existing case for virtually every progressive demand on the books.”



Giving government power to solve a problem is not the same as actually solving the problem. Instead, that government is more likely to make the problem worse as it abuses its power. Klein’s own proposals for climate change — “subways, streetcars and light‐​rail … everywhere” and high‐​density “housing along those transit lines” — will have practically no effect on climate but devastating effects on our economy.



Air, water, wildlife, forests, and other things we call “the environment” are precious and deserve our care. But freedom is also precious. The most important lesson of my four decades as an environmentalist is that you can’t have one without the other.

"Deforestation of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil is at its highest rate in a decade, according to new satellite data. This comes after president Jair Bolsonaro has loosened environmental regulations, cut enforcement budgets, and supported further development in the region.  Trees absorb carbon dioxide naturally, and are one of best tools we have to help stave off climate catastrophe – and the Amazon itself is a crucial carbon sink. This means responding to deforestation in Brazil has become a matter of international responsibility. The primary purpose of the United Nations is to maintain international peace and security. With climate breakdown already causing conflict and undermining human security, it’s hard to argue the UN should not get involved.  So what could it do about Brazil’s deforestation? My PhD research examines the intersection between environmental governance and the UN Security Council. The council is a legislative body designed to safeguard international peace and security – it’s made up of five permanent members and ten non-permanent (elected) members. I want to consider three options available to it: the support of international law; intervention through force; and sanctions.  Brazil was one of the 195 signatories to the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, which set global targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and keep global warming below 2℃ or ideally 1.5℃. Article 5 of the Agreement says that parties “should take action” to preserve forests due to their role as carbon sinks. The problem is the word “should”, which places very little legal obligation on parties. As part of the Paris Agreement, Brazil pledged to protect the Amazon through the restoration of 12m hectares of forest by 2030 (that’s an area roughly the size of England). The problem is Bolsonaro himself didn’t agree to the treaty. And although he has indicated Brazil will remain part of it, his policy thus far – strongly pro- development in the Amazon – means there is very little hope he will stick to the reforestation commitment.  In any case, the Paris Agreement lacks enforcement mechanisms – if Bolsonaro simply decides to ignore Article 5 and continue deforesting there is little the other signatories can do. In light of this the Security Council calling for the implementation of the Paris Agreement would have little tangible impact, and so we must consider other possibilities. It might sound drastic, but if international peace and security is under threat, this means the UN Security Council could intervene under Article 42 which authorises the use of force to halt those actions causing the menace. Force has been used in the past, for instance to create corridors of protection for people in warzones. Extending this idea, a UN force could be directed to provide a perimeter of protection around the Amazon and halt all deforestation activities. However, tanks and troops on the ground means invading a sovereign nation. It means saying dialogue is over. And crucially it rarely results in a clean resolution. Any intervention would likely be met with a response from the Brazilian military – which has hundreds of thousands of troops and the world’s 12th largest budget – and many lives would likely be lost. UN-backed military intervention must balance all this against the cost of inaction. Furthermore, military force also comes with massive environmental impacts and logistical challenges. It is not a credible response to deforestation. Under Article 41 of the UN Charter, the Security Council can impose sanctions to maintain or restore international peace and security. These sanctions are intended as non-military steps in order to coerce uncooperative governments or individuals. A comprehensive sanctions scheme can have significant impacts upon the internal situation of a country, forcing compliance with agreed international standards. But sanctions are not always successful and often have a major humanitarian impact. However the sort of broad brush approach that may have harmed ordinary people in Haiti, for example, is not the only option available – the Security Council could instead introduce targeted sanctions that have less collateral impact. In 1998 the UNSC targeted the exploitation of natural resources that was bankrolling conflict in Angola, and introduced Resolution 1173 which meant all states were obliged to ensure that any diamonds imported were sourced from an official certification scheme. Similar restrictions were also imposed on Sierra Leone, and a later resolution endorsed the Kimberly Scheme that aims to regulate the diamond trade. During the Liberian conflict in the early 2000s, the Security Council recognised that the timber trade was fuelling the situation. Through Resolution 1521 the import of all “round logs and timber products originating in Liberia” was prohibited. The sanction was successful: among other things, it encouraged Liberians with logging licences from the previous Charles Taylor regime to rethink their claim on the forests and begin a national dialogue. Applying this here, the Security Council could prohibit the sale of all Brazilian timber, and sanction all imports of beef reared in areas of deforestation. Some might argue this interferes with Brazilian sovereignty in a way that the above examples did not. And for all the faults of its current leader, and perhaps even its entire political class, the country remains more stable, and a more mature democracy, than the likes of Liberia or Angola during civil wars. It’s also considerably wealthier and more powerful.  Given all this, and the fact permanent members of the Security Council have veto powers, the introduction of sanctions seems a long way off. That said, history shows us that the Security Council and particularly the permanent members can rapidly change their position in response to a global event. Could climate change constitute such an event? Maybe, one day. Brazil’s actions indirectly undermine the stability and sovereignty of countries most affected by climate breakdown, and so, yes, sanctions are severe, but they are proportionate. Crucially they might encourage the Brazilian government to rethink its policy on deforestation."

With Tuesday’s election widely predicted to bring a near‐​historic shake‐​up of the political establishment, here are some things we can say for certain even before the first results are tallied: 
"
"
Share this...FacebookTwitterVarious reports are coming out claiming that Russian authorities have reduced the charges against the Arctic Sunrise activists from piracy to hooliganism.
Russia’s RT here reports the lesser hooliganism charge carries a maximum sentence of 7 years in prison.
‘The actions of those involved in the criminal case have been  reclassified to the charge of hooliganism,’ the spokesman for  the Investigative Committee, Vladimir Markin, told the RIA  Novosti news agency.”
There seem to be conflicting claims on how long the activists may have to spend time in jail if convicted of hooliganism. CTV news here reports that the charge carries 15 days in prison only.
The piracy charges carry a 15-year prison term, while hooliganism is usually punished by 15 days in jail or a fine.”
That is likely very inaccurate. Back in the 1980s a young nutjob German pilot Matthias Rust famously flew his small Cessna through then Soviet airspace and landed on Red Square in Moscow, embarrassing the Soviet empire. For that deed he was, according to Wikipedia, “sentenced to four years in a general-regime labor camp for hooliganism, disregard of aviation laws and breaching of the Soviet border. He was never transferred to a labor camp and instead served his time at the high security Lefortovo temporary detention facility in Moscow. Two months later, Reagan and Gorbachev agreed to sign a treaty to eliminate intermediate-range nuclear weapons in Europe, and the Supreme Soviet ordered Rust to be released in August 1988 as a goodwill gesture to the West.”
Should the activists be convicted of hooliganism, they’ll probably be sentenced to a couple of years and be out within a year or so. That probably won’t be long enough to teach a number of them a lesson. In fact, expect them to be given a hero’s welcome when they return. Barf! gag!

 **Dr Don Brash  
** Founding Member  
[Free Speech Coalition](https://www.freespeechcoalition.nz/donate?utm_campaign=190910_don_brash_ask&utm_medium=email&utm_source=freespeech)



As you know, last week the Free Speech Coalition were finally in court – standing up to the ‘thug’s veto’ enabled by Phil Goff and Auckland Council caving into protesters who threatened to disrupt a totally legal speaking event that was scheduled at a Council-owned venue.



 **But without any sense of irony, a comedian whose career has been based on jokes about racial stereotypes was leading the charge against us.** Apparently we picked the wrong cause…



In an opinion piece published across New Zealand in _Stuff_ newspapers, comedian Raybon Kan opined:



 ** _Don’t help white supremacists by fighting their legal battles_**



 _I’m not against free speech. That would be odd for a comedian. What I’m against is the Free Speech Coalition._



It is amazing how many people say they ‘support free speech’ but…



 _A year ago, when Canadian white supremacist trolls Stefan Molyneux and Lauren Southern were denied a venue booking by Auckland City Council, the Free Speech Coalition’s response wasn’t to giggle, or applaud, or high-five. Instead, this brought the Free Speech Coalition into existence. Politically disparate individuals – well-known, educated people – suddenly danced in sync, a flashmob, assembling as if Avengers for the Canadian pair._



The first of many errors. It wasn’t that the council wouldn’t take the booking, **the council de-platformed** the Canadians after “Auckland Peace Action” kicked up a fuss and the Mayor got involved.



 _Don Brash. Chris Trotter. Stephen Franks. Jordan Williams. Lindsay Perigo. Paul Moon. Ashley Church. David Cumin. Melissa Derby. Rachel Poulain. I hope I didn’t leave anyone out._



 _Literally overnight, these people managed to find each other’s phone numbers, incorporate an organisation, hire a web developer, open a bank account, and set up a crowdfunding site – all to raise money to sue Auckland Council over a couple of cackling white supremacists. Overnight._



This ‘name and shame’ tar brush of ‘white supremacy’ isn’t even advocacy. I am proud that a dozen or so of us got together for a worthy cause, and that such a broad range of Kiwis have financially supported the coalition and made this work possible.



 _To the Free Speech Coalition, a venue cancellation for white supremacists was a moral emergency. It couldn’t think of anything more urgent._



 _The coalition didn’t spend this time making a sandwich for a homeless person. It didn’t plant a tree._



 _It didn’t even bake a cake, just so a dog nearby could perk up at the scent. Instead, the group went and bought fresh art supplies to paint a dollar-sign smile on the faces of white supremacists._



 _In my view, the Free Speech Coalition would have contributed more to society, this entire year, if it had just got in a room, cranked up Pornhub, and gone for it ambidextrously till exhaustion._



Unlike Raybon Kan, you and I understand that this issue was never about the controversial speakers. I can honestly say that I had never even heard of Stefan Molyneux and Lauren Southern prior to Phil Goff getting up on his high horse and claiming that he had banned them.



 **The Free Speech Coalition and the litigation effort was always about protecting the principle: we can’t let the protesting mob, or opportunistic politicians, be the decision-makers about who you and I can (and cannot) hear from.**



 _Let’s talk about free speech. Fine, OK, whatever – racists, white supremacists, Nazis – they probably, maybe, do have the right to free speech._



 _But don’t tell them that. And certainly don’t pay a lawyer to tell them that._



 _Helpful tip: whenever the opportunity arises to be of assistance to white supremacists, look away, cough, and cross the street. That’s the least you can do, morally._



This is the cheap shot in the article. **The whole point of defending free speech is defending the rights of the very speakers you do not necessarily agree with, or even find repugnant. Otherwise, you’re not really defending free speech at all.**



Raybon goes on:



 _[…] On TV, Chris Trotter quoted Voltaire: “I find what you say repugnant, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.”_



 _I say: pick something better to die for. The Amazon is on fire. Kids are hungry. Berms need mowing. My to-do list is a three-volume trilogy, and even so, the financial and emotional sponsorship of white supremacists doesn’t quite make the cut._



 _If you find someone’s views repugnant, don’t help them plug in speakers and turn up the volume._



 _If you find someone’s views repugnant, don’t buy them ink to print out their manifesto._



 _Don’t search for the most repugnant deplorables, to lend them moral support._



 _Don’t make their victory your victory._



 _Pick a side.[…]_



Radio NZ’s coverage of the court case was equally disappointing in playing the politics rather than the principle. Having sat in court for two days listening to interesting legal arguments, our state broadcaster took similarly cheap shots:



 ** _NZ’s right-wing turn up in force for controversial free speech case_**



 _For the past two days room eight in Auckland’s High Court has been home to some of the country’s notable right-wing figures, who are bent on affirming the speaking rights of two controversial Canadians._



 _The man behind the Orewa speech, Don Brash, made an appearance yesterday, and Jordan Williams from the Taxpayers’ Union has been listening intently in the public gallery, a few seats down from a man in a MAGA (Make Ardern Go Away) hat._



 _Old Conservative Party leader Colin Craig also poked his head around the door at one point, although he was in the building for another reason – to face defamation action brought by a former party colleague._



 _On the court documents, University of Auckland anaesthesiology lecturer David Cumin is listed as one applicant, would-be Dunedin Mayor, climate change denier, Donald Trump supporter and rare books dealer Malcolm Moncrief-Spittle the other._



So what? If someone was taking objection to Raybon Kan’s jokes about race, it would probably be left-wing figures at the back of the court. And of course, I am taking a keen interest in this case – I was stopped from speaking at Massey University on the same sort of ‘health and safety’ ~~excuses~~ grounds that the Auckland council and mayor are trying to use.



As you can see we’re up against a media and establishment that just don’t get it. They prefer cheap shots to try and bully and marginalise our cause, because they are confident (I would argue, very naively!) that they themselves will not be in the gun. 



**So protecting free speech relies on our work continuing and your financial support so the Free Speech Coalition can continue to fight for free speech in New Zealand.** We will even stand up for people we disagree with – like Raybon Kan.



 **So I am asking you to take up Raybon’s invitation at the end of his article and pick a side.**



Pick the side of free speech by making a donation to the Free Speech Coalition so we can continue our work fighting for the cause.

"Every few years the ideals of Ebenezer Howard’s garden city utopia are resurrected in an attempt by the UK government to create new communities, and address the country’s housing crisis. Sometimes this takes the form of new towns or eco-towns, and sometimes proposals for an actual garden city are put forward – as in the last budget.  Rather than just rolling out this romantic terminology, we should take a closer look at garden city ideals and how they can be adopted to make the proposed Ebbsfleet development a success. Several years ago my colleague Michael Edwards presciently forecast the current problems in the Thames Gateway where Ebbsfleet falls, with a dominance of private development that does little to provide for local employment and walkable communities. He outlined the need to return to funding principles similar to the garden city model, where development trusts retain freeholds on the land. This model, based on investment in infrastructure and services, is a fundamental principle that shifts from short-term returns to a long-term relationship created between the collective or public landowner and local inhabitants.  Despite the fact that the garden city was a highly influential model throughout the first half of the 20th century, ultimately leading to the establishment of some key settlements in the UK, US and elsewhere in the world, it has had few genuine successes. After World War II, similar utopian dreams of creating model communities, with decent housing surrounding a well-designed centre, met with the reality. British reformer William Beveridge famously summed them up for having “no gardens, few roads, no shops and a sea of mud”. You’d be forgiven for thinking that past lessons would be applied to the next generation of housing. But, even the post-war housing plans – though inspired by the garden city movement of the interwar periods – failed to plan the new housing in relation to transport, employment and public services such as shops and schools. While UK government reports have tried to draw lessons from both their positive and negative aspects, they have also been criticised in more recent reports, for lacking a sense of community – although it should also be said that “community” takes time to develop and cannot be “designed” as such. Many of the challenges of creating new communities are bound up in the spatial separation between newcomers and older inhabitants, a lack of social infrastructure, such as doctor’s surgeries and schools, and difficulties that stem from long commutes, such as lower net income and the strain this has on families. Ruth Durant found this in her 1939 study of Burnt Oak on the outskirts of London.  Early post-war new towns were similarly criticised for their very slow build-up of health services, higher schooling, cultural facilities and decent shopping facilities, although some did better with the provision of local employment, due to many people moving to the towns with a local job linked to their housing. With shifts in the industrial economy, such beneficial connections between home and work (one of the tenets of the garden city) reduced over time. The challenges today are slightly different, however. People live more mobile and fragmented lives and are arguably less likely to be tied to place as was the case for the primarily working-class (and manual labouring) communities of the past. This poses the risk that community will be lost because of how transient people can be. But increased mobility and social interaction don’t have to be mutually exclusive. Indeed, a lack of mobility is the worst problem that can be imposed on a community: both work and leisure must be accessible to people. Plus, with the advent of the internet and grass-roots activism, connections can traverse space more easily. This has allowed movements such as the Transition Network, which brings communities together around sustainable issues, to blossom. UCL’s EPSRC funded Adaptable Suburbs project has studied the evolution of London’s outer suburban towns over the past 150 years, providing some clues on what has made for the relative success of the original garden cities over other planned settlements. It is clear that their success has been dependent on excellent transport connections, coupled with the provision of local employment and access to employment at a commutable distance.  Also important is the provision of a mixed-use town centre, giving a destination for a wide variety of activities in addition to retail: community activities, schools, leisure and cultural uses. Centres work well when connected to the street network, accessible by foot, bicycle, public and private transport. This multi-functional design has helped even the smallest of centres to sustain themselves through the most recent economic recession. A recent government report, “Understanding High Street Performance”, also found that successful town centres are “characterised by considerable diversity and complexity, in terms of scale, geography and catchment, function and form … [as] a result, the way in which they are affected by and respond to change is diverse and varied”.  It is almost impossible to predict how society will change in the future, particularly as new technologies have the power to change how people connect and build community. But what is evident is that here lies another essential aspect of building successful communities: in allowing for places to adapt to change.  This needs to be a foundational aspect of the government’s new cities – simply invoking the phrase “garden city” is not enough. By building places with sufficient flexibility of buildings, infrastructure and uses, coupled with links that allow for local and wider-scale trips to take place, with the necessary long-term financial investment, we can start to create places that will successfully weather the future."

"**The UK's high level of obesity has fuelled a much-increased death rate from Covid-19, says the former chief medical officer for England.**
Prof Dame Sally Davies said high obesity rates - and high levels of deprivation and overcrowded housing - had cost lives.
The poor state of public health meant it was not surprising that the UK had struggled during the pandemic.
Dame Sally called for tougher policies to combat obesity.
She said: ""The fact that we are one of the fattest nations in the developed world has undoubtedly led to more deaths than we should have had.
""Our poor public health - whether it is deprivation, overweight, or other chronic illnesses, alongside crowding in urban areas - have led to a much increased death rate over what we could have had if we had a healthier basic population.""
The UK became the first country in Europe to pass 50,000 coronavirus deaths earlier this month.
Dame Sally said stricter recent restrictions had reduced social encounters and so brought down coronavirus infections.
But she added that she expected a third wave of the virus, possibly in the New Year, and that it was going to be a difficult winter.
Dame Sally left her role as the government's chief medical adviser to become head of Cambridge University's Trinity College a few months before Covid-19 struck.
She has co-authored a book arguing for more effective measures to promote healthier living. Among the measures she supports are taxes on foods high in salt or sugar.
She said: ""It is incontrovertible that if you are overweight - particularly if you are obese - you increase your risk of death.
""All of the diseases associated with overweight, whether it is hypertension, diabetes or others, increase the risk of getting very ill.
""Clearly it is terribly important that we sort out obesity and overweight to improve the health of the nation.""
She said that while average life expectancy in the UK had increased, the average number of years of healthy life had not, and among the most deprived sections of the population it had come down.
The UK government unveiled a plan to tackle rates of obesity in July, which included a ban on ""buy one get one free"" deals on unhealthy food in England, restrictions on where foods high in fat and sugar can be promoted in-store, and new rules for displaying calories on menus.
There will also be a national campaign to help people lose weight and eat more healthily, a consultation on whether to stop fast food adverts online altogether, and a review of traffic light labelling on food and drinks sold in shops.
Dame Sally Davies has made very few comments about the Covid-19 pandemic.
She has been understandably keen not to tread on the toes of her successor Chris Whitty.
She knows that any future review of the government's handling of the coronavirus crisis will partly cover her time as chief medical adviser.
But she has always been passionate about the need to improve health and wellbeing and implement tough anti-obesity policies.
So her broader arguments about the vulnerability of the UK population to Covid because of long-standing structural health inequalities is consistent with her stated views when in Whitehall.
It is a sobering thought that more people died in the UK with coronavirus than in many other leading industrialised nations because of poor underlying health.
Dame Sally has the issue out there for others to consider as they look for lessons to be learned. With her put stature and experience, the message cannot be ignored."
"Hunched against the wind in Tasmania’s central highlands are the floral relics of the last ice age. Walking among them, armed with a large pole and a cloth bag, is James Wood, the coordinator of the Tasmanian seed bank. It is the first time in five years that Tasmania’s 1,000-year-old conifers have seeded, and he is determined not to miss it. It is the third week of April. A coronavirus outbreak has occurred in Tasmania’s north-west, causing the premier to close two regional hospitals and place 5,000 health workers and their families in quarantine. And Wood is walking a deserted stretch of the Overland Track, alone but for Justin Dyer, his guide from the Tasmanian Walking Company, in search of stands of pencil pines, or Athrotaxis cupressoides.  On an ordinary day, the Overland Track carries 60 hikers. But the national parks are closed and travel banned due to the coronavirus, so for five days Wood and Dyer see no one except for a few park rangers, dozens of pademelons (a squat, short-tailed wallaby) and a hungry platypus that ignored them in favour of hunting in a tarn, two humans being no competition to the lure of a full belly. “It was just incredibly quiet,” Wood says. “You do get this feeling of real privilege that you’re getting that place pretty much to yourself.” The pencil pines are one of five species of conifer endemic to Tasmania’s high country, the most well-known of which are king billy pines (Athrotaxis selaginoides). They are the last remnants of the Gondwana forest, from a genus that is at least 150m years old. The trees are not listed as threatened because they are not uncommon within their ecosystems, but that could change any given summer. Stands of pencil pines and cheshunt pines at Lake Mackenzie were destroyed when a fire raced down the Devil’s Gullet in 2016. Stands of king billy pines were also lost. “The reality is that if fire frequency increases in these upland areas, and that seems very likely, that could change very quickly,” Wood says. “So what we are trying to do here is act preemptively and get seed collections in place when we can.” The Tasmanian pines are more dispersed and their habitat wilder, making a rescue effort like that which saved the ancient Wollomi pines in the New South Wales Blue Mountains this summer more difficult. “It does make them very vulnerable,” Wood says. Pencil pines and other Athrotaxis produce seeds only every few years, as part of a global masting event that triggers sudden seed production in unrelated plants around the world. The last masting event was in 2015. The trigger, says Wood, appears to be two successively hotter summers, although there’s no consensus on the exact cause. This year the seeding was “patchy”, with pencil pines on higher and drier areas not producing pine cones, and cheshunt pines, which often grow nearby, not seeding at all. It means that while Tasmania will likely deliver on the prerequisite for hotter summers, due to the climate emergency, the accompanied drying out of the highlands could leave the pencil pines too stressed to seed. That is why the 2020 masting was so important. An ambitious plan involving teams of volunteers, visiting specialists from the Royal Botanic Gardens in Edinburgh, helicopters and arborists was formed in December and tree enthusiasts on Facebook were mobilised to monitor conifer flowering. Those plans were spiked when the pandemic was declared, and Wood got permission for the two-person operation focused just on the pencil pines. Pencil pines are particularly tricky for seed gatherers, because they grow in the wild as suckers. “Most of the stands of the trees that you see in Tasmania are all clonal,” Wood says. “They sucker from their roots and spread that way so large strands of trees generally have only a couple of individuals. You may see several hundred trees but there may be only a dozen or less individuals in that stand.” They walked 70km over the five days, gathering two handfuls of pine cones from each of the 46 stands visited to ensure the seeds collected were genetically diverse. At the end, the bank was 8,000 seeds richer. “Unfortunately we have missed all the other opportunities we had,” Wood says. “Hopefully when the next masting event takes place those stands will still be there and still be happy.”"

"June was hot. Really hot. That much we knew. What we didn’t know was just how hot it was – not just in parts of Europe, but around the world. New analysis by the EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service, with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, shows that temperature records weren’t just broken for Europe – they were completely obliterated. The previous European record for June, set in 1999, was smashed to bits – not just by a fraction of a degree, but by a full 1.0℃. It was also the hottest June the world has ever recorded, with the entire globe experiencing the warmest-ever June by 0.1℃. As parts of Britain sweltered in a single day of heat over the weekend, France recorded its highest-ever temperature of 45.9℃. And even though the early part of June wasn’t as warm, the “Saharan bubble” that rose up and sat over south-western Europe led to parts of Spain, Italy, Germany, France, Austria, Switzerland and the Czech Republic recording average five-day temperatures that were up to 10℃ hotter than you’d expect at this time of the year. But spare a thought for people on the Indian subcontinent. Before the monsoon brought some relief – and then widespread flooding – parts of the northern Indian state of Rajasthan had to cope with weeks of temperatures above 45℃, with maximums above 50℃ in some places. Is this climate change? What we scientists can say with absolute confidence is that as the world heats up, potentially lethal heatwaves will become more common in many parts of the world, including Europe. That’s not to say we can’t study the effects of climate change on individual events. But we must be careful in how we interpret the findings of such studies. A rapid “attribution study” published on Tuesday has suggested that France’s heatwave at the end of June was made five times more likely as a result of climate change. Doing such a fast attribution study, in a timeframe during which the heat is still on for some parts of Europe, is commendable stuff. For many people, leaders and politicians included, memories of the stifling impacts are still fresh. But it’s important to highlight the many caveats and self-professed limitations that come with this type of study. The atmospheric and climate systems that create heatwaves are fiendishly complicated. Accounting for all the drivers of June’s heatwave will take time and an immense amount of data crunching by some of the world’s most powerful supercomputers. They will have to consider all the various influences: the path of the jet stream, the temperature of the oceans, the movement of wind and formation of clouds. Crucially, they will have to do the calculations both with and without the impact of human-influenced climate change. So much for the science. As a scientist, this is what I’m expected to say. And yet, this weekend as I sat in my garden, listening to Glastonbury on the radio and watching my children trying to keep cool in the paddling pool, I was overcome for the first time with a feeling I could not shake off. Guilt, and fear. Guilt, that by being too scientific about these things, I don’t have enough passion and impetus to do everything I can about it. And fear for the future we are leaving for my children. For all our children. So what’s to be done? It’s clear that whatever we decide to do, the extreme weather we’ve seen in recent days is going to be a part of all our futures. In Europe, we will have to change how we behave to cope with heatwaves. We will have to change how we build our homes, schools and hospitals to protect the people who are most vulnerable. And we need to provide people everywhere with more accurate and earlier warnings of oncoming hazards of every type, to give people the best chance to prepare.

"**Covid-19 could be causing lung abnormalities still detectable more than three months after patients are infected, researchers suggest.**
A study of 10 patients at Oxford University used a novel scanning technique to identify damage not picked up by conventional scans.
It uses a gas called xenon during MRI scans to create images of lung damage.
Lung experts said a test that could spot long-term damage would make a huge difference to Covid patients.
The xenon technique sees patients inhale the gas during a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan.
Prof Fergus Gleeson, who is leading the work, tried out his scanning technique on 10 patients aged between 19 and 69.
Eight of them had persistent shortness of breath and tiredness three months after being ill with coronavirus, even though none of them had been admitted to intensive care or required ventilation, and conventional scans had found no problems in their lungs.
The scans showed signs of lung damage - by highlighting areas where air is not flowing easily into the blood - in the eight who reported breathlessness.
The results have prompted Prof Gleeson to plan a trial of up to 100 people to see if the same is true of people who had not been admitted to hospital and had not suffered from such serious symptoms. He is planning to work with GPs to scan people who have tested positive for Covid-19 across a range of age groups.
The aim is to discover whether lung damage occurs and if so whether it is permanent, or resolves over time.
He said: ""I was expecting some form of lung damage, but not to the degree that we have seen.""
The risk of severe illness and death increases markedly for the over 60s. But if the trial discovers that the lung damage occurs across a wider age group and even in those not requiring admission to hospital ""it would move the goalposts,"" according to Prof Gleeson.
He believes the lung damage identified by the xenon scans may be one of the factors behind long Covid, where people feel unwell for several months after infection.
The scanning technique was developed by a research group at the University of Sheffield led by Prof James Wild who said it offered a ""unique"" way of showing lung damage caused by Covid-19 infection and its after-effects.
""In other fibrotic lung diseases we have shown the methods to be very sensitive to this impairment and we hope the work can help understand Covid-19 lung disease.""
Dr Shelley Hayles is a GP based in Oxford involved in helping set up the trial. She believes that up to 10% of those who have had Covid-19 might have some form of lung damage which is leading to prolonged symptoms.
""We're now at more than one and a quarter million who have been infected - and 10% of that is a lot of people,"" she said.
""When medical staff tell patients that they don't know what's wrong with them and they don't know how to sort the symptoms out, it's very stressful.
""With most patients, even if the news isn't great, they want the diagnosis.""
That is true of Tim Clayden, who spent his 60th birthday at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford with Covid symptoms that were so severe he believed that he would die. Fortunately he recovered but remains weary to this day. Tim was frustrated not knowing why he wasn't recovering to full health.
He said that he was simultaneously concerned and relieved when he received one of Prof Gleeson's scans which showed that his lungs were damaged.
""It does help knowing that there is an issue with your lungs,"" he says.
""I now know what it is. I know the origin of it. What I don't know, because no one does, is whether it is permanent or if it will pass. But I'd rather know than not know.""
Dr Samantha Walker, director of research and innovation at Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation, said: ""This is an interesting investigation and it's important that post-Covid lung damage is looked into further and on a larger scale so we can better understand the longer term damage caused.
""If further investigation shows that lung damage occurs, it could enable the development of a test that can measure lung damage caused by Covid-19 which would make a huge difference to many people with 'long covid' respiratory issues and also allow specific treatments to be developed.""

"A few years ago, convincing meat-free “meat” was nothing more than a distant dream for most consumers. Meat substitutes in supermarkets lacked variety and quality. Plant-based burgers were few and far between in major fast food outlets – and meaty they were not. But realistic alternatives to environmentally damaging meat are now big business – and global fast food chains are finally starting to take notice. Burger King has announced that after a hugely successful trial, it will roll out its partnership with plant-based meat company Impossible Foods across the US. McDonalds recently introduced the similarly meaty Big Vegan TS in its outlets in Germany, one of its five largest international markets. Now finally able to produce meat-free imitations that are for many indistinguishable from their beefy counterparts, the rapidly growing industry appears set to make serious waves in the once impregnable bastions of cheap meat. In so doing, it could kickstart a rapid decline in meat’s contribution to the climate crisis – driven not just by a global minority of vegans and vegetarians, but by millions of meat-eaters too. Thanks to rising interest in food technology from Silicon Valley’s start-up scene, such indistinguishable vegan meat came on the menu a little over five years ago.
Helped by huge investments, sophisticated marketing, and a friendly regulatory environment, US companies leaped to the forefront of vegan meat innovation. Products such as the Impossible Burger and the Beyond Burger soon entered into many smaller US restaurants and fast food outlets, before Burger King made it widely available across the country. In contrast, for a long time, tighter food regulations in Europe stifled meatless meat innovation. Thanks to the European Union’s precautionary principle, companies face much more stringent checks to show that new ingredients and foods aren’t harmful before they can go on sale. Quorn, a low-cost meat substitute that is now a household name, took almost ten years to be approved as a legitimate foodstuff, because its use of fungi was unprecedented. These tight regulations also stipulate that genetically modified ingredients have to be labelled, which may explain why the widely heralded Impossible Burger – which uses genetically modified yeast to produce the blood-like plant protein that tastes so much like beef – has not yet landed in European countries.

      What makes the Impossible Burger look and taste like real beef?


 Combined with differences in language, food culture and investment climate across European states, innovative start-ups looking to bring high-quality meat analogues took longer to thrive in Europe. But while the US may have had a head-start in high-quality vegan meat innovation, it may surprise you to know that plant-based alternatives are much more popular in parts of Europe. While some European states such as France, Portugal and Switzerland are yet to warm to fake meat, the average Briton (750g) or Swede (725g) consumed nearly twice as many meat alternatives in 2018 as in the US (350g), where vegan meats are have typically been more realistic and thus higher-priced than in much of Europe.  With the market growing at times by orders of magnitude as traditional meat-eaters switched on to plant-based products, it was only a matter of time before major European companies started cottoning on to the potential of high-quality meat imitations. In 2017, McDonald’s was quick to roll out a vegan burger, the McVegan, at its restaurants in Finland and Sweden. But it was not designed to closely resemble meat, and was marketed primarily at vegans. In the UK, where more than half of British people have either already reduced or are considering reducing their meat consumption, Greggs decided to blaze the trail. Having only last year considered vegan sausage rolls “too difficult” a proposition, they are now returning record profits thanks to an offering so popular that the bakery has struggled to keep up with demand. In traditionally meaty Germany, meat alternatives were practically non-existent ten years ago. But Germans now aren’t far off the USA in fake meat consumption, thanks in part to prominent processed meat brands entering the market. It’s no coincidence that McDonald’s in Germany has since decided to partner with Nestlé, a new major player in the meatless meat game, to offer a vegan burger there. If news of out-of-reach vegan burgers is giving you food envy, there is no need to worry. Different cultures, tastes, prices and administrative hurdles mean that developments will not happen everywhere at the same time. But in the next couple of years, expect to see a lot more plant-based meat coming to fast food chains near you. Realistic chicken imitations have thus far proved difficult to master, but KFC plans to trial a vegan version of its chicken fillet burger from June 17. Meanwhile Burger King is already exploring how best to bring its vegan burger to Europe. And, given the whopping 30% increase in sales brought by the Impossible Whopper, McDonald’s and Nestlé are already considering expanding their partnership beyond Germany. Crucially, these fast-food vegan meats are not just aimed at vegans and vegetarians, but meat-lovers too, who still make up the vast majority of the country populations across the world. The Impossible Whopper, for example, is marketed not as a planet-saving treat, but a healthier way to enjoy the same meaty taste their customers are used to. Some vegans baulk at the idea of replicating the taste of animal flesh – but the bigger picture is that such products will play a major role in realising projections that the majority of “meat” will not come from dead animals by 2040.  Taste and health still far outweigh concern for the environment and animal welfare as factors that determine whether people are willing to purchase plant-based meat. By tapping into these, vegan meat can massively reduce the hefty emissions burden and animal suffering caused by animal agriculture. Bring on the vegan meat revolution, I say."

Americans take religious liberty for granted. Unfortunately, this most fundamental freedom of conscience and action is not protected in many other countries around the world. 



State repression is the most obvious assault on religious faith. Today Christians face the death penalty in Afghanistan and Pakistan in prosecutions for converting from Islam and allegedly blaspheming Mohammed, respectively.



But the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom warns that “a second and equally egregious threat to religious freedom” is the failure “to punish religiously motivated violence perpetrated by private actors.” In this case public officials become accomplices to often brutal private violations of religious liberty.



The U.S. government’s ability to promote any kind of human rights in other nations is obviously limited. Nevertheless, religious liberty is the proverbial canary in the mine. If a state won’t respect this most basic freedom of conscience, it isn’t likely to respect people’s lives and dignity in any context. 



Unfortunately, there is more than enough bad news to fill the USCIRF’s latest annual report. The Commission focused on 28 countries. Worst were conditions in the 13 “countries of particular concern.” This rogue’s gallery is made up of Burma, China, Eritrea, Iran, Iraq, Nigeria, North Korea, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam.



 **Burma:** In this poor Southeast Asian nation, explains the panel, “Religious freedom violations affect every religious group.” Christians and other religious minorities have suffered the worst. House churches were essentially outlawed last year, following a prohibition of meetings in unregistered venues the previous year. 



Moreover, notes the USCIRF, “In ethnic minority areas, where low‐​intensity conflict has been waged for decades, the Burmese military forcibly promotes Buddhism and seeks to control the growth of Protestantism by intimidating and harassing adherents.” The junta’s periodic brutal campaigns have “destroyed religious venues, actively promoted conversion to Buddhism, confiscated land, and mandated forced labor. The Chin, Naga, Kachin, Shan, Karen, and Karenni peoples, each with sizable Christian populations, have been the primary targets of these abuses.”



Moreover, the regime routinely interferes with Buddhism, the country’s dominant faith. After large‐​scale protests in 2007, “the regime also began systematically to repress Burmese Buddhists, closing monasteries, arresting and defrocking monks, and curtailing their public religious activities.” Many of those arrested and detained “have reported torture, forced defrocking, hard labor, and other deprivations.”



 **China:** Although Beijing has been attempting to calm international fears about its rise, China’s leaders have been exhibiting their fear of religion. Reports the Commission: “The Chinese government strictly controls all religious practice and represses religious activity outside state‐​approved organizations. Some Chinese citizens can assemble to worship and conduct charitable projects within government‐​approved parameters. Unregistered religious groups, or those deemed by the government to threaten national security or social harmony, face severe violations, including fines, confiscation of property, imprisonment, and the destruction of religious sites. Religious freedom conditions for Tibetan Buddhists and Uighur Muslims are the worst they have been in the past ten years.”



Even members of officially‐​sanctioned churches “are not safe from harassment, detentions, and arrest due to the arbitrary nature of Chinese law an policy regarding religion,” notes the USCIRF. Unofficial groups are at far greater risk. “Though the total number of arrest and imprisonments declined in the past year, government efforts to suppress the growth and activities of ‘house church’ Protestants continue to be systematic and intense.” Perhaps most virulent has been the sustained campaign against the Falun Gong. 



**Eritrea:** This North African nation has been turned into a totalitarian hellhole by home grown revolutionaries, who suppress all freedoms indiscriminately. The regime recognizes but four religious groupings, and even their adherents are not safe.



According to the Commission: “Systematic, ongoing and egregious religious freedom violations continue in Eritrea. These violations include: arbitrary arrests and detentions without charge of members of unregistered religious groups; torture or other ill‐​treatment of religious prisoners, sometimes resulting in death; a prolonged ban on public religious activities by all unrecognized religious groups; closure by the authorities of the places of worship of these groups; inordinate delays on registration applications from religious groups; and the disruption of private religious gatherings and social events of members of unregistered groups.”



 **Iran:** Explains the USCIRF: “The government of Iran continues to engage in systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of religious freedom, including prolonged detention, torture, and executions based primarily or entirely upon the religion of the accused.” Under political pressure, the regime “has increasingly manipulated the reach of its religious laws to silence, and in some cases put to death, Shi’a Muslims simply for exercising their internationally protected rights to freedom of expression and freedom of thought, conscience, and religion or belief.”



Nevertheless, most vulnerable to repression are religious minorities: Christians, Jews, Zoroastrians, Sunni Muslims, and especially Baha’is. The latter are viewed as heretics and treated accordingly.



 **Iraq:** The Commission details how Christians and other religious minorities suffered after the U.S. invasion: “Systematic, ongoing, and egregious religious freedom violations continue in Iraq. Members of the country’s smallest religious minorities still suffer from targeted violence, threats, and intimidation, against which they receive insufficient government protection.” These smaller communities “also experience a pattern of official discrimination, marginalization, and neglect,” while religious violence continues between Sunnis and Shiites.



Most striking is the veritable destruction of Iraq’s Christian community, which predates the arrival of Islam. The original population of 1.4 million is down to about 500,000. The USCIRF quotes “Christian leaders warning that the result of this flight may be ‘the end of Christianity in Iraq.’ ”



 **Nigeria:** An estimated 12,000 have died in sectarian violence over the last decade. Reports the USCIRF, “The government of Nigeria continues to respond inadequately and ineffectively to recurrent communal and sectarian violence.” The tragic result has been more violence: “Years of inaction by Nigeria’s federal, state and local governments as created a climate of impunity, resulting in thousands of deaths.”



Although Christians and Muslims share responsibility, violence has been concentrated in the Muslim‐​majority states to the north, where Sharia law has been widely imposed. The legislation is supposed to be applicable only to Muslims, but “some states in recent years have instituted or tolerated discriminatory practices based on religious precepts,” including bans on public religious activities, notes the USCIRF.



 **North Korea:** This probably is the most repressive state on earth. Observes the Commission: “The government controls most aspects of daily life, including religious activity, which is allowed only in government‐​operated religious ‘federations’ or in a small number of government‐​approved ‘house churches.’ Other public and private religious activity is prohibited. Anyone discovered engaging in clandestine religious activity is subject to discrimination, arrest, arbitrary detention, disappearance, torture, and public execution.”



 **Pakistan:** The Commission paints a dark picture: “Systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of freedom of religion or belief continue in Pakistan. Religiously discriminatory legislation, such as the anti‐​Ahmadi laws and blasphemy laws foster an atmosphere of intolerance. Sectarian and religiously‐​motivated violence is chronic, and the government has failed to protect members of religious minorities from such violence and to bring perpetrators to justice. Growing religious extremism threatens the freedoms of expression and religion or belief, as well as other human rights, for everyone in Pakistan, particularly women, members of religious minorities, and those in the majority Muslim community who hold views deemed un‐​Islamic by extremists.”



The blasphemy laws are routinely abused, resulting “in the lengthy detention of, and sometimes violence against,” religious minorities. Most frightening has been persistent sectarian violence.



 **Saudi Arabia:** This U.S. ally avidly promotes religious totalitarianism. The USCIRF points to “Systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of religious freedom continue in Saudi Arabia.” Forget King Abdullah’s liberalizing pretensions: “the Saudi government persists in banning all forms of public religious expression other than that of the government’s own interpretation of one school of Sunni Islam and also interferes with private religious practice.” Despite official promises to tolerate expatriate workers worshipping in their homes, the government’s religious police regularly raid such gatherings and arrest non‐​Muslims. Lengthy imprisonment and torture await those arrested for religious offenses.



 **Sudan:** With the end of Sudan’s civil war, the situation has improved in south Sudan, where Christians and animists predominate. But religious persecution remains distressingly common.



Reports the Commission: “Systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of freedom of religion or belief continue to occur in Sudan. Violations include: the efforts by the Arab Muslim‐​dominated government in Khartoum to impose Sharia on Muslims and non‐​Muslims alike; governmental promotion of Sudan’s identity as being Arab and Muslims, thus effectively relegating non‐​Aras and non‐​Muslims to a secondary status in the society; the criminalization of conversion from Islam, a crime punishable by death, and the intense scrutiny, intimidation, and even torture of suspected converts by government security personnel; the denial of the rights of non‐​Muslims to public religious expression and persuasion, while allowing Muslims to proselytize; and the difficulty in obtaining permission to build churches, as compared to government funding of mosque construction.”



 **Turkmenistan:** Human rights have improved in recent years, but abuses remain rife. According to the USCIRF, the country’s religious law includes: “intrusive registration criteria; the requirement that the government be informed of all financial support received from abroad; a ban on worship in private homes and the public wearing of religious garb except by religious leaders; and severe and discriminatory restrictions on religious education.”



There is no recognition of conscientious objectors. The government interferes with internal church governance. Unregistered religious groups face systematic legal disabilities. Production of religious literature is banned. Worse, “in recent years, members of religious communities, including Muslims, Protestants, Jehovah’s Witnesses and a Hare Krishna, reportedly received prison terms or were sent into internal exile due to their religious convictions.”



 **Uzbekistan:** Reports the Commission: “The Uzbek government harshly penalizes individuals for independent religious activity, regardless of their religious affiliation. A restrictive religion law severely limits the rights of all religious communities and facilitates the Uzbek government’s control over them, particularly the majority Muslim community.”



Religions must register with the government: “Unregistered religious congregations may be subject to massive fines and police raids, as well as threats of physical violence, detentions, and arrest.” Yet the authorities routinely refuse to accept registrations from disfavored churches, including Baptists, Jehovah’s Witnesses, Pentecostals, and others. The government also misuses laws against “extremism” to persecute the same groups, as well as Muslims. 



**Vietnam:** This communist state harshly restricts religious liberty. According to the USCIRF, the regime “continues to control government‐​approved religious communities, severely restrict independent religious practice, and repress individuals and groups viewed as challenging political authority.”



In fact, religious liberty is under sustained assault: “individuals continue to be imprisoned or detained for reasons related to their religious activity or religious freedom advocacy; police and government officials are not held fully accountable for abuses; independent religious activity remains illegal; legal protections for government‐​approved religious organizations are both vague and subject to arbitrary or discriminatory interpretations based on political factors; and new converts to some Protestant and Buddhist communities face discrimination and pressure to renounce their faith.” Moreover, the Commission charges that dozens of people remain in prison for their faith and religious rights advocates have been threatened and imprisoned.



The foregoing is a Dirty Baker’s Dozen of religious repression. But another dozen countries go on the “Watch List” — countries which engage in severe religious persecution, just not quite so bad.



Afghanistan is an American client state, but explains the USCIRF, “individuals lack protection to dissent from state‐​imposed orthodoxy.” Authoritarian Belarus has been compared to that of the Soviet Union. Cuba impedes and monitors religious organizations and harasses and arrests religious activists. In Egypt “Serious problems of discrimination, intolerance, and other human rights violations against members of religious minorities, as well as disfavored Muslims, remain widespread.”



The response of India’s central government to widespread communal violence and provincial discrimination remains inadequate. The problem is similar in Indonesia, where “sectarian violence, terrorism, and religious freedom violations” go unchallenged by local and regional officials. In Laos, provincial officials “severely violate the freedom of religion or belief, including detentions, surveillance, harassment, threats of property loss, forced relocations, and forced renunciations of faith.” In Russia religious liberty is shrinking along with political and civil freedoms. 



Religious minorities have suffered badly in the ongoing sectarian strife in Somalia. Tajikistan restricts all religious life. Turkey sharply limits public expression of religious faith while Christians have suffered from deadly Muslim assaults. In Venezuela there has been an increase in “government rhetoric, and in some cases government actions, against the Jewish and Catholic communities and certain Protestant groups.”



Finally, the Commission is monitoring three other countries where persecution remains a problem. Religious minorities fare poorly in Bangladesh. Kazakhstan has been moving backwards on religious liberty issues. Communal violence is common in Sri Lanka, and legislation has been proposed to criminalize conversion.



Washington’s ability to promote religious liberty overseas always will be limited. Nevertheless, religious persecution must be part of Washington’s human rights dialogue with other nations. Moreover, Americans should support and pray for those who are denied the right to worship freely. The oppressed must not be forgotten.

"**Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Monday evening. We'll have another update for you on Tuesday morning.**
Pubs, restaurants and cafes in Wales will be banned from serving alcohol from Friday \- and unable to open to customers beyond 18:00 GMT. First Minister Mark Drakeford said the rules - coming three weeks after the end of a 17-day firebreak lockdown - were a ""matter of deep regret"" but were needed to tackle a rise in cases, particularly among under-25s. Cinemas, bowling alleys and other indoor entertainment venues will also be shut. Read about the new restrictions here.
The government's Covid mass testing programme for England is to be expanded further, the health secretary has announced, suggesting it offers areas ""a faster way out of the toughest restrictions"". Speaking at a Downing Street briefing Matt Hancock cited the example of Liverpool, which will move down from tier three to tier two restrictions later this week. We take a closer look at so-called community testing and how it works.
Door-to-door carol singing should ""probably not"" take place in Scotland this Christmas, the country's national clinical director has suggested, amid concerns it could increase the risk of transmitting the virus through small droplets. Prof Jason Leitch was speaking after new advice for England said singing would be allowed in groups of up to six people. Meanwhile, Downing Street has confirmed that Santa's grottos will be allowed in England in those venues that are permitted to be open. If you are thinking about Christmas Day itself but confused about who you can see, take a look at our guide to the rules.
Shops in England will be allowed to stay open for 24 hours a day in the run-up to Christmas and in January, the communities secretary has said. Rules restricting opening hours will be able to be temporarily waived by local authorities - with the aim of both allowing a safer shopping experience and boost a sector hit hard by the pandemic. The announcement was welcomed by the British Retail Consortium but another business lobby group, UK Hospitality, described it as ""arbitrary and unfair"". Meanwhile, it has been suggested that drinkers in tier two areas of England could order just a Scotch egg with their pint to keep in line with post-lockdown rules.
Rita Ora has apologised after breaking lockdown rules in England to celebrate her 30th birthday. In an Instagram post, the singer says she made a ""misguided"" and ""spur of the moment"" decision to attend a party at a restaurant in west London on Saturday - reportedly attended by up to 30 people. Current lockdown regulations are in force until 00:01 GMT on Wednesday and mean you can only meet one other person outside.

"It is a challenging time to be 16 and, like his peers, Dara McAnulty must currently endure a form of house arrest that means no seeing friends, no GCSEs. Unlike other locked-down teens, McAnulty is also dealing with the harsh mischance of having his first book, Diary of a Young Naturalist, published during the coronavirus crisis. He was supposed to be touring festivals but every date is cancelled. “I feel like my being is suffering from a slow puncture,” McAnulty tweeted in March. “I honestly feel like my world is falling apart right now.” When we meet via a video call a month later, his mood has lifted. Lockdown is tough. His mum, Róisín – who McAnulty likes to have by his side, discreetly, during interviews – contracted coronavirus quite severely; meanwhile, he feels “trapped” and is “bouncing around the house like a ping pong ball”. Mercifully, over the road from their modern housing estate is a wood where he takes his daily exercise. “If I didn’t have it, I would be utterly insane,” he says. “The ground there is alive with peacock butterflies”, and that morning, he saw a red squirrel “so that makes the day”, he grins.  There is a genuine buzz around his debut, a combination of nature book and memoir, a warm portrait of a close-knit family and a coming-of-age story. Robert Macfarlane has hailed his “extraordinary voice and vision”; Chris Packham has become a friend; Steve Silberman, author of NeuroTribes, called him “inspiring”. The teenager’s environmental activism has led to comparisons with Greta Thunberg. McAnulty is autistic, and it would be easy to file his book alongside Packham’s Fingers in the Sparkle Jar which gave a vivid insight into the naturalist’s Asperger’s but Dara has his own style. Simple, gorgeous sentences unfurl, one after another. Of a hot summer’s day, he writes: “Dragonflies are whizzing, grasshoppers are trembling in the grass, and swallows are everywhere.” Or: “The valley sings, heaves and rests.” There are original, imaginative descriptions too – caterpillars move “like slow-motion accordions” and a goshawk chick looks “like an autumn forest rolled in the first snows of winter”. He lives with his dad, Paul, mum and younger siblings, Lorcan and Bláthnaid, in a small rented three-bedroom house in Castlewellan, Northern Ireland. As a young child, Dara loved to bang on about black holes to anyone who would listen, and was diagnosed as autistic when he was five. In fact, Róisín, Lorcan and Bláthnaid are also autistic; only Paul, a conservation scientist, is not. The teenager describes his family as “as close as otters”. They are also punk lovers, chaotic and “pretty formidable, apparently”. McAnulty exudes energy and laughs a lot. His voice, however, belongs to an older man, and his writing is often unexpectedly wise too. When I ask about literary inspiration, he answers immediately: Seamus Heaney. “You can reread his poems again and again”; there are “all these different compartments like bubbles. You pop them one at a time and there’s no centre to it. There’s this saying about a brain: if a brain was simple enough to understand, we’d be too stupid to understand that brain. That’s almost the same as Seamus Heaney’s poems because they have such complex connections.” He also enjoys reading Ursula K Le Guin, is currently “neck-deep” in his umpteenth rereading of The Lord of the Rings, and is fond of Agatha Christie for her focus on people’s hidden motives. “That’s been quite important to me because I try my best to learn about humans so I can make acceptable social interactions.” A teacher once told McAnulty he would never be able to string a paragraph together. He was miserable – “and miserable is an understatement” – at a succession of schools, including Oscar Wilde’s alma mater, Portora. The bullying (he didn’t know how to make small talk about Minecraft) intensified as he became a teenager. The noise and clutter of classrooms made them the worst environment for him. McAnulty learned that being in nature helped. “I can’t speak for all autistic people, but I feel things more intensely. In a shopping centre there’s all of those different noises coming from different angles – my brain can’t process them quickly enough, and everything goes completely crazy. Being out in nature, the sounds are quite level and I find it easier with muted colours. Everything just works. It’s not oppressive.” He wrote from a young age, on scraps of paper. “One of my ways of processing the world is writing things down,” he says. Then social media helped him find a path. Aged 12, he began a blog about nature and joined Twitter. “Four years ago I wouldn’t have been able to talk to you right now,” he says. “Twitter opened my world to like-minded people. You’ll always find someone who is willing to talk to you about mycelial networks. It’s given me so many opportunities to connect with people and not feel so isolated.” As McAnulty wrote, and also took his first steps in environmental activism – campaigning to end the persecution of birds of prey – his blog gained readers and admirers. Three years ago, he appeared on Springwatch and was befriended by Packham. Adrian Cooper and Gracie Burnett, the husband-and-wife team behind tiny independent publisher Little Toller spotted his writing and began talking to his family about a book. Diary of a Young Naturalist tells the story of McAnulty’s year from spring equinox to spring equinox, from his 14th to 15th birthday. It was a difficult time. His family moved from one side of Northern Ireland to the other and he had to cope with changing schools and losing his cherished wild heartlands, a forest called Big Dog. “When I was younger, I remember moving from a school I absolutely hated. Even though I wanted to get out of that place with every single fibre of my body, still, in the back of my mind, I was going: ‘I don’t want change.’” The move from Big Dog precipitated a breakdown, where McAnulty ended up screaming in panic in his garden. His struggles that summer were not helped by the rise of social media trolling (the downside of forging those positive connections). “Removing” himself from Big Dog “was devastating, as if it killed a part of me. Then I went up into the Mournes” – the mountain range close to his new home – “and everything became fine again.” Was his recovery as simple as that? “No, but it definitely helped discovering a new place and building up a new connection with the land. I slowly crawled my way back into some semblance of a calm state of mind. Exploring was a really big part of that, trying to find new places to root myself.” Writing was followed by a seven-month edit with Cooper and his parents. “All my family got together, trying to coax this book into something that was manageable,” says McAnulty. But Róisín says she wouldn’t want people to think his writing was overly shaped by others. “Although it has been edited sensitively and beautifully, the first draft was actually incredible.”  Rewriting was a mixed blessing for McAnulty, forcing him to “re-experience” memories both traumatic and joyful. “I uncovered things about myself along the way. It’s like reading a book for the second time. I had to drag myself back through that thornbush. But I understood myself all the better because of it.” After his breakdown, he started at a new school. Despite huge anxiety, in the book he finds kindred souls and a nurturing environment. “It has been the best school I’ve had,” he says. He still has to flee lessons at times but “I have, dare I say it, friends now, for the first time ever. I’ve had the best luck in the world … I managed to land myself in a year group that was basically made up of nerds.” McAnulty plans to take biology – his first love – alongside maths, chemistry and politics at A-level. He is currently writing a picture book for younger children and anticipates a career in conservation science. Activism takes up an increasing portion of his time. He runs a project to satellite-tag birds of prey, an eco group at school, and is prominent in his generation’s call for action over the climate and biodiversity crises. Although the British government last year became the first major economy to make a legal commitment to “net zero” carbon emissions by 2050, these are still only words, he believes, and his generation is becoming impatient. “We see a problem and we need to fix it. So when [politicians] don’t fix it and seem to be making excuses we get angrier and angrier.”  In the meantime, McAnulty keeps his family, and the simple glories of the natural world, close. His favourite time is dusk, when “the night sky seems to chase the sun out of the sky and you can’t really see the sun’s light but you know it’s just underneath the horizon,” he says. “At that time, the energy in the air is so charged. That’s when the bats begin to come out, and you feel such a rush.” • Diary of a Young Naturalist by Dara McAnulty is published by Little Toller (RRP £16). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com.

"The government faces a legal challenge over a set of “outdated” energy policies which are being used to approve fossil fuel projects even after it vowed to end Britain’s contribution to the climate crisis. Climate campaigners issued proceedings for a judicial review of the energy planning policies on Monday after officials refused to overhaul the rules, which could be used to support major fossil fuel power plants, open cast mines or fracking.  The campaigners claim that the policies undermine the government’s promises to tackle carbon emissions, including in the Paris agreement and in its own net zero legislation which became law last year. The energy planning policies were put in place by government officials almost a decade ago to help avert the risk of blackouts, but are still being used to justify fossil fuel projects, including the controversial plans for a new gas plant at the Drax site in north Yorkshire. Drax won permission to convert two of its coal-fired power units to burn gas, despite a clear warning from the planning inspectorate that a new gas plant would undermine the UK’s climate goals. Jolyon Maugham, a director at the Good Law Project, said: “We are teetering on the brink of a climate catastrophe. Yet the government is refusing to even commit to a review of an outdated energy policy that permits fossil fuel projects to be forced through. Our legal challenge seeks to change that.” The non-profit legal group is working alongside climate campaigners Dale Vince, the founder of Ecotricity, and George Monbiot, a Guardian columnist, to call for the planning rules to be brought in line with the government’s own climate goals. “The government’s outdated energy policy means approval to frack in Lancashire or permission for a new open cast coal mine can be forced through, despite our national and international commitments to tackle the climate emergency,” Maugham said. The National Policy Statement for Energy (NPS) was set by officials in 2011, and called for planning decision makers to find in favour of “urgent” fossil fuel projects to avoid an energy supply crunch which was forecast to raise the risk of blackouts in the middle of the decade. The policy statement is still being used to approve fossil fuel projects, despite a boom in renewable energy which has bolstered the UK’s supplies in recent years. The Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said it was a matter for the courts. • This article was amended on 19 May 2020 to add a response from the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy."

NOTE: An update has been added below, using the press release that came out today after the news stories yesterday.
While ironic that something designed to reduce CO2 emissions (and presumably warming)is actually producing warming around it, this isn’t really any big surprise. Orchardists and vineyard operators in California have been using motor driven wind turbines to elevate local temperatures to save crops from frost for over half a century. What is different here is the scale of nighttime warming, large enough to be visible on MODIS satellite imagery thanks to large scale wind farms.

Dr. Roger Pielke Sr. and associates have been doing research along these lines for quite some time, and has this summary on some recent research.
From Louise Gray in the Telegraph:
Wind farms can cause climate change, according to new research, that shows for the first time the new technology is already pushing up temperatures.

Usually at night the air closer to the ground becomes colder when the sun goes down and the earth cools. But on huge wind farms the motion of the turbines mixes the air higher in the atmosphere that is warmer, pushing up the overall temperature.
Satellite data over a large area in Texas, that is now covered by four of the world’s largest wind farms, found that over a decade the local temperature went up by almost 1C as more turbines are built. This could have long term effects on wildlife living in the immediate areas of larger wind farms. It could also affect regional weather patterns as warmer areas affect the formation of cloud and even wind speeds.

Here’s the paper:
Zhou, Liming, Yuhong Tian, Somnath Baidya Roy, Chris Thorncroft, Lance F. Bosart and Yuanlong Hu 2012: Impacts of wind farms on land surface temperature. Nature Climate Chnage. doi:10.1038/nclimate1505
And the abstract (bold mine):
The wind industry in the United States has experienced a remarkably rapid expansion of capacity in recent years and this fast growth is expected to continue in the future. While converting wind’s kinetic energy into electricity, wind turbines modify surface–atmosphere exchanges and the transfer of energy, momentum, mass and moisture within the atmosphere. These changes, if spatially large enough, may have noticeable impacts on local to regional weather and climate.
Here we present observational evidence for such impacts based on analyses of satellite data for the period of 2003–2011 over a region in west-central Texas, where four of the world’s largest wind farms are located. Our results show a significant warming trend of up to 0.72 °C per decade, particularly at night-time, over wind farms relative to nearby non-wind-farm regions. We attribute this warming primarily to wind farms as its spatial pattern and magnitude couples very well with the geographic distribution of wind turbines.

Scientists find night-warming effect over large wind farms in Texas
Wind turbines interact with atmospheric boundary layer near the surface

Large wind farms in certain areas in the United States appear to affect local land surface temperatures, according to a paper published today in the journal Nature Climate Change.
The study, led by Liming Zhou, an atmospheric scientist at the State University of New York- (SUNY) Albany, provides insights about the possible effects of wind farms.
The results could be important for developing efficient adaptation and management strategies to ensure long-term sustainability of wind power.
“This study indicates that land surface temperatures have warmed in the vicinity of large wind farms in west-central Texas, especially at night,” says Anjuli Bamzai, program director in the National Science Foundation’s (NSF) Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences, which funded the research.
“The observations and analyses are for a relatively short period, but raise important issues that deserve attention as we move toward an era of rapid growth in wind farms in our quest for alternate energy sources.”

Considerable research has linked the carbon dioxide produced by burning fossil fuels with rising global temperatures.
Consequently, many nations are moving toward cleaner sources of renewable energy such as wind turbines. Generating wind power creates no emissions, uses no water and is likely “green.”
“We need to better understand the system with observations, and better describe and model the complex processes involved, to predict how wind farms may affect future weather and climate,” said Zhou.
There have been a growing number of studies of wind farm effects on weather and climate, primarily using numerical models due to the lack of observations over wind farms.
As numerical models are computationally intensive and have uncertainties in simulating regional and local weather and climate, said Zhou, remote sensing is likely the most efficient and effective way to study wind farm effects over larger spatial and longer temporal scales.
To understand the potential impact of wind farms on local weather and climate, Zhou’s team analyzed satellite-derived land surface temperatures from regions around large wind farms in Texas for the period 2003-2011.
The researchers found a night-time warming effect over wind farms of up to 0.72 degrees Celsius per decade over the nine-year-period in which data were collected.
Because the spatial pattern of warming mirrors the geographic distribution of wind turbines, the scientists attribute the warming primarily to wind farms.
The year-to-year land surface temperature over wind farms shows a persistent upward trend from 2003 to 2011, consistent with the increasing number of operational wind turbines with time.

“This warming effect is most likely caused by the turbulence in turbine wakes acting like fans to pull down warmer near-surface air from higher altitudes at night,” said Somnath Baidya Roy of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, a co-author of the paper.
While the warming effect reported is local and small compared to the strong background year-to-year land surface temperature variation, the authors believe that this work draws attention to an important scientific issue that requires further investigation.
“The estimated warming trends only apply to the study region and to the study period, and thus should not be interpolated into other regions, globally or over longer periods,” Zhou said. “For a given wind farm, once there are no new wind turbines added, the warming effect may reach a stable level.”
The study represents a first step in exploring the potential of using satellite data to quantify the possible effects of the development of big wind farms on weather and climate, said Chris Thorncroft of SUNY-Albany, a co-author of the paper.
“We’re expanding this approach to other wind farms,” said Thorncroft, “and building models to understand the physical processes and mechanisms driving the interactions of wind turbines and the atmosphere boundary layer near the surface.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe EU is now in the process of taking away larger size electric appliances from consumers, saying they consume too much energy. Small appliances are enough for the citizens and they’ll just have to learn to like them.
EU banning “energy-hungry” vacuum cleaners
Incandescent light bulbs have already been removed from the shelves. Next being removed are larger size vacuum cleaners. Germany’s online flagship daily the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) reports: “Beginning September 2014 in the EU only vacuum cleaners that consume less than 1600 watts may be sold. From 2017 only a maximum of 900 watts will be allowed.”
Hat-tip: DirkH
The FAZ writes that the ban was very quietly passed by Brussels some weeks ago, going unnoticed by the public.
Vacuum cleaners will also carry a sticker informing the consumer of the appliance’s energy efficiency rating. The EU thinks it can save energy by forcing consumers to buy only small appliances.
Whether the intrusion by the state will have an effect on overall electricity consumption remains a question. Smaller vacuum cleaners will only mean that housewives (and many husbands, of course) will have to spend twice as long vacuuming to get the house clean, and so may end up using even more electricity. This is the latest Brussels eco-justified intrusion into the free market and our private lives.

To be fair, the FAZ does write that the manufacturers of vacuum cleaners have pretty much accepted the law without protest, as most cleaners are already below the 1600-watt limit. However, a couple of high-end vacuum cleaner manufacturers, such as Vorwerk, are resisting.
What’s next?
The FAZ writes that not only light bulbs and vacuum cleaners are targeted for higher efficiency, but also an entire range of appliances. This is all in the wake of the European Ecodesign Directive, which will go into effect on November 1st for clothes dryers. “For condensation tumbler dryers, the weighted condensation efficiency must not be less than 60 percent.”
This latest additional government encroachment into private lives is necessary, European bureaucrats believe. Citizens have to stop being wasteful and it’s past time to rescue the planet from dangerous climate change, so claim the nannies in Brussels and other European capitals. It’s all for our own good.
How could people have come to accept being treated like irresponsible children who need to be nannied 24 hours a day? Surely if a poll were taken in Europe, a majority of citizens indeed would agree that they really are too stupid to make their own personal decisions and so it’s best that the state decides simple things for them, like the purchase of an appliance.
A large part of the European citizens have been brainwashed into believing this.
Recently the EU attempted to force consumers to have only the option of buying cars that emit low levels of CO2. But Angela Merkel resisted the move, claiming that Germany’s powerful automotive industry needs more time to make its cars more efficient.

Like too many other long‐​reigning fixtures on Capitol Hill, Senator Carl Levin (D-MI) doesn’t appreciate the magnitude of the challenge to the authority he presumes to hold over America’s job and wealth creators. Or, maybe he does, and frustration over that fact explains why he besmirches companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Hewlett‐​Packard.



Levin presided over a Senate hearing last week devoted to examining the “loopholes and gimmicks” used by these multinational companies to avoid paying taxes — and to branding them dirty tax scofflaws. Well here’s a news flash for the senator: incentives matter.



The byzantine U.S. tax code, which Senator Levin — over his 33‐​year tenure in the U.S. Senate — no doubt had a hand or two in shaping, includes the highest corporate income tax rate among all of the world’s industrialized countries and the unusual requirement that profits earned abroad by U.S. multinationals are subject to U.S. taxation upon repatriation. No other major economy does that. Who in their right minds would not expect those incentives to encourage moving production off shore and keeping profits there?



Minimizing exposure to taxes — like avoiding an oncoming truck — is a natural reaction to tax policy. Entire software and accounting industries exist to serve that specific objective. Unless they are illegal (and that is not what Levin asserts directly), the tax minimization programs employed at Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Hewlett‐​Packard are legitimate responses to the tax policies implemented and foreshadowed by this and previous congresses. If Levin is concerned about diminishing federal tax collections from corporations (which, of course, reduces his power), the solution is to change the incentives — to change the convoluted artifice of backroom politics that is our present tax code.



Combine the current tax incentive structure with stifling, redundant environmental, financial, and health and safety regulations, an out‐​of‐​control tort system that often starts with a presumption of corporate malfeasance, exploding health care costs, and costly worker’s compensation rules, and it becomes apparent why more and more businesses would consider moving operations abroad — permanently. Thanks to the progressive trends of globalization, liberalization, transportation, and communication, societies’ producers are no longer quite as captive to confiscatory or otherwise suffocating domestic policies. They have choices.



Of course many choose to stay, and for good reason. We are fortunate to have the institutions, the rule of law, deep and diversified capital markets, excellent research universities, a highly‐​skilled workforce, cultural diversity, and a society that not only tolerates but encourages dissent, and the world’s largest consumer market — still. Success is more likely to be achieved in an environment with those advantages. They are the ingredients of our ingenuity, our innovativeness, our willingness to take risks as entrepreneurs, and our economic success. This is why companies like Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Hewlett‐​Packard are born in the United States.



But those advantages are eroding. While U.S. policymakers browbeat U.S. companies and threaten them with sanctions for “shipping jobs overseas” or “hiding profits abroad” or some other manifestation of what politicians like to call corporate greed, characterizing them as a scourge to be contained and controlled, other governments are hungry for the benefits those companies can provide their people. Some of those governments seem to recognize that the world’s wealth and jobs creators have choices about where they produce, sell, and conduct research and development. And some are acting to attract U.S. businesses with incentives that become less necessary every time a politician vents his spleen about evil corporations. Not only should our wealth creators be treated with greater respect from Washington, but we are kidding ourselves if we think our policies don’t need to keep up. As I wrote in a December 2009 Cato paper:



Governments are competing for investment and talent, which both tend to flow to jurisdictions where the rule of law is clear and abided; where there is greater certainty to the business and political climate; where the specter of asset expropriation is negligible; where physical and administrative infrastructure is in good shape; where the local work force is productive; where there are limited physical, political, and administrative friction.



This global competition in policy is a positive development. But U.S. policymakers cannot take for granted that traditional U.S. strengths will be enough. We have to compete and earn our share with good policies. The decisions made now with respect to policies on immigration, education, energy, trade, entitlements, taxes, and the role of government in managing the economy will determine the health, competitiveness, and relative significance of the U.S. economy in the decades ahead.



Since another hearing devoted to thanking these companies for their contributions to the U.S. economy is unlikely, perhaps Senator Levin should at least consider the perils of chasing away these golden geese.

The Brexit Party’s Christopher Monckton talks to investigative journalist Gemma O’Doherty and discusses a new study by Ronan & Michael Connolly showing that the greenhouse gas effect **cannot cause global warming** which he says backed up his own findings: [https://www.researchgate.net/publicat…](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?redir_token=0DKVVhmxTfZbb17vd4872x6BXzJ8MTU2NzU3OTM5MUAxNTY3NDkyOTkx&v=k6iOOuZCE_Y&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.researchgate.net%2Fpublication%2F282389821_Re-evaluating_the_role_of_solar_variability_on_Northern_Hemisphere_temperature_trends_since_the_19th_century&event=video_description) On being denied an audience with the the environment secretary in the the UK, Monckton remarked: “The environment secretary was **willing to hear the side of the story that he wanted to hear from an autistic schoolchild** who hadn’t the faintest idea what she is talking about but who has been relentlessly propagandised by communist teachers…but he was not willing to hear a former member of his own party who leads a team of eminent scientists who had done a serious load of work over the last four years [and] had come to conclusion that the whole thing is nonsense.” “And if you put this evidence in front of the so-called conservative party in Britain which is supposed to be a centre-right party (it’s supposed to fight this sort of totalitarian nonsense), what do they do? They go and listen to a sixteen year old school kid having taken out six weeks NOT to read a scientific paper or even a two page summary of it in plane English which says “look mate, there is not a climate problem and we have proven it”…so when you are dealing with intellectual bankruptcy of that order, that’s why I’m no longer a Conservative because these people are thick as two short planks and that’s doing a disservice to the short planks.”

"The US military’s carbon bootprint is enormous. Like corporate supply chains, it relies upon an extensive global network of container ships, trucks and cargo planes to supply its operations with everything from bombs to humanitarian aid and hydrocarbon fuels. Our new study calculated the contribution of this vast infrastructure to climate change. Greenhouse gas emission accounting usually focuses on how much energy and fuel civilians use. But recent work, including our own, shows that the US military is one of the largest polluters in history, consuming more liquid fuels and emitting more climate-changing gases than most medium-sized countries. If the US military were a country, its fuel usage alone would make it the 47th largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world, sitting between Peru and Portugal. In 2017, the US military bought about 269,230 barrels of oil a day and emitted more than 25,000 kilotonnes of carbon dioxide by burning those fuels. The US Air Force purchased US$4.9 billion worth of fuel, and the navy US$2.8 billion, followed by the army at US$947m and the Marines at US$36m. It’s no coincidence that US military emissions tend to be overlooked in climate change studies. It’s very difficult to get consistent data from the Pentagon and across US government departments. In fact, the United States insisted on an exemption for reporting military emissions in the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. This loophole was closed by the Paris Accord, but with the Trump administration due to withdraw from the accord in 2020, this gap will will return. Our study is based on data retrieved from multiple Freedom of Information Act requests to the US Defense Logistics Agency, the massive bureaucratic agency tasked with managing the US military’s supply chains, including its hydrocarbon fuel purchases and distribution. The US military has long understood that it isn’t immune from the potential consequences of climate change – recognising it as a “threat multiplier” that can exacerbate other risks. Many, though not all, military bases have been preparing for climate change impacts like sea level rise. Nor has the military ignored its own contribution to the problem. As we have previously shown, the military has invested in developing alternative energy sources like biofuels, but these comprise only a tiny fraction of spending on fuels. The American military’s climate policy remains contradictory. There have been attempts to “green” aspects of its operations by increasing renewable electricity generation on bases, but it remains the single largest institutional consumer of hydrocarbons in the world. It has also locked itself into hydrocarbon-based weapons systems for years to come, by depending on existing aircraft and warships for open-ended operations. Climate change has become a hot-button topic on the campaign trail for the 2020 presidential election. Leading Democratic candidates, such as Senator Elizabeth Warren, and members of Congress like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are calling for major climate initiatives like the Green New Deal. For any of that to be effective, the US military’s carbon bootprint must be addressed in domestic policy and international climate treaties. Our study shows that action on climate change demands shuttering vast sections of the military machine. There are few activities on Earth as environmentally catastrophic as waging war. Significant reductions to the Pentagon’s budget and shrinking its capacity to wage war would cause a huge drop in demand from the biggest consumer of liquid fuels in the world. It does no good tinkering around the edges of the war machine’s environmental impact. The money spent procuring and distributing fuel across the US empire could instead be spent as a peace dividend, helping to fund a Green New Deal in whatever form it might take. There are no shortage of policy priorities that could use a funding bump. Any of these options would be better than fuelling one of the largest military forces in history.

The angry Left has been calling for President Obama to fire Jeffrey Immelt from his position as head of the President’s Council on Jobs and Competitiveness. I think that would be a good idea, but for different reasons.   
  
Sen. Russ Feingold, Moveon.Org, and the regular scribes at the _Huffington Post_ see Immelt, the chairman and CEO of General Electric, as unfit to advise the president because GE invests some of its resources abroad and, despite worldwide profits of $14.2 billion, paid no taxes in 2010. No illegalities are alleged, mind you; GE — like every other U.S. multinational — responds to incentives, including those resulting from tax policy and regulations concocted in Washington.   
  
But there are more substantive reasons for why Immelt is unfit to advise the president. In particular, GE is a major player in several industries that President Obama has been promoting as part of his administration’s cocksure embrace of industrial policy. With over $100 billion in direct subsidies and tax credits already devoted to ""green technology,"" President Obama is convinced that America's economic future depends on the ability of U.S. firms to compete and succeed in the solar panel, wind harnessing, battery, and other energy storage technologies. Concerning those industries, the president said: ""Countries like China are moving even faster... I'm not going to settle for a situation where the United States comes in second place or third place or fourth place in what will be the most important economic engine of the future.""   
  
Well, just yesterday GE announced plans to open the largest solar panel production facility in the United States, which nicely complements its role as the largest U.S. producer of wind turbines (and one of the largest in the world). The 2011 _Economic Report of the President_ describes the taxpayer largesse devoted to subsidizing these green industries: 



[T]he Recovery Act directed over $90 billion in public investment and tax incentives to increasing renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power, weatherizing homes, and boosting R&D for new technologies. Looking forward, the President has proposed a Federal Clean Energy Standard to double the share of electricity produced by clean sources to 80 percent by 2035, a substantial commitment to cleaner transportation infrastructure, and has increased investments in energy efficiency and clean energy R&D.



And Box 6.2 on page 129 of the _2011 ERP_ conveniently breaks out those subsidies by specific industry, most of which are spaces in which GE competes.   




Tim Carney gave his impressions of this budding relationship between GE and the Obama administration in the _DC Examiner_ last July: 



First, there’s the policy overlap: Obama wants cap-and-trade, GE wants cap-and-trade. Obama subsidizes embryonic stem-cell research, GE launches an embryonic stem-cell business. Obama calls for rail subsidies, GE hires Linda Daschle [wife of former South Dakota Senator and Obama confidante Tom Dachle] as a rail lobbyist. Obama gives a speeeh, GE employee Chris Matthews feels a thrill up his leg. I could go on.



And Carney does go on in a December 2009 _Examiner_ piece: 



Look at any major Obama policy initiative — healthcare reform, climate-change regulation, embryonic stem-cell research, infrastructure stimulus, electrical transmission smart-grids — and you'll find GE has set up shop, angling for a way to pocket government handouts, gain business through mandates, or profit from government regulation.



One month after President Obama proposed subsidizing high-speed rail because, in his words, ""everybody stands to benefit,"" the head of GE’s Transportation division proclaimed, ""GE has the know-how and the manufacturing base to develop the next generation of high-speed passenger locomotives. We are ready to partner with the federal government and Amtrak to make high-speed rail a reality.""   
  
About the optics of these related events, Carney writes: ""This was typical — an Obama policy pronouncement in close conjunction with a GE business initiative. It happens across all sectors of the economy and in all corners of GE's sprawling enterprise."" And he goes on to list other examples.   
  
Jeff Immelt should step down as head of the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness because there is simply no avoiding a conflict of interest. Even if he recommends courses of action to the president that _don't_ advance GE's bottom line, it's hard to see how that wouldn't be an abrogation of his fiduciary responsibility to GE's shareholders.   
  
But more troubling is that Immelt and the president appear to be two peas in a pod when it comes to faith in government-directed industrial policy. Immelt admires the German model of industrial policy because the Germans believe in ""government and business working as a pack."" He admires China's ""incredible unanimity of purpose from top to bottom."" And days after Obama's inauguration, Immelt wrote to shareholders: 



[W]e are going through more than a cycle. The global economy, and capitalism, will be ""reset"" in several important ways. The interaction between government and business will change forever. In a reset economy, the government will be a regulator; and also an industry policy champion, a financier, and a key partner.



Citizens of a country that owes so much of its unmatched economic success to innovation and entrepreneurship and an absence of heavy-handed top-down mandates should be wary of the changes the presdient and Mr. Immelt are fostering.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDr. Bernd Lucke, head of Germany’s AfD party, (Germany’s version of Britain’s UKIP), was interviewed by the National Anti Energy-Feed-In Act Movement (NAEB) and asked about his new party’s position on the Energiewende (transformation to renewable energy) and on climate science.

AfD head Bernd Lucke, right, calling for an exit from euro and scale-back of subsidies for alternative energies. Calls CO2 science disputed. Photo source: www.alternativefuer.de/.
The AfD party has been expressing doubts about climate science, and as a result has been viciously attacked by green and leftist thugs. To the greens and to leftists, the AfD represents a serious threat to the German climate movement, a movement that has been psychologically and emotionally bullied onto the public.
The entire interview appears at the site of the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE). What follows are the pertinent excerpts.
NAEB: In Germany there are more than 200 citizens’ initiatives against wind parks in their neighborhoods, in nature reserves and in forests. Do you support these initiatives?
Lucke: These initiatives are there so that wind generators are not set up in natural parks or forests, and so that the distance between the wind generators and and residential areas are at least 10 times the maximum blade height. Those are sensible targets that merit support.

NAEB: So you want to scale back the construction of wind power, solar power and biofuel power. This will lead to job losses. Can we afford that?
Lucke: We have to look at the entire picture. By making the price of electricity more expensive, we are threatening to cause lots of job losses in the manufacturing sector. Because of the high costs of electricity, many companies are no longer working economically. They are moving their production facilities to less expensive foreign countries. The energy-intensive basic material industry employs about 2 million people. Currently many of the energy-intensive companies are exempt from the price-driving feed-in charges, but the unpredictable position of the German government and the latest demands by the Socialists are causing companies to worry that a cost explosion is imminent.
NAEB: Must we continue to further push the energy policy in order to rescue the world climate?
Lucke: You’re talking about the impact of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels on the global climate. How great this effect is, is scientifically disputed. It is possibly less than we thought. Of course it is necessary to be careful and to act responsibly.
NAEB: Back to electricity prices. Which dangers do you see coming from the constantly rising electricity prices in Germany?
Lucke: Germany’s energy policy is becoming increasingly unsocial. More or less every household has to pay the same price for electricity, no matter what the income is. The so-called Feed-In charges, which are responsible for the price increase, is like a tax that every household more or less has to pay equally. This is posing a danger for the social balance. Already today the Feed-In charges are causing a loss in buying power of 20 billion euros, by which low income earners are disproportionately impacted. That’s going to get worse if the electricity prices continue rising as planned.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterHaving read the latest on the Greenpeace-30 activists detained by Russian authorities last month, I sense that they probably will be spending a few more years in prison than what some us thought just a couple of days earlier, just after it was announced that piracy charges would be dropped and that the activists would be facing the lesser charges of hooliganism.
The lesser charge was seen as a ray of hope. But that seems to be fading away.
Since then, the tones coming out of Russia have once again become notably harsher, with Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov commenting. The German edition of Ria Novosti writes:
The arrested Greenpeace activists from the Arctic Sunrise vessel knew what they were getting themselves into. Now we simply have to wait for the court’s decision, so says Russian foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.
‘This action was planned. All those involved very well knew who and what they would photograph,’ said Lavrov.”
Obviously Lavrov thinks they are guilty of serious offences. These remarks by Lavrov weren’t reported in the English version of Ria Novosti.

The Russian media also points out that the Greenpeace activists also have other charges to worry about, in addition to the serious charge of hooliganism. The English language Ria Novosti writes:
Russian investigators earlier said some of the detained activists could face additional charges, including ‘assault on an official on duty.’
Russia seized the Greenpeace ship, the Arctic Sunrise, and its multinational crew after several activists tried to scale an offshore oil rig belonging to Russia’s state-run gas giant Gazprom on September 18.”
Unfortunately, sympathy for the Greenpeace environmental activists is also running low in Russia. Ria Novosti writes:
Only 20 percent of Russians believe that the Greenpeace protest was actually in defense of the environment, whereas 42 percent think it was part of a conspiracy to take away Russia’s valuable natural resources, according to a survey released Monday by respected state-run pollster VTsIOM.”
Greenpeace management obviously had completely miscalculated in sending the activists out to protest in the Russian Arctic. When you take on Russia, you take on the whole system: judicial, political, and even the state-run pollsters. It’s awfully clear who is going to lose this one. The activists won’t be coming back anytime soon.

"**With a number of potential vaccines for Covid-19 now imminent, there are increasing concerns that misinformation online could turn some people against being immunized.**
The World Health Organization (WHO) says the world's not only fighting the pandemic, but also what it calls an ""infodemic"" - where an overload of information, some of it false, makes it difficult for people to make decisions about their health.
And it's trying to answer people's concerns about the vaccines - as well as helping people evaluate the information they see on social media.
Nina, who is 21 and lives in London with her 82-year-old grandmother, is one of those who has concerns,
She says she has ""mixed feelings"" about Covid vaccines.
Nina, who is a freelance producer, isn't sure yet if she'll be vaccinated in the future. But she thinks the amount of information around makes it harder to understand the science behind the vaccines.
""Obviously like everyone I want this virus to go away as quickly as possible,"" she says.
""But at the same time, I'm not sure how much I trust the vaccine yet, because it's happened so quickly.""
And her view is partly coloured by what she sees on social media, although she also says she seeks out information from ""traditional"" news sources.
""There are quite a lot of opinions flying around on Twitter, Instagram and TikTok. I think people are very easily influenced by that,"" she says.
Oscar Hodgson, a trainee solicitor who is taking part in a coronavirus vaccine trial at Imperial College London, says: ""It's often very difficult with the amount of information that we are being bombarded with to make sense of what you should be doing.""
But he adds: ""I think a vaccine is one of the only ways out of the situation if we want to get away from endless lockdowns and curfews.""
Researchers have moved at record speed to develop vaccines, less than a year in to this pandemic,
The WHO is monitoring data from more than 200 vaccine trials.
""There are now several types of vaccine in the pipeline based on different technologies,"" says Dr Sylvie Briand, the WHO's director of pandemic and epidemic diseases.
They are going through the same safety tests as vaccines already used all around the world.
""It's very expensive to do these phase three (human) trials. But many countries have come together to pay for it,"" Dr Briand says. ""When you have enough funds the process can go much faster.""
There are three key reasons it's been possible to develop coronavirus vaccines so quickly:
Part of the problem, is that information about this pandemic has been coming out in dribs and drabs, as scientists make new discoveries about the virus and how best to manage it.
This, researchers say, has created space for misinformation to thrive.
""People are looking for information, and they're confronted with this confusing mix of some credible information, and then a lot of other very questioning, undermining or outright wrong information."" says Prof Heidi Larson who runs the Vaccine Confidence Project at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
She has been studying vaccine confidence around the world for more than two decades.
While vaccine hesitancy has always been an issue, she is very concerned about the impact misinformation appears to be having on people's intention to take coronavirus vaccines.
Her team carried out a recent study looking at vaccine confidence in the UK and US.
Of 4,000 people in the UK. 54% said they definitely would be vaccinated. But after they were shown inaccurate claims about vaccine safety that figure fell by over six percentage points
And people on lower incomes and from black and minority ethnic backgrounds were most likely to reject a Covid vaccine.
**How to identify inaccurate information online:**
SOURCE: WHO
""We've had an incredibly hopeful month with some of the new vaccine news,"" Prof Larson says.
""But we still don't have any proven vaccines. So we need to manage the hope.
""And one of the big anxieties is safety. So we can talk about the safety processes and the fact that those tried and tested processes are being followed carefully, with shortcuts in other parts of the long development process.""
Prof Larson, along with the WHO and governments around the world, is working with some of the big tech companies to try and combat misinformation.
Facebook - which owns Instagram and WhatsApp - says it removes information that could lead to ""immediate harm"", including false claims about cures for Covid-19.
It also says it's banned ads that discourage people from getting vaccines, and reduced the number of people who see vaccine hoaxes.
But, it's still pretty easy to come across misinformation about Covid-19 and vaccines online, and to share those posts.
""We need to focus on building resilience, and filling that space"" said Prof Larson.
""You can't just take away pieces of misinformation without providing some alternative."""

The Arabunna people live in the area around Lake Eyre in Southern Australia. It is a hot, hostile desert region, which is no surprise, because … well … it’s in Australia. Here’s the general area where they live:
Figure 1. Lake Eyre region in South Australia. Yellow line show the area from 25°-30°S, 135°-140°E
A new report from the University of Everybody-Panic is a study of the horrendous future faced by these poor folks:
The first stage of University of Adelaide research released today shows that South Australia’s Arabunna country, which includes Lake Eyre in the far north, is likely to get both drier and hotter in decades to come.
“Temperatures could increase up to four degrees Celsius in Arabunna country in the next century, threatening the survival of many plants and animals,” says the author of the report, Dr John Tibby from the University of Adelaide’s Discipline of Geography, Environment and Population. SOURCE: PhysOrg
Yes, temperatures “could” increase … and I could win the lottery, but I’m not quitting my day job just yet. Meanwhile, back in the real world, what’s been happening in the Lake Eyre region in the last thirty years? Figure 2 shows the satellite-derived temperature trends for the lower troposphere in the area around Lake Eyre, from both the University of Alabama Huntsville (UAH) and Remote Sensing Services (RSS).

Figure 2. Satellite temperatures for the lower troposphere in the Lake Eyre Region of Southern Australia. Photo shows the approach to Lake Eyre. Temperatures are the average of the region outlined in yellow in Figure 1. All data from KNMI
So … here’s the deal. We have no evidence that the temperatures are rising in the Lake Eyre region. There has been little change in the area temperatures since the satellite records began. Despite that, University of Adelaide professors are selling their fantasies of a terrifying future to the Arabunna, the aboriginal people who live in the area.
Meanwhile, the temperatures in the region are currently lower than they have been in the entire satellite record …
The professors seem to find nothing wrong with scaring the aboriginal people who have lived there for generations. And where do their projections of a 5°C temperature rise originate? Well, as usual, it’s models all the way down, and even the modelers say that their models are useless at the regional level … but despite that, these professors from the University of East Wankerton or wherever it is are more than happy to use these useless models to terrify the local folks.
I find this kind of crying wolf reprehensible, particularly when it is aimed at indigenous people, but hey, that’s just me.

This is about one of the most damning pieces on the European climate movement I’ve read all year, and that from Germany’s equivalent of the Washington Post. An atmosphere of resignation is truly sweeping through Germany’s climate movement. Flagship media are waking up.
We’re winning!
“Failed tricking their way past democracy”
The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) has written a blistering criticism of Hans Schellnhuber’s WBGU and climate activists’ efforts to impose a green authoritarian society over the rest of the world. They overshot and missed the curve. The FAZ introduction reads:
The rescue of the planet gets cancelled. The climate advisory council to the government played high stakes poker. And lost. They failed at tricking their way past democracy.”
In the eyes of one Germany’s leading flagship national dailies, the renowned FAZ, the attempted green coup led by a small group of elitist scientists and a mass of activists has come to grinding halt.
Germany and Europe again escape a (soft) tyranny – at least for the time being.
Background – the Potsdam doomsday factory
German professor Hans Joachim Schellnhuber is the director of Germany’s infamously alarmist Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, which includes alarmist climate radicals like Stefan Rahmstorf, Anders Levermann, and economist Ottmar Edenhofer. For years Schellnhuber’s institute has busily and relentlessly crafted data showing alarming climate change and putting out doomsday scenarios in an attempt to get spooked policymakers to stampede into enacting radical climate policy.
Schellnhuber is also the director of the WBGU, the German Advisory Council on Global Change. The Council is made up of nine “renowned scientists”. Their primary task: to advise policymakers in Germany and worldwide on how society should proceed in the face of dangerous climate change.
Master-plan for transforming global society
Three years ago the WBGU authored and released a 446-page “Master Plan” for “The Great Transformation of Global Society” designed to put global society on the fast-track to “sustainability” and an almost carbon-free society by 2050. In it the council even called for policies to water down democracy. One journalist once summarized: The WBGU is in favor of democracy, but only so long as the people make the right decisions.
The master-plan called for a so-called future council, made up of prophet-like wise men, who would have the power to veto democratic decisions it felt were not in the best interest of future generations.
“Climate protection as moral as abolishing slavery”
The FAZ writes that one of the fundamental aims of the WBGU was changing Germany’s constitutional law: climate protection was to become an official state priority and that going green was “as morally imperative as the abolition of slavery“. More importantly, the “transformation to a climate-protective society would have to happen very rapidly“. Dissenters would have to be stigmatized and marginalized, and so denied real participation.
Though highly controversial, the WBGU never backed down from their radical proposal, always insisting that the fate of the planet was in imminent peril, that there could be neither compromise nor delay, that time was of the essence, and the science was unanimous. The WBGU even called it a test for democracy, claiming that if society failed to act, it would tell us that democracy was no longer capable of functioning in the face of crisis.
“Failed to trick their way past democracy”
Since the release of the WGBU’s master-plan in 2011, most of the world has not heeded the council’s recommendations and CO2 emissions continue their rapid rise unabated. To the council members, democracy appears overwhelmed and no longer able to cope with the crisis of climate change. The FAZ asks: “Has democracy failed the test to check if it’s adequate for the future?” The FAZ answers:
Not at all. It appears much more so that the attempt by some climate-political advisors to the government to trick their way past democracy has failed.”

//-->




It’s truly encouraging that a major daily like the FAZ has come to realize this. We see that society once again indeed has narrowly escaped another tyranny.
“German climate movement is frustrated”
On the reaction by the WBGU scientists, the FAZ writes: “those who wanted to fire up the climate revolution are frustrated. And with them, the mainstream of the German climate movement.”
Germany gets a new heretic
The FAZ also writes how a new climate-policy heretic has entered the German climate policy scene, Dr. Oliver Geden. Geden, a warmist and a climate policy advisor to the German government, has been sharply critical of the WBGU misusing urgency to justify any means. He’s become the latest persona non grata. The FAZ writes:
By using time pressure, everything can be justified: billions in expenditures, gigantic conferences – and tampering with democracy. The good cause justifies the means.”
The FAZ describes how a green regime of the sort advocated by the WBGU would of course never force green living onto the citizenry by enacting authoritarian laws, but rather it would impose the green regime psychologically using campaigns that would teach citizens what good behavior is, e.g. vegetarianism, and marginalize dissenting behavior. In a nutshell, it would keep making the lives of dissenters miserable until they learned to choose correctly.
However, the FAZ shows this is a lot easier said than done, citing the German Green Party’s recent national election campaign where they demanded one “Veggie Day” a week be imposed in Germany. That issue backfired big time for the greens, who on election day lost hundreds of thousands of votes and ended up in the single digits. A recent poll showed that 61% of the public rejected a “Veggie Day”.
But the WBGU was not at all impressed by the public’s rejection. The FAZ writes that one WBGU scientist brushed the rejection aside, claiming the question should not have been posed in the first place and that cafeterias should just implement Veggie Day without even asking. “Just do it, and don’t vote on it,” the FAZ quips.
Climate policy has been “a giant failure”
For warmist think-tank member and government advisor Oliver Geden, the WBGU scientists have gone too far. FAZ:
He and other scientists feel many climate advisors have abused their role for years: Scientists acted like politicians who applied pressure and exercised power, and did not act like scientists who show solution paths.”
The FAZ quotes Geden regarding the policy approach taken by the WBGU:
The whole thing has been a giant failure.”
According to the FAZ, Geden constantly receives e-mails from agitated scientists who write that it’s “terrible to even express criticism” or that it’s the wrong time for criticism, “We’re close to a breakthrough!”
Mood of resignation taking hold in the green movement
At the end of the article the FAZ describes a mood of resignation that is sweeping across Europe’s climate movement. The FAZ concludes:
This year the nine scientists of the WBGU published a new book about the protection of the world’s oceans within the scope of the Great Transformation. In a mutual committee of the federal Ministries for Environment and Research, where they unveiled their results, there was not a single federal minister present, only state secretaries.”
Looks like the WBGU’s days have come and gone. Now is a good time to ask them: How does it feel not to be listened to?

The recent Cowtan and Way paper attempting to fill gaps in the Arctic surface temperature records by in-filling with satellite data has triggered many reactions in the blogosphere. Cowtan and Way claimed that the coverage gaps in the surface data resulted in a cooling bias that they attempted to correct with satellite derived data. Others have pointed out many failings in this paper, but have failed to note the biggest failing of all:
HUGE warming adjustment bias
The authors managed to identify a coverage bias without noting a HUGE warming adjustment bias in the surface temperatures. It is difficult to believe that they did not notice this as they were comparing the HADCRUT4 data to the satellite data. This failure totally falsifies their findings.
Here is a comparison of the GISS data for land and ocean for the region north of 60° latitude (very similar to HADCRUT4 data, but more accessible), compared to the RSS Satellite land and ocean data for the same latitudes.

Figure 1 is a plot of GISSTemp land and ocean temperatures and RSS TLT land and ocean data for latitudes north of 60°.
Others have pointed out that GISS data, and indeed all the surface temperature data bases, suffer from “homogenization” and “correction”, cooling the past and warming the present. There has been much less criticism of the satellite data because those measurements are derived in a completely different way. The surface temperature data from GISS, HADCRUT, and GHCN suffer from the same problem, a limited number of polar measurement stations (they all use the same ones). Because these stations are in very cold climates, they all suffer from varying degrees of Urban Heat Island (UHI) effects – with Arctic stations being located located near buildings, air strips, etc. The satellites suffer much less from this problem because the polar regions are so thinly populated.
Note that in Figure 1 GISSTemp is warming about 75% faster than the satellite measurements. The divergence was small in the 1980’s, mostly confined to warm years, with less difference in cold years. But in the last decade, the difference has widened to more than a degree. Figure 2 is the bias in the GISS annual temperature data relative to the satellite data.

Figure 2 is the difference between the GISS data and the RSS data in Figure 1.
So why didn’t Cowtan and Way notice this warming bias? Rhetorical question – they didn’t want to!

"Climate breakdown, mass extinctions, and extreme inequality threaten the earth’s rich tapestry of life and leave our own fate increasingly uncertain. At a time of such social, political and ecological upheaval, it’s natural to dream of a utopian world in which these problems are no more – in fact, people have been doing it for centuries.  Such visions are often dismissed as nothing more than pointless flights of fancy, yearnings for impossibly perfect societies. But these assumptions are largely incorrect. Utopianism is the lifeblood of social change, and has already inspired countless individuals and movements to change the world for the better. Utopia is not, as its Greek etymological roots suggest, a “no-place”. The name may derive from Thomas More’s classic 16th-century fictional work, Utopia, but it is not confined to literature depicting distant or fantastical ideal worlds. Utopianism is in fact a philosophy that encompasses a variety of ways of thinking about or attempting to create a better society. It begins with the seemingly simple yet powerful declaration that the present is inadequate and that things can be otherwise. Present in communities, social movements, and political discourse, it critiques society and creatively projects futures free of the strangleholds of the time. Put simply, it embodies a longstanding human impulse towards self-improvement. Utopianism is manifest in countless historical examples of those that have dared to challenge the status quo and assert that things can – and indeed, must – change. Take Martin Luther-King’s dream of a world free of racial segregation for example, or the strivings of the suffragettes for gender equality. Now, our relationship with the natural world is humanity’s defining challenge – and utopian ideas have shifted to meet it. “Ecotopian” aspirations are already in full view in community networks attempting to create more conscious ways of living such as the Transition Network, social movements such as Extinction Rebellion, and bold policy proposals such as the USA’s Green New Deal. What’s more, many of the ideas put forth by these projects were long since imagined in prominent ecotopian literary works. In the ideal worlds sketched in Ernst Callenbach’s Ecotopia and Kim Stanley Robinson’s Pacific Edge for example, resources are renewably sourced and communally owned. Healthcare, education, and meaningful employment are available to all. Extreme wealth disparities have been eradicated through income caps and minimum earnings schemes. These ideas are reflected in many aspects of the Green New Deal, which aims to transition the USA towards communal ownership of energy systems and a 100% renewable energy system by 2030, as well as enshrine into law rights to single-payer healthcare, guaranteed work at a living wage, affordable housing, and free university education. It’s not clear whether Alexandro Ocasio-Cortez, the leading figurehead for the grand policy package, was directly inspired by these works. But judging from the way she has been promoting the Green New Deal, she certainly sees the value in painting visions of utopia. For example, her viral video, titled “A Message from the Future”, creatively imagines a more socially and ecologically resilient society just a few decades on from now – and, crucially, helps us to believe that it is possible.  As a decentralised global movement that gives its members autonomy and demands politics in which citizens lead, Extinction Rebellion also echoes ideals from ecotopian novels. In Ecotopia and many other similar works, most aspects of life are decentralised, from small-scale agriculture to neighborhood-specific healthcare. In Pacific Edge, the direct brand of politics Extinction Rebellion advocates is central to social and ecological wellbeing. Extinction Rebellion urges efforts of wartime proportion to decarbonise by 2025 – a utopian target that has been met with scepticism in some quarters.  But whether or not it is achievable, such a demand has been crucial in highlighting that what is presently deemed politically possible is not sufficient to stop catastrophic climate breakdown.  Their radical visions have shifted the climate and ecological crises to the forefront of the political agenda. And, crucially, they have switched millions on to the idea that fundamental transformations in the way we organise and power our societies are possible. To some, the serious political proposals outlined by Extinction Rebellion and in the Green New Deal might seem as unrealistic as the literary works that imagine their realisation. But living examples of ecotopian imagination can already be found in the world we live in. Thousands of intentional communities across the globe are already creating spaces with social and ecological justice at their heart. Many of these eco-communities have been directly inspired by the communities imagined in ecotopian novels. For example, hundreds of eco-villages in the Baltic region were set up according to the concept laid out in Vladimir Megre’s The Ringing Cedars of Russia. Some movements, such as the Transition Network – whose co-founder describes himself as a “vision harvester” – are even working to transform existing settlements across the world, with great success. As just one example among initiatives in nearly 1,000 towns and cities, Transition Marlborough’s Bee Roadzz project in south-west England has drawn together local residents, businesses and organisations to link habitats and combat the rapid decline of bees and other pollinators.  In shattering the perceived rigidity of the present, utopianism paves the way for change. Perfect worlds may not be realisable or even desirable, but that doesn’t mean we should shy away from imagining and striving for a better future. Societies without extreme inequality and environmental degradation are surely within the bounds of possibility. Whether in the form of a creative novel, a social movement, or a political proposal, dreaming can help us get there. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe latest news on the sea-ice trapped MV Akademik Shokalskiy global warming research vessel comes from Radio Australia:
An Australian icebreaker has abandoned its attempt to rescue a Russian-flagged ship stuck in sea ice in Antarctica due to adverse weather conditions. […]
‘There could be further attempts if the master feels the weather conditions are OK to do that attempt, to get further into the ice fields.’
According to reports, the Australian ice breaker never got closer than 10 nautical miles to the global warming research vessel, and is now back out in open water 18 miles away, waiting for the weather to improve.
‘It’s blowing an absolute blizzard here, there’s a total white-out, there’s snow blowing everywhere and it’s damn cold outside,’ said expedition member John Black in his latest video message.”
Black also adds:
Expedition spokesman Alvin Stone says the group is not worried about spending New Year’s Eve on the ice.”

Of course not. They have lots of diesel fuel to keep the trapped vessel powered and warm. And who cares if the rescue efforts drag on and on. The taxpayers will simply foot the bill run up by all the foolishness.
The South China Morning Post here writes that a rescue by helicopter was also called off due to bad weather, snow and high winds.
Three hours ago, expedition leader Dr. Chris “Baghdad Al” Turney tweeted as he stood surrounded by miles of thick ice, “It’s so warm, it’s actually raining!” Everyone is just having a marvelous time, he assures.
See all the passengers bathing on deck in the warm sun?

"Planting almost a billion hectares of trees worldwide is the “biggest and cheapest tool” for tackling climate change, according to a new study. The researchers claimed that reforestation could remove 205 gigatonnes of carbon from the atmosphere – equivalent to about 20 years’ worth of the world’s current emissions. This has criticised as an exaggeration. It could actually be dangerous.  While the paper itself included no costings, the researchers suggested a best-case estimate of just US$300 billion to plant trees on 0.9 billion hectares. That’s just 40 US cents per tonne of carbon dioxide (CO₂) removed. More detailed studies on the costs of carbon removal through reforestation put the figure closer to US$20-50 per tonne – and even this may be optimistic at such large scales. 


      Read more:
      Reforesting an area the size of the US needed to help avert climate breakdown, say researchers – are they right?


 Our research suggests that the promises implied in such studies could actually set back meaningful action on climate change. This is because of what we call “mitigation deterrence” – promises of cheap and easy CO₂ removal in future make it less likely that time and money will be invested in reducing emissions now. Why would anyone expect governments or the finance sector to invest in renewable energy, or mass transit like high-speed rail, at costs of tens or hundreds of dollars a tonne if they – and shareholders and voters – are told that huge amounts of CO₂ can be absorbed from the atmosphere for a few dollars a tonne by planting trees? Why should anyone expect energy companies and airlines to reduce their emissions if they anticipate being able to pay to plant trees to offset everything they emit, for the paltry price of less than 50 cents a tonne. If studies like this suggest removing carbon is cheap and easy, the price of emitting carbon for businesses – in emissions trading schemes – will remain very low, rather than rising to the levels needed to trigger more challenging, yet urgently needed, forms of emission reduction. The promises of cheap and powerful tech fixes help to sideline thorny issues of politics, economics and culture. But when promises that look great in models and spreadsheets meet the real world, failure is often more likely. This has been seen before in the expectations around carbon capture and storage.  Despite promises of its future potential in the early 2000s, commercial development of the technology has scarcely progressed in the last decade. That’s despite many modelled pathways for limiting global warming still assuming – increasingly optimistically – that it will be deployed at a large scale in coming decades.

      George Monbiot Q + A – How rejuvenating nature could help fight climate change


 This model of tackling climate change goes hand in hand with another tool – pricing carbon emissions. This potentially allows companies to go on emitting by paying someone else to cut emissions or remove CO₂ elsewhere – an approach called climate offsetting. But offsetting makes exaggerated promises of carbon removal even more risky.  Tree planting financed through offset markets would guarantee the polluter could continue emitting carbon, but the market couldn’t guarantee removals to match those emissions. Trees might be planted and subsequently lost to wildfire or logging, or never planted at all.  Trusting in trees to remove carbon in future is particularly dangerous because trees are slow to grow and how much carbon they absorb is hard to measure. They’re also less likely to be able to do this as the climate warms. In many regions of the world but particularly in the tropics, growth rates are predicted to fall as the climate warms and devastating wildfires become more frequent. Relying on trees to absorb CO₂ from the atmosphere in the future also appears misleadingly cheap because of the effects of economic discounting. Economists discount the current value of costs or benefits more deeply, the further in the future they occur. Models which determine the cheapest mix of policies available all use some form of discounting. When researchers add carbon removal options like tree planting to these models, they tend to generate pathways for slowing temperature rise which reduce the role of short term action and replace it with imaginary removals late in the century.  This is because discounting over 30 to 60 years makes the removal options look incredibly cheap in today’s prices. Priming models to focus on minimising cost causes them to maximise the use of discounted future removals and reduce the use of more expensive near term emissions reduction.  I am not arguing against reforestation, nor for a purely technological response to climate change. Trees can help for many reasons – reducing flooding, shading and cooling communities, and providing habitat for biodiversity. Incentives for reforestation are important, and so are incentives for removing carbon. But we shouldn’t make trees or technology carry the whole burden of tackling climate change. That demands moving beyond technical questions, to deliver immediate political action to cut emissions, and to begin to transform economies and societies. This article was amended on July 13 2019 to clarify the proposed costs of carbon removal by reforestation."

"**There are no plans to introduce a ""vaccine passport"" to give people access to places such as pubs and restaurants once a coronavirus jab becomes available, says Michael Gove.**
The Cabinet Office minister told the BBC: ""That's not the plan.""
His comments come after the vaccine minister suggested businesses could bar those who have not had a jab.
The vaccine rollout in the UK is expected to begin before Christmas, subject to regulatory approval.
Nadhim Zahawi has been appointed as a new health minister to oversee rollout of the vaccine in England.
Asked on Monday whether people who get the Covid-19 jab will receive some kind of ""immunity passport"" to show they have been vaccinated, Mr Zahawi told the BBC: ""We are looking at the technology.
""And, of course, a way of people being able to inform their GP that they have been vaccinated.
""But, also, I think you'll probably find that restaurants and bars and cinemas and other venues, sports venues, will probably also use that system - as they have done with the (test and trace) app.
""I think that in many ways, the pressure will come from both ways, from service providers who'll say, 'Look, demonstrate to us that you have been vaccinated'.
""But, also, we will make the technology as easy and accessible as possible.""
However, asked about the possibility of vaccine passports, Mr Gove told BBC Breakfast: ""Let's not get ahead of ourselves, that's not the plan.""
""What we want to do is to make sure that we can get vaccines effectively rolled out.""
He added that individual businesses would ""of course"" have the ""capacity to make decisions about who they will admit and why"".
""But the most important thing that we should be doing at this stage is concentrating on making sure the vaccine is rolled out.""
If a Covid vaccine becomes available, the NHS will keep a log of who has received it. That will be to make sure people are given the right number of doses and to allow any monitoring and follow-up.
But asking individuals to carry proof of vaccination would be for a different reason - to cut the risk of transmitting Covid to others.
Some countries already require immunisation certificates for diseases such as polio or yellow fever to prevent global spread.
The difficulty with proposing the same for Covid-19 is we don't yet know if immunisation stops someone being contagious.
The vaccine trials so far show that jabs are very good at preventing illness, but more studies are needed to determine if they will also prevent a person from ""shedding and spreading"" the virus.
That's why it's premature to talk about vaccine passports to give people access to pubs and clubs, let alone other countries.
Health Secretary Matt Hancock told a Downing Street press conference on Monday: ""For a long time now we've been looking at the questions that minister Zahawi was talking about and the question of what's the impact on the individual in terms of what they can do.""
But he added that the government did ""not plan to mandate the vaccine"".
Many businesses have previously touted the idea of so-called immunity passports, which would allow people to get on a plane or visit a hospitality venue by showing proof that they were not infectious.
The BBC's technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones said that the idea of storing vaccination records in the NHS Test and Trace app is controversial with privacy experts warning that using the app to display a user's vaccination status might lead to employers or public places making its use compulsory.
He adds: ""Complex decisions would be involved, such as whether the app simply records immunisation or the results of later immunity tests proving that the user is no longer capable of spreading the virus."""
"As if there was any doubt, the UN’s latest report on climate change makes clear this is one of the most pressing issues of our times. And as we witness Extinction Rebellion stirring the pot of protest in the UK, that movement is connected to the geopolitical experience of other countries in important ways. This is certainly the case where Mexico is concerned, a country that has been rightly held up as a major leader on climate change in the developing world, while putting the US government to shame over its own inaction. The Paris Agreement is a crucial UN-led international arrangement that intensifies global climate decarbonisation and adaptation measures, yet the Trump administration has indicated its intention to pull out. Mexico has taken direct inspiration from the UK’s Climate Change Act, which requires a 34% reduction in national greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 (measured at 1990 emissions levels). In early June the UK government pledged a new commitment of “net zero” by 2050. Seeking to follow the UK, Mexico put its own equivalent General Law on Climate Change in place in 2012 with advice and support from British experts. The UK is now recognised as the pioneer of this type of framework approach to climate change in the developed world, with Mexico as the equivalent torchbearer in the developing world. But things are running far from smoothly in Mexico at present. The country’s recent election of “strongman” president Andrés Manuel López Obrador has significantly hampered the General Law’s implementation. Since taking office in December 2018, the leftist populist has swung his attention and sympathies towards Mexico’s powerful fossil fuel lobby, supported in turn by other powerful lobbies including cement and steel. Planning to restore the national oil company Pemex to its glory days after the previous administration opened it up to the private sector, Obrador said recently: “We are going to rescue this industry that is so important for the country’s development.” As one of the country’s biggest employers, this has gone down well with many Mexicans. But this also means the future stability of Mexico’s celebrated low-carbon transition has been cast into serious doubt. Admittedly, the General Law was rocked and buffeted by heavy political winds since its first inception under the presidency of Felipe Calderón. Calderón’s six-year term, which ended in November 2012, was far from smooth, given the damaging impact of economic recession and disquiet around his alleged suppression of the press. But the Calderón administration did succeed in elevating climate change to a position of serious importance on the Mexican policy agenda, bolstered by substantial support from the UK. Just as the General Law was bedding in, Calderón was replaced by President Enrique Peña Nieto. Beset by accusations of corruption, Nieto’s administration displayed scant regard for climate concerns, and was able to leverage one of the General Law’s great deficiencies to create a culture of climate inertia – a gaping chasm between the law itself and its implementation. In other words, the law was prescribed but the specific policies needed to achieve lower carbon emissions were not.  Enter the recently elected President Obrador, who is presently extending this troubling gap between law and action. The Mexican government has long had an I-say-you-do tendency that emanates from the presidential office downward – a tradition strengthened by this recent election. Mexican presidential administrations run for six-year terms (they are non-renewable), and the current president is only getting warmed up. Of course, in terms of broader UK/Mexico dynamics, things are far from perfect on the UK side. For starters, the UK government has now agreed to up its 2050 reduction target for emissions to net zero, but this could prove difficult to achieve in practice, and some pressure groups including Extinction Rebellion are pushing for a net zero economy by 2025. Admittedly, Mexico’s General Law lacks stringent UK-style reduction targets altogether, instead rolling some soft aspirational targets into an annex to the legal text. But Mexico is a poorer developing country that is not historically responsible for emissions release to the same extent that the highly industrialised developed world is. And so, in spite of some flaws, the Mexican scheme does set a positive example to the wider world. A growing number of countries are taking inspiration from the serious commitment Mexico and the UK have made to climate issues by scrambling to put their own version of these climate change acts in place. Added to this, a few months before Obrador took office, in July 2018, an amendment beefed up the Mexican framework slightly to bring it into line with requirements under the international Paris Agreement. So there is still much to feel optimistic about. It is to be hoped that the Obrador administration recognises that valuing and acting on Mexico’s important, pioneering framework begins at home. This will allow the flow of international green finance to Mexico from the UK and other major state funders to continue. If not, the UK will be looking elsewhere for a developing nation to support it in its commitment to fighting climate change."
"**The wearing of face masks in Jersey shops will be legally required from Tuesday at 10:00 GMT.**
Anyone older than 12 years old going into an indoor workplace as a customer must wear one, unless exempt for medical or disability reasons, the Government of Jersey said.
Failure to wear a mask could lead to a fine of up to Â£1,000.
The States Assembly voted to give ministers the power to introduce laws mandating masks on 24 November.
Mask-use will be compulsory in indoor public spaces which cannot guarantee physical distancing or other public health measures, including:
Mask exemption cards will be available for people whose health conditions mean they cannot wear them safely.
Application forms will be available online and in public locations, including parish halls, larger supermarkets and the bus station.
The law also includes a provision requiring passengers and drivers in taxis to wear masks, except where their use might impede safe driving.
This is also advised for car journeys involving people from different households, but is not required.
Masks remain strongly advised when close contact between people who do not live together is likely, particularly if it is likely to be for longer than 15 minutes, the government said.
Health minister Richard Renouf argued the law was needed to combat rising winter case numbers and the ""mixed success"" of the government's ""strong recommendation"" for indoor mask use.
He said: ""We are doing all we can to protect islanders and our health care system, while also keeping the island functioning as far as possible.""
Ministers have also been given the power to impose restrictions on gatherings of more than 10 people but ministers have not yet enacted this - current guidance suggests a limit of 10 for indoor gatherings.
An order to limit gatherings in the island in some capacity will be ""signed as soon as it is ready"", the government said."

"When we agree to send our young men and women to war, we expect the reasons why to be made clear. At least some of us will want to subject that explanation to scrutiny at the time, and often even more so with hindsight. That’s why having access to historical documents is an important democratic right. The US sent hundreds of thousands of troops into the disastrous eight-year war in Iraq, propelled by Iraq’s supposed breaches of agreements under the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and guided by rules negotiated at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).  The IAEA, founded in 1957, was set up to champion the peaceful use of nuclear science (“atoms for peace”). The NPT, established in 1968, was intended to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons beyond the nuclear states of the US, USSR, UK, France and China by regulating the movement of uranium and other nuclear material and equipment across national borders. Not only has it failed to do so – Israel, India and Pakistan have acquired nuclear weapons since – but in Iraq we had an example of IAEA rules, and the inspectors that ensure they are followed, being used to justify conventional wars. While this was evident in Iraq, the same game of nuclear brinkmanship is being played out now through negotiations dragged out over several decades between the political leadership of Iran and the IAEA’s various member nations. Yet, for all the IAEA’s demands of openness, peering into the organisation’s workings and history is like trying to prise open an impossibly stubborn black box. Why is it so difficult for researchers to obtain useful documentation from the IAEA archives? Perhaps there are reasons to remain opaque about ongoing discussions.  However, if our elected officials are pushing Iran (or any country) on their nuclear programs, it is our responsibility to take a hard look at the history of the negotiations. That means reading through the detailed discussions at the IAEA, not just about Iran or Iraq, but about the whole nuclear industry. What technologies were originally considered dangerous, when the first nations signed on to the NPT? What attitudes about national sovereignty and commercial development prevailed then? What concerns about an imperial, European- and US-dominated nuclear world were vented in these early discussions? This history is key to making informed contemporary decisions about fairness, good faith, promises made, and promises kept. Fortunately some of this documentation is available, scattered in national archives and private collections throughout the world. But you won’t find it at the IAEA in Vienna. At a recent academic conference on the origins of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, a fellow panelist surprised me by noting how frustrated she’d felt in reading my pre-circulated paper. I braced for a withering critique but instead was complimented on how, while she’d searched in vain at the IAEA archives for even basic negotiating documents on nuclear safeguards, my paper cited meetings of the IAEA Board of Governors. I had found them in the UK National Archives, as at IAEA they are still under wraps. I have spent many years triangulating Cold War stories between the archives of governments, international agencies, personal papers, and independent bodies. Sometimes what is considered sensitive in one country can be found in perfectly open, long-declassified documents in another. Why does the IAEA continue to guard secrets from decades past? The IAEA claims it is obliged to withhold documents until all of the countries mentioned in them agree to declassification. In practice, this guarantees permanent secrecy. I understood my colleague’s frustration, as I have also met a blank wall working in the IAEA archives. Years ago I discovered a trove of documents about Ronald Silow, a scientist who had, after working at a joint FAO-IAEA unit on agricultural applications of atomic energy, penned memos denouncing what he saw as the agency’s unethical behaviour.  I found the documents in Rome, at the archives of the Food and Agriculture Organisation. But when I looked into Silow’s story in the official history of the IAEA, I found only obscure references to him, his name unmentioned. When I searched the IAEA archives, the trail led nowhere: no documents related to his case were available. One document listing employees simply showed his name, crossed out. The IAEA is different from other agencies in the United Nations system. Unlike the agencies devoted to food and agriculture, global health, or to science, education, and culture, the IAEA’s remit is to promote a single set of technologies – but its remit also hands it the position of both chief salesman and chief arbiter of controversies about peaceful and military uses. It is a hammer in search of nails, but is uncomfortable with historical facts about the quality of its workmanship. The agency has a long way to go to demonstrate it understands the need for transparency. The standards it has set since the 1960s are at the cornerstone of today’s major controversies, leading to years of deadly war and leaving countries riven by internal strife. Differences of interpretation of them make the positions of the US and Iran appear irreconcilable. We are in the ridiculous position of asking experts at the IAEA for guidance that may or may not lead to more young men and women being placed in harm’s way, simply to prevent dangerous material from falling in the wrong hands. The IAEA owes us access to its history."

This year Auckland Transport says it will build over 9K of cycleways in Auckland. But that’s not good enough for Simon Wilson who whines about it in a newspaper.



Auckland Transport has “courageously” adopted the Vision Zero road safety plan, targeting 65 per cent reduction in deaths and serious injuries by 2030 and zero by 2050. But why is there no extra money for cycleways?  
  
Unusual scenes in the Auckland Transport boardroom this week. It was quite full, with the board members around one end of the large table, executives around the other, and a large group of staff, from AT, and the council and the police, sitting behind them.  
  
Andrew Bell, “implementation manager for safe systems” at AT, the team leader for most of those staffers, made a speech.   
  
“Tihei mauri ora,” he began, before going on to praise the board for adopting “more than just a document”. He was talking about the Vision Zero Strategy & Action Plan, a major, multi-agency initiative to reduce the number of deaths and serious injuries (DSIs) on our roads.  
  
The targets are very bold: to reduce the current historic highs by 20 per cent by 2021, 65 per cent by 2030 and 100 per cent by 2050. From more than 700 DSIs a year to 250 in 10 years, and to zero in 30 years.  
  
[…]Bell talked a little about the work his team had done. “We’ve talked to people who’ve lost loved ones,” he said. “We have a lot of hope. This plan requires leadership and courage. Thank you.” And they all got up and sang “Tatira mai nga iwi”.



You couldn’t make this up. Can you imagine the board of a major company getting up and all singing Kumbaya My Lord?



[…]Acting chair Wayne Donnelly beamed with pride. He said he’d been involved in safety for a long time. “Finally, we’re moving away from being a car-dominated city,” he said. “Safety is about people in vehicles and outside them.” That’s certainly true: 47 per cent of the sharp rise in DSIs in the past five years has involved people not in a vehicle.  




Translation: AT wants Aucklanders to stop driving cars.



[…]They’re excited. Sherritt told me the day before about the $700 million AT has committed to the project over the current 10-year period. Last year, $45m was allocated to safety. This year it’s $75m. Next year it will be $104m.  
  
While high-risk intersections are targeted, so are dangerous rural roads. Speeds will be lowered, although the board has extended to October 31 the deadline for the final proposals on exactly where and by how much.  
  
Already, though, lower speeds are being trialled in Te Atat&umacr and Papakura. There’s been a bit of blowback: some trucks make a lot of noise going over the raised tables at pedestrian crossings, and there are drivers who don’t believe they should have to slow down as much as the tables force them too.



Raised tables at pedestrian crossings also slow down emergency vehicles like ambulances. In other words they prevent lives from being saved.



[…]It’s all good stuff. Or is it? I asked the AT boss, Shane Ellison, what this would mean for bike lanes. He thought about it.  
  
“This doesn’t of itself trigger greater investment,” he said.  
  
What? Why not?  
  
[…]All those extra dollars and no more funding for cycleways? Nothing added to the work plan? Are you kidding?  
  
[…]Ellison said, “We’ve done better than we thought we would this year, too. We thought we’d do 7.65, I think it is, but it’s going to be 9.65. We’re overperforming.”  
  
Those numbers are kilometres. Auckland Transport is “overperforming” in its delivery of cycle lanes by adding less than 10 kilometres a year to the network.  
  
[…]The problem is fear, of angering motorists and their cheerleaders. They really need to get over that.



The fear is losing their jobs for not doing their job, ie improving transport for everyone including people who drive cars.



[…]In the AT strategy to mode-shift people away from single-occupancy vehicles, cycling is supposed to be important. Cycling helps with congestion, public health, community building and, for heaven’s sake, climate change.  
  
But in the budget and plans to support AT’s bold new focus on safety, it’s been forgotten. This is the city that once had the courage to build the pink pathway: Te Ara I Whiti. Where’s that courage now?



So there you have it. AT wants to “mode-shift” people out of cars. And in the name of safety too.

Share this...FacebookTwitterPowerful autumn storm St. Jude (dubbed Christian in Germany) swept across England and the North Sea Sunday and Monday, leaving a path of destruction in its wake. Especially hard hit were England, Northern France, Holland and the North German coast.
The storm claimed 14 lives in Europe.
Particularly hard hit was the north German port city of Hamburg, which saw wind gusts of up to 120 km/hr. That in itself is not an unusual event for the city, as North Sea storms of this magnitude occur about every 5 or 10 years. What was unusual and devastating, however, was how the city waited until the storm was raging over the city at peak fury before issuing any storm warning at all. Hamburg is governed by a coalition of socialists and environmental greens.
Meteorologist Dominik Jung of wetternet.de here writes that even though Storm Christian had been forecast for days, Hamburg city officials remained deeply asleep and did not wake up to issue any storm warning until 2:26 pm Monday afternoon. By that time the storm was already raging at its peak and the city had plunged into chaos. See wind speed chart below.

Wind speed measured at a weather station near Hamburg. Green curve – wind gusts. Blue curve – wind speed. Source: wetter24.de/html
How Hamburg officials failed to issue a storm warning is a mystery and shows that the city’s early warning system was nothing less than a debacle.
It’s not like the storm came without ample warning. A day earlier England was being battered by the storm. Hours before hitting Germany, western neighbor Holland had seen record wind speeds and France had saw widespread power outages. Jung at wetternet.de writes:
In England it was the most powerful storm in over 10 years. At the coast of Holland it was even the most violent hurricane ever observed in an October month. On the Dutch islands wind gusts of 152 km/hr were recorded. In France more than 75,000 homes lost power.”

Moreover, wetternet.de had already warned of a developing storm last week on Wednesday, read here.
Now a day later, some German meteorologists are scratching their heads over the inaction and are lashing out at the ineptitude of Hamburg officials. Jung writes that the inaction was “amazing and unacceptable“:
It wasn’t until 2:26 pm that a storm warning was issued for the Hansa City (Hamburg). At that point the storm was already going at full blast. At 2:25 pm the fire department had already declared a state of emergency.
The storm could be seen coming already days earlier. At the latest on Monday morning, when the damage and wind speeds in England and France were already known, should a storm warning have been issued in order to warn the public, police, fire and rescue services. Why a storm warning was issued only when Hamburg found itself in the middle of chaos is completely incomprehensible. […] Even stranger: The storm warning issued at 2:26 was for the time period of 3:30 pm to 8 p.m.”
According to Jung at wetternet.de, the storm produced wind gusts of close to 200 km/hr. at the North Sea islands. At Helgoland gusts of 190 km/h were measured – a record value for the island!
Yesterday afternoon as I was driving I noticed toppled trees, small branches littering the streets everywhere, and truckers struggling to keep their rigs under control. I remember thinking it was quite a fall storm, and wondered why the media was being low key about it. Now I know the answer: incompetent officials!
Ironically, these socialist and green party officials are the very ones who like to go on TV and tell viewers how terrible it is when cities like New Orleans and New York are hit by hurricanes and how US officials are too incompetent to cope with storms.
Well, after witnessing Hamburg yesterday, US officials who handled Sandy look like first class experts by comparison.
Expect the hapless Hamburg officials to react by blaming “climate change” for the storm’s “unexpected intensity”.

 **Introduction**



It is galling to hear administration officials characterize the auto bailouts as “successful.” The word should be off‐​limits when describing this unfortunate chapter in U.S. economic history. At most, bailout proponents and apologists might respectfully argue — and still be wrong, however — that the bailouts were necessary evils undertaken to avert greater calamity.



But calling the bailouts “successful” is to whitewash the diversion of funds from the Troubled Assets Relief Program by two administrations for purposes unauthorized by Congress; the looting and redistribution of claims against GM’s and Chrysler’s assets from shareholders and debt‐​holders to pensioners; the use of questionable tactics to bully stakeholders into accepting terms to facilitate politically desirable outcomes; the unprecedented encroachment by the executive branch into the finest details of the bankruptcy process to orchestrate what bankruptcy law experts describe as “Sham” sales of Old Chrysler to New Chrysler and Old GM to New GM; the costs of denying Ford and the other more deserving automakers the spoils of competition; the costs of insulating irresponsible actors, such as the United Autoworkers, from the outcomes of an apolitical bankruptcy proceeding; the diminution of U.S. moral authority to counsel foreign governments against similar market interventions; and the lingering uncertainty about the direction of policy under the current administration that pervades the business environment to this very day.



In addition to the above, there is the fact that taxpayers are still short tens of billions of dollars on account of the GM bailout without serious prospects for ever being made whole. Thus, acceptance of the administration’s pronouncement of auto bailout success demands profound gullibility or willful ignorance. Sure, GM has experienced recent profits and Chrysler has repaid much of its debt to the Treasury. But if proper judgment is to be passed, then all of the bailout’s costs and benefits must be considered. Otherwise, calling the bailout a success is like applauding the recovery of a drunken driver after an accident, while ignoring the condition of the family he severely maimed.



This testimony provides a more comprehensive assessment of the costs and lasting implications of the GM bailout than the administration has been willing to undertake publicly.



 **Crisis Mongering**



On November 5, 2008, the Center for Automotive Research, a Detroit‐​based consulting firm, released the results of a study warning that as many as three million jobs were at stake in the automotive sector unless the U.S. government acted with dispatch to ensure the continued operation of all of the Big Three automakers.1 Detroit’s media blitz was underway. It was timed to remind then‐​President‐​Elect Obama, as he contemplated his victory the morning after, of the contribution to his success by certain constituencies now seeking assistance themselves. The CAR report’s projection of three million lost jobs was predicated on the fantastical worst‐​case scenario that if one of the Big Three were to go out of business and liquidate, numerous firms in the auto supply chain would go under as well, bringing down the remaining two Detroit auto producers, then the foreign nameplate U.S. producers and the rest of the parts supply chain. The job loss projections animating the national discussion were based on an assumption of a total loss of all automobile and auto parts production and sales jobs nationwide. Importantly, the report gave no consideration to the more realistic scenario that one or two of the Detroit automakers might seek Chapter 11 protection to reorganize.



The subsequent public relations effort to make the case for federal assistance was pitched in a crisis atmosphere with an air of certainty that the only real alternative to massive federal assistance was liquidation and contagion. The crisis‐​mongering was reminiscent of former‐​Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson’s and Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke’s insistence six weeks earlier that there was no time for Congress to think, only time for it to act on a financial sector bailout (i.e., TARP), lest the economy face financial ruin.



About the economic situation at that time, incoming White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel said, “You never want a serious crisis to go to waste … [t]his crisis provides the opportunity for us to do things that you could not do before.“2



The mainstream media obliged the script, elevating the automobile industry “crisis” to the top of the news cycle for the next month, and helping to characterize the debate in the simplistic, polarizing dichotomy of “Main Street versus Wall Street.” The notion that some financial institutions took risks, lost big, and were rescued by Washington became the prevailing argument for bailing out the auto companies, and the specific facts about viability and worthiness were all but totally ignored.



But public opinion quickly changed when the CEOs of GM, Ford, and Chrysler laid waste to months of public relations planning and millions of dollars spent trying to cultivate a winning message when they each arrived in Washington, tin cups in hand, aboard their own corporate jets. That fateful episode turned the media against Detroit and reminded Americans — or at least opened their minds to the prospect — that the automakers were in dire straits because of bad decisions made in the past and helped convince many that a shake out, instead of a bailout, was the proper course of action.



A few weeks later, on the same day that the CEOs returned to Washington, attempting to show contrition by making the trip from Detroit in their companies’ most eco‐​friendly cars, a new automobile assembly plant opened for business in Greensburg, Indiana. Although the hearing on Capitol Hill received far more media coverage, the unveiling of Honda’s newest facility in the American heartland spoke volumes about the true state of the U.S. car industry — and provided another example of why the bailout was misguided. The U.S. auto industry was not at risk. Two companies were suffering the consequences of years of incompetence and inefficiency exacerbated by persistent overcapacity and a deep recession. Normal bankruptcies for the two automakers were viable options, but certain stakeholders didn’t like their prospects under those circumstances.



Today, when President Obama contends that his administration saved the auto industry, he evokes memories of those CAR projections of 2–3 million job losses in the absence of government intervention. Without those inflated figures concocted during a time of “crisis,” the 225,000 jobs lost in the auto sector since November 2008 seem quite mild — even worthy of praise.3



 **That Which is Seen**



While bailout enthusiasts hail GM’s first‐​quarter earnings as proof that the administration saved the auto industry, President Obama should know better than to gloat. No such feat was accomplished and the imperative of extricating the government from GM’s operations has yet to be achieved.



With profits of $3.2 billion, the first quarter of 2011 was GM’s best performance in ten years and its fifth‐​consecutive profitable quarter. That’s good for GM, and predictably those earnings have been hailed by some as a validation of government intervention. _The Washington Post_ ’s E.J. Dionne asserted: “Far too little attention has been paid to the success of the government’s rescue of the Detroit‐​based auto companies, and almost no attention has been paid to how completely and utterly wrong opponents of the bailout were when they insisted it was doomed to failure.”



Former Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm tweeted: “To all of you in the strangle‐​government crowd, who said the bailout would never work — I’m just sayin.”



Dionne and Granholm have created a straw man, contending that bailout critics thought that the government couldn’t resuscitate GM. But the most thoughtful criticism of the bailout was not predicated on the notion that GM couldn’t be saved by the government marshaling the vast resources at its disposal. That opposition was borne of concern that that the government would do just that, and in the process impose many more costs and inflict greater damage. And that’s what it did.



But Dionne and Granholm, like others before them, stand slack‐​jawed, in awe, ready and willing to buy the Brooklyn Bridge, donning blinders and viewing just a narrow sliver of the world, oblivious to the fact that related events have been transpiring in the other 359 degrees that surround him. They are the perfect Bastiat foils, incapable of discerning the costs that are not immediately apparent.4



But only the most gullible observers would accept GM’s profits as an appropriate measure of the wisdom of the auto bailout. Those profits speak only to the fact that politicians committed over $50 billion to the task of rescuing a single company. With debts expunged, cash infused, inefficiencies severed, ownership reconstituted, sales rebates underwritten, and political obstacles steamrolled — all in the midst of a cyclical U.S. recovery and structural global expansion in auto demand — only the most incompetent operation could fail to make big profits. To that point, it’s worth noting that more than half of GM’s reported profit — $1.8 billion of $3.2 billion — is attributable to the one‐​time sales of shares in Ally Financial and Delphi, which says nothing about whether GM can make and sell automobiles profitably going forward.



In the process of “rescuing” GM, the government opened a Pandora’s Box. Any legitimate verdict on the efficacy of the intervention must account for the costs of mitigating the problems that escaped the box.



 **That Which is Not Seen**



 _Spoils of Competition Denied — Market Process Short‐​Circuited_



The intervention on GM’s behalf denied the spoils of competition — the market share, sales revenues, profits, and productive assets — to Ford, Honda, Hyundai, and all of the other automakers that made better products, made better operational decisions, were more efficient, or were more responsive to consumer demands than GM, thereby short‐​circuiting a feedback loop that is essential to the healthy functioning of competitive market economies.



Corporate bailouts are clearly unfair to taxpayers, but they are also unfair to the successful firms in the industry, who are implicitly taxed and burdened when their competition is subsidized. In a properly functioning market economy, the better firms — the ones that are more innovative, more efficient, and more popular among consumers — gain market share or increase profits, while the lesser firms contract. This process ensures that limited resources are used most productively.



It has been suggested that I view GM’s fate as a matter of national indifference. That’s correct, because I have not made the mistake of conflating GM’s condition with that of the U.S. auto industry. Whether or not there are so‐​called “national interests” in ensuring the existence of a healthy domestic auto industry (and I’m not convinced there are), health comes through an evolutionary process in which the companies that have made the right decisions survive and grow, and those that have made bad decisions contract and sometimes even disappear.



It is not only fair, but efficient and wise that the market rewards companies that make better products at better prices with higher profits and larger market shares, while the companies that make undesirable products at high cost lose profits and market share.



There is still enormous overcapacity in the U.S. auto industry, reconciliation of which the bailout of GM (and Chrsyler) has deferred at great cost to the other firms and their workers.



 _Weakening of the Rule of Law_



Although legislation to provide funding for an auto bailout passed in the House of Representatives in December 2008, the bill did not garner enough support in the Senate, where it died. Prospects for any form of taxpayer bailout seemed remote and the proper course of action for GM and Chrysler, reorganization under Chapter 11, appeared imminent. An interventionist bullet, seemingly, had been dodged.



But then, just days after then‐​Secretary Paulson claimed to have no authority to use TARP funds to support the auto companies, President Bush announced that he would authorize bridge loans from the TARP of $17.4 billion to GM and Chrysler. That opened the door to further mischief and, ultimately, another $60 billion was diverted from TARP by the Obama administration for unauthorized purposes related to the auto bailout.



Likewise, the Obama administration treated the GM (and Chrysler) bankruptcy as a Section 363 sale, which are known among bankruptcy lawyers as “Sham” sales. These 363 sales are intended to sell assets out of bankruptcy from one company to another, but are not intended as vehicles to facilitate entire corporate restructurings. In a reorganization process, all creditors are given the right to vote on the proposed plan, as well as the opportunity to offer competing reorganization plans. A 363 asset sale has no such requirements, and is being used increasingly by companies seeking to avert paying legitimate claims to creditors.



That the U.S. executive branch would pretend that the restructuring of GM was nothing more than an asset sale and deny creditors the right to vote or to offer competing bids wreaks of crony capitalism.



Though it is a difficult cost to quantify, executive branch overreach — to put it mildly — is a threat to the U.S. system of checks and balances and an affront to the rule of law.



 _Executive Encroachment into Bankruptcy Process_



General Motors was a perfectly viable company that could have been restructured through normal bankruptcy proceedings. The big question was whether GM could have received financing to operate during bankrupt, given the problems in credit markets in 2008 and 2009. Instead of commandeering the bankruptcy process as a condition of providing debtor in possession financing, the Obama administration could have provided the funds and allowed an apolitical, independent bankruptcy process to take place. But the administration’s rationale for a hand‐​on approach was that it wanted to ensure that taxpayers weren’t just throwing good money after bad, chasing empty promises made by executives with credibility problems. Yet, even with the administration’s plans for GM’s post‐​bankruptcy ownership thrust upon the company without allowance for consideration of competing plans, taxpayers will lose between $10–20 billion (without considering the $12 to $14 billion costs of the unorthodox tax breaks granted GM by the administration).



The administration’s willingness to insulate important political allies, like the UAW, from the consequences of their decisions, to shift possession of assets from shareholders and debt‐​holders to pensioners, and to deny “deficiency” claims to creditors who were short‐​changed, will make it more difficult for companies in politically important industries to borrow from private sources when they are in trouble, thereby increasing their reliance on the government purse.



The government’s willingness to intervene in the auto market under false pretenses to pick winners and losers is a significant cause of the regime uncertainty that has pervaded the U.S. economy, deterred business investment and job creation, and slowed the economic recovery ever since.



 **Outstanding Financial Costs**



As Washington has been embroiled in a discussion about national finances that features figures in the trillions of dollars, one might be tempted to marginalize as paltry the sum still owed taxpayers from the GM bailout. That figure is estimated to be about $27 billion, which accounts for the $50 billion outlay minus approximately $23 billion raised at GM’s IPO last November. But that is a very conservative figure considering that it excludes: $12-$14 billion in unorthodox tax breaks granted to GM in bankruptucy; $17 billion in funds committed from the TARP to GM’s former financial arm GMAC (which was supported to facilitate GM sales); GM’s portion of the $25 billion Energy Department slush fund to underwrite research and development in green auto technology; and the $7,500 tax credit granted for every new purchase of a Chevy Volt. There may be other subsidies, as well.



With respect to GM, taxpayers are on the line for much more than is commonly discussed.



The administration wants to put maximum distance between the episode of GM’s nationalization and the 2012 campaign season, which is nearly upon us. In that regard, the administration would like to sell the Treasury’s remaining 500 million shares as soon as possible. But the administration would also like to “make the taxpayers whole.” The problem for the president on that score is that the stock price — even with all of the happy news about the auto industry turnaround — isn’t cooperating. As of this morning, GM stock is hovering just under $30 per share. If all of the 500 million remaining publicly‐​owned shares could be sold at that price, the Treasury would net $15 billion. Add that to the $23 billion raised from the initial public offering last November, and the “direct” public loss on GM is about $12 billion — calculated as a $50 billion outlay minus a $38 billion return. (And not considering all of the extra costs identified above.)



To net $50 billion, those 500 million public shares must be sold at an average price of just over $53 — a virtual impossibility anytime soon. Why? The most significant factor suppressing the stock value is the market’s knowledge that the largest single holder of GM stock wants to unload about 500 million shares in the short term. That fact will continue to trump any positive news about GM and its profit potential, not that such news should be expected.



Projections about gasoline prices vary, but as long as prices at the pump remain in the $4 range, GM is going to suffer. Among major automakers, GM is most exposed to the downside of high gasoline prices. Despite all of the subsidies and all of the hoopla over the Chevy Volt (only 1,700 units have been sold through April 2011) and the Chevy Cruse (now subject to a steering column recall that won’t help repair negative quality perceptions), GM does not have much of a competitive presence in the small car market. Though GM held the largest overall U.S. market share in 2010, it had the smallest share (8.4%) of the small car market, which is where the demand will be if high gas prices persist. GM will certainly have to do better in that segment once the federally mandated average fleet fuel efficiency standard rises to 35.5 miles per gallon in 2016.



Reaping what it sowed, the administration finds itself in an unenviable position. It can entirely divest of GM in the short term at what would likely be a $10-to-$20 billion taxpayer loss (the stock price will drop if 500 million shares are put up for sale in short period) and face the ire of an increasingly cost‐ and budget‐​conscious electorate. Or the administration can hold onto the stock, hoping against hope that GM experiences economic fortunes good enough to more than compensate for the stock price‐​suppressing effect of the market’s knowledge of an imminent massive sales, while contending with accusations of market meddling and industrial policy.



The longer the administration retains shares in GM, it will be tempted to meddle to achieve politically desirable results.



 **Redefining Success**



Or, the administration can do what it is going to do: first, lower expectations that the taxpayer will ever recover $50 billion. Here’s a recent statement by Tim Geithner: “We’re going to lose money in the auto industry … We didn’t do these things to maximize return. We did them to save jobs. The biggest impact of these programs was in the millions of jobs saved.” That’s a safe counterfactual, since it can never be tested or proved. (There are 225,000 fewer jobs in the auto industry as of April 2011 than there were in November 2008, when the bailout process began.)



Second, the administration will argue that the Obama administration is only on the hook for $40 billion (the first $10 billion having coming from Bush). In a post‐​IPO, November 2010 statement revealing of a man less concerned with nation’s finances than his own political prospects, President Obama asserted: “American taxpayers are now positioned to recover more than _my administration_ invested in GM, and that’s a good thing.” (My emphasis).



 **Lasting Implications**



The lasting implications of the bailout will depend on whether or not Americans ultimately accept the narrative that the bailout was a success. If it is considered a success, the threshold for interventions will have been lowered and Americans will have the opportunity to judge similar bailouts in the future. If it is considered a failure — as it should be — the lasting implications will be less destructive because the threshold that tempts interventionists will be higher. On that score, contrary to what the administration would have the public believe, gauging the “success” of the GM bailout requires consideration of more than just the ratio of finances recouped over financial outlays.



There are numerous other costs that don’t factor into that equation.



If the bailout is considered a success, some of the likely lasting implications will include the following:



 **Conclusion**



The objection to the auto bailout was not that the federal government wouldn’t be able to marshal adequate resources to help GM. The most serious concerns were about the consequences of that intervention — the undermining of the rule of law, the property confiscations, the politically driven decisions and the distortion of market signals.



Any verdict on the auto bailouts must take into account, among other things, the illegal diversion of TARP funds, the forced transfer of assets from shareholders and debt‐​holders to pensioners and their union; the higher‐​risk premiums consequently built into U.S. corporate debt; the costs of denying Ford and the other more worthy automakers the spoils of competition; the costs of insulating irresponsible actors, such as the autoworkers’ union, from the outcomes of an apolitical bankruptcy proceeding; the diminution of U.S. moral authority to counsel foreign governments against market interventions; and the lingering uncertainty about policy that pervades the business environment to this day.



GM’s recent profits speak only to the fact that politicians committed more than $50 billion to the task of rescuing those companies and the United Auto Workers. With debts expunged, cash infused, inefficiencies severed, ownership reconstituted, sales rebates underwritten and political obstacles steamrolled — all in the midst of a recovery in U.S. auto demand — only the most incompetent operations could fail to make profits.



But taxpayers are still short at least $10 billion to $20 billion (depending on the price that the government’s 500 million shares of GM will fetch), and there is still significant overcapacity in the auto industry.



The administration should divest as soon as possible, without regard to the stock price. Keeping the government’s tentacles around a large firm in an important industry will keep the door open wider to industrial policy and will deter market‐​driven decision‐​making throughout the industry, possibly keeping the brakes on the recovery. Yes, there will be a significant loss to taxpayers. But the right lesson to learn from this chapter in history is that government interventions carry real economic costs — only some of which are readily measurable.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhat follows is more reaction to AR5 SPM – from two German experts.
First I asked geologist Dr. Sebastian Lüning by e-mail for his impression of the IPCC’s summary. Lüning has published over 20 peer-reviewed papers in the field of geology and is the co-author of the IPCC critical book “The Neglected Sun“.
Photo Lüning: www.kaltesonne.de/
He summarizes: “Once you boil down the science, there no case left for alarm.” He continues:
When I read the reports in the mainstream media, I was shocked that some of the key findings were not properly reported: unexpected warming stop during the last 15 years not explainable by current models, the Medieval Warm Period in at least parts of the world was as warm as today. This should have been reported. Instead they wrote that the sea level threat increased, which is not really true. There has been no acceleration of sea level in the past few decades and a large European Research Consortium has recently ruled out the most scary sea level prognoses (European Research Consortium dismisses extreme sea level rise prognoses). The East Antarctic Ice Cap and Arctic sea ice trend actually is growing, drought and storm occurrences are well within the limits of natural variability. Current Greenland temperatures are on the level of the 1930s. Forget the models, the real data show that there is no cause for any alarm.”
Lüning also left a reader comment at NoTricksZone. One part of his comment is worth mentioning again (my emphasis):
We argue mostly with historical and geological data which clearly show that natural climate factors always played a key role in pre-industrial times, hence also today. Interestingly, we have not found any hard evidence for CO2 having been a climate driver in the past. Therefore we say that half the warming of the last 150 years could be man-made at most. This is a maximum value. It could also be that CO2 has not been involved at all or only marginally in the warming we have seen.”
Also veteran meteorologist Dr. Karsten Brandt at donnerwetter.de had some criticism for the IPCC.

Dr. Karsten Brandt. Photo: www.donnerwetter.de/.
Some excerpts of what he wrote:
The warming stop of the last 15 years gets explained by the oceans absorbing heat more strongly. This stop in warming is hardly treated critically in the report, and thus the prognoses for the next years are everything but certain. …
Concerning the impacts of climate change, the uncertainties are very high. For example the prognoses for Europe can all be questionable because the margin of error is so large. ….
The global community must act, but how? This is precisely the crux of the problem. From climate science we tend to see ideological suggestions where economic growth is viewed negatively. But here strong growth could help the planet to develop technologies and ideas against climate change. The idea coming from many economic philosophers that man has to be steered away from outer targets of prosperity and towards an inner target of self-fulfillment may be well intentioned, but it is hardly accepted by a broader audience, and not all by poor countries.
The best solution is probably a gradual, soft transition to an energy base that focusses on CO2 avoidance globally over the next 50 to 100 years.”
To be fair. Dr. Brandt thinks that rising CO2 emissions do pose risks that cannot be ignored, and that it is a good idea to get away from fossil fuels.

Today’s face of the day is **National MP Matt King** who caused Green party and MSM heads to explode when he posted the following on his Facebook page:



Some words ( not all ) of wisdom taken from NZCPR website.



 **If I wanted New Zealand to fail …**



To suffer, not prosper; to despair, not dream.



I would start with energy.



I’d cut off much of New Zealand’s supply of cheap, abundant energy. I couldn’t take it by force. So, I’d make New Zealanders feel guilty for using the energy that heats their homes, fuels their cars, runs their businesses, and powers their economy.



I’d make cheap energy expensive, so that expensive energy would seem cheap.



I would all-but-outlaw New Zealand’s abundant sources of oil, gas and coal – making it necessary to import it from overseas.



 **If I wanted New Zealand to fail …**



I’d use our schools to teach one generation of children that our factories and cars and cows are causing runaway Global Warming, and I’d muster a straight face so I could teach the next generation that their parents are to blame for killing the planet.



And when it’s cold outside, I’d call it Climate Change instead.



I’d imply that New Zealand’s cities and factories could run on hydro, wind and solar power, without a fossil fuel backup for when the rain doesn’t fall, the wind doesn’t blow, and the sun doesn’t shine.



I’d teach children how to ignore the hypocrisy of condemning logging, mining and farming — while having roofs over their heads, heat in their homes and food on their tables.



I would ridicule as “deniers” those who question the climate scaremongering of politicians, and when they remind people about the laws of nature – that climate change is natural and mankind’s impact is minimal – I’d enlist a sympathetic media to drown them out.



 **If I wanted New Zealand to fail…**



I would create countless new regulations and seldom cancel old ones. They would be so complicated that only bureaucrats, lawyers and lobbyists could understand them. That way small businesses with big ideas wouldn’t stand a chance.



I would never teach children that the free market is the only force in human history to uplift the poor, establish the middle class and create lasting prosperity.



Instead, I’d demonise wealth creators, property owners, and prosperity itself, so they will not miss what they will never have.



 **If I wanted New Zealand to fail …**



I would empower bureaucrats to bully Kiwis out of their dreams and their property rights by imposing such strict and costly regulations that it’d be almost impossible for farmers to farm, miners to mine, loggers to log, and builders to build.



And because I don’t believe in free markets, I’d invent false ones. I’d devise fictitious products – like carbon credits – and trade them in imaginary markets. I’d convince people that this would create jobs and be good for the economy, but I would never say where the new jobs will be found.



 **If I wanted New Zealand to fail …**



For every concern, I’d invent a crisis; and for every crisis, I’d invent a cause; like shutting down entire industries and killing tens of thousands of jobs in the name of cutting greenhouse gas emissions and saving the planet. And when everyone learned the stunning irony that imported oil and gas and coal would create more emissions than home-grown products, it would already be decades too late.



 **If I wanted New Zealand to fail …**



I’d make it easier to stop commerce than start it – easier to kill jobs than create them – more fashionable to resent success than to seek it.



 **If I wanted New Zealand to fail …**



I would transform the environmental agenda from a document of conservation to an economic suicide pact. I would concede entire industries like farming and mining and exploration to our economic rivals by imposing regulations that cost billions. I would celebrate those who preach environmental austerity in public while indulging lavish lifestyles in private.



 **If I wanted New Zealand to fail …**



I’d convince New Zealanders that capitalism is harmful, and that socialism and more regulation is the answer.



I would prey on the goodness and decency of ordinary New Zealanders.



I would only need to convince them … that all of this is for the greater good.



 **If I wanted New Zealand to fail, I suppose I wouldn’t change a thing.**



Roll on election 2020.

"The UK’s climate change targets are world-leading. Yet there is no clear plan in place to achieve them. That is the stark message of a new progress report from the government’s official advisers, the Committee on Climate Change. The Committee is forthright in its criticism of government. On its report card, assessing progress against 25 policies needed to meet carbon targets, there is just one green tick. But, beyond asking for the prime minister to set up a “climate cabinet”, the Committee has much less to say about how government – at both national and local level – should be reconfigured to make climate action a priority. The stark truth is that no one is in charge. Under the UK’s Climate Change Act, there is a statutory requirement on the government as a whole to meet targets. This leaves the prime minister with ultimate authority, but no clarity about which department should do what. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) oversees progress, but other departments have no carbon targets or responsibilities, and BEIS cannot tell them what to do. Neither are there targets or responsibilities for local areas. The Committee on Climate Change can offer advice, but the route between this advice and policy delivery is, to put it politely, unclear. This results in some serious contradictions. Transport results in a quarter of the UK’s emissions, yet the Department for Transport’s strategic plan, published just last month, fails to mention climate action as a key driver. There is the odd reference to “clean growth” and “sustainability”, but also support for airport expansion and many new roads. The only policy that unequivocally contributes to the effort is the pledge to phase out diesel and petrol cars by 2040, which most commentators, including the CCC, have said is too little, too late. Meanwhile, the Treasury and BEIS work together to maximise oil and gas extraction from the North Sea. When questioned by MPs, they dismissed the idea that this is incompatible with climate targets. The energy regulator, Ofgem, has a duty to protect consumers, but again, no clear carbon target or responsibility. As a result, many of its day-to-day decisions, like the recent review of charging arrangements for electricity networks, work against the transition to zero-carbon. Examples like this abound across government and its agencies. At local level, the picture is no clearer. Local authorities have no statutory responsibility, and no specific resources, for climate action. Many have now shouldered responsibility by declaring a “climate emergency”, but when it comes to action they have limited control over policies and budgets, and little room for manoeuvre. As part of the IGov project at the University of Exeter, I have been helping to develop proposals for an institutional framework which would enable coordinated climate strategy, to implement the transition to zero-carbon. We advocate allocating carbon targets to each government department.  We also propose a sister organisation to the Committee on Climate Change, which we are calling the “Energy Transformation Commission”. This body would implement the transformation process set by government, through a process of brokering, coordination, consensus-building and engagement. The ETC would take advice from the Committee on Climate Change and the National Infrastructure Commission, and works with all government departments. It would be a focal point for crucial decisions that need cross-government coordination, like the transition to electric vehicles, and decarbonisation of home heating – two areas where the CCC says policies are lagging behind. At local level, we advocate devolving climate governance to local authorities. This should take the form of a new statutory duty on local authorities, requiring them to produce a transformation plan, which includes setting and meeting devolved carbon budgets. Central government should give local authorities the freedom and funding to enable this process, letting them coordinate across energy, planning, transport and economic development. Being clearer about climate responsibilities across government would provide the vital link between statutory targets and the policies to achieve them. It would make the policymaking process more transparent and less open to lobbying by those who stand to lose from decisive policy. Our research on the UK energy sector has shown that big energy companies, rather than the emerging innovators, have a disproportionate influence over governance decisions. Opening up climate strategy to public debate would also strengthen the government’s hand: research shows that people want to see climate action, but are currently cut out of decisions. The recent decision by six parliamentary select committees to hold a citizens’ assembly on climate change is an encouraging step toward climate democracy. It’s only been a month since the UK legislated for net-zero. Over the coming months, crucial decisions about implementation will be needed. There is nothing more critical than deciding who is in charge.

"

The other day I noted that the budget cuts agreed to last week contained lots of familiar faces. Many of the agencies and programs getting a trim were also cut in 1995 in a rescissions package put together by Gingrich Republicans. In the fifteen intervening years, federal spending exploded across the board, which means that an occasional trim job doesn’t accomplish much if the goal is to limit government.   
  
  
The reason why is that if the scope of government activities isn’t curtailed, the cuts will be short‐​lived. As long as the agencies and their programs remain, special interests won’t stop agitating Congress to continue, or more likely, increase, funding.   
  
  
A recent article in _The Hill_ reports that lobbyists are already hard at work: 



Groups that advocate for everything from more foreign aid to bolstering the nation’s transportation system saw several of their favorite government programs suffer deep spending cuts in the fiscal year 2011 budget deal.   
  
  
With millions of dollars now axed from what they consider key federal initiatives, groups are planning to redouble their efforts and lobby to restore as much funding as possible in next year’s budget.



(Note to reporter: A lot of adjectives could be used to describe the spending cuts. “Deep” is not one of them.)   
  
  
A fellow who lobbies for foreign aid argues that cutting it won’t balance the budget and that “We need to be planting the seeds for future economic prosperity around the world.” It’s true that even _eliminating_ foreign aid wouldn’t balance the budget, but every little bit helps. But what’s striking is his arrogant pronouncement that “we” (taxpayers) need to be forced by the federal government to send our money abroad for the causes he fancies.   
  
  
A lobbyist with the National League of Cities is relieved that the GOP didn’t get the small cut in local handouts that were originally proposed, but is nonetheless concerned about the “anti‐​spending climate in Washington”: 



‘We’re talking about staff layoffs at the city level. Cities are also going to have completely reorganize their budgets mid‐​year and prioritize some things out.’   
  
  
‘In this environment, the numbers from fiscal year 2011 might be the new baseline but our message isn’t going to change,’ Wallace said. ‘We’re focusing on those local programs that create jobs and spur economic growth.’



Cities prioritizing spending? Heaven forbid. Suck more money out of the private sector in order to save bureaucratic deadweight in local government? That doesn’t sound like a recipe for economic growth to me. (See here for more on the problems with federal subsidies to state and local governments.)   
  
  
Then there are the transportation lobbyists. These folks would probably argue that a giant escalator to nowhere would be a wise use of taxpayer money: 



Dean’s group is lamenting spending cuts made to the high‐​speed rail program, transit security grants as well as funding for “fixed guideway” projects, which include commuter trains, cable cars and ferryboats among other public transit systems.



For the fans of _The Simpsons_ who didn’t catch the escalator reference, see this link for my feelings on government‐​funded rail projects. (Fans and non‐​fans should check out these essays on urban transit subsidies and high‐​speed rail.)   
  
  
In Washington, it’s the squeaky wheel that gets greased. Lobbyists for government programs exist to make sure that Congress hears their wheel squeaking. Yes, the deck is stacked against those who are forced to foot the bill, but if taxpayers want federal agencies and their programs to get more than a trimming every fifteen years or so, now is the time to make a lot more noise.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German national weather service (Deutsche Wetterdienst – DWD) writes in its latest press release on how 2013 is shaping up climate-wise in Germany. No warming anywhere!
In fact, the recent trend looks like a strong cooling.
Already regions in the German lowlands have seen frost this fall – which is early. For 2013 so far the DWD writes:
The mean temperature for the first 9 months of 2013 (January to September) in Germany was 9.5°C. That corresponds to the mean for the 1961-1990 reference period, 9.4°C. But it was significantly below the mean of the warmer comparison period of 1981 – 2010, 10.2°C.”
So far Germany’s 2013 is running 0.7°C below the 1981 – 2010 reference period. The DWD lists the top 9 warmest years in Germany since 1880: 






2000
9,9


2001
9,9


2002
9,7


2003
9,6


2004
9,6


2005
9,6


2006
9,5


2007
9,5


2008
9,5



Table source: DWD.
By sheer coincidence the warmest year was 2000 with each subsequent year getting progressively cooler. 2013 is not anywhere near the top, which means that it is one of the coldest this century. I guess the warmist DWD chose the tabular format because the trend is not obvious to the reader’s eye. Hiding inconvenient trends is very much in vogue nowadays. Since 1880, the mean temperature for Germany is 8.2°C, the DWD says.
Glaciers in Swiss Alps gain in mass
There are more signs that things are cooling down globally, in stark contradiction to what the IPCC scientists insist.

Hajo Smit of climategate.nl writes about a report appearing at the Swiss Schweiz am Sonntag. The article is titled: “The First Glaciers Are Growing Again” with the introduction: “2013 was a good summer for the Swiss Alps. The glaciers lost the least amount of ice in 10 years.”
The report quotes glaciologist Matthias Huss:
‘This is the least ice melt I’ve seen in a long time. It appears that they even slightly gained in mass,’ says glaciologist Matthias Huss of the University of Freiburg. This positive development can be traced back to the snowy and long winter. ‘And even though July and August were very hot, the thick snow cover protected the ice.'”
I have to remind readers that it’s not only Swiss Alps glaciers who are ignoring the IPCC, but so are the Himalayan glaciers.
Flashback: last year Die kalte Sonne site posted a story titled “Surprise: Himalayan Glaciers Have Not Lost Any ICE In The Last 10 Years!“. Die kalte Sonne writes:
Using GRACE satellite measurements, a team of researchers from the University of Boulder and the National Center for Atmospheric Research NCAR in Colorado (USA) were able to document that the glaciers in the Himalayas and surrounding mountains. … The IPCC warned in its last report of 2007 that all Himalayan glaciers would melt away by the year 2035.
And if the IPCC were not credible enough, Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research director Prof. Hans Joachim Schellnhuber said that the Himalayan glaciers melting by 2035 was “very easy to calculate“. So it has to be true!
Later of course this assertion was exposed as purely preposterous. The original publication of the Himalayan glacier melt stop is in Nature: Jacob et al. 2012 .

Share this...FacebookTwitterRight now we have over 65% more Arctic sea ice area, a record high sea ice area around Antarctica, a record low tornado season, record late start start hurricane season, 15 years of no global warming, a cooling tropical Pacific and a “strongly cooling Southern Ocean”.

At Twitter Axel Bojanowski links to his Spiegel article describing a climate science that is more confused and uncertain than ever.
The above are just some examples illustrating just how embarrassingly wrong climate science has been. But hey! The PIK says Munich had a record warm Christmas day last year!
Just breaking is the study that blames a cooling tropical Pacific for the stall in global warming, and it is hitting the climate science community like a meteor. If anything, it confirms that natural climate cycles do dominate after all.
Meteorologist Joe Bastardi commented: “You gotta love these guys ‘discovering’ what all of us have been saying.”
Spiegel: Hockey Stick “has lost its weight”
Reaction is now coming from Spiegel. Axel Bojanowski starts by reminding readers: “The climate has not warmed further in 15 years” despite rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations. The temperature hockey stick is also broken. Here Bojanowski writes that “the recent climate development means that it has lost its weight” and that 98% of the climate models had made false forecasts, citing a new study by German scientists.”
Bojanowski explains how the oceans appear to be absorbing heat and keeping the global atmospheric temperature stable, saying that most of the energy ends up in the oceans; “They absorb about 90% of the heat.” But this is not a discovery, and is something the skeptics have been saying for years. It’s actually one of Fritz Vahrenholt’s and Sebastian Lüning’s central themes in their book THE NEGLECTED SUN, for which they were viciously attacked and ridiculed by the German science and media establishment just last year. Now we see they were right.
Recall that the strong El Nino events of the 1980s and 1990s were ominous signs of global warming as heat trapped by CO2 was warming the ocean surface. Now, suddenly when things are cooling, it’s the other way around: the oceans are cooling the atmosphere!
Bojanowski explains that although the tropical East Pacific covers only a twelfth of the Earth’s surface, the cool surface waters there have kept the global temperature from rising over the last years. Spiegel writes that leading climatologists such as Stefan Brönnimann of the University of Bern, Doug Smith of the Met Office, and Gerald Meehl of the National Center for Atmospheric Research say that the explanation has considerable merit.
Bojanowski explains that it’s a mystery to scientists as to why the Pacific would cool in the first place. But not everyone is convinced that this is the explanation for the recent global warming stop. Kevin Trenberth for example still hasn’t found his missing heat. Spiegel writes:

The study does not explain in any way the unusual temperature development,” says Kevin Trenberth of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in the USA (NOAA). An explanation is missing as to where the heat may have gone. A team led by Trenberth recently were able to show that the deep ocean may have swallowed up a third of the global warming.”
Quadruple whammy
Bojanowski then looks at other possible explanations for the “missing heat”, writing that there may have been “changes in the Earth’s radiation budget.”
For example upper atmospheric layers have dried out over the past years. The water vapor there acts as a heat buffer. The aridity of the stratosphere has contributed to the pause in the warming, scientists report.”
Bojanoski also brings up that volcanoes or Chinese aerosols may have dimmed out the warming. The whole thing is an increasingly baffling mystery to the scientists.
On stratosphere, is Spiegel describing the 4th component of a quadruple whammy? Already we have: 1) low solar activity, 2) a negative PDO, 3) a starting negative AMO and now 4) a dried out stratosphere that lets massive amounts of heat radiate out into space. Sounds like the potent ingredients of a nasty mini ice age.
Burgeoning confusion taking over climate science
To add to the ever burgeoning climate science confusion and uncertainty, Spiegel also quotes Mojib Latif of the Helmholtz-Center for Ocean Sciences in Kiel, Germany (Latif correctly predicted that the oceans would stop the warming in 2008).
The Southern Ocean has cooled strongly over the last decades; it must have contributed to the pause in global warming.”
With all the uncertainty and surprises, you’d think the alarmists would start reconsidering their positions. But you’d be wrong. They still remain devout CO2 believers, desperately clinging to their CO2 and models. Expect them to go into total spin mode to salvage what they can. But no matter what they do, one thing is now clearer than ever: The models have been dead wrong, and the scientists are more confused than ever about the climate. They are hopelessly stumped. Spiegel writes at the end:
Also the British Met Office believes that the global warming pause, will continue for a few more years. However, the temperature buffer of the oceans is only temporary, Brönnimann believes. The greenhouse gases will unleash their warming impacts, postulates the UN climate report, which will soon be released. It’s quite possible that even an accelerated warming phase is coming.”
Now I am laughing myself to near death…not at Spiegel, but at the devout alarmists. In a nutshell: At present the alarmists are more perplexed than ever, yet they want us to believe they are totally certain about the future? The climate charlatans are now looking more and more like obstinate fools.

"Many scientists believe that halting global warming at 1.5°C will require us to invent Negative Emission Technologies – machines that can suck climate warming gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂) from the air. But such technology already exists and has done for over two billion years. From the trees outside your window to the microscopic algae in the ocean, nature is working hard to absorb the atmospheric carbon that is heating our world. Rather than reinvent the wheel, some experts are calling for natural solutions to climate change. These involve restoring natural habitats – such as forests and wetlands – which would draw down CO₂ through photosynthesis and store it as living tissue in plants.  Rapidly phasing out greenhouse gas emissions is still vital, but letting nature do much of the hard work in removing the CO₂ that’s already in the atmosphere could save the time and money we’d need to develop artificial methods of capturing carbon.

      George Monbiot Q + A – How rejuvenating nature could help fight climate change


 Returning many of the world’s ecosystems to something resembling their former glory could also help solve another crisis simultaneously. In this fourth issue of the Imagine newsletter, we look at the mass extinction crisis that threatens the nearly nine million species on Earth and how radical action to prevent their extinction could also prevent ours. We asked experts to imagine how natural solutions to climate change could start at home and what a future with more of the wild in our lives might look like. In the end, it’s a case of saving two birds with one tree.  What is Imagine? Imagine is a newsletter from The Conversation that presents a vision of a world acting on climate change. Drawing on the collective wisdom of academics in fields from anthropology and zoology to technology and psychology, it investigates the many ways life on Earth could be made fairer and more fulfilling by taking radical action on climate change. You are currently reading the web version of the newsletter. Here’s the more elegant email-optimised version subscribers receive. To get Imagine delivered straight to your inbox, subscribe now.  Nearly a million species are at risk of extinction without “transformative changes” to the way societies and economies are organised in the 21st century. That’s according to a report published in May 2019 by an international team studying Earth’s biodiversity.

      'Revolutionary change' needed to stop unprecedented global extinction crisis


 Climate change drives species to extinction and exacerbates threats such as habitat loss, by destroying the habitats themselves or changing the conditions that make them hospitable to different species. But it might surprise you to learn that across vast swathes of the world, nature is already returning to places where dense habitats were once destroyed by humans. Even on your own doorstep, your local environment could be wilder than it was 100 years ago.  If you live in mainland Europe, that’s almost certainly the case.

      Rewilding: as farmland and villages are abandoned, forests, wolves and bears are returning to Europe


 More and more people around the world are abandoning rural landscapes and moving to live in cities. In their absence, the land they once used for agriculture is regenerating as shrubland and forest. These new habitats have ushered in wolves, brown bears, lynx and boar. José M. Rey Benayas, Professor of Ecology at the University of Alcalá, says: Despite 40% of the world’s land being cultivated or grazed permanently by domestic herbivores… forests returned at a rate of 2.2 million hectares per year between 2010-2015 alone. Spain, for example, has tripled its forest area since 1900 – increasing from 8% to 25% of its territory. The country gained 96,000 hectares of forest every year from 2000-2015. In the UK, forests have recovered more slowly, from 5% of the land area after World War I to 13% today. It’s been estimated that every hectare of forest that’s restored in the UK could absorb the annual emissions of 30 London buses or 90 cars every year. Restoring forest cover in the UK to just 18% of the land area could absorb a quarter of the carbon that will need to be cut in order to reach net zero emissions by 2050.

      Rewilding is essential to the UK’s commitment to zero carbon emissions


 Aside from not emitting carbon in the first place, restoring forests across the world on an unprecedented scale could be our best bet for avoiding catastrophic climate change, according to a new study. Mark Maslin, a Professor of Earth System Science and Simon Lewis, a Professor of Global Change, both at University College London, explain the thinking. Negative emissions – Increasing the world’s forest land by one third – regrowing an extra billion hectares of trees over an area that’s roughly the size of the United States – could capture 205 billion tonnes of CO₂, according to the study. That’s about two thirds of man-made carbon emissions already in the atmosphere. Low disruption – The study’s authors say reforestation on this scale could actually be achieved with fairly limited disruption to our lives. Most of the land needed would be around 1.8 billion hectares in areas with low human activity, so new forests wouldn’t have to compete with land we’d need to reserve for growing food.  But there’s a catch – Even if global warming is limited to 1.5°C, the higher temperatures could reduce the area that’s suitable for forest restoration by a fifth by 2050. On its own, reforestation isn’t enough. There’s still a very urgent need to reduce emissions drastically for a reasonable chance of avoiding catastrophic climate change. As Maslin and Lewis point out, the actual sum of CO₂ that reforestation could lock away is also much smaller in other research, perhaps closer to 57 billion tonnes.

      Reforesting an area the size of the US needed to help avert climate breakdown, say researchers – are they right?


 Reforesting the Earth will take decades, but right now, people in the UK could help bring back one of the country’s most diminished habitats in their own backyards. Since the end of World War II, Britain has lost 97% of its wild grassland – turned into farmland or dug up to build roads and homes.  What’s left is a sorry sight. The clipped lawns and neat grass verges of Britain mostly contain only one or two species of turf grass, compared to the more than 40 plant species that can thrive in a single square metre of grassland. As their native habitat has declined, British pollinating insects have vanished from a third of their range since 1980.

      Four steps to make your lawn a wildlife haven – from green desert to miniature rainforest


 Maintaining the hyper-manicured lawns that we’re used to seeing in public parks often involves petrol mowers and fertilisers which leak more carbon to the atmosphere during their production and use than the grass itself can store. If you have a lawn, you can think of it as your own patch of artificial grassland – a stunted remnant of a once vast ecosystem. But it needn’t be that way, says Adam Bates – an ecologist at Nottingham Trent University. There are four easy steps any gardener can follow to turn their lawn into a wildlife haven that locks away CO₂. 1. Cut higher Most lawn mowers have blades that are set as low to the ground as possible, ensuring that the lawn is cut to be flat and featureless, which is no good for wildlife. Bugs and small creatures need nooks and crannies to hide from predators. Spiders in particular need something to anchor their webs to. By adjusting the blade to the highest possible setting – often around 4 cm off the ground – mowing can leave taller grass with more recesses for insects to hide in. 2. Include mowing gaps Leaving longer gaps between mowing the lawn can give wildflower species the time they need to flower and provide nectar for pollinating insects to eat. By leaving a gap in spring, early flowering species like the native cowslip can bloom.  Cowslip is a plant which has been declining for decades, but the Duke of Burgundy butterfly depends on it for somewhere to lay its eggs. Leaving a mowing gap in summer can give species like cat’s-ear and fox-and-cub time to flower – both important food sources for leafcutter bees. 3. Don’t use fertilisers or herbicides You might expect herbicides to be a bad idea, but when it comes to lawns, fertilisers are only good for ensuring a luxuriant green colour – one or two grass species will soak up the extra nutrients and outcompete everything else.  To ensure a rich variety of plants can thrive in your wildflower lawn, reducing the fertility of the soil is essential. 4. Remove the clippings By collecting the cut grass after you mow you can stop more nutrients getting into the soil and reduce the lawn’s fertility with every cut.  If you’re 100% committed, you can leave strips at the sides or patches in the corners to go wild and form small wildflower meadows. Most wildflower seeds will be carried to your garden on the wind or by birds, but if you’re tired of waiting, you  can buy and spread the seeds yourself. Once you’ve seen pockets of wildflower meadow spring up on your lawn, you may not want to stop there… Pollinator species would certainly benefit from more people turning their lawns into the wild grassland habitat that’s so rare in the British landscape today. But a single square metre of grassland might only absorb about 2-5g of CO₂ over the course of a year. So how helpful is rewilding your garden for slowing climate change? Very helpful, if you add a pond, says Associate Professor of Ecology at Northumbria University, Mike Jeffries.  


      Read more:
      Ponds can absorb more carbon than woodland – here's how they can fight climate change in your garden


 A pond that’s only a square metre in size could suck as much as 247g of carbon from the air every year. Though small ponds make up a tiny proportion of the UK’s land area – about 0.0006% of it – they punch well above their weight in terms of how much carbon they can bury as sediment. By digging a pond in your garden, you’d also be inviting some truly unique wildlife. Perhaps most interesting of all according to Jeffries is the tadpole shrimp – thought to be the oldest animal in the world. Garden ponds can also draw in more familiar creatures, like frogs and toads. Half of all the UK’s ponds were lost during the 20th century, leaving many native amphibians searching for somewhere to live. As climate change threatens to dry up much of these habitats, garden ponds could provide an oasis for struggling species says Becky Thomas, a Senior Teaching Fellow in Ecology at Royal Holloway University. Frogs and toads need clean ponds in which to breed [but] the fashion of keeping our gardens meticulously neat and tidy is leaving our wildlife with nowhere to hide. Creating a pond can be a fun project – especially with children. Once put in, it will only take a matter of days before something decides to make it their home. It will usually be invertebrates and plants to begin with, but it won’t take long for it to be found by a nearby frog or toad population.

 No matter where you look, you’re likely to find a potentially useful habitat for nature that’s under threat. Professors of Conservation Ecology Brendan Wintle (University of Melbourne) and Sarah Bekessy (RMIT University) say that even very small patches can be invaluable for a particular species.  It may not look like a pristine expanse of Amazon rainforest or an African savannah, but the patch of bush at the end of the street could be one of the only places on the planet that harbour a particular species of endangered animal or plant. In Australia, our cities are home to, on average, three times as many threatened species per unit area as rural environments. This means urbanisation is one of the most destructive processes for biodiversity.

      The small patch of bush over your back fence might be key to a species’ survival


 Moving out of gardens and into the streets, how could our towns and cities be reimagined with more space for nature? Heather Alberro, a PhD Candidate in Political Ecology at Nottingham Trent University, believes that “urban greening” could make the places we live resilient to climate change and ensure a refuge for biodiversity: Cool those heat waves: a single tree can have the cooling effect of more than ten air conditioning units, all while absorbing carbon. Higher temperatures turn cities into concrete heat traps, but using air conditioning to stay cool takes a lot of electricity, adding more CO₂ to the atmosphere. By contrast, trees shade surfaces that might otherwise absorb heat and cool the air by gathering water on their leaves which evaporates in the sun. Filter air pollution: plants capture airborne particulates in the wax or cuticles of their leaves. By filling streets with trees, the air can be made safer to breathe. Increase biodiversity: rooftop gardens and forested terraces can create habitats in new places. Networks of connected habitats – such as wildflower meadows that snake along roadsides – could allow new urban ecosystems to form, populated by species that had previously been squeezed out of the concrete sprawl.

      Urban greening can save species, cool warming cities, and make us happy


 If all that sounds good to you then you’re in luck, Alberro says. Urban greening is being taken very seriously by architects, designers and politicians. You may find your neighbourhood growing wilder in the years to come. The mass greening and rewilding of our cities is no novel or abstract ideal. It is already happening in many urban spaces around the world. The mayor of Paris has ambitious plans to “green” 100 hectares of the city by 2020. London mayor Sadiq Khan hopes to make London the world’s first “National Park City” through mass tree planting and park restoration, greening more than half of the capital by 2050. If you live outside a major city then perhaps it’s your daily commute that will change first. Thanks to efforts by campaigners and local councils in the UK, roadside verges are being turned into wildflower meadows, with an eight-mile “river of flowers” now hugging a motorway in Rotherham. According to Olivia Norfolk – a Lecturer in Conservation Ecology at Anglia Ruskin University – bees and butterflies don’t seem to mind the traffic and their numbers have “increased dramatically” where regular mowing has stopped and wildflower meadows have returned on grass verges. She said: The UK road network spans over 246,000 miles – reducing mowing on the grass verges that surround them to just once a year could save money and create thriving habitats for pollinating insects that return on their own each spring.

      Roadside wildflower meadows are springing up across the UK – and they're helping wildlife in a big way


 Seeing so much colour on land that was once devoid of life can really lift the spirits. Alberro believes this may be the greatest benefit from rewilding – more human happiness. The Japanese call it Shinrin-yoku, or “forest bathing” – the idea that regular immersion in nature is as good as therapy. In the future, people may not have to go too far to get their fix.

Fig. 1. Monthly global atmospheric CO2 (NOOA; green), monthly global sea surface temperature (HadSST2; blue stippled) and monthly global surface air temperature (HadCRUT3; red), since January 1980. Last month shown is December 2011.Reposted from the Hockey Schtick, as I’m out of time and on the road.- Anthony
An important new paper published today in Global and Planetary Change finds that changes in CO2 follow rather than lead global air surface temperature and that “CO2 released from use of fossil fuels have little influence on the observed changes in the amount of atmospheric CO2” The paper finds the “overall global temperature change sequence of events appears to be from 1) the ocean surface to 2) the land surface to 3) the lower troposphere,” in other words, the opposite of claims by global warming alarmists that CO2 in the atmosphere drives land and ocean temperatures. Instead, just as in the ice cores, CO2 levels are found to be a lagging effect ocean warming, not significantly related to man-made emissions, and not the driver of warming. Prior research has shown infrared radiation from greenhouse gases is incapable of warming the oceans, only shortwave radiation from the Sun is capable of penetrating and heating the oceans and thereby driving global surface temperatures.
The highlights of the paper are: 
► The overall global temperature change sequence of events appears to be from 1) the ocean surface to 2) the land surface to 3) the lower troposphere.
► Changes in global atmospheric CO2 are lagging about 11–12 months behind changes in global sea surface temperature.
► Changes in global atmospheric CO2 are lagging 9.5-10 months behind changes in global air surface temperature.
► Changes in global atmospheric CO2 are lagging about 9 months behind changes in global lower troposphere temperature.
► Changes in ocean temperatures appear to explain a substantial part of the observed changes in atmospheric CO2 since January 1980.
► CO2 released from use of fossil fuels have little influence on the observed changes in the amount of atmospheric CO2, and changes in atmospheric CO2 are not tracking changes in human emissions.

Abstract
Using data series on atmospheric carbon dioxide and global temperatures we investigate the phase relation (leads/lags) between these for the period January 1980 to December 2011. Ice cores show atmospheric CO2 variations to lag behind atmospheric temperature changes on a century to millennium scale, but modern temperature is expected to lag changes in atmospheric CO2, as the atmospheric temperature increase since about 1975 generally is assumed to be caused by the modern increase in CO2. In our analysis we use eight well-known datasets; 1) globally averaged well-mixed marine boundary layer CO2 data, 2) HadCRUT3 surface air temperature data, 3) GISS surface air temperature data, 4) NCDC surface air temperature data, 5) HadSST2 sea surface data, 6) UAH lower troposphere temperature data series, 7) CDIAC data on release of anthropogene CO2, and 8) GWP data on volcanic eruptions. Annual cycles are present in all datasets except 7) and 8), and to remove the influence of these we analyze 12-month averaged data. We find a high degree of co-variation between all data series except 7) and 8), but with changes in CO2 always lagging changes in temperature. The maximum positive correlation between CO2 and temperature is found for CO2 lagging 11–12 months in relation to global sea surface temperature, 9.5-10 months to global surface air temperature, and about 9 months to global lower troposphere temperature. The correlation between changes in ocean temperatures and atmospheric CO2 is high, but do not explain all observed changes.

"**A surge in staycations due to coronavirus means it is ""vital"" for lock gates on a historical Welsh canal to be replaced, says a charity.**
GlandÅµr Cymru, which looks after the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal, said more people have been taking time out and ""discovering our waterways"".
The canal network stretches 33miles (55km) from Brecon to Newport, and was used to carry coal, lime and iron ore.
Three new lock gates will replace ones that have been there for 20 years.
It has ""never been more important"" to keep the waterways open and available, according to the director of the waterway charity, Mark Evans.
""This year we're spending almost Â£1m on our winter works programme in Wales,"" added Mr Evans.
""These vital repairs, replacements and refurbishments take on a greater significance this year as many people have discovered our waterways, exercising on the towpaths during lockdown and taking staycation hire boat holidays.
""Set against the challenges of the pandemic, and with research showing that being by the water improves wellbeing, it has never been more important to keep the waterways open and available.""
The new lock gates at a section near Llangynidr in Powys, will stand at up to 5.2m tall (17ft), each weigh as much as a small elephant and 5.4 tonnes in total.
Work began at Lock 64 with a specialist fish rescue to temporarily relocate resident tench, pike and bream in the canal.
It meant draining the the lock and a 450m (1,500ft) stretch of the canal, before the task of removing the old gates could begin, and the hand-crafted replacements made from sustainably grown green oak are installed.
Replacing lock gates is a key part of GlandÅµr Cymru's winter programme of works ""ensuring that the 200-year old canal is boat-ready and boater-friendly"".
It is hoped the work will be completed before Christmas."
"Perched at almost 8,500 metres on Everest, we paced back-and-forth, attempting to stave off frostbite as temperatures hovered close to -30°C and our drill batteries became too cold to work. Our ambition to install the highest automatic weather station in history looked destined for failure. We were at the end of an almost two-month expedition, led by National Geographic, to conduct a hugely ambitious scientific survey of the 8,848-metre Mount Everest. I am a climate scientist who specialises in extreme environments, and together with Baker Perry (a geographer at Appalachian State University), I was trying to install the highest weather station in the world. Weeks of sickness had plagued the expedition (from diarrhoea to full-on Influenza-A), but we had so far succeeded. Four stations were under our belt, including at Everest Basecamp (5,315 metres), and Camp II (6,464 metres) – perched high above the infamous Khumbu Icefall. The day before we had celebrated installing the highest operating weather station in the world, near Camp IV at almost 8,000 metres. Only one team of Italian scientists had deployed equipment this high before. Any celebrations, however, were short-lived. We filled the rest of that day eating, melting snow and sleeping, squeezing in about two hours of sleep before climbing out of Camp IV as midnight approached. We were determined to get our final station as close to the summit as possible, capturing the first continuous measurements of the weather in the thin air of the “death zone” above 8,000 metres. Such data increases our understanding of the climates possible on Earth. Were we going to find the strongest near-surface winds on the planet? Just how cold and oxygen deprived is it up there during a winter storm? Could a human theoretically survive these conditions? Beyond this frontier meteorology and insight into life at the extremes, the station data could help improve weather forecasts on the mountain, hopefully making Everest climbers less susceptible to deadly surprises from extreme events. Led by a superhuman Sherpa team from the nearby village of Phortse – carrying the disassembled weather station, other science equipment and the normal climbing paraphernalia – we made good progress from Camp IV, climbing faster than we had all expedition. The atmosphere, however, was tense. Above 8,000 metres there is little room for failure, and the 2019 Spring climbing season provided too many reminders of our vulnerability. Unfavourable weather concentrated a record number of climbers into just a few days for summit attempts, making parts of the mountain unusually crowded. Tragically, many more climbers than normal would never make it back down alive.

      Everest: 11 climbers dead in 16 days – how should we deal with the bodies on the mountain?


 These crowds also impacted our expedition. After around three hours of good progress towards the summit, we hit the back of a queue of climbers all clipped to the rope above. Our pace was cut by more than half. Hands and feet began to cool. The fear of frostbite grew. After hours more of shuffling, collective frustration was palpable. Our lead Sherpa (Panuru) – a charismatic veteran of 14 successful Everest summit – declared that we must reassess our options. So it was there, at Everest’s “Balcony” (8,430 metres), that we peeled off from the back of the pack and found a spot for the weather station.  Continuing any higher would have been a dangerous gamble against the odds. Ours was not a typical climbing expedition: we needed to perform hours of work on the summit and, given the slow progress, it was extremely unlikely our oxygen supplies would have lasted the round trip. Our Sherpa team leapt into action at the Balcony. They had trained with us over the past two months for this very moment. For Baker and I this represented the climax of almost eight months’ preparation. We were desperate when the drill (that was needed to help bolt the station to the rock) refused to be coaxed to life. It was only with the sustained body heat from our warmest Sherpa that the batteries eventually warmed enough for the drilling and installation to commence. The Sherpa were immense: a lifetime spent at high altitude meant they were quicker witted in the low oxygen environment, stronger, with hands more tolerant of the cold. It was thanks to their efforts that we successfully broke new ground with the installation of this weather station – nearly half a vertical kilometre higher than anything that had gone before. Now safely back at sea-level, Baker and I have been watching the near-real time, satellite-streamed weather data with interest. We have already seen winds near Camp IV equivalent to a category 2 hurricane – and this is the period normally known for its settled weather. These stations owe their severe winds to the subtropical jetstream – a high-altitude ribbon of fast-moving air which influences weather across large swathes of the Northern Hemisphere. Placing a weather station at such height means scientists can now monitor the jet directly and learn more about it. And the fact it is on the relatively well-trodden Mount Everest means passing climbers and Sherpas may be able to help with maintenance. If the new weather stations can survive the extreme conditions long enough, we hope that they will also give us a more complete picture of the high-altitude Himalayan climate, including how it may be changing. This is urgent because it is here that glaciers – the source of freshwater to hundreds of millions of people – are retreating, and as we improve our understanding of the climate, we increase our ability to outline the changes (and challenges) that may be ahead. There is of course much to do, with far more monitoring needed to understand the spatial diversity in climate and its rate of change across the Earth’s mountains. It is difficult and risky to install weather stations in high-altitude locations, but the stakes are now very high. As scientists we must therefore accept the challenge and continue venturing upward."
"**There have been more than 1.6 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and about 60,000 people have died, government figures show.**
However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus and other measures suggest the number of deaths is higher.

After the first peak in April, cases started rising again in July, with the rate of growth increasing sharply in September and October, before falling again in the past two weeks.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 16,170 confirmed cases.
It is thought the infection rate was much higher during the first peak in spring, but testing capacity at the time was too limited to detect the true number of daily cases.
The data for cases can also be broken down by region and comparing the change in those figures by week gives a sense of where there has been a recent increase in newly-reported infections.
Coronavirus infections in England have fallen by about a third during lockdown, according to a major study carried out by Imperial College London.
While some of the worst-hit areas saw the biggest improvements, cases have remained relatively high across England, according to the React-1 study, which is based on tests of more than 100,000 people between 13-24 November.
The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), suggest about one in 185 (16,400 people) in Wales had the virus in the week ending 21 November.
In Northern Ireland rates are thought to be decreasing at around one in 145 people (about 12,700 people), while in Scotland, the figure was one in 115 (about 45,700 people).
The average number of daily deaths began to rise again in September, following the first peak in April.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 648 deaths.
Of these, 555 deaths were in England, 51 in Wales, 38 in Scotland, and four in Northern Ireland.
Rules were amended over the summer to include deaths in the coronavirus total only if they occurred within 28 days of a positive test. Previously in England, all deaths after a positive test were included.
England has seen the majority of UK deaths from Covid-19. Using the 28-day cut-off, there have been more than 52,000.
Although hospital admissions for Covid-19 remain below the levels seen in the spring, there are big regional disparities.
The North West, North East and Yorkshire, and Midlands have seen the highest number of admissions but the situation in all three now appears to be improving.
Cases have risen across large parts of England, with other spikes in areas of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The red areas on the map below are those currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people.
Restrictions have been tightened across the UK in an effort to tackle the number of rising cases.
In England, each local authority has been placed in one of the new three tiers following the end of the recent national lockdown.
Wales has announced a range of further measures, including a ban on pubs, restaurants and cafes serving alcohol, from Friday 4 December.
In Northern Ireland, a further two-week ""circuit-break"" lockdown began on 27 November.
Scotland has a five-tier system of alert levels with different measures in place in different parts of the country.
UK leaders have agreed to allow up to three households to meet indoors during a five-day Christmas period of 23-27 December.
When looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways.
Government figures count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus.
But there are two other measures.
The first includes all deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, even if the person had not been tested for the virus. The most recent figures suggest there had been almost 70,000 deaths by 20 November.
The second measure counts all deaths over and above the usual number at the time of year - that figure was more than 75,000 by 20 November.
The most recent figures available from the ONS are for the third week of November, which show there were 14,276 deaths registered in the UK.
Some 3,038 of these deaths involved Covid-19 - 199 more than the week before.
Deaths normally do rise at this time of the year, but the data from the ONS and its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland show the second wave of the virus has pushed the death rate above the average seen over the past five years by about 21%.
Overall, the figures are still well below the peak of 9,495 deaths recorded in a week, reached on 17 April.
The ""R number"" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to.
If R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow.
The government's current estimate for the R number across the whole of the UK is 0.9 to 1.
The estimate for England is 0.9 to 1, while for Scotland it is 0.8 to 1. The estimate for Wales is 0.8 to 1 and in Northern Ireland it is 0.9 to 1.1.
The government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions."

Like too many other long‐​reigning fixtures on Capitol Hill, Senator Carl Levin (D-MI) doesn’t appreciate the magnitude of the challenge to the authority he presumes to hold over America’s job and wealth creators. Or maybe he does, and frustration over that fact explains why he besmirches companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Hewlett‐​Packard.   
  
  
Levin presided over a Senate hearing last week devoted to examining the “loopholes and gimmicks” used by these multinational companies to avoid paying taxes – and to branding them dirty tax scofflaws. Well here’s a news flash for the senator: incentives matter.   
  
  
The byzantine U.S. tax code, which Senator Levin – over his 33‐​year tenure in the U.S. Senate (one‐​third of a century!) – no doubt had a hand or two in shaping, includes the highest corporate income tax rate among all of the world’s industrialized countries and the unusual requirement that profits earned abroad by U.S. multinationals are subject to U.S. taxation upon repatriation. No other major economy does that. Who in their right minds would not expect those incentives to encourage moving production off shore and keeping profits there?   
  
  
Minimizing exposure to taxes – like avoiding an oncoming truck – is a natural reaction to tax policy. Entire software and accounting industries exist to serve that specific objective. Unless they are illegal (and that is not what Levin asserts directly), the tax minimization programs employed at Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Hewlett‐​Packard are legitimate responses to the tax policies implemented and foreshadowed by this and previous congresses. If Levin is concerned about diminishing federal tax collections from corporations (which, of course, reduces his power), the solution is to change the incentives – to change the convoluted artifice of backroom politics that is our present tax code.   
  
  
Combine the current tax incentive structure with stifling, redundant environmental, financial, and health and safety regulations, an out‐​of‐​control tort system that often starts with a presumption of corporate malfeasance, exploding health care costs, and costly worker’s compensation rules, and it becomes apparent why more and more businesses would consider moving operations abroad – permanently. Thanks to the progressive trends of globalization, liberalization, transportation, and communication, societies’ producers are no longer quite as captive to confiscatory or otherwise suffocating domestic policies. They have choices.   
  
  
Of course many choose to stay, and for good reason. We are fortunate to have the institutions, the rule of law, deep and diversified capital markets, excellent research universities, a highly‐​skilled workforce, cultural diversity, and a society that not only tolerates but encourages dissent, and the world’s largest consumer market – still. Success is more likely to be achieved in an environment with those advantages. They are the ingredients of our ingenuity, our innovativeness, our willingness to take risks as entrepreneurs, and our economic success. This is why companies like Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Hewlett‐​Packard are born in the United States.   
  
  
But those advantages are eroding.   
  
  
While U.S. policymakers browbeat U.S. companies and threaten them with sanctions for “shipping jobs overseas” or “hiding profits abroad” or some other manifestation of what politicians like to call corporate greed, characterizing them as a scourge to be contained and controlled, other governments are hungry for the benefits those companies can provide their people. Some of those governments seem to recognize that the world’s wealth and jobs creators have choices about where they produce, sell, and conduct research and development. And some are acting to attract U.S. businesses with incentives that become less necessary every time a politician vents his spleen about evil corporations. Not only should our wealth creators be treated with greater respect from Washington, but we are kidding ourselves if we think our policies don’t need to keep up. As I wrote in a December 2009 Cato paper: 



Governments are competing for investment and talent, which both tend to flow to jurisdictions where the rule of law is clear and abided; where there is greater certainty to the business and political climate; where the specter of asset expropriation is negligible; where physical and administrative infrastructure is in good shape; where the local work force is productive; where there are limited physical, political, and administrative friction.



This global competition in policy is a positive development. But U.S. policymakers cannot take for granted that traditional U.S. strengths will be enough. We have to compete and earn our share with good policies. The decisions made now with respect to policies on immigration, education, energy, trade, entitlements, taxes, and the role of government in managing the economy will determine the health, competitiveness, and relative significance of the U.S. economy in the decades ahead.   
  
  
Since another hearing devoted to thanking these companies for their contriubtions to the U.S. economy is unlikely, perhaps Senator Levin should at least consider the perils of chasing away these golden geese.

Burma’s agony continues. On Sunday the military dictatorship held a rigged election to cloak itself in civilian garb. The people of Burma will continue to suffer under one of the worst governments on earth.



Gen. Ne Win seized power in 1962. Nearly a half century later the country is ruled by a junta headed by Gen. Than Shwe. The military’s crimes are many. It has imposed a corrupt and brutal dictatorship; conducted a genocidal war against dissident ethnic groups; suppressed civil and political liberties; kept the country desperately poor; and enriched well‐​connected allies at public expense. The government even impeded international assistance after devastating Cyclone Nargis in 2008. 



The regime has repeatedly attempted to rebrand itself. For instance, the junta once called itself the State Law and Order Restoration Council, SLORC, but shifted to the State Peace and Development Council. Alas, the only peace the SPDC believes in is of the grave and the only development it supports is of junta members’ bank accounts. The generals occasionally ousted and imprisoned each other. 



In 1990 the junta foolishly held an election. Like the Nicaraguan Sandinistas and Polish Communists, who also called free ballots, the Burmese military overestimated its popular support. The Burmese people decisively rejected the regime, overwhelmingly voting for Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy. So the generals voided the result, suppressed the NLD, and quarantined Suu Kyi, subjecting her to house arrest for 15 of the last 21 years.



There has been no mellowing over the years. In 2003 the regime promised a “roadmap to discipline‐​flourishing democracy,” which emphasized discipline over democracy. The SPDC ruthlessly suppressed protests led by Buddhist monks in 2007. The following year the junta stuffed ballot boxes in a referendum on its authoritarian constitution, drafted without popular input. The generals routinely harassed Suu Kyi and sentenced many of her supporters to long prison terms. The regime reached ceasefire agreements with a number of rebellious ethnic groups, but since then has begun demanding that the forces disarm, a nonstarter for people who have suffered from unlimited military barbarity for decades.



The junta’s latest strategy is another election, for a two‐​house national parliament and 14 state and regional assemblies. However, this ballot was rigged from the start to prevent any chance of the opposition triumphing. First, there was no independent election commission and no foreign observers were allowed. No electioneering, let along criticism of the government was permitted. The media is largely controlled by the government; even nominally private publications are censored. So are sermons by monks. The cost of registering to run alone exceeded the per capita GDP. Elaine Pearson, deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch, complained: the vote was “being conducted in a climate of fear, intimidation, and resignation.”



Second, some 2000 imprisoned democracy activists, including Suu Kyi and many other NLD members, were deemed ineligible to run. Political parties were required to expel members with “criminal” records, including for political offenses, to contest the ballot.



Thus, the NLD, the nation’s only legitimate governing force, refused to participate. The generals then dissolved the party (along with nine others). NLD activists responded by urging a boycott. The regime threatened to jail them while promising development projects to neighborhoods where residents marked their ballots ahead of time. The government also barred people from participating in many eastern ethnic areas, while in others rebellious groups refused to participate. 



Third, the regime turned military apparatchiks into civilian candidates. Through the misnamed United Solidarity and Development Party the generals fielded candidates to contest all 1,163 offices at stake. The equally misnamed National Unity Party, representing Ne Win, the original dictator who was ousted in 1988, put up 999 candidates. Richard Horsey, a former UN official, contended that victories by some of the latter would demonstrate that the military is not monolithic, but the NUP no more represents the Burmese people does than the USDP. Both military factions are paranoid, xenophobic, and despotic.



In contrast, the National Democratic Force, a rump group of former NLD‐​activists, only contested 163 seats. A number of other small parties, including several ethnic‐​based organizations, ran a few candidates. A number of independents also stood for office. Still, Burma’s foreign minister, Nyan Win, claimed: “Such a large participation made it crystal clear that the elections become virtually inclusive.”



Fourth, parties were required to affirm support for the 2008 constitution imposed by the SPDC. That document reserves one‐​fourth of the lower house and one‐​third of the upper house to the military, allows the “civilian” president to turn power over to the military, creates a National Defense and Security Council, and permits the military‐​controlled Union Election Commission to dismiss legislators for “misbehavior.”



Authority will not be transferred. The generals will remain in charge. The Burmese people are not fooled. Ashin Issariya, a founding member of the All Burma Monks Alliance, observed: “It will be the same faces and the same system that we have been living with for decades. The name ‘elections’ does not change anything for us.” Long‐​time NLD activist Win Tin said the election “will just help the military get what they want — to rule for a century or more.” Dot Lay Mu of the Karen National Union warned: the generals are using the poll to “consolidate and prolong” their control.



The junta’s objective is another image makeover. Today the SPDC is widely reviled around the world and subject to U.S. and European sanctions. The generals hope to gain greater international acceptance.



The international response to the junta has been divided. The U.S. and Europe have campaigned against the regime, but Burma’s neighbors have refused to join in. China supports the generals irrespective of how many people they kill. India is economically active in Burma and, along with Malaysia and Singapore, trains SPDC military officers. Other countries, including Thailand, have refused to do more than apply limited pressure, valuing Burma’s natural resources more than Burmese human rights.



Now Asian governments are lauding the poll while Western governments are unsure how to respond. Some analysts argue that even a flawed election presages possible political liberalization. 



Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson of MIT and Harvard, respectively, wrote: “History shows that gradual, half‐​hearted reforms of this sort are exactly how many autocracies successfully transition to democracy.” However, the examples they cite are less than convincing. Great Britain and early America were republics which distrusted direct democracy, not dictatorships. Chile immunized participants in the military regime, but returned power to an elected civilian government. Taiwan allowed the established though previously outlawed opposition party to contest newly free elections. Burma matches none of these. Egypt may be closer, but that nation remains unfree a half century after Col. Abdul Nasser became a civilian. 



Allowing a genuinely free vote for a civilian government with some independent powers even while the military maintains control over security agencies might permit a gradual evolution to a more liberal system. But allowing a few dissident civilians to assume powerless positions in a system controlled by the same authoritarian apparatchiks, only wearing suits rather than uniforms, is unlikely to yield any noticeable difference in governance. 



Some analysts posit that the process may empower younger military men. Younger does not necessarily mean reformer, however. Observed journalist Bertil Lintner, “Lower and middle‐​ranking army officers remain immensely loyal to the leadership, knowing full well that they can only rise to prominent and privileged positions by showing that they are even more hardline than their superiors.” Anyway, the aging process guarantees personnel turnover. The faux elections add nothing. So too when it comes to dreams of economic liberalization and government transparency: such policies will change only if the military wants them to change, not as a result of the vote.



If Suu Kyi is released after her house arrest formally expires on November 13 — and she is allowed to resume active political activities, along with other democratic activists — then there might be at least a little hope for a little change. But if most of those who have been fighting for liberty remain imprisoned, opposition political activity remains proscribed, and criticism of the government remains prohibited, then even Suu Kyi’s release, though welcome, would signal no change.



Still, Lex Rieffel and David I. Steinberg, of the Brookings Institution and Georgetown University respectively, argued that “With smart, nuanced policies, however, the U.S. and other Western countries could help to ensure that the November election is a major step toward a democratic and prosperous Burma.” What policies they do not say. Since the ballot changes nothing substantive, it is hard to imagine policies which could to turn the vote into a positive step forward.



The fact that the faux election offers no prospect of change doesn’t mean the West should maintain its policy of isolation and sanctions. This strategy has manifestly failed. Today’s only winner is China, which has achieved disproportionate influence in Rangoon.



Attempting to reinforce isolation and sanctions is a dead‐​end. For instance, the administration is now pushing for a UN‐​sponsored commission to investigate Burma for war crimes. It’s a fine idea, but one that will never get past Beijing in the Security Council. Given the prevalence of human rights abusers in the international body, General Assembly or Human Rights Council vote is no more likely.



It is time to move in the opposite direction.



Kurt Campbell, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, said the ballot “will be without international legitimacy” but called for “dialogue” as “the best way forward” among difficult options. He hopes for the rise of new players and structures, but that’s more dream than reality. The poll alone is no reason by itself to reverse policy. The U.S. should not aid the junta’s attempt to disguise its malign character. Brutal authoritarians were in control on November 6, before the vote. Brutal authoritarians remain in control on November 8, after the vote.



After a decent interval, however, Washington should consult with Europeans and leading Asian states to forge a united strategy to press Burma for reform. The U.S. government needs to recognize that its ability to influence events in Rangoon is limited. Broader international support, especially in Southeast Asia, is required for any hope of progress. 



No policy offers much likelihood of success. But promising to eschew attempts at coercive regime change while offering rewards for political liberalization may provide the best, if still not a good, strategy to promote real change. For instance, Jared Genser of Freedom Now argued: “It is only through a facilitated process of tripartite dialogue among the junta, Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy and the country’s disparate ethnic groups that any real reconciliation and progress toward democracy will be made.”



Burma poses one of the world’s greatest humanitarian challenges. The latest “election” changes nothing. The Obama administration should treat the new “civilian” government no different than the old military regime. But Washington nevertheless should acknowledge the failure of its past democratization efforts, and look for a new way forward.

"Victoria is experiencing an increasing number of megafires that are threatening some of the state’s most important ecological habitats, a new study in a leading international journal has found. Many areas had seen multiple bushfires since 1995 at a frequency that was much too high to allow forests time to recover, risking the beginning of ecosystem collapse, the research said.  Areas worst hit by bushfires were native forests used for logging, the research found, with 63% of those areas burned since 1995. Lead author Prof David Lindenmayer, of the Australian National University’s Fenner school of environment and society, said global heating was increasing the risk of fires and logging was making forests more flammable. Published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the research analysed in detail areas burned each year from 1995 to last summer’s fire season. In late 2019 and early 2020, about 1.5m hectares of Victorian forests burned – the largest area since 1939, when 3.4m hectares were hit. Across the state’s most important areas for forest-dependent threatened species, the analysis found 57% had burned in the most recent fires. From 1950 to 2002, Victoria had not experienced a year when fire had burned through more than 600,000 hectares. But since 2003, there had been three “megafire” years when more than 1m hectares of forest had burned. Lindenmayer told Guardian Australia: “We should not expect that the last fire season will be unusual. “A megafire is a fire that’s more than 1m hectares, and we’ve had three since 2003 – a megafire every six years. We will probably have another, or possibly two, before the end of this decade.” Lindenmayer said of the 1.5m hectares burned in the most recent fire season, more than 600,000 hectares had burned twice in the past 25 years, and more than 112,000 hectares had burned three times. “Some significant parts of the landscape are burning three or four times in 25 years. The forest can’t cope with that much fire or produce viable seed and it can collapse into something else.” Some 44% of protected areas had burned from 1995 to present, the study found, compared with 63% of native forests used for logging. “That’s a significant difference,” Lindenmayer said. “State forests are burning significantly more than national parks. “The number of fires is also significantly greater in state forests than national parks. That’s happening because the data is showing that for many forest types, logging makes them more prone to fire and higher severity fires. The area statistics show this quite strikingly. “We have this substantial area of native forests that’s purposed for logging, but it’s burning incredibly frequently and that undermines the ability of the industry to keep working its resource. Fire is competing with logging for the resource.” Biomass was left behind during logging operations, and younger regrowth trees also tended to dry out forest areas and create dense zones that were more prone to fire, causing impacts that lasted decades, Lindemayer said. In new and unpublished analysis, Lindenmayer said Victoria had lost 77% of its old growth forests in the past 25 years – “and old growth forests are where biodiversity is the highest”. He said one ecosystem type that included the commercially-harvested mountain ash was burning too frequently to allow it to regenerate. Mountain ash was traditionally harvested when it reached about 80 years old, but Lindenmayer said the chances of the trees reaching that age was down to only one in five. “In some places the return interval [for bushfire] is five to six years where it should be 75 to 150 years,” he said. “We have some serious issues to deal with – there’s the climate and land management – as well as the interaction between the two. “We are going to lose important areas of forest but we will make some parts of rural and regional Australia incredibly dangerous to live in. “Old growth forests is where biodiversity is the highest. From any perspective Victoria is a train wreck, but New South Wales is also heavily damaged. “The answer is that we have to get our timber from plantations,” he said. The study said: “The large amount of native forest in Victoria dedicated to logging that is now burnt means that native forest-dependent logging industries will no longer be sustainable or economically and ecologically tenable.” A spokesman for the state-owned forest company VicForests said: “Many academics and fire experts agree that harvesting does not elevate fire risk. “We work with partner agencies and use scientific research to develop a harvest program that protects the environment and mitigates the impacts of bushfires. “VicForests is committed to the sustainable management of forest areas allocated to it for harvesting. We take great care to protect potential habitat and high conservation values, especially following fire.” He said VicForests’ “ecologically sensitive approach” was supporting families, communities and townships that were impacted by the fires. In a seperate study in the journal Fire, scientists at the University of Tasmania examined the fires in Tasmania’s southern Huon Valley in early 2019. The study compared the severity of fires across old-growth, mature and plantation forests, and found that old-growth forests not impacted by logging burned less severely than other areas."
"**A ""lighthouse lab"" with the capacity to process 50,000 coronavirus tests every day has opened in the East Midlands.**
The laboratory in Loughborough, Leicestershire, will receive samples from drive-through centres, social care and home kits.
PerkinElmer has been chosen by the government to run the facility, which is the sixth of its kind to open.
Hopes of a coronavirus vaccine mean it is only contracted until the end of March.
Lighthouse laboratories are already operating in Milton Keynes, Cheshire, Glasgow, Cambridge and Newport.
The Loughborough facility is expecting to receive about 3,000 coronavirus test samples on its first day.
Miles Burrows, managing director of PerkinElmer, said this will slowly increase throughout December until it reaches its 50,000 a day projection.
Mr Burrows said the lab represented, ""a significant additional capacity"".
""Essentially, the more capacity in the network, the greater the number of people can be tested and the faster the results will get back to those people,"" he added.
The laboratory will be open 24 hours a day and will employ 430 staff.
Fatima Omar, a biomedical scientist at the site, said the work would be ""challenging"" but interesting.
Mike Sandys, director of public health for Leicestershire County Council, said he welcomed the lab's arrival.
Interim executive chair of the National Institute for Public Health, Baroness Dido Harding said the lab had ""definitely not"" come too late.
She said: ""It's still going to take time for the vaccine to be rolled out.
""In the world of today, we really do need this.""

As a regulatory tool, the precautionary principle has met with mixed reactions. While many variants exist, a generally accepted definition is that activities should not proceed when the threats of damage are not fully understood. A major concern with this principle is that by focusing solely on the risk from one action, it fails to consider the risk from an alternative action. Something abandoned out of precaution is replaced by something else, which may also carry risk. From an economic perspective, the precautionary principle fails to consider the tradeoffs inherent in policy decisions.



We provide a large-scale, empirical evaluation of the tradeoff that came from invoking the precautionary principle using the nuclear power plant shutdowns resulting from the accident at Fukushima, Japan. The accident, which resulted from a tsunami caused by the fourth-largest earthquake in recorded history, led to a nuclear meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Driven by long-standing concerns over the unknown effects from radiation risk, this rejuvenated the anti-nuclear movement. Within 14 months of the accident, nuclear power production came to a complete halt in Japan.



The decrease in nuclear energy production did not come without a cost: higher electricity prices. To meet electricity demands, the reduction in nuclear energy production was offset by increased importation of fossil fuels, which increased the price of electricity by as much as 38 percent in some regions. These higher electricity prices led to a decrease in electricity consumption, particularly during times of the year that have the greatest heating demand. Given that interior climate control provides protection from extreme weather events, we find that the reduced electricity consumption caused an increase in mortality. Our estimated increase in mortality from higher electricity prices significantly outweighs the mortality from the accident itself, suggesting that the decision to cease nuclear energy production caused more harm than good.



We produce these results using the following strategy. First, we document that the shutdown of nuclear power plants increased electricity prices, with strong variation throughout the country depending on the initial energy mix within a region. For example, regions with almost no nuclear energy before the accident experienced electricity price increases around 10 percent, whereas regions with higher dependence on nuclear experienced price increases up to 40 percent. The highly regulated nature of residential electricity markets in Japan means that supply factors contributed to these price changes, suggesting the price changes are exogenous to consumer demand for electricity. Second, we explore how the price changes affected electricity consumption. For example, we compare electricity consumption in Tokyo in January 2012 to electricity consumption in Tokyo in January 2011. We find that electricity consumption decreased roughly one to two months after price changes occurred. The decreases in electricity consumption are more pronounced during the winter, suggesting there is less protection from the weather during the coldest times of the year.



Third, we explore the consequences from the reduced electricity consumption by estimating how it moderates the temperature-mortality relationship. Similar to previous research, we find that extreme temperatures affect mortality, in particular during very cold temperatures, although the effects from higher temperatures are small given the high rates of air conditioning penetration. We then interact temperature with electricity prices to explore how electricity prices moderate the relationship between temperature and mortality. We find increased mortality effects from extreme cold weather, suggesting the decreased consumption of electricity that resulted from higher electricity prices increased mortality.



To put these estimates in context, we calculate that the higher electricity prices resulted in at least an additional 1,280 deaths during 2011–2014. Since our data only covers the 21 largest cities in Japan, which represents 28 percent of the total population, the total effects for the entire nation are even larger. Meanwhile, the number of deaths due to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident is much lower. No deaths have yet to be directly attributable to radiation exposure, although projections estimate a cumulative 130 deaths. An estimated 1,232 deaths occurred as a result of the evacuation after the accident. Therefore, the deaths from the higher electricity prices likely outnumber the deaths from the accident in only four years if we extrapolate our estimates to the entire country, and almost certainly outnumber the deaths over a longer time period given that the higher electricity prices persisted beyond the end of our study. This suggests that ceasing nuclear energy production has contributed to more deaths than the accident itself.

"**There have been more than 1.6 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and about 60,000 people have died, government figures show.**
However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus and other measures suggest the number of deaths is higher.

After the first peak in April, cases started rising again in July, with the rate of growth increasing sharply in September and October, before falling again in the past two weeks.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 16,170 confirmed cases.
It is thought the infection rate was much higher during the first peak in spring, but testing capacity at the time was too limited to detect the true number of daily cases.
The data for cases can also be broken down by region and comparing the change in those figures by week gives a sense of where there has been a recent increase in newly-reported infections.
Coronavirus infections in England have fallen by about a third during lockdown, according to a major study carried out by Imperial College London.
While some of the worst-hit areas saw the biggest improvements, cases have remained relatively high across England, according to the React-1 study, which is based on tests of more than 100,000 people between 13-24 November.
The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), suggest about one in 185 (16,400 people) in Wales had the virus in the week ending 21 November.
In Northern Ireland rates are thought to be decreasing at around one in 145 people (about 12,700 people), while in Scotland, the figure was one in 115 (about 45,700 people).
The average number of daily deaths began to rise again in September, following the first peak in April.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 648 deaths.
Of these, 555 deaths were in England, 51 in Wales, 38 in Scotland, and four in Northern Ireland.
Rules were amended over the summer to include deaths in the coronavirus total only if they occurred within 28 days of a positive test. Previously in England, all deaths after a positive test were included.
England has seen the majority of UK deaths from Covid-19. Using the 28-day cut-off, there have been more than 52,000.
Although hospital admissions for Covid-19 remain below the levels seen in the spring, there are big regional disparities.
The North West, North East and Yorkshire, and Midlands have seen the highest number of admissions but the situation in all three now appears to be improving.
Cases have risen across large parts of England, with other spikes in areas of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The red areas on the map below are those currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people.
Restrictions have been tightened across the UK in an effort to tackle the number of rising cases.
In England, each local authority has been placed in one of the new three tiers following the end of the recent national lockdown.
Wales has announced a range of further measures, including a ban on pubs, restaurants and cafes serving alcohol, from Friday 4 December.
In Northern Ireland, a further two-week ""circuit-break"" lockdown began on 27 November.
Scotland has a five-tier system of alert levels with different measures in place in different parts of the country.
UK leaders have agreed to allow up to three households to meet indoors during a five-day Christmas period of 23-27 December.
When looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways.
Government figures count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus.
But there are two other measures.
The first includes all deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, even if the person had not been tested for the virus. The most recent figures suggest there had been almost 70,000 deaths by 20 November.
The second measure counts all deaths over and above the usual number at the time of year - that figure was more than 75,000 by 20 November.
The most recent figures available from the ONS are for the third week of November, which show there were 14,276 deaths registered in the UK.
Some 3,038 of these deaths involved Covid-19 - 199 more than the week before.
Deaths normally do rise at this time of the year, but the data from the ONS and its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland show the second wave of the virus has pushed the death rate above the average seen over the past five years by about 21%.
Overall, the figures are still well below the peak of 9,495 deaths recorded in a week, reached on 17 April.
The ""R number"" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to.
If R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow.
The government's current estimate for the R number across the whole of the UK is 0.9 to 1.
The estimate for England is 0.9 to 1, while for Scotland it is 0.8 to 1. The estimate for Wales is 0.8 to 1 and in Northern Ireland it is 0.9 to 1.1.
The government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions."
"Every tree in a forest has a neighbour. In many forest neighbourhoods, the same species are often found living together, especially when the growing conditions are similar. Sometimes these neighbours are close and sometimes far apart, but collectively they form part of a community, with some species naturally being more dominant than others, especially in terms of biomass production. But what happens when the going gets tough? A drought is coming and there’ll be winners and losers.  Droughts can be a big challenge for many trees, and one that is only going to get worse as the world shifts to a hotter, drier climate. Different species have different strategies for dealing with this kind of stress, but how they deal with losing water is particularly important. Trees have tiny pores in their leaves that they can open and close called stomata. Trees lose water through their stomata in a process called transpiration, and absorb carbon dioxide for use in photosynthesis – how plants make their food. Some trees are more conservative, closing their stomata early on in a drought to prevent water loss, but this also limits how much carbon dioxide they can take in and so how much energy they can generate.  Some trees use a riskier strategy and leave these pores open for longer to continue absorbing carbon dioxide, but this also increases the risk of a process called cavitation, which stops them being able to transport water. Clearly, each strategy has its advantages and disadvantages, and all trees sit somewhere between really conservative and really risky. Diversity like this in trees is fortunate, because if every species relied on the exact same strategy it would be a bit like putting all of their eggs in one basket. Having only a single strategy to deal with all that life can throw at them would leave forests pretty vulnerable. A diverse range of strategies for coping with stress is what gives forests some of their essential stability and resilience.  Which species has the best strategy to survive will depend in part on how long a stressful event lasts, how intense it is, how frequently it occurs - and what its neighbours are doing. How all of these different strategies work in a stressful environment like a drought will determine how the whole forest fares. A bit like personalities in humans, sometimes they work well together and everyone benefits, but sometimes they clash.

      The scandal of calling plantations 'forest restoration' is putting climate targets at risk


 Recent research has started to tease apart who wins and who loses when certain species are planted together, and how this changes under stressful conditions. Somewhat amazingly, much of this information can be extracted from tree rings, which contain a physical record of how well each individual tree grew when something like a drought came along. Tree rings allow scientists to see how different trees respond to the same stressful event - and how the identity of the species in their immediate neighbourhood influences this response. Crucially, this research is also shedding light on some of the complicated reasons why species respond so differently depending on who they grow next to. Why some trees do better next to certain neighbours and not others is extremely complicated and not yet fully understood. But at a basic level, we can imagine that each tree species has a whole range of traits, characteristics and functions that make up its personality. How a tree responds to stress might have something to do with the level of direct competition between its neighbours. For example, some trees have deep roots and some trees have shallow roots – two trees with shallow roots will directly compete for water, but a deep rooted species can access water lower down in the soil and avoid some of this competition. This is called “niche differentiation” – by using the environment differently, two different species can occupy the same place.  Being able to predict which tree species will make good and bad neighbours is really important. For instance, placing two trees together that are more risky when it comes to deciding when to close their stomata could mean they use up the limited water quicker than a conservative and a risky tree growing together.

      Reforesting an area the size of the US needed to help avert climate breakdown, say researchers – are they right?


 Reforesting large parts of the Earth has been suggested as a method for slowing climate change. Technologies are being developed to suck carbon from the air and store it too, but trees have benefited from a 350m year research and development programme that makes them perfect for the task.  Understanding what tree species work well together – and crucially why – can help guide how reforestation is implemented in the decades to come. With a greater variety of tree “personalities”, forests are likely to be more resilient to droughts, pests and diseases than those made up of a single species. Diversity comes in many forms – making sure the forests planted today are resilient in the future will partly depend on choosing tree neighbours wisely.

Tim Beveridge speaks with dairy farmer Mike on Newstalk ZB at 4:30am on Saturday 7th September



 **Tim:**



What… what’s Fonterra’s deal with all this then? Because they seem to be… cosying up to the government…



 **Mike:**



 _(Sighs)_



 **Tim:**



…but is this a political exercise in virtue signalling because they’re bloody useless?



 **Mike:**



Aaah… now I’m getting into a sensitive area. Um… there were people… if you’ve ever read some of the farming magazines there’s quite a bit of angst about certain middle managers who thought they knew… who came into this with no skin in the game, somewhere down the line in Dairying NZ was someone who thought they could show all the industry how to negotiate with the government and then made a total cockup of the whole affair. 



They cosied up to the government, they broke industry ranks and… and it made a mess and now they’re trying to recuperate the mess they’ve made because they’ve agreed to targets which are scientifically impossible to get.



They’ve talked about this methane reduction and methane… unless they allow genetic engineering methane is a by-product of cows eating grass. End of story.



 **Tim:**



I think they’ve got to get with the engineering… I absolutely think they’ve got to go with the science and get it into the education but we’ve got these luddites called the greens who choose… who will ram this down your throat when it comes to climate change and then run screaming into the hills when you talk about what science can do for um… our impact on the environment.



 **Mike:**



They won’t allow science. A lot of it’s written into… into regional plans. Um… I was involved with quite a lot of the _(indistinct)_ plans stuff in the horizons area and they wrote into the plans that only their science was allowed to be used. And basically, everything on that bloody Overseer Programme, sorry to call it bloody but that’s what I mean about it…



 **Tim:**



It doesn’t bother me.



 **Mike:**



That Overseer Programme, it was just a simple computer tool – it got a plus or minus 30% variation rate… and they’re using it as a programme with greenhouse gas. Did you… if you go into the greenhouse gas of what the farmer is producing it simply churns out this figure but there’s no science, well there maybe science in certain areas, but there’s no way of proving it. And they won’t allow you to use your own systems. 



So, getting back to dear old Mr Parker and he’s got a ready reputation of hating farmers, um… he’s got a reputation for having a really sour mouth too, he… he, when he talks to people in a room he has a lot of “F”s into it, he hates it – and you want to know why he hates it? He was a lawyer…



 **Tim:**



Someone should turn on a recording device in these meetings and catch these guys for the way they conduct themselves in private. It’s disgusting.



 **Mike:**



Well, apparently, they um… they went to Helen Clark about him, he was using this language, and she cut him down but Jacinda hasn’t got the ability to cut him down.



 **Tim:**



No.



 **Mike:**



But he actually was involved as a lawyer in the setting up of Fonterra and he was got rid of – that’s why he hates… that’s his sole…



 **Tim:**



So, what’s…. I guess the question is – we’ve actually got this article by… is it Tim Mackle?



 **Mike:**



Yeah.



 **Tim:**



Which has actually been reproduced on the NZ Herald website. He’s Chief Executive Dairying NZ and a PhD in animal food and nutritional sciences – it’s worth a read people. I’d… it basically talks about it being um… us as global leaders in the sustainability… I mean, why are we…



 **Mike:**



Because, okay, they want to virtue signal… James Shaw wants to virtue signal we are doing the best. He wants to… he doesn’t want to sit on the laurels of NZ is the best he wants to go further and further and further and be the…



 **Tim:**



It’s just needless virtue signalling and who’s paying for is? You, me and everyone else.



 **Mike:**



And if we lower production in NZ, if we lower production because all of the – use of the right word, the luddites and so forth – they are embarrassed about the fact that NZ is an agricultural country – they really feel that NZ should do something else…



 **Tim:**



Okay, so here’s a question for you: is it going to be a vote for the government or is it going to be something else that might backfire on them?



 **Mike:**



I’m… I’m picking up a lot of vibes that from people such as yourself, and other people who are promoting that they’re getting pretty angry about it and we’re picking up vibes within the cities and towns that people are not comfortable with this stuff coming out. You are getting all these other things coming out um… Julie Anne Genter and her green stuff and… and David Parker has just alienated the west coast by refusing to allow the _(indistinct)_



 **Tim:**



That was inexplicable – what the hell was that about, everyone wanted it?



 **Mike:**



Yeah, well you’ve got a man that owes… _(indistinct)_ utu, I don’t know, that is getting revenge on everybody…



 **Tim:**



That’s peculiar, it really is quite peculiar.



 **Mike:**



Yeah.



 **Tim:**



Hey, I better move on Mike, but anyone that wants to have a look at the Tim Mackle article on our NZ Herald website, just about some of the good things about farming. Thanks Mike.

My grandfather made steam engines, my father made a scale steam locomotive for taking children on rides in the park and at the fair. Some of my happiest memories as a child were of sitting behind my father in the coal tender, chugging down the tracks, so any picture of a steam engine brings back fond memories.
[ UPDATE: I hadn’t realized it from the photo above until later, but the 4-6-4 “Hudson” locomotive above is the one my dad modeled for the 1/8th scale train of my youth, except his had the feedwater tank over the front like this one. Our family had to sell the train due to financial hardship after his death to somebody in Lebanon Ohio (probably the saddest day of my life). I’ve since lost track of it and would give anything to get it back, but I fear it has been scrapped. I hadn’t thought about this in a long time but the image provoked some long repressed memories. On the plus side, I’ve located a Lionel model Hudson 4-6-4 Steam Locomotive 665 with 736W Tender on Ebay, and exact match to the engine and tender my dad constructed, which I hope to buy so that I can show it to my children, and pass on the story with something to show them, along with the family photographs. I never thought this topic would come up on my blog, but here it is, serendipitously hitting me with emotion. – Anthony ]
When I saw this, all I could think of is how silly this idea is. All the greens seem fascinated with high speed rail due to Euro-envy, and in California they are ramming it down our throat at an anticipated huge loss, even worse than Solyndra. With a forecast price tag in the tens of billions and growing, it is just nuts given the economic climate right now, not to mention we don’t have people clamoring to climb aboard.
In retrospect however, anything that would put a steam locomotive back on the tracks is music to my ears, even if they ran it on used McDonald’s french fry oil like some of those hippie buses we see here in California.
Here’s the strange part, they are converting an oil burning locomotive to run “biocoal”, and somehow they magically think the production process and the burning of it won’t produce any net CO2, saying the process is “carbon neutral”.  I think they’ve left out some parts, like the energy needed to produce and transport the biocoal fuel in the first place. Excerpts from the MSNBC story:  
A steam train built in 1937 is getting a makeover that will turn it into a “higher-speed” locomotive that runs on biocoal, a coal-like fuel made with woody plant material.
When finished, the train will be able chug along existing tracks at speeds up to 130 miles per hour without contributing to the greenhouse gas pollution blamed for global warming.
…
“Computer simulations already show that the locomotive is about as powerful as two modern passenger diesel locomotives,” Davidson Ward, president of the Coalition for Sustainable Rail, told me Thursday.
“But it will burn carbon neutral fuel.”
The biocoal is based on a so-called torrefaction process pioneered at the University of Minnesota in Duluth. To make it, woody material — in this case trees — are heated in the absence of oxygen. The resulting flaky matter is then rammed together under high pressure to create coal-like bricks.
The charcoal briquettes aka “biocoal”
Biocoal has the same energy density as regular coal, but is cleaner burning, and since trees (the fuel source) sequester carbon as they grow, the system is considered carbon neutral, according to Ward.
…
Today, most higher-speed passenger trains are diesel-electric locomotives, which generate their peak horsepower at low speeds — about 25 miles per hour. Steam locomotives, by contrast, get their peak horsepower at higher speeds — about 40 miles per hour.
“Initial computer simulations suggest that the CSR’s modern steam engine will significantly out-accelerate a modern diesel-electric locomotive to 110 mph,” according to the coalition’s website.
…
I got a big chuckle out of this part though:
If all goes according to plan, they might build a new steam locomotive from scratch, which will have some modern looks.
For example, “no cowcatcher,” Ward said. “You don’t need a cowcatcher today unless you are a ‘Back to the Future’ fan.”
Just wait until they plow into some green gawker driving a Prius, you know it is going to happen.
From the “Coalition for Sustainable Rail” website:
Once its modernization is complete, CSR 3463 will have little in common with the smoke-belching steam engine it once was. Featuring a gas-producer combustion system, improved steam circuit, modernized boiler, low-maintenance running gear and steam-powered electric generator (to power the passenger train), CSR anticipates 3463 will be able to pull a passenger train with electric-like performance for less than the cost of diesel-electric locomotives. In order to further prove the viability of biocoal and modern steam technology, CSR plans to test the locomotive in excess of 130 miles per hour, out-performing any existing diesel-electric on the market and breaking the world steam speed record. In light of this achievement, CSR has named this endeavor: “Project 130.”

Historical 3463 Tech Specs

Locomotive 3463, acquired by CSR through the generosity of its former owner, the Great Overland Station of Topeka, Kansas, is the largest locomotive of its type left in the world and features the largest wheels of any engine in North America. CSR will completely rebuild and modernize the locomotive, doubling its thermal efficiency, converting it to burn biocoal and more. When done, locomotive 3463 will share only the most fundamental resemblance to the engine it once was.

Guest post by Mark Johnson
What would the climate change debate be without a quote from Rosie O’Donnell. Al Roker was interviewing the talk show host on a Weather Channel segment Monday morning during “Wake Up with Al.” Here’s how the exchange went:
ROKER: “What do you think about the controversy about the people who say, ya know, this whole global warming thing is a scam…a sham?”
ROSIE: “It’s ridiculous. Its absurd. There’s scientific proof. And those are the people who also believe in Creationism, right? I don’t know how you can argue with science in that way when…we’re alive in 2012, and every kind of from of measuring and scientific data. Its a ridiculous thing to say it is not occurring.”
ROKER:”During this winter, when all this weird stuff was going on, were you like a lot of us, going ‘What the heck is going on?’ ”
ROSIE: “You know, I was in Chicago for the winter and everyone said to me, ‘You better get thermal underwear and heated boots!’ Literally, I spent all this money getting all this stuff. It was like spring…it was a joke! It was spring the entire winter! I used my coat once!”
Now, lets review:

According to commedien-turned-climate scientist Rosie O’Donnell,
1) the science is settled,
2) Skeptics are flat-earthers and religious fanatics;
3) one cut-off low pressure in March across the central United States is proof of global warming.
4) Rosie has a gently used winter coat and thermal underwear for sale.
I wonder what O’Donnell would think about underestimated polar bear populations, decreasing hurricane intensity, fewer strong tornadoes since 1974, the forgotten heat records of the 1930s, adjusted arctic temperatures, twelve trees in the Urals, spliced temperature data in the Antarctic, upside down Tiljander proxies, a non-ice free summer arctic, hidden declines, the non-existent big red heat spot, artificial temperature inclines, ClimateGate, FakeGate & hockey sticks.
I guess the word “science” means different things to different people…

From the Data dot Gov website, this data set: https://explore.data.gov/d/8vq3-ke4t
…has been turned into a stunning image of the United states. Each line represents an individual tornado, while the brightness of the line represents its intensity on the Fujita Scale. The result, rendered by John Nelson of the IDV User Experience, shows some interesting things, especially the timeline bargraph that goes with the map, which show that the majority of US tornado related deaths and injury (prior to the 2011 outbreak which isn’t in this dataset) happened in the 1950’s to the 1970’s. This is a testament to NEXRAD doppler radar, improved forecasting, and better warning systems combined with improved media coverage.

Here’s the data description, the big map of the CONUS follows below.
The National Weather Service (NWS) Storm Prediction Center (SPC) routinely collects reports of severe weather and compiles them with public access from the database called SeverePlot (Hart and Janish 1999) with a Graphic Information System (GIS). The composite SVRGIS information is made available to the public primarily in .zip files of approximately 50MB size. The files located at the access point contain track information regarding known tornados during the period 1950 to 2006. Although available to all, the data provided may be of particular value to weather professionals and students of meteorological sciences. An instructional manual is provided on how to build and develop a basic severe weather report GIS database in ArcGis and is located at the technical documentation site contained in this metadata catalog.
It is also worth noting that the distribution of strong tornadoes -vs- weaker tornadoes (rated by the Fujita scale) is greatly lopsided, with the weakest tornadoes far outnumbering the strong killer F5 tornadoes (such as we saw in 1974 and 2011, both cooler La Niña years) by at least an order of magnitude:  

And here’s the entire map, click for a very hi-resolution version:

Mike Smith covers a lot of the history contained in this data set in his book Warnings The True Story of How Science Tamed the Weather.

He talks about the vast improvements we’ve witnessed since the early days of severe weather forecasting and is well worth a  read if you want to understand severe weather in the USA and how the detection and warning methods have evolved. He has another book just out (Reviewed by Pielke Sr. that explains the failure of this system in Joplin in 2011.
In Mike Smith’s first book, “Warnings: The True Story of How Science Tamed the Weather,” we learned the only thing separating American society from triple-digit fatalities from tornadoes, weather-related plane crashes, and hurricanes is the storm warning system that was carefully crafted over the last 50 years. That acclaimed book, as one reviewer put it, “made meteorologists the most unlikely heroes of recent literature.” But, what if the warning system failed to provide a clear, timely notice of a major storm? Tragically, that scenario played out in Joplin, Missouri, on May 22, 2011. As a wedding, a high school graduation, and shopping trips were in progress, an invisible monster storm was developing west of the city. When it arrived, many were caught unaware. One hundred sixty-one perished and one thousand were injured. “When the Sirens Were Silent” is the gripping story of the Joplin tornado. It recounts that horrible day with a goal of insuring this does not happen again.
Of course, alarmists like Peter Gleick (who knows little about operational meteorology and is prone to law-breaking) like to tell us severe weather (and days like Joplin) are a consequence of global warming saying at the Huffington Post:

“More extreme and violent climate is a direct consequence of human-caused climate change (whether or not we can determine if these particular tornado outbreaks were caused or worsened by climate change).”
But in this story from Physorg.com
“If you look at the past 60 years of data, the number of tornadoes is increasing significantly, but it’s agreed upon by the tornado community that it’s not a real increase,” said Grady Dixon, assistant professor of meteorology and climatology at Mississippi State University.
“It’s having to do with better (weather tracking) technology, more population, the fact that the population is better educated and more aware. So we’re seeing them more often,” Dixon said.
But he said it would be “a terrible mistake” to relate the up-tick to climate change.
Again, for a full understanding I urge readers to click, read, and to distribute these two WUWT essays:
The folly of linking tornado outbreaks to “climate change”
Why it seems that severe weather is “getting worse” when the data shows otherwise – a historical perspective

"Subsidies for onshore wind power were cut by the UK government in 2015. Then the main reasons given were that it was too expensive and that the public didn’t support it. Amber Rudd MP, then head of what was the Department of Energy and Climate Change, said in a statement to parliament: “We are reaching the limits of what is affordable and what the public is prepared to accept.” Fast-forward to 2019: onshore wind is the UK’s cheapest form of electricity, and our newly-published academic research shows that public support for renewables is high and getting steadily higher. Support for nuclear and fracking on the other hand is low and decreasing. These trends are demonstrated by the government’s own data: the UK Energy and Climate Change Public Attitudes Tracker (PAT). The PAT has been running quarterly since 2012, meaning there is a huge amount of data to show how attitudes have changed over the past seven years. In total, more than 50,000 people have been surveyed, making it the largest and most representative dataset of its kind. Along with colleagues at the University of Leeds, I analysed the PAT dataset to dig a bit deeper into what it can tell us. As well as looking at how trends in public support have changed over time, we also explored whether trends varied geographically. While the map below shows there is some variation, the overall trends are pretty consistent across Great Britain. (Unfortunately there isn’t enough data for Northern Ireland to ensure confidentiality). So, are energy policymakers listening to the public? The short answer is: no. At present, the UK government is pursuing the energy technologies which receive the lowest levels of public support (nuclear and fracking), while cuts to various subsidy schemes are making it more difficult for popular onshore renewables such as wind and solar to get built.  One exception is offshore wind – the third most popular technology – which was recently given fresh backing by the government. The survey does not ask about support for fossil fuels such as coal or natural gas, so it’s not possible to directly compare people’s preferences with existing fossil-based energy infrastructure.  However, our study does show that concern for climate change was a particularly important predictor of attitudes. People who worried more about the climate were more supportive of renewables, and people who were less concerned were more supportive of nuclear and fracking. As concern over the climate crisis continues to grow (a trend also shown by the PAT), it seems likely that renewables will continue to enjoy high public support, while support for nuclear and fracking (as well as other types of fossil fuel) will continue to fall. This is a positive sign for the transition to a low carbon society. Our results also suggest that some sections of the public may be having a stronger effect on energy policy than others. We found that young people and women were more likely to support renewables, while older people, men and higher social classes were more likely to support nuclear and fracking. It is perhaps not a coincidence that this demographic group has the most similar views to the status quo energy policy, given the lack of diversity in the energy sector. This highlights the need to get more women and people of all social backgrounds into the top energy jobs, so that decisions are more representative of society and its preferences. The UK government recently put into law the bold ambition to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050 – the first major economy in the world to do so. This is a fantastic step in the right direction and sets the bar for other countries around the world. But (and there’s always a but), this is only possible if technologies pursued are genuinely low carbon, cost effective (as renewables increasingly are) and have the backing of the public. Given the introduction of this new net-zero target, it is time for policymakers to rethink the direction of the UK’s energy future, and to listen more carefully to what the public really wants. With average support of 82.5%, solar energy is more popular by far than certain other recent political decisions in the country.

California State Capital in Sacramento (Photo credit: Wikipedia)
Guest post by Lorraine Yapps Cohen
California Air Resources Board (CARB) met on Thursday, May 24.  On the agenda was discussion toward deciding where and how to spend the billions raised from cap-and-trade carbon trading in the state.
At the public meeting was Betty Plowman, who attended the meeting to present a letter on behalf of the industries that CARB calls polluters, the California Construction Trucking Association (CCTA) and California Dump Truck Owners Association.  The letter describes CARB’s threats to these industries, induced by the Board’s regulations that are, in turn, based on junk science.  The letter’s signatories indicate intention to seek reparations for the regulated class under CARB’s repression in California.
CARB Chairman Mary Nichols let the clock conduct the agenda and closed the meeting at 5 p.m. before Plowman could present the letter. The world according to CARB disallows any voicing of concerns. 
“It was just another day in paradise, wasn’t it?” said Plowman in her personal communications on the meeting.  “I thought of ‘The Price is Right’ announcer saying ‘come on down.’  Everyone get their hands out; decide where this windfall should go.”
CARB disallowed the presentation of public concerns.  Mary Nichols, in her authoritative overreach, simply adjourned the meeting when dissenting perspective tried to be heard, as seen in this video:

Despite that the letter received no air time at the CARB meeting, the matter is not likely to go away.  The tyranny of Mary Nichols and CARB wears thin on the regulated.  Their letter seeking reparations follows.
RE: Reparations to the Regulatory Class in California
Dear Governor Brown | Mary Nichols: 
Recently, Robert Jenne, Assistant Counsel to the California Air Resources Board (CARB) released a written statement that we in the specific industries that CARB recognizes as polluters are hereby branded as the “Regulated Class” in California and subject to the rule and regulation of the agency and are bound to accept their rule at any cost. The class includes those who live and work productively in the transportation, manufacturing, construction and agriculture/forestry sectors of the California economy. 
In this letter we inform you of the first action we are taking to meet this threat to our livelihood and our freedom, enacted by unelected bureaucrats without the due process guaranteed to us by the Constitution. 
We the undersigned reject the classification by CARB. In the state of California we represent a minority of the population and have been singled out by regulators simply because we produce the goods and services required to build and maintain a modern society. We request Governor Jerry Brown, Chairman Mary Nichols and the State of California make payment as reparations, to those individuals and commercial entities who have been severely damaged by laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are based on junk science, sometimes conducted by individuals without valid credentials, contrived to achieve the control now shown to be the objective behind the charade. 
Certain California state employees, board members, members of certain scientific review panels, and members of the California legislature and bureaucracy pushed these laws through the Legislature and its agencies without concern for the well being of its citizens, the public health, and the economic well being of the regulated class. Under the guise of a moral crusade to protect the environment, these agents of California government have generated an accumulating residue of economic damage, unintended consequences, bureaucracy and repression. Indeed agents of California government have learned to manufacture hypothetical threats in order to cement and expand state power and to enable the collection of funds needed to sustain and expand its grip. 
California is unique in its extremism and excesses in the ruthless pursuit of societal control. The collapse of the Western Climate Initiative gives evidence that California stands alone in North Americain its activism and agenda. In the same way that the 19th century Confederacy rationalized and defended keeping a large segment of its productive population under extreme exploitive control, today the state government of California takes for granted its ability to control the backbone of its productive population. As Americans we are reclaiming our unalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. 
Hundreds of thousands of California citizens and businesses have been displaced and/or lost their jobs, careers and homes over agendas borne by radical agents in the California legislature, executive offices, and its supporting cast of NGOs and academics. We as citizens of California can no longer bear the brunt of this attack on our freedoms and exercise our right to protect ourselves from these excessive regulations designed to end our livelihoods and our well being. 
The losses borne by this “Regulated Class” are immense. Details will be provided to you in the form of actual losses from regulations borne by the California Air Resource Board that have no benefit to Man or the environment. We will base our demand for reparations on this accounting. 
Signatories,
==============================================================
The reality is that the state will find a way to grab the money to support its continuing out of control spending, now in the red to the tune of over 16 billion dollars. In effect, this just becomes a backdoor tax scheme. See   http://www.calwatchdog.com/2012/01/11/brown-wants-cap-trade-for-pensions/
The letter’s signatories indicate the intention to seek reparations for damages to the “regulated class” as defined by CARB.  In so doing the class placed itself as a new example of minority exploitation by a repressive state government.

As a followup to a previous story about congressional hearings regarding a proposal to turn over control of the internet to the United Nations International Telecommunications Union, we are happy to report that extensive public pressure has ensured that there remains a bipartisan consensus against allowing this transfer of power over the Internet.

“There’s a strong, bipartisan consensus within the (US) administration and Congress that we must resist efforts from some countries to impose a top-down governance of the Internet,” Representative Henry Waxman told the hearing.
Congresswoman Doris Matsui added that “any international authority over the Internet is troublesome, particularly if that effort is being led by countries where censorship is the norm.”
A top State Department official, in prepared remarks, reaffirmed the opposition of the Obama administration to UN governance of the Internet.
“In all bilateral encounters and multilateral meetings, the United States consistently opposes the extension of intergovernmental controls over the Internet,” said Philip Verveer, deputy assistant secretary of state and coordinator for IT policy, saying this would lead to “very bad outcomes.”
“It inevitably would diminish the dynamism of the Internet,” he said.
Verveer told lawmakers that UN control would possibly “aid in censorship and repression” in some countries.
“Father of the Internet”, Google’s Vint Cerf, said Thursday that proposals to bring the Internet under United Nations’ control “holds profound — and I believe potentially hazardous — implications for the future of the Internet and all of its users”.
The ITU is scheduled to have their annual meeting in December where Russia, China, and other repressive countries will continue to press for this transfer “on behalf of developing countries”.

"As an island nation, Britain has vulnerable communities that must be prepared for the impact of the climate emergency. And while much has been said about homes at risk from the sea in coastal regions, or those inland subject to river flooding, the UK Committee on Climate Change’s new progress report for 2019 has laid bare the challenge facing them. In 2018, Hemsby on the coast of Norfolk in the east of England saw several homes dramatically lost after storm surges caused metres of the sandy cliff edge to collapse. Over the last decade, major storms left substantial areas of England badly flooded for weeks or months, such as in 2007, 2009, 2012, and the winters of 2013-14 and 2015-16. The Environment Agency has said that the UK faces having to abandon areas rather than continue to defend them with the ever higher and stronger flood defences that would be necessary.  According to the committee’s climate change risk assessment it is almost certain that England will have to adapt to at least one metre of sea level rise. Modelling studies have shown that flooding increases exponentially with rising sea levels. So for coastal areas subject to flooding it is not sufficient to increase the height of sea walls in line with sea level rise. The assessment predicts that up to 1.5m properties (including 1.2m residential homes) may be located in areas with an annual flood risk of once in 200 years or more by the 2080s. Around 8,900 properties are located in areas at risk from coastal erosion, this may increase to over 100,000 properties by the 2080s. While coastal erosion affects fewer properties than flooding, the impact is more drastic due to the inevitable and irrecoverable loss of land to the sea.  Significant increases in coastal flood risk are projected to occur as early as the 2020s due to increases in storm frequency. According to the committee’s projections the number of residential properties exposed to flooding more frequently than once every 75 years (on average) is predicted to increase 20% by the 2020s under the scenario which gives a 4°C rise in global temperatures by the 2080s. However, the Committee on Climate Change’s latest report on dealing with these issues scores work on alleviating surface water flooding, and work on ensuring new building development is properly designed to manage flooding, both firmly in the “red” of the red-amber-green traffic light system indicating readiness. Other aspects of flood protection fare only slightly better, with river and coastal development flood protection and alleviation and flood recovery in general marked as “amber”. In the Netherlands, for centuries vulnerable to floods due to its low-lying land, a number of new approaches to water management have been adopted over the years in an effort to live with water rather than to fight it. Schemes range from flood-proof homes, including floating homes, to the Room for the River programme which entails strategies for planned evacuations, temporary relocation of farmers and villagers, and strategic flooding of polders (reclaimed areas separated by drainage dykes). The UK has its own approaches to manage increased flood risk, and is developing new approaches in view of the dire predictions by climate change experts under scenarios of both 2°C and 4°C global temperature rise. River flooding and coastal flooding (from waterway or coastal inundation), as well as surface water and groundwater flooding (from rain and storms and insufficient drainage), were categorised as the most significant sources of risk in the UK now and in the future.  The committee’s projection of flood risk has identified the most cost-effective, engineering-based measures to reduce flooding as improving defences, managed realignment of the coast, catchment area management, and urban runoff management through sustainable drainage systems. In this case, “realignment” of the coast entails not only the natural changes to the physical coastline as a result of climate change, but also the decision to abandon or relocate entire settlements. This can have a significant personal and financial impact on those residents affected. While the abandonment of properties in places like Happisburgh and Hemsby in Norfolk due to coastal erosion is well known, we can see from the map above that many other coastal areas around the Humber, Mersey, Severn and Thames estuaries are at risk. Those affected, and also key infrastructure assets, will need to be evaluated to ascertain whether they should be included in this process of coastal realignment. The area around the Thames in southern England is likely to be classed as worth protecting due to the high numbers of people living there, for example. In addition, a number of low-lying inland plains will also be lost – many of which were selected for housing development only a few decades ago. While planning and building regulations can reduce flood risk to new-build properties within affected areas, anticipated population growth means that there is increasing pressure to build on floodplains. According to Emma Howard Boyd, Chair of the Environment Agency, the number of properties built on floodplains will double over the next 50 years, creating further flood risk problems. The UK has a significant number of key industries and infrastructure at the coast – for example power stations, petrochemical plants, steel industries and oil and gas infrastructure. To tackle the associated design challenges for housing, business and industries appropriate funding and having a well-skilled engineering force will be key.  In view of the increasing impact of climate change we need to urgently build our resilience to flooding. Flood resilience includes knowing what the risks are and where. We need flexible engineering solutions, including natural flood risk management, as well as ways to help society adapt. We need to make sure we have the right people with the right skills at all levels to address related socio-economic issues, including hard decisions on what to fight to keep, and what can be lost."

Almost every major American daily newspaper picked up an article published earlier this month by _New York Times_ scribe Justin Gillis entitled “A Warming Planet Struggles to Feed Itself.”



How many times have we read, in the last 50 years, that this or that environmental apocalypse is going to starve the world? I got my doctorate on the wings of one; at that time it was called “global cooling,” after a 1974 CIA report leaked to the _Times_ said that rapidly cooling planetary temperatures could usher in an era of heightened global instability caused by food shortages.



In my lifetime there have been a large number of predicted nutritional apocalypses, caused by overpopulation, lack of biological diversity in our food supply, genetic engineering run amok, acid rain, too little ozone, too much ozone and, finally, global warming. If there were futures on the end of the world, I’d go short. The wrong bet won’t matter anyway.



Facts: Global surface temperature rose about three‐​fourths of a degree Celsius in the 20th century. U.S. corn yields _quintupled_. Life expectancy _doubled_. People got fat. Global warming didn’t cause all of this, but increased atmospheric carbon dioxide directly stimulated plant growth. Further, greenhouse warming takes place more in the winter, which lengthens growing seasons. With adequate water, plants then fix and yield more carbohydrate.



While doing my dissertation I learned a few things about world crops. Serial adoption of new technologies produces a nearly constant increase in yields. Greater fertilizer application, improved response to fertilizer, better tractor technology, better tillage practices, old‐​fashioned genetic selection, and new‐​fashioned genetic engineering all conspire to raise yields, year after year.



Weather and climate have something to do with yields, too. Seasonal rainfall can vary a lot from year‐​to‐​year. That’s “weather.” If dry years become dry decades (that’s “climate”) farmers will switch from corn to grain sorghum, or, where possible, wheat. Breeders and scientists will continue to develop more water‐​efficient plants and agricultural technologies, such as no‐​till production.



Adaptation even applies to the home garden. The tomato variety “heat wave” sets fruit at higher temperatures than traditional cultivars.



However, Gillis claims that “[t]he rapid growth in farm output that defined the late 20th century has slowed” because of global warming.



His own figures show this is wrong. The increasing trend in world crop yields from 1960 to 1980 is exactly the same as from 1980 to 2010. And per capita grain production is rising, not falling.



Gillis more rightly could have blamed any loss in per capita consumption on the stupid (I choose my words carefully) global warming policy that greens once touted: ethanol production from corn.



Even Al Gore now admits that corn‐​based ethanol produces more carbon dioxide than it saves. But as a result of recent ethanol policy, we are the first nation in world history to burn up its food supply to please a political faction.



Indur Goklany, a much‐​published scholar on the consequences of global warming policies, recently calculated that in 2010 alone, diversion of grain to biofuels (like ethanol) caused nearly 200,000 excess deaths in the developing world because of increased prices.



Roger Pielke, Jr., another noteworthy student of global warming science and policy, concurs. Regarding Gillis’ piece, he says: “The carbon dioxide‐​centric focus on the article provides a nice illustration of how an obsession with ‘global warming’ can serve to distract attention from factors that actually matter more for issues of human and environmental concern.”



Ever since people noticed how robust the increase of crop yields is, others have been saying that it must soon stop. This “limits to growth” argument is as tired as a farmer at the end of harvest. Two weeks ago, it was announced at the Global Wheat Rust Symposium that scientists are now producing “super varieties” of pathogen‐​resistant grain, which will tack another 15% onto yield. As the new strain is adopted, it will continue the linear upward trend in wheat yield for at least another decade.



I continue to be amazed at how little the facts are checked on global warming, even when writing for the so‐​called newspapers of record. Crop yields have increased at a constant rate despite changes in global temperature. Per capita grain production is going up, and stupid policies — not global warming — are putting people’s food security at risk.

I just watched this video interview on MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow show (h/t to Poptech)

Despite the tacky caption, it was what Dr. Muller didn’t talk about that was, ahem, the best part. 
To my surprise, when questioned on the issue, he didn’t list station quality as one of the things he ruled out.  I think my message was delivered.
If you can get past the “genius” lead in part, its worth watching. Video here

This letter to Dr. Richard A. Feely of NOAA’s Pacific Marine Environment Laboratory Carbon Program in Seattle, WA was sent by Chuck F. Wiese on Wednesday. Chuck also asked me to post it on WUWT but I wanted to see if NOAA would fix the error on the web page first. It is now Saturday, and they haven’t, so I think a public notice is appropriate. I suppose I’m not surprised though, since Dr. Feely lists “Nobel Peace Prize (co-shared with Al Gore and other members of IPCC) – 2007” on his web page. I suppose anyone who lists Al Gore along with the gross errors he makes, such as his laughably non-reproducible “high school physics” of CO2, would not bother to correct their own gross errors. – Anthony
==============================================================
Dear Dr. Feely:
I exchanged e-mails with you a while back over a story that ran in the Oregonian on April 12, 2012. It was about “ocean acidification” that was supposedly killing off what would otherwise be healthy oyster harvests here in the Northwest, The story can be found here:
http://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/index.ssf/2012/04/oregon_state_research_traces_o.html
An OSU researcher who gave the story to the Oregonian, Alan Barton, had incorrectly asserted that the ocean pH had risen 30% because of human CO2 emissions and gave that as the reason the oyster harvests had been suffering. And he qualified that statement by stating that the ocean pH had moved .1 unit towards acidity over the last century.

But as you know, the equation for the pH of an aqueous solution is logarithmic and defined as pH = -log[ H+ ] . As you also know, there are 14 orders of magnitude that define the pH scale from zero to fourteen units as per this equation. So a movement of .1 units towards acidity cannot equal a 30% increase in acidity as claimed in this article. It is actually .1/14 or only 7/10ths of 1%. In order for there to be the increase cited, the researchers solved it for the hydrogen ion concentration and computed that change instead and called it the change in acidity. So if we moved .1 units towards acidity from the alkaline 8.2 to 8.1 oceans and compared the change, we have [delta H+] = 8 E-9/6 E-9 = 1.33 or a 33% increase in the hydrogen ion concentration, not an increase of 33% in the pH. None the less, that is how the story was reported and it is wrong.
Since the natural variation of ocean pH can be up to 5% in either direction, I am speculating that in order to make the story seem legitimate, a gross exaggeration of fact was needed to sell it and hence the switch and bait tactic was used with the pH equation.
You agreed with me in my premise that hydrogen ion concentration makes up the pH but it is not defined by that number because the number of ions in an aqueous solution of water are very large. That was the whole idea behind creating a logarithmic scale with the 14 orders of magnitude to define it. I reported this to the Oregonian readership and thought the issue was settled. But then I found this:
http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/co2/story/What+is+Ocean+Acidification%3F

In this explanation offered by NOAA, of which you are a senior scientist, we are back to the trickery of claiming the ocean acidity has increased by 30%. Are you aware of this NOAA information page? It needs an immediate correction. The ocean pH has been changing everywhere within natural variations. There is no provable decrease that can be identified with atmospheric CO2 that is related to human activity. Does Jane Lubchenco understand this? She has made numerous and completely false assertions that the up welling ocean water off of the Northwest coasts ( that will be on the rise because of the switch to cold phase PDO in 2007 that will run thirty years and likely decrease the pH additionally ) is attributable to human caused climate change. There is absolutely no proof of this and as far as meteorologists can tell, the mid and north Pacific Hadley cell summer circulation has intensified on schedule and is behaving perfectly normally in the cold phase of this ocean cycle. Either you or Lubchenco need to correct this page. It is misleading the public.
Sincerely,
Chuck F. Wiese
Meteorologist

"Barcelona just had a week of temperatures above 30℃. It’s a few degrees hotter than the long-term average, but no heatwave. In winter, Spain’s second largest city is typically a mild 15℃ or so. With its climate regulated by warm Mediterranean waters, temperatures rarely drop below freezing. Is this what the future holds for London? One group of scientists certainly thinks so. In a new study, they have tried to convey the risks of global warming by finding the closest modern-day climates to describe what the future might be like for certain cities. They predict that, for instance, Madrid’s climate in 2050 will be like Marrakech’s climate now, Seattle will resemble San Francisco, Stockholm will feel like Budapest, and that London will become like Barcelona. It makes sense to focus on cities as they are literally “hot-spots” of climate risk due to their dense populations, concentration of assets and susceptibility to extreme weather. Getting this message across to city managers and vulnerable communities is not always easy.  The researchers gathered data on the background climate of 520 major cities. Nineteen variables, including maximum temperature of the warmest month and precipitation seasonality, were combined using a statistical method that takes account of their relative importance and interrelationships. Equivalent variables for 2050 were obtained from three climate models, which were all programmed to take the optimistic view that emissions will stabilise this century. Present and future city climates were then used to “twin” the most similar metropolises. Pairing cities in this way is a clever idea. But such like-for-like comparisons are just too simplistic. This is because cities make their own climates according to their unique layouts, building materials, artificial heat sources, amounts of open or green spaces, and types of water feature.  There can be fundamental differences between two cities in these respects. For example, Barcelona has among the highest population densities in Europe, at about 16,000 per square kilometre, more than the 10,000 or so recorded by inner London boroughs. Population density is a useful indicator of both the intensity and level of exposure to the urban heat island – compact cities tend to be hotter cities. While Barcelona is striving to become a greener city, nearly two-thirds of Greater London is already occupied by gardens, parks and water. Across the city, such spaces provide cool refuges for people and biodiversity. For instance, satellite observations reveal that on a hot summers day Richmond Park – a large space on the western edge of the city known for its deer – can be about 10°C cooler than parts of the more central Southwark, Lambeth and Westminster. Even in these central boroughs, temperatures are chillier along the Thames embankment than just a few hundred metres away. Hence, the multiple micro-climates experienced day-to-day and from place-to-place within a city are not readily characterised by a few summary statistics. The actual “felt” temperature depends on a host of factors, not least the effect of atmospheric humidity. Conditions can become lethal when dangerous combinations of temperature and humidity are exceeded – something that unfortunately already occurs in cities such as Karachi in Pakistan or Kolkata in India.  Global warming means that 350m more people could be exposed to deadly heat by 2050 – and South Asian mega-cities are in the front-line. However, with 4°C of global warming even New York could become heat stressed. So any assessment of future conditions in global cities should evaluate the combined threat of heat with humidity. According to the Lancet Countdown 2018 Report, threats to human health from heatwaves are becoming more frequent and dangerous. Despite the above reservations, the new study does alert us to the possibility that over one-fifth of the studied cities could shift to climate conditions hitherto unobserved anywhere on Earth. This applies to cities such as Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia, Libreville in Gabon and Manaus in Brazil, which are all in the tropics.  Extraordinary temperatures are already being experienced within the homes and workplaces of some low income communities of cities such as Accra, Ghana. Trying to visualise how these places might be further stressed by climate change is an important step towards improving the well-being of some of the world’s most vulnerable urban citizens.

"**An outdoor festive lights show has been cancelled after police and council officials said it breached coronavirus regulations, organisers say.**
The Fonmon Festive Lights Show had been due to get under way at Fonmon Castle, in the Vale of Glamorgan, on Friday.
But just hours after organisers said it had been given the ""all clear"" from environmental health officials, it was cancelled.
The Vale of Glamorgan council said it was ""in dialogue"" with organisers.
Organisers of the show say the new regulations prohibit outdoor events attended by more than 30 people over the age of 11 at any one time.
But organisers claim they had been caught by surprise by the new rules after they were given permission by Vale of Glamorgan Council just two hours before it was due to begin.
About 500 people had been expected to attend the light show each evening, spaced out over six hours, at the 30-acre (12.1-hectare) site.
""We created a safe, secure environment under the current Covid Laws which we hoped would have provided a much needed uplifting end to the year,"" organisers said in a statement on Facebook.
But due to ""a very recent change"" to environmental health laws in Wales, staff said they were ""very disappointed to say that it is no longer viable or operationally possible for us to proceed as planned this year"".
People who purchased tickets are being offered full refunds or the opportunity to transfer tickets for future events.
The statement added: ""Fast changing laws like these make it difficult for any business to survive but we will not let this stop us and we will all push onâ¦ somehow.""
A spokesman for the Vale of Glamorgan council said: ""It was agreed the light show would not continue beyond Friday night and we are in dialogue with the organisers as the regulations continue to evolve."""

Paul Bongiorno submits this story:
Mr. Watts and company,
Good day Sir. I’d received a response from the UK’s Press Complaint’s Commission regarding the UK’s ‘Guardian’ story of, ‘Peter Gleick cleared of forging..’ fiction.
The ‘PCC’s Simon Yip forwarded me the following:

============================================================
The concerns you have raised relate directly to the Pacific Institute Board of Directors. Given the nature of the story, it appears that it would be difficult for the Commission to investigate or understand this matter fully without the involvement of the organisation in question. In addition, the outcome of a Commission investigation (whether correction, apology or adjudication, for example) would need their approval. In such circumstances, we would generally require a complaint from the subject of the article, in order to take the matter forward.
We recognise, however, that the concerns you have raised are significant. Therefore, in the first instance, we will attempt to contact the Pacific Institute Board of Directors to make them aware of our services and the fact that we have been alerted to this coverage as a possible concern. We will endeavour to keep you updated on the outcome, but I should make clear that these approaches frequently take some time to result in a decision whether or not to take forward a complaint, so it may not be possible in this case to revert to you.
You are most welcome to contact us if you would like to follow up on it.
With best wishes
Yours sincerely

The speculation is that Goldenberg got some inside information from somebody privy to the “independent investigation” commissioned by the Pacific Institute and then jumped the gun with it just like she did with the original Fakegate story.
Sounds to me like another bought and paid for bucket of whitewash of the Muir-Russell brand.

"The shadow treasurer Jim Chalmers says if the Morrison government is serious about kickstarting the economy after the coronavirus, it will seek bipartisan agreement with Labor on a new energy policy, and end the decade long climate wars. In an interview with Guardian Australia’s politics podcast, Chalmers says Labor was prepared to end the “decade-long barney” in the last parliament by supporting the national energy guarantee to “get some certainty in the system”.  He said that mechanism allowed the major parties to bridge their long running disagreement about how quickly Australia should reduce emissions “because at some point in the future Labor could dial up the ambition, and the Coalition theoretically could dial down the ambition at some future point”. With the government flagging a program of reforms to boost growth as part of the recovery post-Covid-19, Chalmers said energy was the obvious place to start. “If they are serious about getting the economy going again, if they are serious about revisiting some of those things they’ve rejected before – remembering that the last architect of an energy policy is now the treasurer – for all those reasons I think it would be worth seeing if something is possible.” A leading Australian business organisation, the AiGroup, has recently called for the two biggest economic challenges in memory – recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic and cutting greenhouse gas emissions – to be addressed together, saying that would boost economic growth and put the country on a firm long-term footing. A number of other community and investor groups have expressed similar sentiments. “Anybody who looks at our economy objectively and thinks about what will be the source of growth after this crisis clearly thinks that industry needs to have cheaper and cleaner energy,” Chalmers said. “We need to get that skills mix, the R&D commercialisation side – all of those things – they will be the key to the future.” “I guess what I am relaying is what business says to me … business can’t understand why we can’t get a resolution on energy, and if you think about our challenges on growth, employment and wages, then I think any serious objective observer would say energy has got to be part [of post-Covid recovery].” Chalmers said it “remains to be seen” whether the major parties could come to terms but he said Labor’s attitude towards the national energy guarantee indicated “there were compromises Labor was prepared to make to get some kind of certainty in the system so business could invest with confidence”. In a wide-ranging conversation, Chalmers also flagged Labor would look to develop policies during the current parliamentary term that recognised that unemployment was likely to remain elevated in Australia after the worst of the coronavirus economic shock had passed. New figures released this week show the jobless rate in Australia has hit the highest level since September 2015, with seasonally adjusted employment falling by 594,300 in April. The Australian Bureau of Statistics said around 2.7 million people, or one in every five person employed in March, either left employment, or had their hours reduced between March and April. Chalmers said there was a problem with demand in the economy and there was also a problem that the unemployment benefit was too low. The shadow treasurer said he was not an advocate of universal basic income as a concept. Universal basic income provides all citizens with a cash payment, replacing traditional welfare systems. But Chalmers said there was clearly a need to “rethink whether the social safety net is stitched together robustly enough to deal with crises like [Covid-19] and the aftermath of crises like this”. He said reference points for that conversation would be job guarantees, or labour market programs like Working Nation – a labour market program from the Keating era. Chalmers said there was an “appetite” for a place-based labour market program “where we recognise for young people in particular, they may be unemployed for longer, and we need to think in innovative ways how we employ these people”. He said central to his thinking was the need to avoid “inter-generational carnage” after an economic downturn. “I think a first world, first rate, wealthy country like ours shouldn’t have disadvantage cascade through the generations.” Chalmers said he was particularly concerned about workers aged over 55 and young people becoming detached from the labour market."

"**NI's Education Minister has again dismissed speculation that schools will close early for the Christmas break.**
Peter Weir said despite dismissing the possibility of an extended Christmas break earlier this month ""there continue to be widespread rumours about this matter"".
He described the ongoing rumours as ""disappointing"".
""I will once again stress that there are no plans to extend the Christmas holidays for schools,"" Mr Weir said.
Mr Weir first addressed speculation on 17 November.
""I believe this would only cause further disruption to children's education and lead to an increase in levels of stress and anxiety,"" he added.
Mr Weir said an extended Christmas break could lead to a greater spread of the virus.
""I strongly believe that face-to-face teaching is the best form of education and our schools are the best place to provide this in a controlled and safe environment.
""Indeed, large numbers of young people socialising out of school has the potential to create a major public health concern,"" he said.
His priority, he added, is to ""guard children's education, mental health and well-being"".
Schools in Northern Ireland are due to be closed between 22 December and 4 January."

Pretty shocking headline isn’t it! How dare I! How could I cast such a slur over the darling of the climate change activist movement? What could I possibly look to that would back up such a ludicrous conclusion?



Thank you for asking. Allow me to present my evidence. Before I do, please understand I don’t generally do politics, but my concerns mean I might have to. I have parents and in-laws, who are about the same age as Greta’s grandparents would be, that I love dearly. I don’t want to see anything bad happen to them due to the side effects of bad policies.



I cannot read Greta’s mind, so I am more than happy to believe she is sincere like so many who have bought into the Greenie ideology going around these days. But we must ask, how is it working out in the real world? One not governed by the utopian delusions of the political tree-huggers.



Greta advocates for environmentally sustainable energy sources. Nice sounding idea, but what are the side effects? The biggest one is sky rocketing power prices, despite political promises to the contrary. 



Wind, rain and sun just aren’t reliable, so coal, gas and nuclear power plants need to remain on “hot standby” (effectively still running) in case Mother Earth needs to go to the loo and can’t steer clouds around solar panels all the time. So, there is no money saved. Just extra construction and infrastructure costs.



Who does this affect the worst? The poor and the elderly. There are already so many horror stories about them turning off heaters because they cannot pay power bills and suffering from pneumonia or other winter chills. At least the young have the physiology to cope. The old don’t. They have quite often finished up in hospital and died years before their time.



But even that’s not the biggie.



The biggie is the government control and socialist restructuring required to implement all the fearmongering global environmental targets that people like Greta support. How has that worked out in the past? Who was it that said, “those who don’t learn from history will repeat it?” It was George Santayana in 1906.



Once large numbers of people start losing jobs, after socialist controls over anything remotely affecting the environment start bankrupting free market economies, the government is going to get one epic social welfare bill, without the economic activity to generate the money to pay for it.



Couple that with the medical bill that mass sickness because the elderly and others are unable to heat their homes (if they even get reliable electricity), and the government is going to fast run out of ethical options to cut costs.



There is one solution to this that has been seen before throughout history. Euthanasia. Economically it’s too easy. Suddenly there are trillions of dollars available to do other things to alleviate (or at least delay) suffering in other areas and to pacify angry voters.



Maybe that’s why some politicians are not quite as outraged by euthanasia as they used to be: once they see what the money saved on elderly care could do elsewhere. It’s too politically easy to justify it on the grounds of “alleviating suffering,” at least initially, then slowly slide down the slippery slope, allowing other excuses for it behind the scenes.



You don’t think they would dare do this? They will. They will have to. The alternative will either be being voted out for bankrupting the country or being booted out for not having the balls to make tough decisions.



I’m sure Greta herself would shudder to think of this. I’m sure she has grandparents whom she loves and who love her. I am sure the thought of them dying or being euthanised in a socialist dystopia would be unbearable.



Just like the thought of a loved one dying in a car crash caused by my bad driving would be unbearable to me. The problem is, once I have entered that corner too fast and started slipping off the road it’s too late. Braking, steering, accelerating only changes which side of the car goes over the edge first.



To avoid the accident, you must anticipate what could go wrong and slow down earlier. In the same way, we need to look at where Greenie scaremongering is taking us politically and select reverse sooner rather than later. By the time it’s all set up, and the desperate political elite run out of money and need to start taking the knife to their darling social programmes, it will be too late.

Never mind carbon dioxide; the biggest threat to our children’s future is the cluster of economic arsonists creeping through our halls of power, their claws clutching shabby virtue like the awful [Tricoteuse](https://timeline.com/tricoteuse-french-revolution-b9887af073f4)[s](https://www.google.com/search?q=Tricoteuse&oq=Tricoteuse&aqs=chrome..69i57&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)[ ](https://www.google.com/search?q=Tricoteuse&oq=Tricoteuse&aqs=chrome..69i57&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)of Paris clutched knitting-needles in their crusted fingers while delightfully anticipating Madame Guillotine’s newest victim, enjoying the sport as whole sections of society are destroyed.



The Zero Carbon bill is the fuel to burn New Zealand’s house down, and like all socialist ideologically-driven disasters it will create division, resentment and misery that will spread like an inferno through every single piece of this green and pleasant land with middle New Zealand set to lose heavily.



Austin Mitchell observed this land and its people in the late 1960s, dubbing it the ‘Half-Gallon, Quarter Acre, Pavlova Paradise’. Under the shackle of the Zero Sense Bill we will, within thirty years, have become the ‘Half-baked, Quarter-trillion, Palaver Purgatory’.



Half-baked, because that’s what the idea that we can influence nature’s grand thermometer by altering the emissions profile of our little group of islands is. It is no more than a ridiculous tilt at an overwhelmingly powerful windmill, a force we don’t fully understand nor could ever hope to control. It is bloody ridiculous idea and **it is an indictment, an affront to common sense, that just a single MP voted against** the sanity-free document’s first reading in our parliament.



Quarter-trillion, because that’s what it’s going to cost us. A $247,500,000,000 – [by Treasury estimates](https://treasury.govt.nz/publications/risa/regulatory-impact-assessment-zero-carbon-bill) – restriction on our economy’s growth caused by attempting to restrict a tiny, harmless, trace-element component of this earth’s atmosphere. What madness is it called, in an age when every manifestation of insanity has a name, when we attempt to strangle ourselves in order to save our own breath?



What does a quarter-trillion mean in real terms? **It means $17,800 less,** every year, for each and every ‘average’ household in the country, except there is no ‘average’ household; the hurt will not be borne fairly, or squarely. The vandalism will strike some severely. Some entire industries will disappear as early as 2025. Some households will be devastated. Some entire communities will be placed on life-support for the entirety of their foreseeable future, and their children’s. ([Zero Carbon Bill Economic Analysis: A synthesis of economic impacts.](https://www.mfe.govt.nz/publications/climate-change/zero-carbon-bill-economic-analysis-synthesis-of-economic-impacts) Page 16, Table 5. Comparison of scenarios and key assumptions made across NZIER and Vivid. ‘Assumptions specific to each scenario’: “Closure of iron, steel and aluminium production in 2025”)



Both Treasury and the Ministry for the Environment have identified the hardest-hit under the Zero-Sense Bill – our earners. Producers will bear the brunt of increased costs and inhibited growth under the unhinged plan. The socialists will not care a jot about these people who are the backbone of our export earnings. They’ll simply say “go away and find a supplementary income stream”. The producers themselves may well say (but probably in much sterner terms), “Don’t you think that if I could find an income stream that would reward my family $17,800 per year for the next thirty years, that I would have already embraced it?” 



The other group of **hardest-hit will be our vulnerable.** Both Regulatory Impact Statements, Treasury’s and MoE, clearly identify our worst-off for markedly brutal side effects under the Zero Sense Bill. Some of these families have household incomes of under $35,000 already; how the hell will they cope with less – relatively, much, much less? 



While middle New Zealand will be forced to shell out for the afflicted economic quintiles 1 & 2 there will be limits before the extra taxation burdens start to cause further economic damage. At this point the chardonnay socialists will simply wave the poor off astern and forget about them, as ever socialists have done, caring not at all about equality of outcomes as long as they’re alright, Jack. This attitude is nicely summed up by Mr Mitchell in his book:



“With socialists equality is a matter of principle, until they reach power, when it’s a matter of amnesia.”



 **Palaver** , because that’s what this bill is – a whole lot of talk that will produce nothing and lead to none of its stated outcomes. I could have said Bullshit; perhaps I should have, but it doesn’t start with a P.



 **Purgatory** , because that’s what we will, as a society, become, a place of eternal punishment for trusting that these economically-illiterate goons would not deliberately harm the people of this country in such an utterly meaningless and comprehensively ridiculous way for not a grain of benefit.

"**The Urdd Eisteddfod - due to be hosted in Denbighshire - has been cancelled because of the Covid pandemic.**
The May 2021 event will be postponed until 2022 ""for the health and wellbeing of its members, volunteers and staff, as well as the public"".
The Urdd hopes to organise and stage an alternative, digital festival. Plans will be revealed in January.
The National Eisteddfod will decide in January whether to go ahead, after postponing in Ceredigion this year.
The Urdd said the virtual Eisteddfod T event will be held duringâ¯Whitsun half-term for children, young people and their families, following the success of this year's first-ever online version of the festival which attracted more than 6,000 competitors.
The Urdd Eisteddfod in Carmarthenshire will move to 2023 and Urdd Eisteddfod Maldwyn to 2024.
SiÃ¢n Eirian, acting director of the Urdd Eisteddfod, said there was ""no real alternative"" but to cancel next year's event.
""Under normal circumstances, very soon into the new year, schools, Urdd youth clubs and households alike would be busy preparing for the local and regional Eisteddfodau,"" she said.
""But the current restrictions in place would make it almost impossible for our contestants to prepare for these preliminary rounds, let alone stage them.""
""I am fully aware of the disappointment today's announcement brings to the volunteers in Denbighshire who have worked so tirelessly, not to mention the children and young people who were looking forward to returning to compete on stage,"" she said.
But she added the 2022 Eisteddfod falls on the Urdd's centenary, making it ""an extra special occasion"".
Gwenno Mair Davies, chair of the Urdd Eisteddfod and Arts Board, said everyone was ""longing"" for the festival to return and that 2022's would be ""a festival to remember""."

Whoo boy. Judith writes:
Muller bases his ‘conversion’ on the results of their recent paper?

So, how convincing is the analysis in Rohde et al.’s  new paper A new estimate of the average surface land temperature spanning 1753-2011?   Their analysis is based upon curve fits to volcanic forcing and the logarithm of the CO2 forcing (addition of solar forcing did not improve the curve fit.)
I have made public statements that I am unconvinced by their analysis.  I do not see any justification in their argument for making a stronger attribution statement than has been made by the IPCC AR4.    I have written MANY posts that critique the IPCC’s attribution analysis.  Here I try to give a sense of the challenges in attributing climate change to causal factors.

The first Earth Day was in 1970, and back then, many ‘apocalyptic’ predictions were made about the environment. Mark Perry at [Carpe Diem AEIdeas blog](https://www.thegwpf.com/18-spectacularly-wrong-predictions-made-around-the-time-of-first-earth-day-in-1970-expect-more-this-year/) has gone back and looked at them in order to present us with all the predictions that they got so spectacularly wrong 49 years ago.



1\. Harvard biologist George Wald estimated that “civilization will end within 15 or 30 years unless immediate action is taken against problems facing mankind.”



2\. “We are in an environmental crisis which threatens the survival of this nation, and of the world as a suitable place of human habitation,” wrote Washington University biologist Barry Commoner in the Earth Day issue of the scholarly journal Environment.



3\. The day after the first Earth Day, the New York Times editorial page warned, “Man must stop pollution and conserve his resources, not merely to enhance existence but to save the race from intolerable deterioration and possible extinction.”



4\. “Population will inevitably and completely outstrip whatever small increases in food supplies we make,” Paul Ehrlich confidently declared in the April 1970 issue of _Mademoiselle_. “The death rate will increase until at least 100-200 million people per year will be starving to death during the next ten years.”



5\. “Most of the people who are going to die in the greatest cataclysm in the history of man have already been born,” wrote Paul Ehrlich in a 1969 essay titled “Eco-Catastrophe! “By…[1975] some experts feel that food shortages will have escalated the present level of world hunger and starvation into famines of unbelievable proportions. Other experts, more optimistic, think the ultimate food-population collision will not occur until the decade of the 1980s.”



6\. Ehrlich sketched out his most alarmist scenario for the 1970 Earth Day issue of The Progressive, assuring readers that between 1980 and 1989, some 4 billion people, including 65 million Americans, would perish in the “Great Die-Off.”



7\. “It is already too late to avoid mass starvation,” declared Denis Hayes, the chief organizer for Earth Day, in the Spring 1970 issue of _The Living Wilderness_.



8\. Peter Gunter, a North Texas State University professor, wrote in 1970, “Demographers agree almost unanimously on the following grim timetable: by 1975 widespread famines will begin in India; these will spread by 1990 to include all of India, Pakistan, China and the Near East, Africa. By the year 2000, or conceivably sooner, South and Central America will exist under famine conditions….By the year 2000, thirty years from now, the entire world, with the exception of Western Europe, North America, and Australia, will be in famine.”



9\. In January 1970, _Life_ reported, “Scientists have solid experimental and theoretical evidence to support…the following predictions: In a decade, urban dwellers will have to wear gas masks to survive air pollution…by 1985 air pollution will have reduced the amount of sunlight reaching earth by one half….”



10\. Ecologist Kenneth Watt told _Time_ that, “At the present rate of nitrogen buildup, it’s only a matter of time before light will be filtered out of the atmosphere and none of our land will be usable.”



11\. Barry Commoner predicted that decaying organic pollutants would use up all of the oxygen in America’s rivers, causing freshwater fish to suffocate.



12\. Paul Ehrlich chimed in, predicting in 1970 that “air pollution…is certainly going to take hundreds of thousands of lives in the next few years alone.” Ehrlich sketched a scenario in which 200,000 Americans would die in 1973 during “smog disasters” in New York and Los Angeles.



13\. Paul Ehrlich warned in the May 1970 issue of _Audubon_ that DDT and other chlorinated hydrocarbons “may have substantially reduced the life expectancy of people born since 1945.” Ehrlich warned that Americans born since 1946…now had a life expectancy of only 49 years, and he predicted that if current patterns continued this expectancy would reach 42 years by 1980, when it might level out. (Note: According to the [most recent CDC report](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/life-expectancy.htm), life expectancy in the US is 78.8 years).



14\. Ecologist Kenneth Watt declared, “By the year 2000, if present trends continue, we will be using up crude oil at such a rate…that there won’t be any more crude oil. You’ll drive up to the pump and say, `Fill ‘er up, buddy,’ and he’ll say, `I am very sorry, there isn’t any.’”



15\. Harrison Brown, a scientist at the National Academy of Sciences, published a chart in _Scientific American_ that looked at metal reserves and estimated the humanity would totally run out of copper shortly after 2000. Lead, zinc, tin, gold, and silver would be gone before 1990.



16\. Sen. Gaylord Nelson wrote in _Look_ that, “Dr. S. Dillon Ripley, secretary of the Smithsonian Institute, believes that in 25 years, somewhere between 75 and 80 percent of all the species of living animals will be extinct.”



17\. In 1975, Paul Ehrlich predicted that “since more than nine-tenths of the original tropical rainforests will be removed in most areas within the next 30 years or so, it is expected that half of the organisms in these areas will vanish with it.”



18\. Kenneth Watt warned about a pending Ice Age in a speech. “The world has been chilling sharply for about twenty years,” he declared. “If present trends continue, the world will be about four degrees colder for the global mean temperature in 1990, but eleven degrees colder in the year 2000. This is about twice what it would take to put us into an ice age.”



Today, we are still being bombarded with apocalyptic predictions about global warming and the rise of sea levels, so it is a good idea to bear in mind how badly wrong the doomsday prophets can get it.



Climate preacher/scientist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez predicted recently that “[We’re like… the world is gonna end in 12 years if we don’t address climate change](https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/426353-ocasio-cortez-the-world-will-end-in-12-years-if-we-dont-address).” You can add that to the spectacularly wrong predictions made this year around the time of Earth Day 2019.

 _The Current Wisdom_ is a monthly series in which Senior Fellow Patrick J. Michaels reviews interesting items on global warming in the scientific literature that may not have received the media attention that they deserved, or have been misinterpreted in the popular press.



 _The Current Wisdom_ only comments on science appearing in the refereed, peer‐​reviewed literature, or that has been peer‐​screened prior to presentation at a scientific congress.



The recent publication of two articles in _Nature_ magazine proclaiming a link to rainfall extremes (and flooding) to global warming, added to the heat in Russia and the floods in Pakistan in the summer of 2010, and the back‐​to‐​back cold and snowy winters in the eastern U.S. and western Europe, have gotten a lot of public attention. This includes a recent hearing in the House of Representatives, despite its Republican majority. Tying weather extremes to global warming, or using them as “proof” that warming doesn’t exist (see: snowstorms), is a popular rhetorical flourish by politicos of all stripes. 



The hearing struck many as quite odd, inasmuch as it is much clearer than apocalyptic global warming that the House is going to pass meaningless legislation commanding the EPA to cease and desist from regulating greenhouse gas emissions. “Meaningless” means that it surely will not become law. Even on the long‐​shot probability that it passes the Senate, the President will surely veto, and there are nowhere near enough votes to override such an action.



Perhaps “wolf!” has been cried yet again. A string of soon‐​to‐​be‐​published papers in the scientific literature finds that despite all hue and cry about global warming and recent extreme weather events, natural climate variability is to blame.



Where to start? How about last summer’s Russian heat wave?



The Russian heat wave (and to some degree the floods in Pakistan) have been linked to the same large‐​scale, stationary weather system, called an atmospheric “blocking” pattern. When the atmosphere is “blocked” it means that it stays in the same configuration for period of several weeks (or more) and keeps delivering the same weather to the same area for what can seem like an eternity to people in the way. Capitalizing on the misery in Russia and Pakistan, atmospheric blocking was added to the list of things that were supposed to be “consistent with” anthropogenically stimulated global warming which already, of course included heat waves and floods. And thus the Great Russian Heat Wave of 2010 became part of global warming lore.



But then a funny thing happened — scientists with a working knowledge of atmospheric dynamics started to review the situation and found scant evidence for global warming.



The first chink in the armor came back in the fall of 2010, when scientists from the Physical Sciences Division (PSD) of the Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) presented the results of their preliminary investigation on the web  [1], and concluded that “[d]espite this strong evidence for a warming planet, **greenhouse gas forcing fails to explain the 2010 heat wave over western Russia**. The natural process of atmospheric blocking, and the climate impacts induced by such blocking, are the principal cause for this heat wave.”



The PSD folks have now followed this up with a new peer‐​reviewed article in the journal _Geophysical Research Letters_ that rejects the global warming explanation. The paper is titled “Was There a Basis for Anticipating the 2010 Russian Heat Wave?” Turns out that there wasn’t.



To prove this, the research team, led by PSD’s Randall Dole, first reviewed the observed temperature history of the region affected by the heat wave (western Russia, Belarus, the Ukraine, and the Baltic nations). To start, they looked at the recent antecedent conditions: “Despite record warm globally‐​averaged surface temperatures over the first six months of 2010, Moscow experienced an unusually cold winter and a relatively mild but variable spring, providing no hint of the record heat yet to come.” Nothing there.



Then they looked at the long‐​term temperature record: “The July surface temperatures for the region impacted by the 2010 Russian heat wave shows no significant warming trend over the prior 130‐​year period from 1880 to 2009… . A linear trend calculation yields a total temperature change over the 130 years of -0.1Â°C (with a range of 0 to -0.4Â°C over the four data sets [they examined]).” There’s not a hint of a build‐​up to a big heat wave.



And as to the behavior of temperature extremes: “There is also no clear indication of a trend toward increasing warm extremes. The prior 10 warmest Julys are distributed across the entire period and exhibit only modest clustering earlier in this decade, in the 1980s and in the 1930s… . This behavior differs substantially from globally averaged annual temperatures, for which eleven of the last twelve years ending in 2006 rank among the twelve warmest years in the instrumental record since 1850… .”



With regard any indication that “global” warming was pushing temperatures higher in Russia and thus helped to fuel the extreme heat last summer, Dole et al. say this: “With no significant long‐​term trend in western Russia July surface temperatures detected over the period 1880–2009, mean regional temperature changes are thus very unlikely to have contributed substantially to the magnitude of the 2010 Russian heat wave.”



Next the PSD folks looked to see if the existing larger‐​scale antecedent conditions, fed into climate models would produce the atmospheric circulation patterns (i.e. blocking) that gave rise to the heat wave. The tested “predictors” included patterns of sea surface temperature and arctic ice coverage, which most people feel have been subject to some human influence. No relationship: “These findings suggest that the blocking and heat wave were not primarily a forced response to specific boundary conditions during 2010.”



In fact, the climate models exhibited no predilection for projecting increases in the frequency of atmospheric blocking patterns over the region as greenhouse gas concentrations increased. Just the opposite: “Results using very high‐​resolution climate models suggest that the number of Euro‐​Atlantic blocking events will decrease by the latter half of the 21st century.”



At this point, Dole and colleagues had about exhausted all lines of inquiry and summed things up:



Our analysis points to a primarily natural cause for the Russian heat wave. This event appears to be mainly due to internal atmospheric dynamical processes that produced and maintained an intense and long‐​lived blocking event. Results from prior studies suggest that it is likely that the intensity of the heat wave was further increased by regional land surface feedbacks. The absence of long‐​term trends in regional mean temperatures and variability together with the model results indicate that it is very unlikely that warming attributable to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations contributed substantially to the magnitude of this heat wave.



Can’t be much clearer than that.



But that was last summer. What about the past two winters? Both were very cold in the eastern U.S. with record snows events and/​or totals scattered about the country.



Cold, snow, and global warming? On Christmas Day 2010, the _New York Times_ ran an op‐​ed by Judah Cohen, a long‐​range forecaster for the private forecasting firm Atmospheric and Environmental Research, outlining his theory as to how late summer Arctic ice declines lead to more fall snow cover across Siberia which in turn induces atmospheric circulation patterns to favor snowstorms along the East Coast of the U.S. Just last week, the Union of Concerned Scientists held a news conference where they handed out a press release [2] headlined “Climate Change Makes Major Snowstorms Likely.” In that release, Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center, laid out his theory as to how the loss of Arctic sea ice is helping to provide more moisture to fuel winter snowstorms across the U.S. as well as altering atmospheric circulation patterns into a preferred state for big snowstorms. Weather Underground’s Jeff Masters chimed in with “Heavy snowstorms are not inconsistent with a warming planet.”



As is the wont for this _Wisdom_ , let’s go back to the scientific literature.



Another soon‐​to‐​be released paper to appear in _Geophysical Research Letters_ describes the results of using the seasonal weather prediction model from the European Center for Medium‐​Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) to help untangle the causes of the unusual atmospheric circulation patterns that gave rise to the harsh winter of 2009–2010 on both sides of the Atlantic. A team of ECMWF scientists led by Thomas Jung went back and did experiments changing initial conditions that were fed into the ECMWF model and then assessed how well the model simulated the known weather patterns of the winter of 2009–2010. The different set of initial conditions was selected so as to test all the pet theories behind the origins of the harsh winter. Jung et al. describe their investigations this way: “Here, the origin and predictability of the unusual winter of 2009/10 are explored through numerical experimentation with the ECMWF Monthly forecasting system. More specifically, the role of anomalies in sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice, the tropical atmospheric circulation, the stratospheric polar vortex, solar insolation and near surface temperature (proxy for snow cover) are examined.”



Here is what they found after running their series of experiments.



 _Arctic sea ice and sea surface temperature anomalies_. These are often associated with global warming caused by people. Finding: “These results suggest that neither SST nor sea ice anomalies explain the negative phase of the NAO during the 2009/10 winter.”



(NAO are the commonly used initials for the North Atlantic Oscillation — and atmospheric circulation pattern that can act to influence winter weather in the eastern U.S. and western Europe. A negative phase of the NAO is associated with cold and stormy weather and during the winter of 2009-10, the NAO value was the lowest ever observed.)



 _A global warming‐​induced weakening stratospheric (upper‐​atmosphere) jetstream_. “Like for the other experiments, these stratospheric relaxation experiments fail to reproduce the magnitude of the observed NAO anomaly.”



 _Siberian snow cover._ “The resulting [upper air patterns] show little resemblance with the observations… . The implied weak role of snow cover anomalies is consistent with other research… .”



 _Solar variability._ “The experiments carried out in this study suggest that the impact of anomalously low incoming [ultraviolet] radiation on the tropospheric circulation in the North Atlantic region are very small… suggesting that the unusually low solar activity contributed little, if any, to the observed NAO anomaly during the 2009/10 winter.”



Ok then, well what did cause the unusual weather patterns during the 2009-10 winter?



The results of this study, therefore, increase the likelihood that both the development and persistence of negative NAO phase resulted from internal atmospheric dynamical processes.



Translation: Random variability.



To drive this finding home, here’s another soon‐​to‐​be‐​released paper (D’Arrigo et al., 2001) that uses tree ring‐​based reconstructions of atmospheric circulation patterns and finds a similar set of conditions (including a negative NAO value second only to the 2009-10 winter) was responsible for the historically harsh winter of 1783–84 in the eastern U.S. and western Europe, which was widely noted by historians. It followed the stupendous eruption of the Icelandic volcano Laki the previous summer. The frigid and snowy winter conditions have been blamed on the volcano. In fact, Benjamin Franklin even commented as much.



But in their new study, Roseanne D’Arrigo and colleagues conclude that the harshness of that winter primarily was the result of anomalous atmospheric circulation patterns that closely resembled those observed during the winter of 2009-10, and that the previous summer’s volcanic eruption played a far less prominent role:



Our results suggest that Franklin and others may have been mistaken in attributing winter conditions in 1783–4 mainly to Laki or another eruption, rather than unforced variability.



Similarly, conditions during the 2009-10 winter likely resulted from natural [atmospheric] variability, not tied to greenhouse gas forcing… Evidence thus suggests that these winters were linked to the rare but natural occurrence of negative NAO and El NiÃ±o events.



The point is that natural variability can and does produce extreme events on every time scale, from days (e.g., individual storms), weeks (e.g., the Russian heat wave), months (e.g., the winter of 2009-10), decades (e.g., the lack of global warming since 1998), centuries (e.g., the Little Ice Age), millennia (e.g., the cycle of major Ice Ages), and eons (e.g., snowball earth).



Folks would do well to keep this in mind next time global warming is being posited for the weather disaster _du jour_. Almost assuredly, it is all hype and little might.



Too bad these results weren’t given a “hearing” in the House!

UPDATE: I’ve added a video at the end that speaks to the consensus thinking. Marc Morano’s arguments leaves the Australian Youth Climate Coalition’s Anna Rose speechless. – Anthony
Guest post by Dr. Tim Ball

Claims of a consensus was an early sign climate science was political. It was used to support official science of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in a public relations campaign to offset and divert from bad science, inadequate data, and incorrect assumptions. It’s in use again as the science of the anthropogenic global warming (AGW) hypothesis fails and people are not persuaded.
Many scientists were fooled, including James Lovelock, a central figure to environmentalism with his Gaia hypothesis. In 2007 he said,
“Before this century is over, billions of us will die and the few breeding pairs of people that survive will be in the Arctic.”
Recently he revised his view;
“The problem is we don’t know what the climate is doing. We thought we knew 20 years ago. That led to some alarmist books – mine included – because it looked clear-cut, but it hasn’t happened.”
“We were supposed to be halfway toward a frying world now.”
How could a reputable scientist be so wrong?

Some words have different meanings for the public than for professionals. For example, calling someone a skeptic is considered derogatory, yet it’s a necessity for a scientist. When warming became climate change skeptics became deniers, a nasty ambiguous word. It means you refuse to acknowledge information, but it’s specifically used for a few who deny the holocaust, arguably the most horrendous event in history.
There’s a negative implication to the word consensus. If you’re not part of it you’re out-of-step, stupid, antisocial, or all three. There’s no consensus in science. Even in politics it’s rare to assign a number to a consensus. Apparently to pretend credibility current users say there’s a 97 percent consensus about IPCC climate science.
Numerical measures of the consensus argument appeared early in climate As I recall, approximately 6000 people associated with the IPCC represented the original consensus. That number decreased to 2500 today, but they’re still the consensus according to RealClimate, the web site about which Michael Mann wrote in a 2004 email,
“…the important thing is to make sure they’re loosing (sic) the PR battle. That’s what the site is about.”
A 16 December 2004 entry asks,
“Is there really “consensus” in the scientific community on the reality of anthropogenic climate change?”
Evidence used was the now discredited study of Naomi Oreske that claimed of 928 articles selected objectively by a three word google search, 100 percent supported IPCC science.
On 22 December 2004 there’s another RealClimate insight;
We’ve used the term “consensus” here a bit recently without ever really defining what we mean by it. In normal practice, there is no great need to define it – no science depends on it. But it’s useful to record the core that most scientists agree on, for public presentation. The consensus that exists is that of the IPCC reports, in particular the working group I report (there are three WG’s. By “IPCC”, people tend to mean WG I).
This admits consensus is unnecessary in science, but necessary for climate science “for public presentation” or propaganda.
It’s another circular argument that pervade IPCC science and politics. For example, they hypothesize that CO2 causes temperature increase, program a computer model accordingly, then say the model proves that CO2 increase causes temperature increase. RealClimate says,
“The main points that most would agree on as “the consensus” are:
1.The earth is getting warmer (0.6 +/- 0.2 oC in the past century; 0.1 0.17 oC/decade over the last 30 years (see update)) [ch 2]
2.People are causing this [ch 12] (see update)
3.If GHG emissions continue, the warming will continue and indeed accelerate [ch 9]
4.(This will be a problem and we ought to do something about it)
I’ve put those four points in rough order of certainty. The last one is in brackets because whilst many would agree, many others (who agree with 1-3) would not, at least without qualification. It’s probably not a part of the core consensus in the way 1-3 are.”
So the consensus is their IPCC Reports.
Here are the facts of the consensus today.
1.The rise of 0.6°C has an error of ±0.2°C or 33 percent – which is scientifically meaningless. Phil Jones a senior member of the IPCC produced the number. The earth is not warming any more.
2.The only evidence people are the cause is in their computer models.
3. Temperature increase precedes CO2 increase in every single record anywhere, except in their computer models.
4.An application of the precautionary principle.
RealClimate said about consensus,
“In normal practice, there is no great need to define it – no science depends on it.”
But climate science of the IPCC and the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) at East Anglia was not normal practice: a political consensus was their only hope. As Michael Crichton said,
Historically, the claim of consensus has been the first refuge of scoundrels; it is a way to avoid debate by claiming that the matter is already settled.
Sounds familiar; the science is settled, and the debate is over because there’s a consensus.

It is amusing to listen to those involved in the business of public transport like the degreed so-called experts at Auckland Transport. You know the ones, straight out of university, who Phil Twyford thinks are as dumb as he is. In the case of Auckland Transport, he just might be not too far off the mark. Then there are the journalist ideologues like Simon Wilson. They all seem to be possessed with simplistic logic, to a degree brought about by an unhealthy obsession with climate change. They think that getting cars off the road and increasing all forms of public transport is going to solve all sorts of problems to do with our planet.



They love to spout figures referring to the increased number of passenger trips taken on trains and buses over the last fifteen years or so. These figures are presented in such a way that, in the morning and afternoon peak traffic times, you would expect to be the only vehicle on the motorway. This is not to question the accuracy of their figures but rather the myth that these increased numbers of public transport passenger trips are solving the gridlock on the motorways and major suburban roads. No one would argue that they’re helping, but they’re not and never will be the answer.



Some figures that they would like hidden will tell you why. According to a Boston Consulting Group report commissioned by Uber and released in March this year, peak hour travelling now lengthens Auckland car trips by 48%, just pipping Sydney as the worst in Australasia. The report found that 90% of the population travel in cars compared to just 5% who use public transport. This is the figure that needs to be taken notice of rather than the increased high fives figure of passenger trips taken. Nicky Preston, head of communications at Uber, says they found that 54% of Aucklanders own more than one car.



According to government modelling, 40% more of Auckland’s roads will be severely congested by 2049 if no action is taken. So what is Auckland Transport’s answer? No prizes for guessing. They’re taking action to improve public transport in the region, a project I thought they’d just completed. They now have copious numbers of buses belching diesel fumes into the air, many outside of peak times with only two or three people in them.



Auckland Transport’s Mark Lambert says “We all know congestion is getting pretty bad in Auckland and it has been getting worse, we’ve been working on a lot of things, particularly public transport.” Interestingly Auckland Transport’s own figures show that it’s still quicker to get to the CBD by car in the morning peak from at least half of the six centres it monitors. The reports suggests car pooling and e-scooters as part of the solution. **Papakura or Albany to the city on an E-scooter?**



A report published in July by the Automobile Association said the average Aucklander wasted about 85 hours sitting in traffic last year, up from 79 hours in 2017. The AA predicts by 2028 Auckland will have 300,000 more people and 250,000 more cars. AA spokesman Barney Irvine says most of the growth will be in the outer suburbs with limited public transport, work and study options. He says what it all adds up to is much more driving and that means much more congestion.



In the next nine years, according to the AA, the passenger transport share of trips made will have increased from 5% to 7%, a measly 2%. This is where all the talk of great increases in numbers of passenger transport trips made, in my view, doesn’t paint the full picture and is to a degree misleading. Great for the transport boffins and Mayor Goff though.



Wellington is not much better off with bureaucrats seemingly unable to run a bus service. It reminds me of an episode of Yes Minister where a top politician asked if anyone had seen a bus timetable to which Jim Hacker replied by asking if a bus driver had ever seen a bus timetable. You’d think Grant Robertson’s partner Alf would be able to offer some meaningful advice. Wellington has five train lines but 85% of the people travelling only use two of them. Poses the question, is it worth keeping the others operational?



Both Auckland and Wellington are crying out for road improvements but requests from those in the know for what should happen are falling on deaf ears. The government, councils and those running transport in both cities need to wake up to the fact that public transport is not a solution to gridlock. The Hamilton to Auckland slow coach express with its 150 ghost passengers won’t do anything to reduce motorway congestion either.



Mr Twyford and his assistant, Ms Genter, need to get their heads out of the climate change sand and take a leaf out of Megan Woods’s book with her housing dashboard. They need a roading dashboard and to start building quick smart.

"The global coal industry will “never recover” from the Covid-19 pandemic, industry observers predict, because the crisis has proved renewable energy is cheaper for consumers and a safer bet for investors. A long-term shift away from dirty fossil fuels has accelerated during the lockdown, bringing forward power plant closures in several countries and providing new evidence that humanity’s coal use may finally have peaked after more than 200 years.  That makes the worst-case climate scenarios less likely, because they are based on a continued expansion of coal for the rest of the century. Even before the pandemic, the industry was under pressure due to heightened climate activism, divestment campaigns and cheap alternatives. The lockdown has exposed its frailties even further, wiping billions from the market valuations of the world’s biggest coal miners. As demand for electricity has fallen, many utilities have cut back on coal first, because it is more expensive than gas, wind and solar. In the EU imports of coal for thermal power plants plunged by almost two-thirds in recent months to reach lows not seen in 30 years. The consequences have been felt around the world as well. This week, a new report by the US Energy Information Administration projected the US would produce more electricity this year from renewables than from coal for the first time. Industry analysts predict coal’s share of US electricity generation could fall to just 10% in five years, down from 50% a decade ago. Despite Donald Trump’s campaign pledge to “dig coal”, there are now more job losses and closures in the industry than at any time since Eisenhower’s presidency 60 years ago. Among the latest has been Great River Energy’s plan to shut down a 1.1-gigawatt thermal plant in North Dakota and replace it with wind and gas. Rob Jackson, the chair of Global Carbon Project, said the pandemic was likely to confirm that coal will never again reach the global peak seen in 2013: “Covid-19 will slash coal emissions so much this year that the industry will never recover, even with a continued build-out in India and elsewhere. The crash in natural gas prices, record-cheap solar and wind power, and climate and health concerns have undercut the industry permanently.” Records are falling thick and fast. By Friday, the UK national grid had not burned a single lump of coal for 35 days, the longest uninterrupted period since the start of the industrial revolution more than 230 years ago. In Portugal, the record coal-free run has extended almost two months, the campaign group Europe Beyond Coal recently reported. Last month Sweden closed its last coal-fired power plant, KVV6 in Hjorthagen, eastern Stockholm, two years early because the mild winter meant it was not used even before the pandemic. Austria followed suit with the shutdown of its only remaining coal plant at Mellach. The Netherlands said it would reduce the capacity of its thermal plants by 75% to comply with a court order to reduce climate risks. More importantly, in India – the world’s second-biggest coal consumer – the government has prioritised cheap solar energy rather than coal in response to a slump in electricity demand caused by Covid-19 and a weak economy. This has led to the first year-on-year fall in carbon emissions in four decades, exceptional air quality, and a growing public clamour for more renewables. Elsewhere in Asia, the picture is mixed. A few years ago, Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines were expected to be the industry’s biggest growth areas, but the pandemic, falling renewable prices and a growing divestment campaign have put several major coal projects on hold. The party of South Korean president Moon Jae-in has been re-elected on a pledge to phase out domestic coal use, and many in his ruling coalition are pushing to end financing of overseas projects. In Japan, the big three commercial lenders and the governor of the Japan Bank of International Cooperation have recently said they will no longer accept proposals for coal generation. Other money taps are also being turned off, as investors and finance houses respond to scientific advice and campaigns by divestment activists and school strikers such as Greta Thunberg. “The economics of coal were already under structural pressure before the pandemic,” said Mark Lewis, the head of sustainability research at the investment management arm of French bank BNP Paribas. “And coming out of it these pressures will still be there – but now compounded by the impact of the pandemic.” BNP Paribas is one of a growing list of financial institutions which have chosen to sever ties with coal. The bank said last week that it would accelerate its planned exit from coal financing to 2030 to bring its portfolio in line with the Paris climate goals sooner. In the same week, the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund – the world’s biggest – ditched a host of coal mining and energy companies, including Glencore, Anglo-American, Vale and AGL over climate concerns. This follows coal blacklisting announcements by BlackRock, Standard Chartered and JPMorgan Chase. The fossil fuel has fallen from favour in the eyes of many investors due to rising climate concerns, cheaper renewable energy alternatives and a public backlash against air pollution. “The public health benefits of cleaner air will be front and centre after weeks of lockdown that have prompted blue skies and clean air in Asia’s megalopolises,” Lewis said. “This pressure from the finance sector will only accelerate going forward, pushing the cost of capital for coal projects even higher.” Even before the pandemic, Australian coal companies said they were finding it hard to find financing for mines and port facilities due to the international divestment campaign. This is not the only economic squeeze. A near-30% fall in the price of thermal coal has made more than half of production unprofitable, prompting several firms to warn of pit closures and layoffs. The elephant in the room is China, which burns half of the world’s coal and is the biggest financier of mines and power plants in Asia and Africa – largely to provide an export market for its domestic manufacturing and engineering firms. A few years ago, domestic coal consumption fell, prompting hopes that president Xi Jinping was committed to a shift away from dirty, high-emitting power production. But after the lockdown, the political priority is to jumpstart the economy. Provincial governments are now working on a slew of new thermal plants. But they are running at less than half of capacity because demand for coal has not returned to its previous level. “Covid-19 has made clear that China and India have built more than they need. Even before the crisis, they had overcapacity. Now with lower demand, you can see everything is a mess,” said Carlos Fernández Alvarez, lead coal analyst at the International Energy Agency. Alvarez said coal had been hit hardest by the pandemic, but he cautioned the decline could be temporary unless governments invest in renewables to pull economies out of the lockdown. “We have to look at this structurally. If there is high energy demand again in the future, it will probably be coal that picks up the slack because it is the marginal supplier,” he said. While nobody is expecting coal to disappear any time soon, Ted Nace, director of Global Energy Monitor, believes the balance has shifted for good. “Coal is definitely on the downturn and this pandemic is going to accelerate that. Demand should come back to some degree next year. But there is a very strong argument that it is not going to just bounce back.” • This article was amended on 18 May 2020. The quote about “structural pressure” was from Mark Lewis, head of sustainability research at the investment management arm of BNP Paribas, not from Michael Lewis, head of climate change investment research at BNP Paribas, as an earlier version said. And it was the party of the South Korean president that was re-elected this year, rather than Moon Jae-in himself."

Share this...FacebookTwitterSpiegel here presents the top 10 science stories of 2013.
Among them is the stop in global warming, which Spiegel describes as “the mysterious temperature development of the past years“. In the sub-heading Spiegel writes:
An unexpected development has been occupying the attention of climate scientists: The air appears not to have warmed up in the last 16 years. Obviously natural phenomena are covering the increasing impact of greenhouse gases.”
Here Spiegel appears to be very confused by the science, admitting that natural factors are running the show but at the same time illogically claiming that the impact of greenhouse gases is increasing! Spiegel then writes that skeptics should not be so sure that the warming has stopped, claiming that there’s “a variety of plausible explanations for the unexpected development“.
Spiegel then cites ocean cycles, weak solar activity, and both natural and manmade aerosols, which is amazing because except for aerosols, these are precisely the factors that skeptics have been claiming and alarmists dismissing from the get-go.
So whatever excuses or wordsmithing Spiegel tries to employ to save face from having been a grand believer of the AGW dogma since the very start, two things are clear: 1) the warming has definitely stopped, and 2) natural factors are really much more important than assumed and that the skeptics were right all along.
It’s time to completely revamp the models so that they start to resemble reality. It’s also time for the media to rethink their position on the issue rather than trying to hopelessly prop it up.

Direct, reliable observations of atmospheric conditions stretch as far back as the mid seventeenth century, with otherwise consistent records being punctuated by periodic updates in methods, practitioners, and observational equipment. To bridge these shifts in technique and technology, scientists develop reanalysis models designed to tie together diverse observations into a coherent picture of the system’s evolution. But, like all models or analytical techniques, reanalysis data sets can suffer from errors or biases. Identifying how the records produced by different reanalyses vary can be a difficult practice, but determining if a cluster of models consistently produces biased results can be even more difficult.
A number of reanalyses have recently been developed to track the rapidly changing Arctic atmosphere, and Serreze et al. compared them with one another and with the observational record. The authors focused on how the reanalyses represent the change in Arctic tropospheric water vapor from 1979 to 2010. They compared three of the most recent and complex reanalyses against meteorological measurements made using radiosondes at nine sites north of 70 degrees North. They find that the reanalyses consistently overestimate low-altitude temperatures and winter humidity. It is important to note that these positive biases caused the reanalyses to miss low-altitude wintertime temperature and humidity inversions identified by the radiosondes.

A finding shared by both reanalyses and radiosonde observations, however, is of an increasing availability of precipitable water in the low-altitude Arctic, which the authors suggest is associated with increasing air-sea surface temperatures, reduced sea ice extent, and other markers consistent with the polar amplification of global warming. Increasing Arctic humidity is a troubling result, as heightening atmospheric water vapor could further drive up regional temperatures.

Changes in tropospheric water vapor over the Arctic are examined for the period 1979 to 2010 using humidity and temperature data from nine high latitude radiosonde stations north of 70°N with nearly complete records, and from six atmospheric reanalyses, emphasizing the three most modern efforts, MERRA, CFSR and ERA-Interim. Based on comparisons with the radiosonde profiles, the reanalyses as a group have positive cold-season humidity and temperature biases below the 850 hPa level and consequently do not capture observed low-level humidity and temperature inversions. MERRA has the smallest biases. Trends in column-integrated (surface to 500 hPa) water vapor (precipitable water) computed using data from the radiosondes and from the three modern reanalyses at the radiosonde locations are mostly positive, but magnitudes and statistical significance vary widely between sites and seasons. Positive trends in precipitable water from MERRA, CFSR and ERA-Interim, largest in summer and early autumn, dominate the northern North Atlantic, including the Greenland, Norwegian and Barents seas, the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and (on the Pacific side) the Beaufort and Chukchi seas. This pattern is linked to positive anomalies in air and sea surface temperature and negative anomalies in end-of-summer sea ice extent. Trends from ERA-Interim are weaker than those from either MERRA or CFSR. As assessed for polar cap averages (the region north of 70°N), MERRA, CFSR and ERA-Interim all show increasing surface-500 hPa precipitable over the analysis period encompassing most months, consistent with increases in 850 hPa air temperature and 850 hPa specific humidity. Data from all of the reanalyses point to strong interannual and decadal variability. The MERRA record in particular shows evidence of artifacts likely introduced by changes in assimilation data streams. A focus on the most recent decade (2001–2010) reveals large differences between the three reanalyses in the vertical structure of specific humidity and temperature anomalies.

Dr. Roger Pielke Sr. reports that there’s a new paper out with a fun title, based on that famous for Robert A. Heinlein quote : Climate is what you expect, weather is what you get.
“The Climate Is Not What You Expect” By S. Lovejoy and D. Schertzer 2012
The abstract reads: (emphasis added by Pielke)
Prevailing definitions of climate are not much different from “the climate is what you expect, the weather is what you get”. Using a variety of sources including reanalyses and paleo data, and aided by notions and analysis techniques from Nonlinear Geophysics, we argue that this dictum is fundamentally wrong. In addition to the weather and climate, there is a qualitatively distinct intermediate regime extending over a factor of ≈ 1000 in scale.
For example, mean temperature fluctuations increase up to about 5 K at 10 days (the lifetime of planetary structures), then decrease to about 0.2 K at 30 years, and then increase again to about 5 K at glacial-interglacial scales. Both deterministic GCM’s with fixed forcings (“control runs”) and stochastic turbulence-based models reproduce the first two regimes, but not the third. The middle regime is thus a kind of low frequency “macroweather” not “high frequency climate”. Regimes whose fluctuations increase with scale appear unstable whereas regimes where they decrease appear stable. If we average macroweather states over periods ≈ 30 years, the results thus have low variability. In this sense, macroweather is what you expect.
We can use the critical duration of ≈ 30 years to define (fluctuating) “climate states”. As we move to even lower frequencies, these states increasingly fluctuate – appearing unstable so that the climate is not what you expect. The same methodology allows us to categorize climate forcings according to whether their fluctuations decrease or increase with scale and this has important implications for GCM’s and for climate change and climate predictions.
The conclusion reads:
Contrary to [Bryson, 1997], we have argued that the climate is not accurately viewed as the statistics of fundamentally fast weather dynamics that are constrained by quasi fixed boundary conditions. The empirically substantiated picture is rather one of unstable (high frequency) weather processes tending – at scales beyond 10 days or so and primarily due to the quenching of spatial degrees of freedom – to quasi stable (intermediate frequency, low variability) macroweather processes. Climate processes only emerge from macroweather at even lower frequencies, and this thanks to new slow  internal climate processes coupled with external forcings. Their synergy yields fluctuations that on average again grow with scale and become dominant typically on time scales of 10 – 30 years up to ≈ 100 kyrs.
Looked at another way, if the climate really was what you expected, then – since one expects averages – predicting the climate would be a relatively simple matter. On the contrary, we have argued that from the stochastic point of view – and notwithstanding the vastly different time scales – that predicting natural climate change is very much like predicting the weather. This is because the climate at any time or place is the consequence of climate changes that are (qualitatively and quantitatively) unexpected in very much the same way that the weather is unexpected.
Pielke writes:
There are a series of informative comments on this paper by Judy Curry, Philip Richens, Shaun Lovejoy and others on the weblog All Models are Wrong post
Limitless Possibilities
In the insightful comment by Shaun Lovejoy on that weblog, he does write on one issue that I disagree with. Shaun writes
“….deterministic models (GCM’s) reproduce only weather and macroweather statistics (they do this quite well)”.
I agree on weather, but not on macroweather. Macroweather prediction has shown little, if any skill ; e.g. see the papers listed in my post
Kevin Trenberth Was Correct – “We Do Not Have Reliable Or Regional Predictions Of Climate”

Share this...FacebookTwitterA November 11, 2013 press release by Austria’s national weather service, the Zentralanstalt für Meteorologie und Geodynamik (ZAMG), somehow got by me. And not surprisingly it was completely ignored by the German-language mainstream media. It’s titled: “Slower temperature increase: climate models under scrutiny“.
In the introduction the ZAMG writes:
If one compares the temperature development of the last 15 years to the simulations from the new climate model generation, then one sees a substantial deviation between reality and model: the so-called temperature hiatus.”
Air temperature is the preferred parameter that experts use to gauge climate change. On the hiatus the ZAMG writes, “In the last 15 years there has been a clear weakening in the global temperature rise; only 3 of 114 climate model simulations account for it (Figure 1).”

Figure 1: Change in global near-surface temperature relative to the 1986–2005 period from observation data (black) and model simulations (coloured) (IPCC 2013).
As possible causes for the unexpected temperature hiatus, the ZAMG cites: 1) the 11-year solar cycle, 2) volcanic activity, 3) internal climate variability and 4) man-made aerosols. Keep in mind that man-made aerosols have long been dubiously used as the preferred wild card to explain away deviations between models and observations. If there’s a misfit, no problem! Just adjust the aerosol weighting in the model until it there’s a fit! Never mind small details like reality.
Interestingly, the ZAMG also brings up global winter temperature trends and provides the following chart.

Note how the northern hemisphere winters are cooling dramatically. Ed Caryl recently wrote a piece on this and a couple of readers got a bit pissy about the claim wintertime temps are cooling. Well, here’s more proof that they indeed really are cooling. What more do you want?
So why are the models deviating so starkly from reality? The ZAMG writes:
Why the global climate models are by far over-estimating the current temperature development – and thus obviously are not taking the processes behind it correctly – is the topic of discussion and is now the subject of ongoing research. According to the latest expert report, it could be an error in missing or incorrect radiative forcing, or a false reaction by the climate model to external drives. Moreover, some of the climate models are likely reacting too much to the concentrations of greenhouse gases.”
In layman’s terms: The modelers have no clue what’s wrong, and they are not even close to properly modeling the climate. The sheer simplicity of their models, when compared to the enormous complexity of the climate system, is a joke.
The Austrian ZAMG concludes:
The research results of the last year make it ever clearer that natural fluctuations in climate are substantial. The current temperature hiatus shows that the climate system is not understood in its full complexity and that the climate models still are not adequate.”
Really makes you wonder about the scientists who claim to be 95% certain. That 5% uncertainty is looming larger than ever.

"Air pollution has a particularly damaging effect on children. They’re still growing and breathe faster than adults do. They also live closer to the ground, where the most polluting gases from vehicles accumulate. Pollution from traffic has been linked to problems with brain development, stunted growth, respiratory conditions, cancers and 300,000 child deaths worldwide. Children themselves are far from oblivious to all this. The school climate strikes show that young people are forcing air pollution and the climate crisis to the top of the political agenda. The strikes tell us that children demand a platform to challenge pollution in their environment. Unable to voice their concerns in school, they are forced to take radical action. What if instead there was a way to work with children in tackling air pollution and climate change? Through my research, I look for ways that we can give children the tools, the skills and the confidence to affect change in the cities they live in. With the help of teachers and my colleagues in Open Lab – a research group at Newcastle University – we’ve come up with Sense Explorers, a series of lessons to run in primary schools. Newcastle upon Tyne in the UK has a population of just over 260,000. It’s relatively small, but several areas of the city have illegal levels of air pollution. The culprit? Cars, buses and lorries, all emitting harmful concentrations of polluting gases such as nitrogen dioxide in built-up areas.

      Why air pollution in schools is such a big deal – and what to do about it


 The children I talked to care about the environment and wanted to see it change for the better – but they have few means to influence that change. In our lessons, we didn’t simply teach school children about environmental issues – we allowed them to learn for themselves what they can do to improve their local environment. First, we took them to streets in their neighbourhood. With the help of some digital tools, including a basic kit we built ourselves, we collected data about air pollution. In our pilot lessons, we gave them a tool that professionals use called the Fidas Frog, a handheld device that monitors fine dust in the air. But when we found this wasn’t so fun or easy for children, we created the Sensor Pi. Using low-cost sensors connected to a Raspberry Pi computer, they could get a rough air pollution reading at the press of a button.  We didn’t just rely on technology – we asked the children to think about what their own five senses were telling them about the street. Could they see or hear what may be causing pollution? We compiled the data they collected and showed it back to them alongside official data. Adults might not expect children to be able to interpret air pollution data, but when we asked them to explain what might be causing peaks in the graphs, they suggested parents in their idling cars, rush-hour traffic and the fumes from local factories. We then asked: if you were in charge of the city, how would you make the situation better? The children proposed many things, including solar-powered cars, separate bridges for people and vehicles, tunnels to keep traffic underground and even electric travelators to replace roads and cars altogether. Many of their ideas to combat pollution could be implemented right now – slowing vehicles down or removing them from the road, providing electric car charging points, filtering the air and getting more people to walk and cycle. These ideas won’t just linger in a teacher’s drawer or decorate a display wall. We’ve worked with four classes in three different schools, and local politicians came to meet all of them to listen and commit to action on their ideas. Schools are the perfect places to encourage children to become environmental activists. It’s where children learn about the future, what it holds for them, and how they can make it better. We should be showing them what they can – and should – do to make their cities less polluted places. Urban planners and politicians are often hesitant to work with children, but they shouldn’t be – we need to embrace their creativity and passion to take radical action on air pollution and climate change. More now than ever, we need the original ideas that only children can bring. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter. Climate change is inevitable. Our response to it isn’t."

The Thai people have voted. The crony populists decisively defeated the establishment thugs. It probably was the best outcome among imperfect choices.



Thailand has been in various stages of political crisis for years. The only good news is that while Thailand is Southeast Asia’s second‐​largest economy, even the worst political chaos there affects no vital American interest. Long‐​term stability will come only if the country’s ruling elite is willing to cede power to the disaffected and heretofore neglected rural majority.



The Thai monarchy was made famous by _The King and I_ and lost its absolute power seventy‐​nine years ago. In recent years, parliamentary democracy and powerful army have uneasily coexisted: over the years there have been eleven coups, seven attempted coups, twenty‐​three military governments, and nine military‐​dominated regimes. Helping provide political stability was King Bhumibol Adulyadej, a widely revered figure able to call even military rulers to account.





It’s not evident that either side in Thailand’s bitter political conflict is willing to take a long view of their nation’s transformation from old to new.



This system is breaking down, however. The king is eighty‐​three and has been hospitalized since late 2009. The crown prince enjoys little of the respect accorded his father and some Thai citizens have proposed bypassing him for his sister or even jumping to one of his young sons.



Moreover, a decade ago a frustrated rural majority rallied behind billionaire Thaksin Shinawatra to overthrow the country’s cozy political establishment. Thaksin promised to share the wealth, winning elections — and, it was charged, growing wealthier himself — in return. He became prime minister in 2001, only to be ousted in a coup in 2006.



Unfortunately, King Bhumibol has been increasingly unable to intervene even if he was inclined to act. Worse, the courtiers surrounding him and the queen allied themselves with the military and other elites. The judiciary also was firmly in establishment hands, an important factor where political outcomes often are determined by judges.



With Thaksin living in Dubai to avoid prison, the military rewrote the constitution to restrict the power of elected officials — not to protect the people, like the original U.S. Constitution, but to safeguard the ruling coalition of royalists, businessmen, military officers, and bureaucrats. They relied on the misnamed Democrat Party as their political vehicle. However, Thaksin’s successor party won a plurality of seats in the 2007 vote and formed a coalition government.



The courts then disqualified a succession of pro‐​Thaksin parliamentarians, parties, and prime ministers on dubious charges — one of the latter, for instance, was ousted for being paid to host a televised cooking show. In contrast, the DP, which had not won even a plurality of the vote since 1992, received much kindlier treatment when charged with legal violations.



So‐​called “Yellow Shirt” demonstrators took over the prime minister’s office and international airport, demanding the government’s ouster and constitutional changes to disenfranchise the rural majority, and the army refused to restore order. Thailand’s strict lese‐​majeste laws were largely deployed against Thaksin supporters — there were 164 cases in 2009 alone — as establishment forces charged him with planning to downgrade the monarchy. (Even foreigners, including an American blogger and an Australian novelist living in Thailand, have ended up behind bars for mild or indirect criticism of things royal.) Behind the scenes the court and army pressured coalition partners to switch sides, finally turning the government over to the Democrat Party.



As largely urban dwellers, the Yellow Shirts had an obvious advantage in organizing protests. But in 2009 and 2010 Thaksin loyalists, known as Red Shirts, managed to fill Bangkok, first to disrupt an ASEAN summit and later to shut down much of the financial district. The military conveniently decided that this time public demonstrations threatened Thailand’s security and bloodily evicted the protestors. At least 91 people died and more than 1800 were wounded; opposition leaders were prosecuted and imprisoned.



Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva spoke of reconciliation while continuing to demonize the Red Shirts. Thaksin turned to his sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, to carry his banner for the Puea Thai Party in the July 3 election. She promised to increase the minimum wage, hike subsidies for the elderly, expand price supports, initiate tax relief and provide a host of other benefits. The normally more fiscally responsible DP responded accordingly, but populism lite offered little electoral appeal. Army chief Gen. Prayuth Chan‐​ocha staged a televised attack on the Puea Thai Party, but could not staunch the anger of Red Shirt activists.



The result was a decisive victory for 44‐​year‐​old Yingluck. Her party took 265 seats in a 500‐​member parliament, compared to just 159 for the DP. A party formed by the general who staged the 2006 coup won two seats.



Yingluck immediately moved to form a coalition with four smaller parties, giving her government nearly 299 seats. Strengthening her coalition makes it harder for opponents to again use the judiciary to win back political control. The electoral commission said it was investigating election violations which could lead to the disqualification of candidates — and no one expects an objective judgment.



The military promised to respect the election result. Defense Minister Prawit Wongsuwon said: “We are not going to intervene.” But leading officers disclaimed any interest in staging a coup before the last one. Activists opposed to Puea Thai’s victory have promised protests and in a majority of those polled by the Bangkok Post said they expect political violence in the future.



The putative prime minister faces an extraordinary challenge. The members of the frustrated and long‐​marginalized majority who voted for her expect a better future, even though her policies could wreck the government budget, business climate and national economy. Her brother hopes for an amnesty which would allow him to return home, a step which would enrage his opponents.



Dealing with the traditional ruling institutions accustomed to occupying the commanding heights of power likely will be even harder for Yingluck. Pavin Chachavalpongpun of Singapore’s Institute of South East Asian Studies observed: “I think one of her biggest challenges is how to build a working relationship with the elite, particularly the military.” Indeed, Christophe Archambault, who covered Thailand for 17 years for Reuters, warned that her tenure could be short: “The establishment is likely to resort again to Yellow Shirt mob violence, a judicial intervention, or even another coup to unseat her. That will tear Thailand further apart.”



There is much scuttlebutt about the potential of striking a deal or even having struck a deal before the election to protect the military from prosecution for the 2006 coup and last year’s crackdown on the Red Shirts in return for accepting a Yingluck government. One can imagine the appeal to the Thaksin forces of such an arrangement.



But the incoming prime minister’s ultimate objective should be to strip establishment institutions of their ability to effectively invalidate elections when they don’t like the results. One young voter declared: “It’s been a so‐​called democracy, not a real democracy. This time I’d like the majority to decide the winner. I really want democracy to decide the outcome.”



Of course, confronting thuggish elites requires a firm government hand, strong political base, and steely personal nerves. A similar process took years in Turkey, in which the so‐​called Deep State dominated by the military and other elites used the courts and laws protecting the image of Turkey founder Kemal Attaturk to maintain their influence irrespective of election results. A Thai government that demonstrates economic success would be far better positioned to undertake far‐​reaching political reforms.



There’s not much Washington, which urged the outgoing government to respect the election result, or anyone else can do other than counsel caution, patience, reconciliation and compromise. Thitinan Pongsudhirak of the Institute of Security and International Studies observed: “We must take the long view. This is not a two‐​year or a three‐​year exercise. We are talking about two or three decades of political maturation to come. It will be many years before we can reconcile the old order and the new order.”



It’s not evident that either side in Thailand’s bitter political conflict is willing to take a long view of their nation’s transformation from old to new. If not, the Thai people will need all the good wishes they can get to manage the future.

Guest Post by David Middleton
I ran across a really funny story on Real Clear Energy last Friday…
Once you get past all of the nonsense about fracking polluting groundwater and global warming hysteria, the article really gets “interesting.”

Ten Reasons Why Fracking is isn’t Doomed
1. Scientists have found that solar photovoltaic cells could be producing electricity at less 50 cents a watt by 2016, four years earlier than other projections.
The source of reason #1 is this blog post…
Brave new world as solar PV heads to 50c/watt
By Giles Parkinson on 20 July 2012
US Energy Secretary Stephen Chu earlier this year suggested that solar PV without subsidies will be cheaper than both coal and gas if it could get its costs down to around $1/watt by the end of the decade – an event that would trigger a total re-examination of the way electricity was produced in the world’s largest economy.
[…]
The report includes a few notable graphs. The first is the cost path for module – now estimated at around 75c/W and heading down to 50c/W at a rate of knots. GTM, and most others in the industry, believe it will get to the 50c/W mark by 2016 at the latest, most likely 2015

[…]
http://reneweconomy.com.au/2012/brav…-50cwatt-29404
The chart implies that solar PV power plants currently cost ~$1.45/W and will soon fall to ~$0.50/W. However, the chart only covers the CapEx for the solar modules. Even if the module costs are accurate, the CapEx for solar PV power plants currently ranges from $6-7/W ($6-7 million per MW), costing 6-7 times as much as and requiring 8 times as much land area per MW as a natural gas-fired plant.

Even if you factor in fuel,solar PV is still projected to cost 3 times as much per kWh as gas-fired electricity (combined cycle).

Even if the module costs did drop from $1.45 to $0.50 per Watt, that would only lower the full cost from $6-7 million per MW to $5-6 million per MW. Land isn’t free and construction isn’t done by volunteers.
2. Germany is on the verge of producing more solar energy than wind energy, the first major industrialized country to reach that milestone. Germany wants to produce 35 percent of its electricity from renewables by 2020, only 8 years from now.
I didn’t think the second reason could be dumber than the first reason. I was wrong…


3. Researchers at UCLA have created a solar-power-generating window. If all those glass box skyscrapers in southern California could be put to work generating electricity, it would probably power the whole state.
Words escape me… Even if mythical solar windows could power the entire State…
How much would it cost per MW of installed capacity?
How would California keep the lights on when “the Sun don’t shine”?
4. The British government has given the go-ahead for two huge offshore wind farms off the coast of Norfolk (the eastern coast). Together, they will have the capacity to produce over a gigawatt of power (roughly one nuclear power plant’s worth). Britain is the leader in offshore wind energy generation.
“Over a gigawatt of power”! That’s just 1,000 MW and, as can be seen in the previously posted levelized generation cost chart, offshore wind is even more expensive than solar PV.
5. With Japan’s nuclear energy plants being phased out because of public fury over the Fukushima disaster, the country is trying to move quickly to renewables. It is placing a big bet on offshore floating wind platforms.
Maybe I’m missing something here… But I don’t see how Japan’s lack of cheap energy sources dooms fracking.
6. Scientists have concluded that it is perfectly practical to provide 2/3s of US electricity from solar over the next decades. The main problem is not electricity generation or having enough land to put the cells on, it is the poor electrical grid of the US, which will have to be redone.
Reason number 6 seems to be that there is enough surface area on the planet for solar PV (I wonder if there’s enough Windex on the planet). Good to know that there’s enough space. Since natural gas-fired plants take up 1/8 as much space per MW, “space” isn’t likely to doom fracking before it dooms solar PV.
7. Algeria wants to go solar, aiming for 650 megawatts of solar energy by 2015 and a massive 22 gigawatts by 2030. The Desertec Foundation has big projects in Egypt and Morocco, and Algeria, an oil producer, has decided to join in.
It’s been a bit more than a year since I ran the numbers on Desertec; but I doubt they’ve improved. The ultimate goal is 100 GW installed capacity (100,000 MW) at an estimated total cost of $550 billion (~$5.5 million per MW)… Only about 6 times as expensive as coal and natural gas and 2-3 times as expensive as nuclear and wind.
1 TW (Terrawatt) = 1 billion kW (Kilowatts)
At 15 cents per kWh, Desertec will generate an annual gross revenue of $105 billion if it really delivers 700 TWh per year. That’s enough to cover the construction cost principle (pay out) in 35-46 years (30-40 years to build and 5-6 years of operation).
If Desertec really had to compete with nuclear, natural gas and coal, it could only charge 3 to 7 cents per kWh. This would push “pay out” up to about 70 years.
In either case, it’s still an example of multinational mental deficiency.
On top of all of that. These solar arrays would be built across North Africa and the Middle East. I always thought one of selling points for solar was that it would make us less energy-dependent on regions like North Africa and the Middle East… 
8. Some 750,000 Australian homes have solar panels on the roof, heading toward 10% of the 8 million households in the sun-drenched country.
Not likely to doom fracking in the USA… We’re a bit less sun-drenched than Oz. And I doubt it will doom fracking in Oz either….
Australian LNG Exports to Triple
11 July 2012
National exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) could more than triple to 63 million tonnes per annum by 2016-17 as Australia plays a greater role in satisfying global energy demand.
This is the forecast of the inaugural Bureau of Resources and Energy Economics (BREE) Gas Market Report released today by Minister for Resources and Energy, Martin Ferguson AM MP.
[…]
http://minister.ret.gov.au/mediacent…rtstriple.aspx
9. China is going to make a major push for solar energy after 2015, aiming for a mind-bogging (Sic) 50 gigawatts worth by 2020.
I think the author may have meant “mind-boggling,” However, the author’s mind clearly is “bogged.” 50 GW would be less than 5% of China’s generation capacity.
China leads the world in the manufacturing and sales of solar PV cells, but they are in no hurry to build out solar PV infrastructure for themselves…

They manufacture solar cells to sell them to Germany.
China’s push to build 50 GW of solar PV won’t even doom fracking in China, much less in the USA…
July 4, 2012,
Can China Follow U.S. Shift from Coal to Gas?
By ANDREW C. REVKIN
[…]
Second, several years ago, I heard that teams of Chinese engineers were spending months in Oklahoma to learn about hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, as a method for liberating gas and oil from previously untappable shale deposits. More recently, reports showed that China — which was once considered gas poor — now has estimated volumes greater than those of the United States (which are, as you know, enormous). This week China signaled that it may indeed be gearing up for an ambitious gas push. An article in China Daily, “Will China embrace a shale gas boom?,” essentially answers its headline question with a resounding yes.
[…]
http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/20…m-coal-to-gas/
Reason number 10: Blame Israel…
10. The Egyptian gas pipeline through the Sinai to Jordan and Israel has been blown up 15 times since the Jan. 25 revolution. Egyptians are angry that the government of deposed dictator Hosni Mubarak had sold the gas at substantially below-market prices to Israel. Because of the interruptions, Jordan’s government is more eager than ever to move to solar and wind power. A sign of increased international interest in the nascent Jordanian renewables sector is that a Chinese company wants to invest $200 million in a solar project. Jordan has a goal of getting 10% of its electricity from renewables by 2020, though that may be an ambitious timeline. If its government were smart, it would go all out and double that goal, and try to meet it.
I have no doubt that China is eager to sell solar cells to another gullible customer… In the meantime Israel is open for business to natural gas drilling…

Noble Energy has been operating in the Mediterranean Sea, offshore Israel, since 1998. Our 47 percent interest in the Mari-B field, the first offshore natural gas production facility in Israel, is one of our core international assets. Production from Mari-B began in 2004 and sales volumes have increased as Israel’s natural gas infrastructure has developed. Additional pipeline construction and power plant conversion is contributing to the growing natural gas demand in Israel. Significant new exploration discoveries at Tamar and Dalit will help meet Israel’s energy needs and drive new uses for natural gas in the future.
In early 2010, the Company commenced drilling two additional development wells at Mari-B. Combined with additional compression work, these new wells will support near-term gas deliverability and serve as injection wells for storage in the future.
We have a 36 percent operated working interest at Tamar, with gross mean resources of 8.4 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of natural gas. Tamar was the largest natural gas discovery in the world in 2009 and represents Noble Energy’s largest-ever exploration find. Initial expectations target first production from Tamar in 2012. Contracting for the sale of natural gas from Tamar is underway, and the Company has negotiated a number of multi-year letters of intent to deliver energy supply to customers. Project sanction at Tamar is expected in 2010.
In late 2009, we acquired additional 3D seismic over approximately 1,600 square miles in the region where we have identified a number of new prospects and leads on our significant acreage position offshore Israel and Cyprus. Based on the results of the seismic program, the Company has identified gross unrisked resource potential greater than 30 Tcf. Along with our partners, we are planning to spud Leviathan, a 16 Tcf gross prospect, in the fourth quarter 2010.

"Japan recently left the International Whaling Commission (IWC) and has now caught the first whale in its waters since resuming commercial whaling, 33 years after a global ban came into effect. As a non-member, Japan is no longer bound by the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (ICRW) – the rules that the IWC has used to manage whaling since 1946. The IWC’s moratorium on commercial whaling has broadly been a success – whale populations have increased where whaling was the primary threat. The humpback whale is one example of successful recovery, but species such as the northern right whale have never recovered from centuries of whaling and are in critically low numbers. Outrage and despair greeted Japan’s decision to relaunch commercial whaling in its waters, although the conservation status of many species may be unaffected. Still, Japan’s exit from the IWC is a worrying message to the international community at a time when collaboration on environmental issues is sorely needed. Japan introduced a proposal at the IWC in 2018 which would allow it to restart commercial whaling. This was voted down – the proposal that was approved in its place supported a shift in the commission’s goal towards banning all commercial whaling in perpetuity.  A permanent commercial whaling ban might sound like an ordinary step, but the IWC’s purpose since 1946 has been “the orderly development of the whaling industry”. The IWC has gradually pivoted to focus more on conservation and other threats to whales since then, but one of its founding goals was to support the whaling industry and the people it employed. As the whaling industry has declined and attitudes towards whales have changed around the world, the IWC has changed too. Japan meanwhile has always been clear it wants to resume commercial whaling and is leaving the IWC because the moratorium was only meant to be temporary and lifted when whale populations could support whaling. Japan isn’t the first country to leave the IWC because of frustration with its rules on commercial whaling. Iceland left in 1992 and rejoined in 2002 as a full member but with a reservation to the moratorium that allows it to commercially whale. Norway objected to the moratorium decision in 1982 and so kept its right to commercially whale while remaining a full IWC member.  For most whale species, the exit of Japan from the convention banning commercial whaling will have few consequences. Whale populations in the Southern Ocean are even likely to benefit as Japan will lose its special research permit for scientific whaling in the region by leaving the IWC. Japan mostly took Antarctic minke whales (Balaenoptera bonaerensis) here, but this species is not considered endangered. It’s a different story for whales found within Japan’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). No longer bound by the IWC’s rules, Japan can harvest whales here under the right given by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea but the number and species it will decide to take hasn’t been announced. One vulnerable population living in Japan’s EEZ which may be affected are common minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), which are genetically distinct and possibly number fewer than 5,500. It’s worrying this population hasn’t shown the same robust recovery seen among other minke whales.  Japan will want to prove to the world it can whale sustainably but the long-term future of whaling is uncertain. The market for whale meat in Japan peaked after World War II and is now a shadow of its former self. Although still eaten in cultural ceremonies and a few localities in northern Honshu, consumption is around 40g per capita each year - about the size of a slice of ham. Whether Japan’s diminished appetite for whale meat will reduce its whaling efforts though remains to be seen. Research by the IWC scientific committee has greatly advanced our understanding of whale ecology and how to address other threats to their survival, like pollution, bycatch and climate change. Japan’s exit from the IWC doesn’t threaten the organisation’s activities and every effort should be made to continue this important research. But if the “International Whaling Commission” is to become a conservation organisation, then maybe its status as a whaling commission is outdated.  Countries could continue to work together on whale conservation by using the Convention on Migratory Species. This specifically targets the conservation of migratory species and their habitats, and would apply to protecting whales. In fact, there is already a regional agreement between countries that’s focused on whale conservation. Agreements made under this convention might be better able to deal with the diverse threats facing whales. A whale research programme focused on conservation – as opposed to a whaling research programme – made up of the IWC scientific committee and Japan might have fewer conflicts as their objective would be clearer. Japan’s exit from the IWC is a complicated issue beyond just whale conservation – it highlights the need for the international community to overcome disagreements. Asking why the IWC has succeeded and failed at different times can help us improve the way we work together on global challenges as after all, whaling is only one example of the many urgent and complex environmental issues that demand a global response. How well we work together determines more than just the fate of the world’s whales."

In case you missed it, on Sunday Dr. Roger Pielke Sr.wrote a statement of support for Watts et al 2012. See: Comments On The Game Changer New Paper “An Area And Distance Weighted Analysis Of The Impacts Of Station Exposure On The U.S. Historical Climatology Network Temperatures And Temperature Trends” By Watts Et Al 2012
Today he has written another essay, showing that Watts et al 2012 and another recent paper, McNider et al 2012 have shown
“…evidence of major systematic warm biases in the analysis of multi-decadal land surface temperature anomalies by NCDC, GISS, CRU and BEST.”
The Summary: 

One paper [Watts et al 2012] show that siting quality does matter. A warm bias results in the continental USA when poorly sited locations are used to construct a gridded analysis of land surface temperature anomalies.
The other paper [McNider et al 2012] (pdf here) shows that not only does the height at which minimum temperature observations are made matter, but even slight changes in vertical mixing (such as from adding a small shed near the observation site, even in an otherwise pristine location) can increase the measured temperature at the height of the observation. This can occur when there is little or no layer averaged warming.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI got an e-mail from an NTZ reader who brought a recent post at Skeptical Science to my attention. Normally I don’t read reality-denial, end-of-world theorist sites. But in this case I had to make an exception. In general, for once, it’s even worth reading.

Climate Bet for Charity, 2013 Update
Posted on 27 November 2013 by Rob Honeycutt
A couple of years ago I happened upon a German “climate contrarian” website called NoTricksZone run by Pierre Gosselin.  While reading through one particular post I made an off-hand comment that I’d never found a skeptic who would put their money where their mouth is related to climate.
Well, Pierre took that as a challenge and we got together to create a gentleman’s climate bet with proceeds going to a charity of the winner’s choice.  (Correction: As Tom points out in the commens the terms state, “…the charity organisation is yet to be chosen, but will (1) be one that both sides agree on, (2) help children in dire need (3) have low overhead and (4) be international.”) That was back in early 2011.  It became the Climate Bet for Charity, subtext: “Will  the next 2011-2020 decade be warmer than the previous 2001 – 2010 decade?”
Continue reading here.
Couple of notes. Rob Honeycutt writes:
I pulled up the UAH and RSS lower tropospheric anomalies through WoodForTrees.org and did the calculations myself.  Sure enough, the average of UAH and RSS for the 2001-2010 decade comes out at 0.226C.  The current 2011-present decade is running at 0.173C.  That’s 0.053C below the last decade, based on, yes, three years of data.  So, they actually do have this much correct.”
And even if the current decade ended up being slightly warmer, it would still mean CO2 sensitivity is seriously exaggerated.
Next Rob blames the start-point (which he agreed with from the beginning) for being one of the reasons they are behind in the bet. He also writes:
In fact, since we’re averaging so few data points in the early phase of the of the chart, it’s going to be mostly just noise.  It doesn’t tell us anything meaningful at all.

I suppose if the data for the current decade were running warmer, you would not be hearing any “just noise” talk from Rob.
Rob then tries a few other statistical games before ultimately concluding that, under the bottom line, temperatures haven’t been rising like they were expected to.
Next Rob gives his opinion on who he feels is doing the better job measuring global temperature:
 I’m now of the personal opinion that GISS is likely the most accurate data set being that it has the greatest coverage for the Arctic, where we’re seeing the greatest warming.”
Arctic measurement has serious issues, as ED Caryl has just written at NTZ. I get the feeling he wishes he regrets agreeing to using RSS and UAH data to settle the bet. In the end, he does maintain a positive attitude, doing his best to exude confidence:
My own best guess is, barring a major low latitude volcanic event before 2020, there is a >95% chance that this decade will end up being warmer than the last. Physics is on our side.  You just can’t add 2.3Watts/m2 of man-made radiative forcing (source) to the climate system and believe the planet is not going to warm.
Strangely those theoretical 2.3 W/sqm and his brand of physics mysteriously have not produced any warming in 15 years….except, that is, “somewhere” in the depths of the oceans.
Finally, to support his theories of global warming physics, Rob writes:
Note that the decade of 1991-2000 was 0.139C warmer than 1981-1990, and the decade of 2001-2010 was 0.204C warmer than 1991-2000.”
Suddenly Rob completely forgets about the oceans. 🙂

For those celebrating Brexit as a way to push for freer markets, be aware that there is going to be a fight over this. This is from a _Financial Times_ piece arguing that the UK must ensure that its agriculture industry continues to receive subsidies:   




Some free market thinkers believe Britain’s departure from the CAP [the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy] is a golden opportunity to scale back — and even end — agricultural subsidies altogether. They believe the CAP has been hugely distortive because farmers are granted funds according to how much they produce. British farming businesses have therefore been unwilling to innovate, leaving agricultural productivity in the UK lagging well behind that of the US, for example.   
  
  
Proponents of deep cuts in subsidy also believe they are a _sine qua non_ if Britain is to forge new trade deals with non‐​EU states. The EU is so heavily committed to agricultural protectionism — imposing tariff barriers on outsiders while subsidising its own farmers — that its ability to sign trade agreements with developing nations has long been restricted. If the UK adopts a different approach, opening up its markets to food exports from, say, Commonwealth nations, it could gain significant new access for UK companies looking to sell services.   
  
  
Politicians should tread carefully, however. It is in Britain’s interest to maintain a strong farming industry at home and no government should take risks on food security. Farming is an uncertain profession and one that is increasingly exposed to the challenges posed by climate change. That is why most developed countries, whether inside the EU or not, maintain public funding for farming communities.   
  
  
The right course for Britain is to replace the CAP with a smarter and more innovative system of public support. Instead of subsiding food production, the UK should look to adopt a system of highly specific direct transfers. Future UK governments should, for example, put far more emphasis on paying farmers to tackle specific environmental problems; or to boost training and skills in the workplace; or to invest in research and development projects that boost productivity.



It’s amazing how much effort goes into finding new and “innovative” ways for governments to take taxpayer money and give it to the agriculture industry. No doubt there are better and worse ways to provide that money, and the EU Common Agricultural Policy could be improved, but Brexit offers an opportunity to go beyond the incremental changes suggested above for farm subsidies. That’s why the next few months and years are such an important time for the future of UK policy: There’s a chance to move strongly in the direction of free markets, in agriculture and other sectors. But this article makes clear that there will be people pushing back, and making questionable arguments about “food security,” so it’s important to engage now, while policies are still being decided.

"**JD Sports has pulled out of talks over a rescue deal for department store chain Debenhams.**
It was the last remaining bidder for the firm, which is in administration, and up until the end of last week had been closing in on a deal.
But retail giant Arcadia is the biggest concession operator in Debenhams and its collapse is understood to have been a factor in JD Sports' decision.
Without a buyer, Debenhams could be wound down, risking thousands of jobs.
The company had already cut about 6,500 jobs since May, and now has 12,000 workers.
The 242-year-old retailer had been considering a potential sale since the summer after it went into administration in April for the second time in a year.
The news that Arcadia has collapsed into administration, after the Covid-19 pandemic hit trading, has further complicated matters.
The downfall of the Arcadia group puts 13,000 jobs at risk. The group, which runs 444 stores in the UK and 22 overseas, currently has 9,294 employees on furlough.
Arcadia's brands, such as Miss Selfridge and Dorothy Perkins, are sold across Debenhams stores. They account for about Â£75m of sales.
Former Debenhams chairman Sir Ian Cheshire told the BBC he felt ""desperately sorry"" for the thousands of employees who were worried about their jobs.
He said that Debenhams had been ""caught in a straitjacket"" with too many High Street outlets on long leases.
""You've got to be so much faster and so much more online,"" he said, adding that the chain would have been better off with about 70 stores instead of the 130 it currently operates.
Shareholders in JD Sports had reacted badly to the news of the potential purchase of Debenhams, with the sports retailer seeing a sharp fall in its share price last week.
That rebounded on Monday after weekend reports claiming that it was reconsidering its move.
JD Sports was widely seen as the last chance to save the beleaguered British chain.
But in a short statement issued on Tuesday, JD Sports said that ""discussions with the administrators of Debenhams regarding a potential acquisition of the UK business have now been terminated"".
If a buyer is not found for Debenhams, the firm could go into liquidation, or face being wound down. During that process, buyers would be sought for its shops and the business's other assets, like stock.
Hilco Capital, a firm that specialises in winding up struggling retailers, was appointed by Debenhams in August to draw up contingency plans.
Debenhams said at the time that it was ""trading strongly"", despite having issued a string of profit warnings even before the pandemic hit.
In recent years several big High Street names have struggled including Thomas Cook, Mothercare and Bonmarche as retailers try to adapt to the rise of online shopping and changing consumer habits.

One of the most memorable characters in Michael Crichton’s climate-thriller _State of Fear_ is the pompous, egotistical actor-activist Ted Bradley. Bradley, who serves as both the avatar of Hollywood’s ignorant self-importance and as a foil for the book’s skeptic-heroes, comes to a hilariously bad end. As the crew are held captive by cannibals in New Guinea, Bradley insists that their peaceful village life is the acme of human contentment. He keeps insisting it, right up till the moment they club him over the head and butcher him.



But Ted Bradley’s fictional ignorance is as nothing compared to the dangerously blind foolishness of Western Pollyannas who insist that the world’s shitholes are just, like, misunderstood. Then come a cropper when they travel there to prove it.



Two Australians detained in a notorious Tehran prison have been identified as travel bloggers from Perth who were reportedly arrested for flying a drone without a licence.



Jolie King and Mark Firkin have been globetrotting since June 2017, and documenting their travels on Instagram and Youtube.



They started their blog to “inspire anyone wanting to travel, and also try to break the stigma around travelling to countries which get a bad rap in the media”.



At least they’ve got off lightly, compared to poor [Pippa Bracca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pippa_Bacca). The Italian feminist and artist set off to hitch-hike through the Middle East in a wedding dress, “to give a message of peace and of trust”. Her naked, strangled and decomposing body was later found hidden in bushes near Istanbul.



Ms King was told by the Iranian authorities that she was being detained in hope of a prisoner swap, a source told The Times…Most recently the couple had posted videos of themselves driving the Karakoram Highway in Pakistan.



…“We’ll be blogging the whole trip on YouTube, documenting through pics and blogs on here, Facey and our website,” they wrote on an Instagram post in April.



Will they be posting Instagram pics of the prison food, a breathless world wonders? How many stars will their Yelp review give Iran’s secret police?



A female academic who holds Australian and British citizenship is also being detained and has ­reportedly been sentenced to 10 years in prison for an unspecified offence.



Another woman, dual Australian-Iranian citizen and Melbourne University demographer Meimanat Hosseini-Chavoshi, was arrested in Iran in December, charged with trying to “infiltrate” Iranian institutions.



Gosh, it’s almost like these idiot bloggers should have known that Iran gets a “bad rap” for a reason.



The Australian government even has a whole website for this stuff:



Reconsider your need to travel to Iran due to the risk that foreigners, including Australians, could be arbitrarily detained or arrested. Dual nationals are also at risk. We can’t guarantee access to consular services or legal representation if you’re detained or arrested.

"**Boris Johnson has agreed to publish the health, economic and social data behind England's new tier system later, as he seeks to avert a Commons rebellion.**
MPs will vote on the measures on Tuesday, and numerous Conservative MPs have demanded to see the evidence government is basing its new system on.
Writing to a group of around 70 MPs - who are sceptical of the new rules - Mr Johnson called for ""unity and resolve"".
Labour is expected to support the PM, but is yet to confirm its stance.
If Labour does decide to get behind the new tier system, the government should easily win the vote - even if there is a sizeable revolt among Conservative MPs.
The information is expected to include data first published by the Office for Budget Responsibility last week.
England's new system - due to replace the national lockdown when it expires on Wednesday - will see regions placed in one of three tiers: medium, high and very high.
Nearly all of England will be in the highest two tiers, with tight restrictions on bars and restaurants and a ban on households mixing indoors. Only Cornwall, the Isle of Wight and Isles of Scilly will be in the lowest tier.
The PM's letter to Tories from the Covid Recovery Group is his second letter to colleagues over the weekend, as he seeks to reassure them about the measures.
In an earlier letter to all MPs and peers, the prime minister said the rules in some areas could be eased in December, MPs could vote again on the measures in January, and the tier system could end on 3 February.
But some Conservative MPs have complained their constituencies are entering one of the tougher tiers, despite cases in their areas falling, and asked to see the data behind the measures.
The contents of one document could determine the size of Tuesday's Conservative revolt.
The government has conceded a key demand of the rebels - to produce an assessment of the economic and social impact of the restrictions.
Put very crudely, MPs want to know if the lives these tiers will save will outweigh livelihoods that will be lost.
Privately, some other potential rebels are indicating they are prepared to be convinced by the government's arguments.
And Mr Johnson's efforts to win over his sceptics seem to be making some headway.
The former minister Conor Burns - an old ally of Mr Johnson's - had been critical of how the government intended to impose its restrictions.
But he told the Westminster Hour he won't be voting against them, saying: ""We've got the vaccine coming over the horizon. If the government really feels we need to do this then I'm probably prepared to swallow hard and support them.""
But some other potential rebels have told the BBC that they are withholding their support unless and until they see the hard data behind the PM's decisions.
In his letter to the Covid Recovery Group, Mr Johnson said he'd ""responded positively"" to their ""constructive proposals"". The next 24 hours will see him continue the campaign of persuasion with his own backbenchers.
Conservative MP Mark Harper, chairman of the Covid Recovery Group, said he was ""particularly concerned about some of the non-Covid health implications these restrictions have been having"".
And he urged the government to publish details of what extra support would be made available, as well as a cost-benefit analysis of the new tier system before Tuesday's vote.
Conservative West Midlands Mayor Andy Street has asked Chancellor Rishi Sunak to increase the grants given to businesses. He said the hospitality sector in his region is ""facing crisis"".
Speaking during a visit to a pharmaceutical manufacturers in Wales, Mr Johnson said he understood people's ""frustrations"" particularly those in the hospitality sector.
He said the best thing for the industry would be to ""keep the virus under control, use mass testing, roll that out in ever greater numbers, plus the vaccine if, as I hope, we can start to distribute them.""
In his letter to MPs, the PM also said the government would:
Speaking to the BBC, Environment Secretary George Eustice acknowledged a large number of Conservative MPs were ""unsettled"" and said the prime minister would be ""working very hard"" to reassure those MPs that he doesn't want to ""maintain the measures for a moment longer than is necessary"".
He added he would be surprised if Labour voted against the steps, adding ""it is not the moment for any party to play politics.""
Speaking at a virtual town hall with residents from Lancaster and Morecambe, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said there was a ""need for restrictions"" and that the Labour Party ""has to act in the national interest"".
He expressed concerned that the government ""doesn't have the support package right"" and said people in the North West ""are tearing their hair out saying ""we've been in restrictions for months and need better support.'""
Sir Keir and other members of the shadow cabinet are due to meet England's chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty and the government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance later, as they decide whether to vote with the government.
However, one Labour MP, Richard Burgon, has already said he will vote against the tier system, arguing that it will fail to lower the infection rate and make another lockdown more likely.
Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey described the system as ""chaotic"" and said his party would not back the measures until the prime minister addressed their concerns.
The party is urging the government to release the evidence underpinning the new system; commit to involving local authorities; and offer urgent support to pubs.
Meanwhile, a major study from Imperial College London has found that coronavirus infections in England fell by about a third over lockdown.
Some of the worst-hit areas saw the biggest improvements, but cases still remained high across England.
Researchers estimated that the virus's reproduction (R) rate had fallen to 0.88, meaning the epidemic is shrinking.
Elsewhere in the UK, Northern Ireland has begun a two-week circuit-breaker lockdown, while in Scotland each area has been placed in one of five tiers.
In Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford announced new rules to tackle a rise in coronavirus cases which will come into force from 18:00 GMT on Friday.
On Sunday, a further 12,155 positive coronavirus test results were recorded across the UK, bringing the total to 1,617,327.
A further 215 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also recorded, bringing the total to 58,245."

Abstract
The traditional estimate of temperature at measuring stations has been to average the highest (Tmax) and lowest (Tmin) daily measurements. This leads to error in estimating the true mean temperature. What is the magnitude of this error and how does it depend on geographic and climatic variables? The US Climate Reference Network (USCRN) of temperature measuring stations is employed to estimate the error for each station in the network. The 10th-90th percentile range of the errors extends from -0.5 to +0.5 C. Latitude and relative humidity (RH) are found to exert the largest influences on the error, explaining about 28% of the variance. A majority of stations have a consistent under- or over-estimate during all four seasons. The station behavior is also consistent across the years.
Introduction 
Historically, temperature measurements used to estimate climate change have depended on thermometers that record the maximum and minimum temperatures over a day. The average of these two measurements, which we will call Tminmax, has been used to estimate a mean daily temperature. However, this simple approach will have some error in estimating the true mean (Tmean) temperature. What is the magnitude of this error? How does it vary by season, elevation, latitude or longitude, and other parameters? For a given station, is it random or consistently biased in one direction?

Multiple studies have considered this question. Many of these are found in food and agriculture journals, since a correct mean temperature is crucial for predicting ripening of crops. For example, Ma and Guttorp (2012) report that Swedish researchers have been using a linear combination of five measurements (daily minimum, daily maximum, and measurements taken at 6, 12, and 18 hours UTC) since 1916 (Ekholm 1916) although revised later (Moden, 1939; Nordli et al, 1996). Tuomenvirta (2000) calculated the historical variation (1890-1995) of Tmean – Tminmax differences for three groups of Scandinavian and northern stations. For the continental stations (Finland, Iceland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark) average differences across all stations were small (+0.1 to +0.2 oC) beginning in 1890 and dropping close to 0 from about 1930 on. However, for two groups of mainly coastal stations in the Norwegian islands and West Greenland, they found strongly negative differences (-0.6 oC) in 1890, falling close to zero from 1965 on. Other studies have considered different ways to determine Tmean from Tmin, Tmax and ancillary measurements (Weiss and Hays, 2005; Reoicovsky et al., 1989; McMaster et al., 1983; Misra et al., 2012). Still other studies have considered Tmin and Tmax in global climate models (GCMs) (Thrasher et al, 2012; Lobell et al., 2007).
This short note examines these questions using the US Climate Reference Network (USCRN), a network of high-quality temperature measurement stations operated by NOAA and begun around 2000 with a single station, reaching a total of about 114 stations in the continental US (44 states) by 2008. There are also 4 stations in Alaska, 2 in Hawaii, and one in Canada meeting the USCRN criteria. Four more stations in Alaska have been established, bringing the total to 125 stations, but have only 2-3 years of data at this writing. A regional (USRCRN) network of 17 stations has also been established in Alabama and has about 4 years of data. All these 142 stations were used in the following analysis, although at times the 121- or 125-station dataset was used. The stations are located in fairly pristine areas meeting all criteria for weather stations. Temperature measurements are taken in triplicate, and other measures at all stations include precipitation and solar radiance. Measurements of relative humidity (RH) were instituted in 2007 at two stations and by about 2009 were being collected at the 125 sites in the USCRN network but not at the Alabama (USRCRN) network. A database of all measurements is publically available at ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/uscrn/products/. The database includes hourly, daily, and monthly results. This database, together with single compilations of multiple files kindly supplied by NOAA, was used for the following analysis.
Methods
The monthly data for the 142 stations were downloaded one station at a time and joined together in a single database. (Note: at present, the monthly data are only available to the public as separate files for each station. Daily data are available as separate files for each year for each station. This requires 142 separate downloads for the monthly data, and about 500 or so downloads for the daily data. Fortunately, a NOAA database manager was able to provide the daily data as a single file of about 373,000 records.)
The hourly data include the maximum and minimum 5-minute average temperatures recorded each hour as well as the mean temperature averaged over the hour. The daily data include the highest 5-minute maximum and the lowest 5-minute minimum temperatures recorded in the hourly data that day (i.e. Tmax and Tmin) together with the mean daily temperature (Tmean). The average of Tmax and Tmin ({Tmax+Tmin}/2) is also included for comparison with the true mean. The monthly data includes the maximum and minimum temperatures for the month; these are averages of the observed highest 5-minute average maximum and minimum daily temperatures. There is also an estimate of the true mean monthly temperature and the monthly average temperature using the monthly Tmax and Tmin. The difference between the daily Tminmax and the true mean will be referred to as Delta T:
DeltaT = (Tmin+Tmax)/2 – Truemean
Data were analyzed using Excel 2010 and Statistica v11. For each station, the entire length of the station’s history was used; the number of months ranged from 47 to 132. Since the relationship between the true mean and Tminmax may vary over time, these were compared by season, where Winter corresponds to January through March and so on. The diurnal temperature range (DTR) was calculated for each day as Tmax-Tmin. For the two stations with the highest and lowest overall error, the hourly data were downloaded to investigate the diurnal pattern.
Results
As of Aug 11, 2012 there were 12,305 station-months and 373,975 station-days from 142 stations. The metadata for all stations are available at the Website http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/crn/docs.html.
Delta T averaged over all daily measurements for each station ranged from -0.66 oC (Lewistowne, MT) to +1.38 oC (Fallbrook, CA, near San Diego). (Figure 1). A negative sign means the minmax approach underestimated the true mean. Just about as many stations overestimated (58) as underestimated (63) the true mean.

Figure 1. DeltaT for 121 USCRN stations: 2000-August 5, 2012. Error bars are standard errors.
A histogram of these results is provided (Figure 2). The mean was 0.0 with an interquartile range of -0.2 to +0.2 oC. The 10-90 percentile range was from -0.5 to + 0.5 oC.

Figure 2. Histogram of Delta T for 121 USCRN stations.
Seasonal variability was surprisingly low: in more than half of the 121 stations with at least 47 months of complete data, the Tminmax either underestimated (28 sites) or overestimated (39 sites) the true mean in all 4 seasons. Most of the remaining stations were also weighted in one direction or another; only 20 stations (16.5%) were evenly balanced at 2 seasons in each direction. 16 of these 20 were negative in winter and spring, positive in summer and fall. Over all 121 stations, there was a slight tendency for underestimates to be favored in winter and spring, with overestimates in summer and fall (Figure 3).

Figure 3. Variation of Delta T by season.
Since Delta T was determined by averaging all values over all years for each station, the possibility remains that stations may have varied across the years. This was tested by comparing the average Delta T for each station across the years 2008-9 against the average in 2010-11. The result showed that the stations were very stable across the years, with a Spearman correlation of 0.974 (Figure 4).

Figure 4. Comparison of Delta T for each station across consecutive 2-year periods. N = 140 stations.
When Delta T is mapped, some quite clear patterns emerge (Figure 5). Overestimates (blue dots) are strongly clustered in the South and along the entire Pacific Coast from Sitka, Alaska to San Diego, also including Hawaii. Underestimates (red dots) are located along the extreme northern tier of states from Maine to Washington (excepting the two Washington stations west of the Cascades) and all noncoastal stations west of Colorado’s eastern border.

Figure 5. DeltaT at 121 USCRN stations. Colors are quartiles. Red: -0.66 to -0.17 C. Gold: -0.17 to 0 C. Green: 0 to +0.25 C. Blue: +0.25 to +1.39 C.
Figure 5 suggests that the error has a latitude gradient, decreasing from positive to negative as one goes North. Indeed a regression shows a highly significant (p<0.000002) negative coefficient of –0.018 oC per degree of latitude (Table 1, Figure 6). However, other variables clearly affect DeltaT as shown by the adjusted R2 value indicating that latitude explains only 21% of the observed variance.

Figure 6. Regression of DeltaT on Latitude.
Therefore a multiple regression was carried out on the measured variables within the monthly datafile. The Spearman correlations of these variables with DeltaT are provided in Table 2. The largest absolute value of the Spearman coefficient was with latitude (-0.375), but other relatively high correlations were noted for Tmin (0.308) and RHmax (0.301). However, TMIN, TMAX, TRUEMEAN and DTR could not be included in the multiple regression, since they (or their constituent variables in the case of DTR) appear on the left-hand side as part of the definition of DELTAT. Also the three RH variables were highly collinear, so only RHMEAN was included in the multiple regression. Finally, because Alaska and Hawaii have such extreme latitude and longitude values, they were omitted from the multiple regression. These actions left 3289 station-months (out of 3499 total) and 6 measured independent variables, of which 4 were significant. Together they explained about 30% of the measured variance (Table 3, Figure 7). However, only latitude and RH were the main explanatory variables, explaining 28% of the variance themselves with about equal contributions as judged from the t-values. When the multiple regression was repeated for each season, in fall and winter the four significant and two nonsignificant variables were identical to those in the annual regression, with adjusted R2 values of 19-20%, but in spring and summer all six variables were significant, with R2 values of 47-50%. However, in all seasons, the two dominant variables were latitude and RH.

Since RH had a strong effect on DeltaT, a map of RH was made for comparison with the DeltaT map above (Figure 8). The map again shows the clustering noted for DeltaT along the Pacific Coast, the Southeast, and the West. However, the effect of latitude along the northern tier is missing from the RH map.

Fundamentally, the difference between the minmax approach and the true mean is a function of diurnal variation—stations where the temperature spends more time closer to the minimum than the maximum will have their mean temperatures overestimated by the minmax method, and vice versa. To show this graphically, the mean diurnal variation over all seasons and years is shown for the station with the largest overestimate (Fallbrook, CA) and the one with the largest underestimate (Lewistowne, MT) (Figure 9). Although both graphs have a minimum at 6 AM and a maximum at about 2 PM, the Lewistown (lower) diurnal curve is broader. For example, 8 hours are within 2 oC of the Lewistowne maximum, whereas only about 6 hours are within 2 oC of the Fallbrook maximum. Another indicator is that 12 hours are greater than the true mean in Lewistowne but only 9 in Fallbrook.

Discussion
For a majority of US and global stations, at least until recent times, it is not possible to investigate the question of the error involved in using the Tminmax method, since insufficient measurements were made to determine the true mean. The USCRN provides one of the best datasets to investigate this question, not only since both the true mean temperatures and the daily Tmax and Tmin are provided, but also because the quality of the stations is high. Since there are >100 stations well distributed across the nation, which now have at least 4 years of continuous data, the database seems adequate for this use and the results comparing 2-year averages suggest the findings are robust.
The questions asked in the Introduction to this paper can now be answered, at least in a preliminary way.
“What is the magnitude of this error?” We see the range is from -0.66 oC to +1.38 oC, although the latter value appears to be unusual, with the second highest value only +0.88 oC.
“How does it vary by season, elevation, latitude or longitude, and other parameters?” The direction of the error is surprisingly unaffected by season, with more than half the stations showing consistent under- or over-estimates during all 4 seasons. We have seen a strong effect of latitude and RH, with a weaker effect of elevation. Geographic considerations are clearly important, with coastal and Southern sites showing strong overestimates while the northern and western stations mostly show strong underestimates of the minmax method. Although the Tuomenvirta (2000) results mentioned above are averages across all stations in a region, still their findings that the coastal stations in west Greenland and the Norwegian islands showed a strong delta T in the same direction as the coastal stations in the USCRN supports the influence of RH, whereas their finding of the opposite sign for the continental stations shows the same dependence we find here for the Western interior USCRN stations. (Note that their definition of delta T has the opposite sign from ours.)
“For a given station, is it random or biased in a consistent direction?” For most stations, the direction and magnitude of the error is very consistent across time, as shown by the comparison across seasons and across years.
Considering the larger number of stations in the US and in historical time, we may speculate that the error in the minmax method was at least as large as indicated here, and most probably somewhat larger, since many stations have been shown to be poorly sited (Fall et al, 2011). The tendency in the USCRN dataset to have about equal numbers of underestimates as overestimates is simply accidental, reflecting the particular mix of coastal, noncoastal, Northern and Southern sites. It may be that this applies as well to the larger number of sites in the continental US, but there is likely to be a bias in one direction or another in different countries, depending on their latitude extent and RH levels.
This error could affect spatial averaging. For example, the Fallbrook CA site with the highest positive DeltaT value of 1.39 C is just 147 miles away from the Yuma site with one of the largest negative values of -0.58. If these two stations were reading the identical true mean temperature, they would appear to disagree by nearly 2 full degrees Celsius using the standard minmax method. Quite a few similar pairs of close-lying stations with opposite directions of DeltaT can be seen in the map (check for nearby red and blue pairs). However, if only anomalies were considered, the error in absolute temperature levels might not affect estimates of spatial correlation (Menne and Williams, 2008).
Although the errors documented here are true errors (that is, they cannot be adjusted by time of observation or other adjustments), nonetheless it would not be expected that they have much of a direct effect on trends. After all, if one station is consistently overestimated across the years, it will have the same trend as if the values were replaced by the true values. Or if it varies cyclically by season, again after sufficient time the variations would tend to cancel and the trend be mostly unaffected. Of course, this cannot be checked with the USCRN database since it covers at most 4-5 years with the full complement of stations, and normal year-to-year “weather” variations would likely overwhelm any climatic trends over such a short period.

APPENDIX
The main concern of this paper has been with Delta T and therefore almost all of the above analyses deal with that variable. However, another variable depending on the daily Tmax and Tmin is their difference, the Diurnal Temperature Range (DTR), which has its own interest. For example, the main finding of Fall et al., (2011) was that the poorly sited stations tended to overestimate Tmin and underestimate Tmax, leading to a large underestimate of DTR. However, the USCRN stations are all well-sited and therefore the estimates of DTR should be unbiased. What can we learn from the USCRN about this variable? We can first of all map its variation (Figure A-1).

Figure A-1. Variation of daily DTR across the US CRN. Colors are quartiles. Red: 4.7-10.8 C. Gold: 10.8-12.0 C. Green: 12.0-13.8 C. Blue: 13.8-19.9 C. 
Here we see that the coastal sites have the lowest daily variation, reflecting the well-known moderating effect of the oceans. Perhaps the two sites near the Great Lakes in the lowest quartile of the DTR distribution are also due to this lake effect. The Western interior states have the highest DTRs.
A multiple regression shows that RH is by far the strongest explanatory variable (Table A-1). Solar radiation and precipitation have moderate effects, and latitude is weakly significant. The model explains about 46% of the variance, with RHMEAN accounting for most (42%) of that (Figure A-2).

Figure A-2. Diurnal Temperature Range vs. mean RH.
The figure suggests that a linear fit is not very good; for RH between about 60-95% the effect on DTR (eyeball estimate) is perhaps twice the slope of -0.138 C per % RH for all the data..
Finally, how does the true mean temperature depend on the variables measured at the UCRN sites? The multiple regression is provided in Table A-2. Although all six variables are significant and explain about 79% of the variance, the relationship is largely driven (R2=59%) by solar radiation (Figure A-3).

This month President Trump visited Detroit to announce that his administration would revisit the Corporate Average Fuel Economy regulations that require vehicles to attain an average minimum gas mileage. The Obama administration had agreed to increase those standards by 2025 to 60 miles per gallon for small cars and 46 for large cars, and 50 for small trucks and 30 for large trucks.



Why are such requirements necessary? CAFE supporters claim that consumers don’t fully appreciate the value of good gas mileage. Specifically consumers are not willing to pay more initially for a vehicle that gets better gas mileage and has lower operating costs over the lifetime of the vehicle. Thus the government must mandate the production of more efficient vehicles.



Are consumers myopic? Clemson University economist Molly Espey examined sales price data for 2001 model year cars and found that consumers paid _more_ than the fuel savings for different cars that, apart from gas mileage, were comparable. In another paper, a team of researchers led by James M. Sallee of the University of California, Berkeley, examined monthly sales data for vehicles sold between July 1993 and June 2008 and found that consumers paid more for better mileage cars when fuel prices increased and paid less for them when fuel prices decreased. Consumers’ willingness to pay perfectly replicated expected future fuel costs without any government intervention.





It’s hard to disagree that fuel economy standards are bad policy.



CAFE supporters respond that the Obama standards weren’t intended to address consumer failings to appreciate fuel savings, but rather to reduce carbon emissions and their effects on the climate. But CAFE is a clumsy way to combat climate change, both because it targets only one source of greenhouse gases and because it does so indirectly and thus inefficiently.



A less costly way is to tax carbon emissions, which would encourage consumers to economize in both their gasoline use and their other carbon‐​emitting activities. The problem is that the public, and thus politicians, hate new taxes, even if they are revenue‐​neutral.



In addition, many prefer CAFE standards because they believe that taxes on carbon emissions are regressive, falling heavily on lower‐​income households. Academic researchers agree with this, but they find CAFE places an even heavier burden on those with low‐​incomes.



A recent paper by Georgetown economist Arik Levinson looks at the distributional implications of gasoline taxes, keeping in mind how the resulting tax revenues would be used. Levinson finds that the most affluent 5 percent of households have at least 10 times the income of the poorest 20 percent, but those rich households use only four times more gasoline. That means that a gasoline tax would be regressive in the sense that the affluent would pay a lower percentage of their income. But if the proceeds were then rebated equally to all households, the overall tax‐​plus‐​rebate program would be progressive because low‐​income households would get back more money than they paid.



CAFE standards are equivalent to a tax on the gasoline used per mile of travel. Thus to assess the distributional effects of CAFE standards, we need to know whether a direct tax on gasoline use increases faster with income than a “CAFE standard–equivalent” tax. Affluent households use four times as much gasoline as poor households, but affluent households use only three times the gasoline _per mile_ as poor households. Thus, an explicit tax on gasoline goes up faster with respect to income for affluent households than the tax‐​equivalent cost of CAFE standards with respect to income. Put more simply, a gasoline tax would be more progressive than the cost of CAFE standards.



CAFE’s regressivity has grown worse in recent years. There was once a single standard for cars and a single standard for trucks, but in 2011 the federal government began using different standards for small and large cars and small and large trucks. The larger vehicles face more lenient standards and, of course, wealthier people tend to drive larger vehicles. Thus, the new CAFE standards are even more regressive relative to a gas tax.



To summarize, academic researchers have shown that consumers correctly consider fuel costs when making vehicle‐​buying decisions. CAFE standards cannot be justified as correcting some sort of consumer failure to appreciate fuel savings. The idea that CAFE reduces carbon emissions is slightly more reasonable, but it is a very indirect, inefficient and regressive method. Thus it’s hard to disagree with the Trump administration that the CAFE standards are bad regulation.

"**There have been more than 1.6 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and about 60,000 people have died, government figures show.**
However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus and other measures suggest the number of deaths is higher.
**Find out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:**
If you can't see the look-up click here.
After the first peak in April, cases started rising again in July, with the rate of growth increasing sharply in September and October, before falling again in the past two weeks.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 16,170 confirmed cases.
It is thought the infection rate was much higher during the first peak in spring, but testing capacity at the time was too limited to detect the true number of daily cases.
The data for cases can also be broken down by region and comparing the change in those figures by week gives a sense of where there has been a recent increase in newly-reported infections.
Coronavirus infections in England have fallen by about a third during lockdown, according to a major study carried out by Imperial College London.
While some of the worst-hit areas saw the biggest improvements, cases have remained relatively high across England, according to the React-1 study, which is based on tests of more than 100,000 people between 13-24 November.
The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), suggest about one in 185 (16,400 people) in Wales had the virus in the week ending 21 November.
In Northern Ireland rates are thought to be decreasing at around one in 145 people (about 12,700 people), while in Scotland, the figure was one in 115 (about 45,700 people).
The average number of daily deaths began to rise again in September, following the first peak in April.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 648 deaths.
Of these, 555 deaths were in England, 51 in Wales, 38 in Scotland, and four in Northern Ireland.
Rules were amended over the summer to include deaths in the coronavirus total only if they occurred within 28 days of a positive test. Previously in England, all deaths after a positive test were included.
England has seen the majority of UK deaths from Covid-19. Using the 28-day cut-off, there have been more than 52,000.
Although hospital admissions for Covid-19 remain below the levels seen in the spring, there are big regional disparities.
The North West, North East and Yorkshire, and Midlands have seen the highest number of admissions but the situation in all three now appears to be improving.
Cases have risen across large parts of England, with other spikes in areas of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The red areas on the map below are those currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people.
Restrictions have been tightened across the UK in an effort to tackle the number of rising cases.
In England, each local authority has been placed in one of the new three tiers following the end of the recent national lockdown.
Wales has announced a range of further measures, including a ban on pubs, restaurants and cafes serving alcohol, from Friday 4 December.
In Northern Ireland, a further two-week ""circuit-break"" lockdown began on 27 November.
Scotland has a five-tier system of alert levels with different measures in place in different parts of the country.
UK leaders have agreed to allow up to three households to meet indoors during a five-day Christmas period of 23-27 December.
When looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways.
Government figures count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus.
But there are two other measures.
The first includes all deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, even if the person had not been tested for the virus. The most recent figures suggest there had been almost 70,000 deaths by 20 November.
The second measure counts all deaths over and above the usual number at the time of year - that figure was more than 75,000 by 20 November.
The most recent figures available from the ONS are for the third week of November, which show there were 14,276 deaths registered in the UK.
Some 3,038 of these deaths involved Covid-19 - 199 more than the week before.
Deaths normally do rise at this time of the year, but the data from the ONS and its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland show the second wave of the virus has pushed the death rate above the average seen over the past five years by about 21%.
Overall, the figures are still well below the peak of 9,495 deaths recorded in a week, reached on 17 April.
The ""R number"" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to.
If R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow.
The government's current estimate for the R number across the whole of the UK is 0.9 to 1.
The estimate for England is 0.9 to 1, while for Scotland it is 0.8 to 1. The estimate for Wales is 0.8 to 1 and in Northern Ireland it is 0.9 to 1.1.
The government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe UN IPCC AR5 completely neglected discussing the reason why we have climate to begin with: THE SUN. There’s a reason why they did.
I’m pleased to say that Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt’s and Sebastian Lüning’s climate skeptic book “The Neglected Sun” is NUMBER 1 in several categories at Amazon.uk!


Of course, The Neglected Sun is not yet at the top of the charts overall, but it’s way up from a couple of days ago. Now with the AR5 report out, this book is more timely than ever. Pick up some extra copies for Christmas presents.
You can purchase it in paperback at the really great price of £9.09.
The book looks at all climate factors and doesn’t gloss over anything. There’s a reason why the IPCC avoids the sun – they’re scared to death of it. Lüning and Vahrenholt explain why.
And you’ll understand why Fritz Vahrenholt had to get a bodyguard and why the two authors became the German science establishment’s and climate activism’s most feared and disliked dissidents.

This government has to rank as the most inept, illogical and idiotic we have had the misfortune to endure. They sit in the House in Question Time like possums in the headlights. Unable to answer questions coherently, they are only saved from the equivalent of daily roadkill by the blatant bias displayed by Speaker Mallard. His knavery in continually wading to their defence is nothing short of a disgrace.



Worse than that though, are the decisions being made, many which reflect an inability to make sensible judgments. Ideology is overruling rational thinking which highlights a major problem with this government. They find ideology much easier to cope with than rational thinking which requires a mental capacity to first comprehend the subject matter and then formulate legislation based on logical thought. 



Examples of where failure has occurred in this regard are:



ENERGY. The virtual closing down of the oil and gas industry. A Captain’s call. The result is that the industry is sunk, just like the Titanic. Having done that, they declared a climate emergency and told everyone to buy an electric car. They then turned down an application to build a hydro dam on the West Coast in favour of a few kayakers. Hypocrisy in the extreme. If it wasn’t such a momentous act of stupidity we could all die laughing.



TRANSPORT. The Hamilton to Auckland train. It is, in fact, two trains with two fares and only two stops taking over two hours to complete the journey. Then there’s the Dominion Road tram. The initial costing was two billion but evidently it is now approaching seven. This tells you a lot about the financial prowess of these dunderheads. I wonder where that leaves the business case? Perhaps there isn’t one. Do they even know what a business case is?



EDUCATION. The closing of Charter schools. They are ruining the lives of children in need simply to please their Union masters. Due to other policy failures, school lunches are now having to be provided. The PM suggests that schools team up with the local bakery. What for? A pie, a doughnut and a coke? She failed to mention who would pay the bakery for the purchase of such wholesome treats. Here’s a better idea. How about the schools team up with parents and ask them why they can’t provide their child with a lunch. Perhaps even dare to talk about parental responsibility.



WELFARE. Their policies encourage lack of responsibility and as a result, the risk of indiscriminate procreation. Carmel Sepuloni made it very clear from the outset that antics in the bedroom were no concern of hers, but she would be only too happy to take financial care of the two legged consequences. The welfare cheques are so good they can’t get the nephews off the couch. And if the statistics are correct, they’re not getting people out of the poverty trap either.



HOUSING. The government has no place in the housing market. Its role is to build statehouses. The fiasco that is Kiwibuild proves this beyond doubt. The targeting of landlords with endless regulations means the resulting increased costs are being passed on to the tenants making renting even less affordable. Hence an increase in the housing waiting lists. They obviously couldn’t even work that out.



HEALTH. Millions are being poured into mental health for no positive effect. This is another example of left-wing ideology, that problems are solved by throwing money at them. Then there is the cancer agency broken promise and DHB financial blowouts.



CRIME. A ridiculous knee jerk reaction following the Christchurch massacre meaning law-abiding citizens are being forced to hand in their firearms while the gangs keep theirs. Judges are now handing down pathetic sentences to honour the Government’s policy of reducing the prison population. Multiple rape = home detention.



This is proving to be a government incapable of governing. The prime minister, as has been noted, is part-time at best, although full time wouldn’t make much of a difference. Her grasp of the issues of the day is woeful as evidenced weekly in the ums and ahs interview with Mike Hosking. The rest of her shambolic team is equally lightweight and clueless.   
We deserve better, but that will only happen with a change of government. National, and don’t we like to moan about them, are nowhere near this level of downright incompetence. With ACT to keep them honest, as opposed to NZF, I think we might get a government that could command some respect.



Give some serious thought as to how you might cast your vote next year.

Their arguments are getting more adventurous”. This especially in the wake of typhoon Yolanda.
Swiss journalist Alex Reichmuth (photo right) writes that flagging interest is frustrating global warming activists.
Progress on hammering out a globally binding climate emissions treaty has been moving at a glacial pace. Reichmuth also adds that “it is not only the political gridlock that is frustrating the climate catastrophe warners, but also flagging public interest in global warming.”
He writes that major Swiss media outlet SRF did not even bother sending any correspondents over the COP 19 conference in Warsaw, and says “the loss of interest also comes from the latest reports coming from science where there are few signs of catastrophe.”
Another sign, he writes, is the disappearance of Swiss warmist climate blog of the ETH in Zurich. “Now the blog is called ‘Future Blog’ and offers popular articles like on how to prevent waste from buffets by using Tupperware.”

Amidst the many headline‐​grabbing moments of the Republican and Democratic national conventions, both parties released their platforms for the 2016 election. While both platforms mentioned the U.S.-China relationship, there was very little room for agreement on how the United States should deal with China in the years to come. The Republicans and Democrats both displayed some “dragon slayer” tendencies — after all nobody wants to look weak in international politics. But the platforms showed substantive differences on how Washington should deal with Beijing.



The Democrats: Continuing the Pivot



The core of the Democratic platform is the Obama administration’s “pivot” or “rebalance” to Asia, which was spearheaded by Hillary Clinton when she was Secretary of State. The platform considers East Asian allies such as Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines to be essential for achieving U.S. interests in the region. According to the platform, “We will also work with our allies and partners to fortify regional institutions and norms as well as protect freedom of the seas in the South China Sea.” Importantly, allies are not explicitly called on to balance against China or try to contain its rise.





No matter who wins in November, U.S.-China relations are heading toward a period where competition will trump cooperation.



The primary source of hawkish language on China in the Democratic platform is found on page 49. The platform states, “We will stand up to Beijing on unfair trade practices, currency manipulation, censorship of the internet, piracy, and cyberattacks.” However, and in stark contrast to the Republican platform, the very next sentence mentions “areas of cooperation” with Beijing that the Democrats will pursue. Seeking cooperation with China on issues like climate change and nuclear proliferation and standing up to Beijing when important interests are threatened is a continuation of the Obama administration’s policies.



If Hillary Clinton wins in November and follows through on this platform, then expect the United States to stay the course in the pivot to Asia. Whether or not this policy will achieve its intended goals is questionable given China’s intransigence in response to the Obama administration’s policies, but Beijing likely prefers a continuation of the pivot to the harsh stance spelled out in the GOP platform.



The Republicans: China is the Enemy, and We Will Defeat It



The Republican platform is adamant about the threat China poses to the United States and cooperation is practically impossible. According to the Republicans, the United States has tried playing nice with China, but has gotten nothing in return besides unfair trade policies, regional instability, grave human rights violations, and the revival of “the cult of Mao.” Chinese activities in the South China Sea are one example of how the Obama administration’s weakness has “invited aggression.” China is presented as an enemy, and the United States does not cooperate with its enemies.



The Republican platform is also more hawkish on Taiwan. Taiwan’s democratic system of government, human rights record, and open economy are “saluted” in the GOP platform, but not in the Democratic platform. This makes American support for, and if need be defense of, Taiwan essential for normative, not just practical reasons. Additionally, the Republicans affirm the Six Assurances to Taiwan made by President Reagan in 1982, which the Democratic platform does not mention.



Implementing the GOP platform would put the United States into an outright adversarial relationship with China characterized by greater U.S. criticism of China’s human rights record and activities in cyberspace, and a stronger U.S. military stance to prevent weakness from inviting aggression. However, it is unclear how much of the platform would be implemented by Donald Trump if he is elected president. His tough talk on economic issues suggests adherence to those aspects of the platform, but weakening U.S. alliance relationships could undermine the platform’s language on Taiwan and the treaty allies.



Both the Republican and Democratic platforms reflect a willingness to get tougher with China, albeit in different ways and to a different degree. The Democrats want to continue the pivot to Asia and strengthen the alliance system that Chinese leaders see as a vehicle for containment. The Republicans want to reclaim a moral high ground and confront China on its human rights record, territorial ambitions, and cyber activities. No matter who wins in November, U.S.-China relations are heading toward a period where competition will trump cooperation.

"Gunjur Beach should be a pearl in the crown of the Gambia, a small sliver of a country in West Africa. Long stretches of silver sand are lined with coconut palms, while many generations of fishermen from nearby Senegal have used this beach as a landing point for their colourful and masterfully crafted wooden boats. And in the past 30 years several bars and eco-tourism ventures have moved into the area, serving “voluntourists” and bird watchers. I have just returned from Gunjur, where I was researching its historical community-based link with the town of Marlborough in the UK. During my visit, I met various members of the community to explore the particular development challenges faced there today.  I heard that, for the past few years, the seafront at Gunjur has been at the centre of a tense environmental and social dispute, one that magnifies wider concerns about the nature of Chinese investment in The Gambia.  The dispute is over a factory that produces fishmeal, a product obtained by drying and grinding fish or fish waste. It is usually sold as powder before being added to other foods and fed to poultry, pigs or farmed fish.  In 2016, a Chinese-owned fishmeal manufacturer, Golden Lead, opened a factory and started operations at Gunjur Beach. The factory is flanked by the ocean on one side and on the other the Bolong Fenyo – a lagoon with lots of birds that was Gambia’s first community wildlife reserve. Golden Lead’s operational contract was issued by the previous government of Yahya Jammeh, an autocrat who was much reviled for reported corruption and human rights abuses. Some locals worried about its environmental impact but, nonetheless, the factory was initially welcomed. Locals believed Golden Lead promised improved infrastructure, increased employment and training for Gambians. With relatively high wages on offer, around 80 people took up jobs. However tensions soon surfaced over the factory’s use of ocean-caught bonga, a fish that Gunjurians have long relied upon as a cheap and abundant source of protein. Increased pressure on supplies has already pushed up bonga prices. Local residents allege that since the factory arrived in Gunjur, swathes of dead fish and mammals – including whales, turtles, dolphins, eels and rays – have washed up on the beach. Things started to escalate when, in 2017, the Bolong Fenyo suddenly changed colour and fish and birds in the protected reserve started to die. Biomedical scientist Ahmed Manjang tested the local water and found it was unusually high in phosphates. Local environmentalists blamed a waste pipe running from the factory building into the ocean (fishmeal factories tend to produce lots of wastewater). However, Golden Lead had previously denied that it had been dumping wastewater products.  The Gambian National Environment Agency (NEA) then got involved, and ordered Golden Lead to treat its wastewater and remove the pipe. However, after months of inaction, local residents and environmental activists gave Golden Lead an ultimatum: move the pipe within seven days or we will. And so, on March 22 2018, that’s exactly what they did. Up to 150 young Gunjurians assembled on the beach, where they were met by a large deployment of police. A group of activists armed with shovels physically dug out and removed the pipe. In spite of the NEA’s earlier demands, Golden Lead was soon permitted to reinstall a waste pipe. Local news agency, Gunjur News Online said the move was politically motivated, with their sources suggesting that the government stepped in due to concerns about discouraging potential investors. Foreign income is much sought after by the Gambian government, which must contend with a large current account deficit and public debt. At the end of May 2018, a new pipe was installed with a certain amount of theatricality. Golden Lead this time chose a central spot on Gunjur beach to lay the waste pipe and staff members raised a Chinese flag in the process. This act was perceived as a provocation by members of a community whose entire village was once destroyed during colonial land grabs at the end of the 18th century. As one activist told me:  When they planted a flag on our beach like that, we really saw this as an insult. While we are not against investment in the area, we do ask that these things are undertaken responsibly and that they do not cause harm to our people and environment. Local activists continue to allege the plant is responsible for pollution and overfishing, but the government says it is satisfied Golden Lead has cleaned up its act. Golden Lead denied to the Guardian in March 2019 that it outcompetes local fish sellers and said it had a zero tolerance approach to pollution. As also reported in the paper, Jojo Huang, the director of the fishmeal plant, has also previously stated that the factory was “in no way responsible for the dumping of fish in the local area” and that it “does not pump chemicals into the sea and has followed guidance from the National Environment Agency on waste management”. However, community members have now filed court cases seeking reparations for environmental degradation, so the story continues to unfold. Gunjur is the site of one of three Chinese-owned fishmeal plants that have recently set up operations in the Gambia. The Guardian reports that the other factory sites at Kartong and Sanyang have both faced temporary closures due to complaints and protests linked to waste disposal methods.  Together with the Gunjur site, these three factories provide a glimpse of the tensions between the need to economically develop and attract foreign investment, and local environmental and socio-economic issues. And as someone who researches the politics of resistance in the global south, what is especially encouraging about events in the Gambia to me is that this local activism represents a rebirth of civil society following the demise of the Jammeh regime."
"Hydrothermal vents host rare species at incredibly high density comparable to tropical rainforests or coral reefs. Forty years ago, the first descriptions of the ecosystems around these deep underwater heat funnels changed our understanding of deep ocean environments and the very origins of life. Now, species in even the most inaccessible parts of Earth are threatened by disturbance from human activity, including mining the depths of the ocean.   Technological impediments, and commodity prices, mean that deep sea mining may not be immediately economically viable. But many companies and nations motivated by geopolitics or other subtler calculus than simple profit mean extraction is already happening. The targets of seabed mining include volcanic areas where hydrothermal processes can concentrate rare minerals, including gold, zinc, and cobalt and lithium that are key components in lithium-ion batteries. Yet there is no provision for these biodiversity hotspots to receive blanket protection from the development of deep sea mining.  Now an update to the global IUCN Red List, the global inventory of the conservation status of Earth’s species, includes Chrysomallon squamiferum – known as the scaly-foot snail or Sea Pangolin – the first marine species to be assessed as officially endangered due to the potential threat of deep sea mining. The Red List was developed for well-studied species with possible ways to restore them, but as we show in Nature Ecology & Evolution, the Red List is also a powerful, proven tool for protecting even the most remote and poorly understood animals.

      Unless we regain our historic awe of the deep ocean, it will be plundered


 The assessment process for the Sea Pangolin started with an epiphany on the high seas. In early 2016, deep sea biologist Chong Chen and I were part of a deep sea expedition to the Kairei hydrothermal vent field in the Indian Ocean. We were there to work on the Sea Pangolin, to understand adaptations to life in hydrothermal vents. The Sea Pangolin was a key part of that scientific mission; we were re-visiting a site where these snails were known to occur. Many people in the science party had prior experience collecting this species, but, we just couldn’t find them. Where were they? Had something happened to them?  As biologists, we really love the species we work on, and I vividly remember the sick feeling when we started to really worry that we were not going to find the Sea Pangolin on that expedition. We knew more about this species than anyone else, but we didn’t know where they had gone.  Kairei vent field is over 2,400 metres deep (about 1.5 miles), and almost 900km away from the nearest point of land. The vent field itself is tiny, like most hydrothermal vents or geothermal sites on land, Kairei is less than a third of a football field. Areas beyond 12 nautical miles (22.2km) away from any coast fall under the purview of the International Seabed Authority, which was established by the United Nations to manage deep sea benthic space and resources.  The UN refers to the seabed as “the common heritage of mankind”, but the focus of the International Seabed Authority (with scientific advice from the Deep Ocean Stewardship Initiative) is now deep sea mining. At that time, the Sea Pangolin was known from only three sites, though we knew informally that one additional population had recently been discovered. Even with undiscovered sites, the total habitat area available for the Sea Pangolin extends up to a generous potential maximum of 0.27km² (0.1 square miles).  Today, all sites but one have active mining exploration licenses, and none of them have any protection from deep sea mining.  At sea in 2016, it took more than three weeks for our team to find a colony of the snails, but we did eventually find a healthy population and we were able to complete our experiments. We also realised that we needed a better way to explain the vulnerability of these species and spaces, in a way that everyone can understand.  A few months after we got back to land, I connected with the IUCN Species Survival Commission (SSC) Mollusc Specialist Group. Chong and I started gathering the information we would need to complete a Red List assessment from our prior published research on the Sea Pangolin.  When we talked about this work to other deep sea biologists, some disliked the idea of Red List status for their study animals. “That will just be really inconvenient,” said one. They worried that if international recognition leads to legal protection, it would prohibit them from collecting specimens for research, or that sharing preserved specimens would be confused with wildlife trafficking, and that these prohibitions could delay research or create mountains of paperwork. But many have a different view now. Personally, I am willing to risk some minor inconvenience. It is far more difficult to work on a species that is extinct, than one that gets the protection it deserves.  We are now expanding Red List assessments from the Indian Ocean to all species found in deep sea hydrothermal vent habitats around the world, in a project led by Elin Thomas, as part of her PhD studies in my group at Queen’s University Belfast. Endangered status for hydrothermal vent species only found in areas under license for mining exploration, could be compared to a species that only lives in a patch of rainforest scheduled for logging. Not all hydrothermal vent species will be classified as endangered, and status can change for the worse, or for better. In the last global update of the Red List, not a single species improved in status. Active hydrothermal vents are not the only targets for deep sea mining and while extinct vents and other sites may be larger and more practical for extraction, they also pose serious environmental concerns. If active hydrothermal vents were protected against the threat of deep sea mining, the endangered status of the Sea Pangolin could be lifted."
"Have you have seen ants this year? In Britain, they were probably black garden ants, known as Lasius niger – Europe’s most common ant. One of somewhere between 12,000 and 20,000 species, they are the scourge of gardeners – but also fascinating.  The small, black, wingless workers run around the pavements, crawl up your plants tending aphids or collect tasty morsels from your kitchen. And the flying ants that occasionally appear on a warm summer’s evening are actually the reproductive siblings of these non-winged workers. Here’s what else you need to know: Ants have a caste system, where responsibilities are divided. The queen is the founder of the colony, and her role is to lay eggs. Worker ants are all female, and this sisterhood is responsible for the harmonious operation of the colony.  Their tasks range from caring for the queen and the young, foraging, policing conflicts in the colony, and waste disposal. Workers will most likely never have their own offspring. The vast majority of eggs develop as workers, but once the colony is ready the queen produces the next generation of reproductives which will go on to start own colonies. A female ant’s fate to become a worker or queen is mainly determined by diet, not genetics. Any female ant larva can become the queen – those that do receive diets richer in protein. The other larvae receive less protein, which causes them to develop as workers. Unlike humans, with X and Y chromosomes, an ant’s sex is determined by the number of genome copies it possesses. Male ants develop from unfertilised eggs so receive no genome from a father. This means that male ants don’t have a father and cannot have sons, but they do have grandfathers and can have grandsons. Female ants, in comparison, develop from fertilised eggs and have two genome copies – one from their father and one from their mother. Male ants function like flying sperm. Only having one genome copy means every one of their sperm is genetically identical to themselves. And their job is over quickly, dying soon after mating, although their sperm live on, perhaps for years. 
– essentially their only job is to reproduce.  When the conditions are warm and humid, the winged virgin queens and males leave their nests in search of mates. This is the behaviour seen on “flying ant day”. In L. niger, mating takes place on the wing, often hundreds of meters up (hence the need for good weather). Afterwards, queens drop to the ground and shed their wings, while males quickly die. Mated queens choose a nest site and burrow into the soil, made softer from recent rain.  


      Read more:
      The amazing secrets behind 'flying ant day'


 Once underground, the queens will not eat for weeks – until they have produced their own daughter workers. They use energy from their fat stores and redundant flight muscles to lay their first batch of eggs, which they fertilise using sperm stored from their nuptial flight. It is the same stock of sperm acquired from long dead males that allows a queen to continue laying fertilised eggs for her entire life. Queens never mate again. Sometimes two L. niger queens unite to found a nest. This initially cooperative association – which increases the chance of establishing a colony – dissolves once new adult workers emerge and then the queens fight to the death. More sinister still, L. niger colonies sometimes steal brood from their neighbours, putting them to work as slaves.  Slave-making has evolved in a number of ant species, but they also display cooperation at extraordinary levels. An extreme example of this is a “supercolony” of Argentine ants (Linepithema humile) which extends over 6,000km of European coastline from Italy to north-west Spain, and is composed of literally billions of workers from millions of cooperating nests. After establishing her colony, the queen’s work is not done and she has many years of egg-laying ahead of her. In the laboratory, L. niger queens have lived for nearly 30 years. Workers live for about a year, males little more than a week (although their sperm live longer). These extraordinary differences in longevity are purely due to the way their genes are switched on and off. Ants have a major influence in ecosystems worldwide and their roles are diverse. While some ants are considered pests, others act as biological-control agents. Ants benefit ecosystems by dispersing seeds, pollinating plants and improving the quality of soil. Ants might also benefit our health, as a potential source of new medicines such as antibiotics.  So when you next see an ant, before you think to kill her, consider how fascinating she really is."

Ah, summer in our cities, where the climate is woebegone and the temperature is almost always above normal.



Cities tend to get warmer, whether or not there is global or regional warming. Bricks, buildings and pavement absorb more heat during the day than a “natural” vegetated state, and urban structures impede the flow of ventilating winds. The result is that, as cities grow, temperatures rise. In Washington, there is additional warming caused by the waste heat from all the money changing hands.



The official (and silly) definition of “normal” temperature is the average for the past 30 years. In a growing urban environment (which includes suburban sprawl) that number is likely to be lower than what it is now.



As a result, cities are inadvertently testing a dear hypothesis of my greener friends: that global warming will result in increasing heat‐​related mortality.



Those who have read _Freakonomics_ can see this hanging curveball. Global warming should _reduce_ urban mortality as heat waves become more frequent.



I’ve done a bit of work in this area. Robert Davis, a former colleague at the University of Virginia, and I examined three decades of heat‐​related mortality data from the Centers for Disease Control for the 28 largest U.S. cities. We then teamed up with a UVa medical statistician, Wendy Novicoff, who made sure we adjusted for different demographics between cities; we did this because the elderly and infants are most susceptible to heat‐​related mortality, and we wanted to compare disproportionately old cities (like Phoenix) with disproportionally young ones (like Seattle). After all was said and done, we found that heat‐​related mortality is dropping like a stone in almost every major urban area in the nation.



Before you go to the “comments” and blast me with the European heat wave of 2003 or the Chicago disaster in 1995, read on.



The 2003 heat wave in Europe was devastating. In France alone, and very dependent on the way you count things, it appears there were about 35,000 excess deaths. That heat wave was a lulu, with European temperatures about three standard deviations above the average, something that has a 1‐​in‐​333 chance of occurring averaged over your state or province. Given that there are a lot of places of similar size on the planet, such an anomaly can usually be found somewhere. In 2003, that somewhere just happened to be at the epicenter of global warming angst.



Then there was the great French heat wave of 2006.



Whoops. Don’t know about that one? Climatically, it was pretty comparable, but far fewer French fried.



A. Fouillet and his team of researchers wrote this up in a 2008 paper in the _International Journal of Epidemiology_. They started off with a simple (i.e. logical and testable) model relating temperature to mortality and found that something in addition to the heat killed a lot of people in 2003. While their model predicted about 17 deaths per 100,000, the observed rate was 21 per 100,000, or about nearly 7,000 bodies.



(There’s plenty of speculation on the cause, with fingers pointed at France’s August recess, when everyone — including health care workers — takes to the beach or the hills and leaves the old folks at the non‐​airconditioned home)



In 2006, their model showed nearly 4,500 _fewer_ deaths than expected.



What the French did was (begrudgingly) emulate urban Americans. They _adapted_. The government bought air conditioning (formerly a crass Yankee invention) for retirement homes. They implemented a National Heat Wave Plan that keeps tabs on the elderly, who were left to swelter in 2003. They set up cooling shelters for those without A/C.



And, of course, adaptation is what’s happening in our cities. Perhaps the most politically incorrect thing an urban administration can do is to be caught flatfooted by the weather. Chicago’s Daley dynasty was (temporarily) swept away by a 1979 snowstorm when it selectively canceled rail service in southside black neighborhoods. And who can forget Washington’s colorful mayor Marion Barry, cavorting at the 1987 Super Bowl during back‐​to‐​back storms. White stuff set him up.



Want proof of our adaptation to heat? Two extremely hot cities, Tampa and Phoenix, have virtually no heat‐​related mortality, despite sporting the oldest populations in our study. In only one city is mortality increasing. That would be young and vibrant Seattle, where summer heat is still very rare.



I am sure many consider it immoral to export heat‐​related mortality to the North, but that won’t last for long. Seattle’s latitude is about 48 degrees north. The vast majority of our hemisphere’s cities are south of there, and by the time you get to 60 degrees, not very far away, you tend to run out of cities. At that point, global warming will have squeezed urban heat‐​related mortality off of the map.

"**A charity which helped rehabilitate profoundly disabled people for the last 45 years has warned it is on the brink of financial collapse.**
The Lake District Calvert Trust offers outdoor adventure breaks for adults and children with physical and learning difficulties.

Share this...FacebookTwitterBjorn Lomborg comments at Facebook on the Cook 97% survey. Has climate science gotten so bad that it is now resorting to utterly phony claims? Cook confirms that indeed it has.

Here’s what Lomborg writes (my emphasis, links shortened):
Ugh. Do you remember the “97% consensus”, which even Obama tweeted?
Turns out the authors don’t want to reveal their data.
It has always been a dodgy paper (iopscience.iop.org/article). Virtually everyone I know in the debate would automatically be included in the 97% (including me, but also many, much more skeptical)….
The paper looks at 12,000 papers written in the last 25 years (see here, the paper doesn’t actually specify the numbers, notalotofpeopleknowthat/).
It ditches about 8,000 papers because they don’t take a position. They put people who agree into three different bins — 1.6% that explicitly endorse global warming with numbers, 23% that explicitly endorse global warming without numbers and then 74% that “implicitly endorse” because they’re looking at other issues with global warming that must mean they agree with human-caused global warming.
Voila, you got about 97% (actually here 98%, but because the authors haven’t released the numbers themselves, we have to rely on other quantative assessments).
Notice, that *nobody* said anything about *dangerous* global warming; this meme simply got attached afterwards (by Obama and many others).
Now, Richard Tol has tried to replicate their study and it turns out they have done pretty much everything wrong. And they don’t want to release the data so anyone else can check it. Outrageous.
Read Tol’s letter to the Peter Høj, University of Queensland: ‘the main finding of the paper is incorrect, invalid and unrepresentative.’ (www.uq.edu.au/about/vice-chancellor)
It would be hilarious if it wasn’t so sad.

For decades, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has calculated the benefits of proposed regulations. These calculations are necessary both to justify regulation under the language of statutes they implement, such as the Clean Air Act, and to present the cost‐​benefit analysis that has been required under executive orders since the Reagan Administration.



Very often, as was the case for EPA’s 2012 assessment of the benefits of tightening the standard for fine particulates known as PM 2.5, EPA estimates regulatory benefits by multiplying epidemiologists’ estimate of the reduction in premature mortality that a new standard would generate by the value of a statistical life reported by economists.



For other regulations, such as the so‐​called tailpipe regulation of 2010 that raised automobile Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, EPA has relied in part on epidemiological studies to get a value for statistical lives saved, but also in part on purely economic studies of the value of higher mileage vehicles to consumers.





EPA’s rulemakings have increasingly been based on statistical analysis that has never been subject to rigorous testing and critique.



During the spring and summer of 2018, EPA issued two rulemaking proposals that together could significantly improve its benefit calculation process. The first, and most important rule, proposed in April, would require EPA to ensure that the data justifying its regulations be “publicly available in a manner sufficient for independent validation.” The second proposal, issued in June, is a request for comment on potential EPA rulemaking on how the agency conducts cost‐​benefit analysis.



Both proposals may seem abstract and technical. But, in fact, they could fundamentally change the process by which EPA calculates regulatory benefits. Indeed, they could effect such a fundamental improvement to the EPA’s calculation of regulatory benefits that under processes revised to conform to the new regulations, benefits under both the 2012 PM 2.5 standard and the 2010 tailpipe rule would be revealed to be much smaller than EPA reported, and far smaller than their costs.



Consider first the April proposed rule that would require the public availability of the data and methods used to calculate regulatory benefits. By requiring that EPA regulations be based on data that are actually available for statistical testing by outside, non‐​EPA affiliated researchers, this rule would bring EPA practices up to the standard exercised in every scientific discipline, where peer‐​edited journals require that authors share data with other researchers and, in some instances, even require study authors to post online both data and statistical code used to derive published results. The reason that scientific journals require these disclosures is fundamental to the scientific process: Unless the authors of published work share their data and methods, future researchers cannot verify whether the reported results can be replicated and relied upon as a basis of further work.



Public availability of data and methods is crucial to the progress of science because only with such availability can scientists avoid going down dead‐​end roads built on previous results that were actually false. Such public availability is even more important in the regulatory context, where false scientific findings do not just cause researchers to waste time and money pursuing dead‐​end research, but they also justify regulations costing billions of dollars and sometimes thousands of jobs. Before such regulations are issued, the underlying science must be publicly available for replication and critical review.



The environmental lobby has objected that the April proposed rule would cut the legs out from important regulations that have been justified by studies—epidemiological studies, in particular—whose data have never been made publicly accessible for replication and review. This is true, but it is not a bad thing.



To see why, consider a particularly important EPA rule: the Obama‐​era EPA’s 2012 rule tightening the standard for fine particulates or fine PM—that is, particles of dust and various pollutants less than 2.5 microns in diameter. As reported by the Office of Management and Budget, since 2004, the monetized value of the benefits from tougher fine PM standards make up the majority of—and for some years over 80 percent of—the quantified benefits of _all_ regulatory benefits. The Obama EPA used the quantified benefits of fine PM reduction not only to support the new fine PM standard, but also as a side effect or “co‐​benefit” justifying tougher standards for other air pollutants, such as ozone, oxides of nitrogen, and even greenhouse gases.



In calculating the benefits of toughening the fine PM standard, the Obama EPA relied heavily on two long‐​term studies—called cohort studies—of particular individuals exposed to varying levels of fine PM. The goal of a cohort study is to see whether exposure to a particular pollutant or engaging in a particular behavior, like smoking, increases mortality risk. Cohort studies are widely used in epidemiology and biomedical research. Like clinical trials for new drugs—where a known group of people are given a new drug, and two other groups are given a placebo and an existing drug already on the market—cohort studies enlist a known group of individuals for study.



The environmental lobby argues against EPA’s proposed rule primarily by noting that data from such cohort studies cannot be made publicly available without compromising promises of confidentiality made to study subjects. This argument is ludicrous. As the EPA’s April proposed rule notes, there are well‐​known protocols for ensuring that cohort study data can be shared for purposes of replication and further scientific work without compromising the identity of study participants.



For example, following the standard practice of the Organization for Economic Co‐​operation and Development (OECD), the Medical Research Council of Great Britain _requires_ the sharing of data from any study that it funds. At the same time, the Medical Research Council also requires that “data‐​sharing agreements must prohibit any attempt to identify study participants from the released data or otherwise breach confidentiality” or “make unapproved contact with study participants.” EPA can and should impose precisely the same requirements.



During the Obama Administration, EPA’s fallback to the obvious absurdity of the argument that making data publicly available would compromise confidentiality was to make an even more absurd argument: that EPA could not get the data because it was owned by researchers who had conducted the cohort studies, not by EPA.



The problem with this argument is that both of the long‐​term cohort studies that provided the primary evidence for EPA’s 2013 toughening of the fine PM standard were primarily funded by EPA itself. For example, as I describe in more detail in my chapter in the forthcoming Cato Institute book, _Science and Liberty_ , the Health Effects Institute, which paid for reanalysis and an extended reanalysis of a long‐​term cohort study called the Harvard Six Cities Study, has received at least $87 million from EPA since 2000. If EPA is paying for research, there is no reason in the world why it cannot follow the standard OECD practice of requiring both that data from such studies be shared with other researchers and that safeguards be put in place to ensure that confidentiality is not breached in that sharing.



Scientific journals these days routinely contain a list of articles corrected or retracted entirely because the results they reported have failed the scientific litmus test of replication. Certain fields, such as social psychology, now operate under a perceived “replication crisis” due to the discovery that large bodies of supposedly true results established by stars in the field were either based on fabricated data or simply cannot be replicated.



EPA’s proposed rule requiring the public availability of data does no more than make EPA current with best scientific practice. Without such public availability of data, EPA regulations are not based on the scientific process as it is now undertaken; they cannot plausibly be considered science‐​based.



As for EPA’s June proposed rule asking whether it should issue regulations setting standards for how it performs requisite cost‐​benefit analyses, my answer is a resounding “yes.”



There has been so little consistency in how EPA has chosen to calculate regulatory benefits that the exercise has often seemed much less an actual objective analysis and much more an attempt to find any methodology which results in estimated benefits big enough to justify a proposed rule using cost‐​benefit analysis.



Many examples of this inconsistent cost‐​benefit analysis advocacy exist. In the case of the 2010 CAFE standards, EPA rejected a large number of economic studies showing that consumers did not attach high value to increased mileage, choosing instead to multiply an estimate of reduced gallons of gas consumed by the estimate price of gasoline. The latter approach, which uses estimates of future miles driven and gasoline prices that are subject to enormous uncertainty, had the apparent virtue of increasing the value of the CAFE standard.



A few years later, around 2011, EPA initially proposed to value alternative approaches to regulating power plant cooling water intake by simply asking people how much they would hypothetically pay to protect various fish populations and aquatic ecosystems. These contingent valuation surveys attempt to elicit stated preferences, not preferences revealed by the actual choices people make. Many economists who do not make a living running these surveys believe that they do not reliably measure people’s actual willingness to pay for anything.



Finally, in many of its Obama‐​era greenhouse gas regulations, including the 2015 Clean Power Plan, which set guidelines for states to follow in ending electric utility generation from coal‐​burning power plants, the biggest EPA‐​calculated benefit of reducing greenhouse gas emissions was the lower Social Cost of Carbon (SCC). But those SCC estimates assumed that people are very limited in their ability to adapt to climate change. Recent work has proven this assumption to be fabulously wrong as indeed it had to be, since if humans could not adapt to differing climates, our species should have vanished with the onset of the Holocene, the Netherlands should not exist, and American settlers should have failed to establish agriculture on the Great Plains.



The only standards that EPA has seemed to apply consistently in doing cost‐​benefit analysis are to choose whatever approach generates the largest regulatory benefits and to obfuscate rather than fully disclose the uncertainty of its estimated benefits and the dependence of those estimates on certain, and often questionable, underlying methodological choices. EPA should issue regulations setting guidelines for how it will estimate both regulatory benefits and costs, specifying that certain methodologies—such as stated preference estimates from contingent valuation—will be disfavored as unreliable.



These regulations should also establish consistency in how EPA deals with wide variation and uncertainty in estimates. In the tailpipe rule, EPA did not use any empirical estimates of consumers’ revealed market preference for increased gas mileage, explaining that it ignored those because there was too much variation in reported estimates. In getting an SCC estimate, by contrast, an Interagency Working Group generated an SCC estimate for EPA’s use despite enormous variation in estimated SCC—with estimates ranging from large negative SCCs, that is, net benefits from increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, to positive SCCs in the hundreds of dollars per ton of carbon dioxide. The Interagency Working Group reported SCC estimates from three models with particular assumptions—most importantly, assuming very limited ability to adapt to future climate change.



EPA should by regulation specify how it would treat uncertainty in estimated regulatory benefits: If some studies are to be given weight while others are ignored, EPA must clearly explain which general scientific principles determine the weighting choice. Only through such regulatory guidance can EPA end its practice of ignoring uncertainty when doing so allows it to choose studies that support large regulatory benefits and dismiss studies with very low estimated benefits that weaken the case for regulation.



A particular topic that EPA’s cost‐​benefit analysis regulations should address is how it will calculate the total benefits of reducing one pollutant—call it pollutant A—when the actions taken to reduce that pollutant also reduce the levels of another pollutant—call it pollutant B—that is also regulated directly. This is known as the “co‐​benefits” problem in cost‐​benefit analysis, with the co‐​benefits being the reduction in pollutant B that arise from regulations targeting pollutant A.



Take ozone as pollutant A and fine PM as pollutant B. EPA’s regulation on cost‐​benefit analysis should clearly specify that in calculating the total benefits from reducing ozone, side benefits from reducing fine PM should be counted in the cost‐​benefit analysis only if the reductions in fine PM—due to the reductions in ozone—have been credibly established to be over and above those achieved by regulating fine PM directly. If this is not done, and, for example, the benefits of regulations targeted at reducing fine PM directly are added as an indirect benefit of regulations targeted at reducing other pollutants, then benefits of reducing the other pollutants may be vastly overestimated. New EPA regulations should clearly set out that benefits from reducing pollutant B should be included as a co‐​benefit of reducing pollutant A only to the extent that reductions in pollutant B have been credibly established to result solely from the new regulation under consideration.



EPA’s rulemakings have increasingly been based on statistical analysis that has never been subject to rigorous testing and critique, and its cost‐​benefit analysis on oftentimes unreliable economic methods. The two rules proposed by EPA during the summer of 2018 can do much to restore the scientific and economic integrity of EPA regulations.

Then in the 1970s the sea ice at the Arctic recovered and the globe again struggled with bitterly cold and long winters. Immediately scientists issued dire warnings of a coming potential ice age, like Newsweek reported in 1974:

 Newsweek, April 28, 1974.
Later in the 1990s, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation had swung back to their warm phases and they reheated the planet, like a bathtub with hot water warms a bathroom. The global temperature jumped a half degree and the panic quickly switched, this time back to global warming and melting Arctic – just like we what we had seen in the 1940s and 50s. And this time environmental activists seized the opportunity and tried to blame it all on human CO2 emissions. The UN set up the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and governments worldwide committed trillions of our tax money to fight nature by holding profligate conferences and inventing schemes to control human behavior.

But then in the 2000s the planet unexpectedly refused to warm up further, which left many scientists stumped and clueless. Finally over the last years, signs of a cooling planet have been mounting and becoming impossible to deny. Today we see the first scientists bolting for the back door. Just yesterday renown climate scientist Professor Mike Lockwood of Reading University told the world through the BBC that we are possibly looking at “a new mini ice age“.
It’s back to global cooling – climate science is now going back 40 years to the headlines of the 1970s!
So quickly are they able to turn on a dime.
If anything has become clear since the release of the IPCC 5th Assessment Report released last month, it is that climate science has collapsed into a state of complete confusion. It is very clear that they now have no idea where the climate is headed and never before has the science found itself in such a state of open dispute.
Politicians take note!

Chairman Gallegly, Ranking Member Lofgren, and members of the Subcommittee, thank you for inviting the Cato Institute to testify today on the subject of worksite enforcement of U.S. immigration law. The Cato Institute is a non‐​profit, non‐​partisan educational institution dedicated to promoting understanding of public policies based on the principles of individual liberty, free markets, and limited, Constitutional government. As the director the Institute’s Center for Trade Policy Studies, I’ve been researching and writing about trade and immigration policy since joining Cato in 1997.



All of us in this room share the policy goals of reducing illegal immigration, securing our borders against those who would do us harm, and creating jobs for U.S. workers through a growing economy. With those goals firmly in mind, I believe that focusing primarily on worksite enforcement will continue to be an expensive and damaging distraction until we reform our immigration laws to reflect the underlying realities of America’s 21st‐​century labor market.



Our policy of relying solely on enforcement of existing law to reduce illegal immigration has failed. This is true for both border and interior enforcement. Since 1992, the U.S. Border Patrol’s annual budget has shot up by 714 percent, from $326 million to $2.7 billion, while the number of Border Patrol agents stationed along the southwest border has grown five‐​fold, from 3,555 to 17,415.1 Meanwhile, since the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, U.S. employers have been subject to fines for knowingly hiring undocumented workers. Interior enforcement of those laws has waxed and waned and waxed again over the years. In the late 1990s, the Clinton administration raided hundreds of workplaces and detained thousands of illegal workers. More recently the Bush administration ramped up deportations in 2007 and now the Obama administration has rounded up and deported record numbers of illegal immigrants.2



Yet during two decades of more vigorous enforcement at the border and at the worksite, the number of illegal immigrants in the country has roughly tripled, from 4 million to 11 million. Imagine the complaints we would rightfully hear about a federal education program in which spending and personnel had grown dramatically, and yet the problem it was supposed to solve had gotten far worse. The right response would be to change our approach, not to keep throwing more money and personnel into a broken system hoping for a better result.



 **Economic and Demographic Realities Drive Immigration**  
Our enforcement‐​only approach is at odds with the underlying economic and demographic realities of our dynamic American economy. Low‐​skilled immigration to the United States, both legal and illegal, is driven by basic forces of demand and supply.



On the demand side, our economy continues to create hundreds of thousands of net new jobs each year that require only short‐​term, on‐​the‐​job training. Of course, the Great Recession of 2007-09 put a temporary halt to net job creation, but as our economic recovery and expansion continue, the long‐​term demand for low‐​skilled workers will continue to rise. According to recent projections by the U.S. Department of Labor, hundreds of thousands of net new jobs will be created during the next decade for home health aides, food preparation and serving workers, retail salespersons, landscaping and groundskeeping workers, and waiters and waitresses.4



At the same time, the number of Americans who have traditionally filled such jobs continues to shrink. American workers, on average, are becoming older and better educated and thus less willing to fill those jobs. The number of adult Americans in the work force without a high school diploma has dropped by 3 million in the past decade, and that trend will likely continue.5 According to projections by the U.S. Department of Labor, the number of workers age 16–24, another group that has traditionally filled less‐​skilled jobs, will shrink by 900,000 by 2018.6



Immigrants fill the growing gap between expanding low‐​skilled jobs and the shrinking pool of native‐​born Americans who would want such jobs. Immigrant workers enable important sectors of the U.S. economy to continue to grow and meet the needs of their customers. By facilitating the growth of such sectors as retail, agriculture, landscaping, restaurants, and hotels, low‐​skilled immigrants have enabled those sectors to expand, attract investment, and create middle‐​class jobs in management, design and engineering, bookkeeping, marketing and other areas that employ native‐​born Americans. 



More broadly, our nation is undergoing a demographic downshift with enormous implications. The 2010 Census figures that were just released show the slowest population growth in the past decade since the 1930s. Without immigration, our workforce would soon begin to shrink, reducing our potential economic growth and our weight and influence in the global economy. Without a steady, continuing growth in our workforce, it will be even more difficult to fund Social Security and Medicare payments to the army of Baby Boomers who are already beginning to retire. Immigration has played an important role in allowing our workforce to continue a healthy if slowing rate of growth. 



It may produce a good sound bite but it is misleading to assert that every low‐​skilled immigrant we can round up and deport will mean a job for an unemployed American. The real world economy doesn’t work that way. Low‐​skilled immigrants, whether legal or illegal, do not compete directly with the large majority of American workers. American companies hire immigrant workers to fill millions of low‐​skilled jobs because there are simply not enough American workers willing to fill those same jobs. The pay and working conditions for many of these jobs do not match the qualifications and aspirations of the large majority of Americans currently looking for employment in our recovering economy.



Consider the agricultural sector, in which an estimated 800,000 to 1 million undocumented immigrants work each year to harvest American crops. Does anybody seriously believe that if we could deport every one of those workers tomorrow, that a sufficient number of American workers would line up to take their place? It’s safe to say most of those jobs would go unfilled. If wages were hiked significantly, many of those jobs would simply disappear, most likely to be replaced by imported farm goods grown and harvested in other countries. 



Without immigrant workers, the most likely scenario is that we would simply produce less agricultural output as a nation. This would mean not only a direct loss of manual, on‐​the‐​farm jobs but a ripple effect of job losses in upstream and downstream sectors such as management, processing, packaging, distribution, and marketing. According to estimates from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, there are 3.1 related jobs off the farm for every job on the farm. Eliminating the on‐​farm jobs would put at risk many more jobs paying middle‐​class wages and employing native‐​born American workers. 



**Immigration and Employment**  
We cannot enforce our way out of unemployment. There is no causal relationship between inflows of immigration and higher overall unemployment in the U.S. economy. In fact, the causation usually runs the other way: immigrants tend to come in greater numbers during periods of low unemployment when jobs are plentiful, and the numbers tend to decline when unemployment rises. That is the main reason why the number of illegal immigrants in the United States has actually fallen by an estimated 1 million since 2007, according to the Pew Hispanic Center.7 Incremental changes in enforcement cannot account for such a sharp drop in the number of undocumented workers in the United States. The most plausible major explanation is the economic downturn in the U.S. labor market that began at the end of 2007 and persisted into 2010. 



When it comes to employment, immigrants complement the large majority of American workers rather than compete against them. Immigrants help to create job opportunities for native‐​born workers by starting businesses, attracting investment, and allowing important sectors of the economy to expand, creating opportunities higher up the skills ladder. 



It is an especially pernicious myth that low‐​skilled immigrants harm the employment prospects of African Americans. As with most other Americans, few African Americans compete directly with immigrant workers. In what was probably the most thorough economic study of U.S. immigration ever, the 1997 report of the National Research Council, titled _The New Americans_ , came to the conclusion that: 



None of the available evidence on spatial correlations suggests that in the aggregate the economic opportunities of black Americans are substantially reduced by immigration. … Some black workers have lost their jobs to immigrants, especially when they live in a place with a large concentration of immigrants. But the vast majority do not live in such places, and their economic opportunities are determined by other things.  
  
Those “other things” include the quality of education, local crime rates, and the overall business climate. I would humbly suggest to the Committee members that improving any or all of those other things would do far more to enhance the economic opportunities of American workers than beefed up worksite enforcement against the hiring of low‐​skilled immigrants.8



My own research at the Cato Institute shows that the growth of Hispanic immigration has not had a negative effect on lower‐​income African Americans. In fact, the evidence from the past 20 years shows that as immigrants have moved in, native‐​born Americans, including African Americans, have generally moved up. From 1994 through 2007, the number of illegal immigrants in the United States more than doubled, from an estimated 4.5 million to 11 million. During that same period, the number of African Americans living below the poverty line dropped by 1.6 million.



During that same period of rising low‐​skilled immigration, we also witnessed an encouraging decline in the number of adult Americans toiling without a high‐​school diploma. From 1993 through 2006, the number of adults 25 and older without a high school diploma declined from 32.1 million to 27.9 million, a fall of 4.2 million. That includes a drop of 1 million in the number of adult African Americans without a diploma.9 Clearly, rising numbers of low‐​skilled immigrants have not prevented African Americans from improving their skills and lifting themselves out of poverty.



Immigration itself may have helped to spur the advancement of millions of Americans to improve their employment prospects and earnings potential in the past two decades. The arrival of low‐​skilled foreign‐​born workers in the labor force increases the incentives for younger native‐​born Americans to stay in school and for older workers to upgrade their skills. 



Immigrants do compete directly with a small subset of American workers, typically those without a high school diploma. But the addition of low‐​skilled immigrants also expands the size of the overall economy, creating openings in higher‐​paid occupations such as managers, skilled craftsmen, and accountants. The result is a greater financial reward for finishing high school and for acquiring additional job skills. Low‐​skilled immigration motivates Americans who might otherwise languish in the underclass to acquire the education and skills necessary so they are not competing directly with foreign‐​born workers.



The large majority of economists across the political spectrum agree that immigration is good for our economy. It increases the incomes of the large majority of Americans while boosting overall economic growth. Evidence is growing that immigration has a modestly positive impact on the wages of the large majority of American workers, and a modestly negative impact on the small and shrinking minority of adult American workers without a high‐​school diploma. 



The 1997 National Research Council study concluded that immigration boosts the income of American workers overall by as much as $10 billion, but that it does slightly reduce the wages of the lowest skilled Americans. As the NRC concluded, “The weight of empirical evidence suggest that the impact of immigration on the wages of competing native born workers is small — possibly reducing them by only 1 or 2 percent.“10 More recent studies have confirmed this effect. For example, in a 2006 study for the National Bureau of Economic Research, Ottaviano and Peri estimated that immigration from 1990 to 2004 had reduced the wages of Americans without a high school diploma by 1 to 2 percent, while boosting the wages of the more than 90 percent of American adults with a high‐​school education by 0.7 percent in the short run and 1.8 percent in the long run.



Immigrants have a relatively small impact on the wages of native born workers for at least three major reasons: One, immigrants tend to bring a different set of skills and differing preferences for the kind of work they perform compared to native‐​born workers, which means immigrants are less easily substituted for their native‐​born counterparts. Two, by increasing the size the labor force, immigrants tend to boost the returns to capital, stimulating more investment in the economy and thus raising the productivity and wages of all workers, including the native‐​born. Three, for all the political hype over immigration, the number of immigrants and their output continue to be modest compared to the overall size of a U.S. economy that employs close to 150 million workers and produces more than $14 trillion in output a year.



 **The Economic Benefits of Legalization**  
Allowing more low‐​skilled immigrants to legalize would have a positive effect not only on the immigrants themselves but on native‐​born workers on the lower end of the skill ladder. We know from experience after the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act that newly legalized workers are more likely to upgrade their job and language skills, raising their productivity and wages. Legalized workers also enjoy more bargaining power in the marketplace, and are far more likely to be employed “on the books,” resulting in better pay. A 1996 Labor Department study found that real wages paid to undocumented workers were flat for most of the decade until 1987–88, but then rose 15 percent in the five years following legalization.11 Legalization means that native‐​born and legal immigrants are no longer required to compete with an underground labor supply. 



If anything, more aggressive enforcement against low‐​skilled immigration will arguably have a negative impact on our economy and the incomes of American households. Removing millions of low‐​skilled workers from our labor force through enforcement would impact our economy in a number of negative ways: It would reduce incentives for investment in the affected industries. It would reduce the relative job openings in more skilled positions in those industries, reducing employment for native‐​born Americans. Less investment and employment in the affected sectors would in turn reduce government revenue. 



A 2009 Cato study by Dixon and Rimmer estimated the economy‐​wide effects of enhanced border enforcement and interior enforcement, as well as different versions of legalization through immigration reform. The authors used a general‐​equilibrium model that they have developed for the U.S. Homeland Security Department, the U.S. Agriculture Department, and the U.S. International Trade Commission. In a study titled, “Restriction or Legalization,” Dixon and Rimmer estimated that more aggressive interior enforcement that resulted in a 30 percent reduction in low‐​skilled immigration to the United States would cause a drop in the incomes of American households of 0.45 percent — or $64 billion a year. In contrast, the same study estimated that immigration reform that allowed more low‐​skilled immigrants to enter the United States legally could boost the incomes of American families by $180 billion a year.12 A 2010 study by the Center for American Progress confirmed the magnitude of the potential gains, concluding that legalization would boost incomes by $189 billion a year once fully implemented.13



The best approach to reducing illegal immigration would be to expand opportunities for legal immigration while targeting enforcement against terrorists, criminals and others who continue to operate outside the system.



If foreign‐​born workers were allowed to enter the country through a safe, orderly and legal path, the number choosing to enter illegally would drop sharply. When given the choice of paying a smuggler $2,000, risking robbery and death in the desert, and living a shadowy existence in the underground U.S. economy, unable to leave and return freely to visit home, or entering the United States across a legal port of entry with legal documents, enjoying the full responsibility and protection of the law, and the freedom to visit home without fear of being denied re‐​entry, the large majority of potential entrants will choose the legal path.



We know from experience that legal immigration, if allowed, will crowd out illegal immigration. Here we can learn two valuable lessons from the _Bracero_ program, which allowed Mexican workers to enter the United States temporarily from 1942 to 1964, typically to work on farms in the Southwest. One lesson is that temporary workers should be given maximum mobility to change employers. The fatal flaw of the _Bracero_ program is that it tied workers to specific employers as a condition of the visa. This gave too much leverage to employers, resulting in abuses which lead Congress to shut down the program.



The more positive lesson from the _Bracero_ program is that, for all its shortcomings, it did provide a legal alternative to illegal immigration. Early in the 1950s, illegal immigration was widespread because the program offered an insufficient number of visas to meet the labor demands of a growing U.S. economy. Instead of merely redoubling efforts to enforce a flawed law, Congress dramatically increased the number of visas to accommodate demand. The result: Apprehensions of illegal entrants at the border soon dropped by more than 90 percent. Back then, as we could expect now, foreign‐​born workers rationally chose the legal path to entry when it was available. When the _Bracero_ program was abolished in 1964, illegal immigration began an inexorable rise that has continued to the present time.



Legalization would not necessarily mean a significant increase in the number of low‐​skilled immigrant workers in the U.S. economy, but instead the replacement of an undocumented workforce with a documented workforce. Legalization would allow the U.S. government to more effectively monitor and manage who was entering the United States for employment. Although the number of immigrant workers is ultimately determined by demand in the labor market, the federal government could regulate the number of visas depending on the unemployment rate and the business cycle. One tool of regulation could be changing visa fees to better match the supply of temporary foreign‐​born workers with domestic demand. 



A program of legalization would transform the enforcement debate. Instead of wasting resources in a futile effort to root out millions of low‐​skilled immigrant workers who are productively contributing to our nation’s economy, we could focus our enforcement efforts on apprehending terrorists and other real criminals. Large‐​scale illegal immigration will end only when America’s immigration system offers a legal alternative consistent with the underlying realities of our labor market.

The Thai people have voted. The crony populists decisively defeated the establishment thugs. It probably was the best outcome among imperfect choices.



Thailand has been in various stages of political crisis for years. The only good news is that while Thailand is Southeast Asia’s second‐​largest economy, even the worst political chaos there affects no vital American interest. Long‐​term stability will come only if the country’s ruling elite is willing to cede power to the disaffected and heretofore neglected rural majority.



The Thai monarchy was made famous by _The King and I_ and lost its absolute power seventy‐​nine years ago. In recent years, parliamentary democracy and powerful army have uneasily coexisted: over the years there have been eleven coups, seven attempted coups, twenty‐​three military governments, and nine military‐​dominated regimes. Helping provide political stability was King Bhumibol Adulyadej, a widely revered figure able to call even military rulers to account.





It’s not evident that either side in Thailand’s bitter political conflict is willing to take a long view of their nation’s transformation from old to new.



This system is breaking down, however. The king is eighty‐​three and has been hospitalized since late 2009. The crown prince enjoys little of the respect accorded his father and some Thai citizens have proposed bypassing him for his sister or even jumping to one of his young sons.



Moreover, a decade ago a frustrated rural majority rallied behind billionaire Thaksin Shinawatra to overthrow the country’s cozy political establishment. Thaksin promised to share the wealth, winning elections — and, it was charged, growing wealthier himself — in return. He became prime minister in 2001, only to be ousted in a coup in 2006.



Unfortunately, King Bhumibol has been increasingly unable to intervene even if he was inclined to act. Worse, the courtiers surrounding him and the queen allied themselves with the military and other elites. The judiciary also was firmly in establishment hands, an important factor where political outcomes often are determined by judges.



With Thaksin living in Dubai to avoid prison, the military rewrote the constitution to restrict the power of elected officials — not to protect the people, like the original U.S. Constitution, but to safeguard the ruling coalition of royalists, businessmen, military officers, and bureaucrats. They relied on the misnamed Democrat Party as their political vehicle. However, Thaksin’s successor party won a plurality of seats in the 2007 vote and formed a coalition government.



The courts then disqualified a succession of pro‐​Thaksin parliamentarians, parties, and prime ministers on dubious charges — one of the latter, for instance, was ousted for being paid to host a televised cooking show. In contrast, the DP, which had not won even a plurality of the vote since 1992, received much kindlier treatment when charged with legal violations.



So‐​called “Yellow Shirt” demonstrators took over the prime minister’s office and international airport, demanding the government’s ouster and constitutional changes to disenfranchise the rural majority, and the army refused to restore order. Thailand’s strict lese‐​majeste laws were largely deployed against Thaksin supporters — there were 164 cases in 2009 alone — as establishment forces charged him with planning to downgrade the monarchy. (Even foreigners, including an American blogger and an Australian novelist living in Thailand, have ended up behind bars for mild or indirect criticism of things royal.) Behind the scenes the court and army pressured coalition partners to switch sides, finally turning the government over to the Democrat Party.



As largely urban dwellers, the Yellow Shirts had an obvious advantage in organizing protests. But in 2009 and 2010 Thaksin loyalists, known as Red Shirts, managed to fill Bangkok, first to disrupt an ASEAN summit and later to shut down much of the financial district. The military conveniently decided that this time public demonstrations threatened Thailand’s security and bloodily evicted the protestors. At least 91 people died and more than 1800 were wounded; opposition leaders were prosecuted and imprisoned.



Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva spoke of reconciliation while continuing to demonize the Red Shirts. Thaksin turned to his sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, to carry his banner for the Puea Thai Party in the July 3 election. She promised to increase the minimum wage, hike subsidies for the elderly, expand price supports, initiate tax relief and provide a host of other benefits. The normally more fiscally responsible DP responded accordingly, but populism lite offered little electoral appeal. Army chief Gen. Prayuth Chan‐​ocha staged a televised attack on the Puea Thai Party, but could not staunch the anger of Red Shirt activists.



The result was a decisive victory for 44‐​year‐​old Yingluck. Her party took 265 seats in a 500‐​member parliament, compared to just 159 for the DP. A party formed by the general who staged the 2006 coup won two seats.



Yingluck immediately moved to form a coalition with four smaller parties, giving her government nearly 299 seats. Strengthening her coalition makes it harder for opponents to again use the judiciary to win back political control. The electoral commission said it was investigating election violations which could lead to the disqualification of candidates — and no one expects an objective judgment.



The military promised to respect the election result. Defense Minister Prawit Wongsuwon said: “We are not going to intervene.” But leading officers disclaimed any interest in staging a coup before the last one. Activists opposed to Puea Thai’s victory have promised protests and in a majority of those polled by the Bangkok Post said they expect political violence in the future.



The putative prime minister faces an extraordinary challenge. The members of the frustrated and long‐​marginalized majority who voted for her expect a better future, even though her policies could wreck the government budget, business climate and national economy. Her brother hopes for an amnesty which would allow him to return home, a step which would enrage his opponents.



Dealing with the traditional ruling institutions accustomed to occupying the commanding heights of power likely will be even harder for Yingluck. Pavin Chachavalpongpun of Singapore’s Institute of South East Asian Studies observed: “I think one of her biggest challenges is how to build a working relationship with the elite, particularly the military.” Indeed, Christophe Archambault, who covered Thailand for 17 years for Reuters, warned that her tenure could be short: “The establishment is likely to resort again to Yellow Shirt mob violence, a judicial intervention, or even another coup to unseat her. That will tear Thailand further apart.”



There is much scuttlebutt about the potential of striking a deal or even having struck a deal before the election to protect the military from prosecution for the 2006 coup and last year’s crackdown on the Red Shirts in return for accepting a Yingluck government. One can imagine the appeal to the Thaksin forces of such an arrangement.



But the incoming prime minister’s ultimate objective should be to strip establishment institutions of their ability to effectively invalidate elections when they don’t like the results. One young voter declared: “It’s been a so‐​called democracy, not a real democracy. This time I’d like the majority to decide the winner. I really want democracy to decide the outcome.”



Of course, confronting thuggish elites requires a firm government hand, strong political base, and steely personal nerves. A similar process took years in Turkey, in which the so‐​called Deep State dominated by the military and other elites used the courts and laws protecting the image of Turkey founder Kemal Attaturk to maintain their influence irrespective of election results. A Thai government that demonstrates economic success would be far better positioned to undertake far‐​reaching political reforms.



There’s not much Washington, which urged the outgoing government to respect the election result, or anyone else can do other than counsel caution, patience, reconciliation and compromise. Thitinan Pongsudhirak of the Institute of Security and International Studies observed: “We must take the long view. This is not a two‐​year or a three‐​year exercise. We are talking about two or three decades of political maturation to come. It will be many years before we can reconcile the old order and the new order.”



It’s not evident that either side in Thailand’s bitter political conflict is willing to take a long view of their nation’s transformation from old to new. If not, the Thai people will need all the good wishes they can get to manage the future.

Ugly reality has dashed the high hopes of the “Arab Spring.” Although the dream of democratic reform lives on, only Tunisia appears on course. In Egypt, the fall of Hosni Mubarak has encouraged religious intolerance and persecution, especially against the Coptic Christian community.



Once a great civilization, Egypt long ago turned into an impoverished backwater. Only a large population and strategic location today deliver geopolitical importance. Hosni Mubarak ruled for three decades, but under him the Egyptian people enjoyed neither prosperity nor liberty. In fact, Mubarak was exhibit A for America’s foreign policy conundrum: stability or democracy? He held the Muslim Brotherhood in check, maintained a cold peace with Israel, and kept the Suez Canal open. For that he was richly rewarded with tens of billions in “foreign aid,” which he used to build an authoritarian kleptocracy — one that treated the needs of most Egyptians as an afterthought. Washington occasionally pushed for reform, but never too hard, lest stability be sacrificed.



Mubarak counted among his victims the Coptic Christians, who make up around ten percent of the population. They predate Islam, but today are a disadvantaged and increasingly threatened minority. Rather like Saddam Hussein and the Assad family, Mubarak seemingly cared little for religion. However, he left more room for Islamic extremists to act and compete for political support by victimizing religious minorities.



While the “government does not actively persecute or repress Christians, a prejudicial legal framework has created a permissive environment that allows Egyptian officials and private individuals to discriminate against Christians freely and with impunity,” noted Michele Dunne of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The U.S. State Department called the status of religious liberty in Egypt “poor.” State added that Christians and Baha’is faced “personal and collective discrimination, especially in government employment and their ability to build, renovate, and repair places of worship.”



Moreover, the regime “sometimes arrested, detained, and harassed” those “whose beliefs and/​or practices it deemed to deviate from mainstream Islamic beliefs and whose activities it alleged to jeopardize communal harmony.” Government‐​controlled media and government‐​funded mosques encourage violence. The authorities do little to stop the kidnapping of young Coptic girls, who then are forced to marry Muslims.



Converts are at particular risk. Despite some recent progress, the government traditionally refused to provide new identity documents to converts as well as Baha’is. Worse, noted William Inboden of the Strauss Center for International Security and Law, “Egyptian converts from Islam to Christianity, though very few in number, suffered particularly heinous treatment — including imprisonment and sadistic torture.”



Equally disturbing, noted the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, “violence targeting Coptic Orthodox Christians remained high.” But the Mubarak government rarely punished the attackers. Indeed, International Christian Concern noted that it was common for the government to arrest “Coptic victims alongside the perpetrators of the violence.”



Even when the Copts did not end up behind bars, they did not receive justice. State explained that the Mubarak government sponsored “informal reconciliation sessions” which “generally prevented the criminal prosecution of perpetrators of crimes against Copts, precluded their recourse to the judicial system for restitution, and contributed to a climate of impunity that encouraged further assaults.”



No surprise, failing to exact a penalty for murder and mayhem has led to more murder and mayhem — or what the Hudson Institute’s Nina Shea called “pogroms and acts of terror.” The failure to punish the perpetrators, complained the Commission, “continued to foster a climate of impunity, making further violence likely.” Even more emphatic was Dina Guiguis of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, who told a recent congressional hearing that “the Egyptian regime is fully responsible for creating the fertile ground on which pernicious and egregious sectarian violence has become routine.”



Unfortunately, those who hoped the Egyptian revolution would better protect Christians and other religious minorities have been disappointed. To the contrary, violent attacks on Copts have been increasing.



As of last month 24 Christians had been killed, more than 200 had been injured, and three churches had been destroyed. Muslim mobs have beset Coptic churches, businesses, and homes. Well‐​armed thugs also attacked Christians who were protesting against the forgoing attacks.



No surprise, then, that few perpetrators have been arrested, let alone imprisoned. Noted Paul Marshall of the Hudson Institute: “as under Mubarak, the authorities’ refusal to punish attacks on Christians has led to more attacks.” The army even assaulted two Coptic monasteries, supposedly to enforce discriminatory zoning laws (which prohibited walls erected for protection from attacks).



Overall, the transition regime’s record is dismal. Noted the Commission: “Since February 11, military and security forces reportedly have used excessive force and live ammunition targeting Christian places of worship and Christian demonstrators. Implementation of previous court rulings — related to granting official identity documents to Baha’is and changing religious affiliation on identity documents for Christian converts — continues to lag. In addition, the government has not responded adequately to combat widespread and virulent anti‐​Semitism in the government‐​controlled media.”



Islamic extremists are responsible for what increasingly looks to be a campaign of intimidation. The World Evangelical Alliance’s Religious Liberty Commission explained that the attacks were “mostly incited by conservative Salafi Muslims,” who are using violence to mobilize Islamist support. Salafis also led opposition to the choice of a Christian to be governor of the Qena Governorate, leading to a suspension of the appointment, even though his predecessor was a Christian. Traditionally, the Salafis had remained aloof from politics, but no longer. Alas, they make the Muslim Brotherhood appear moderate.



Nina Shea fears “what we’re seeing in Egypt today — namely, a reinvigorated effort by some of the country’s more radical Islamists to establish Egypt’s identity as a thoroughly Islamicized and Arabicized state.” The Copts “are the most visible bloc standing in the way of impatient jihadists and violent Salafis,” who therefore are accelerating their attacks.



The future looks increasingly bleak. Although there has been some pushback — Muslims rallied to help rebuild one of the destroyed churches — the vast majority of Egyptians express intolerance towards minority faiths. And Copts, as well as other Christians, are feeling the pressure.



The _Wall Street Journal_ entitled one article: “As Islamists Flex Muscle, Egypt’s Christians Despair.” It quoted Ayman Anwar Mitri, who was attacked by Islamists who cut off an ear and burned his apartment: “they kept saying: ‘We won’t leave any Christians in this country’.” No one was punished for the assault. One Salafi leader warned ominously: “Only those Christians who did something wrong should be fearful.” Mitri said simply: “Here, there is a war against the Copts.”



Shea worries about “a mass exodus” of Copts from Egypt if existing trends continue. In fact, the Egyptian media has reported an upsurge in Copts seeking to emigrate. Coptic human rights lawyer Naguib Gabriel said: “They are insisting on leaving Egypt because the risks of staying here are too great.” Iraq offers an ugly precedent, with the practical destruction of the large historic Christian community, which also precedes Islam. Syria has become the refuge for many Iraqi exiles, who fear that the overthrow of Bashar Assad could unleash similar violence there. The status of Christians and other religious minorities is growing ever more precarious throughout the Arab and broader Islamic world.



For the first time the USCIRF recommended that Egypt be designated a Country of Particular Concern, which, if adopted by State, could lead to a variety of penalties. Still, Washington’s influence inevitably is limited. The Obama administration had no idea how to respond to Egypt’s upheaval, haphazardly offering support for Mubarak before exhibiting enthusiasm for the revolution — and its ever‐​changing stance had no effect on events on the street in any case.



Nevertheless, religious liberty should be part of the U.S. government’s official dialogue with existing regimes and revolutionary forces alike. Religious freedom is a bedrock form of human rights. This basic freedom of conscience acts as the proverbial canary in the mine. If peoples and governments are not willing to respect religious minorities, they are unlikely to tolerate political opponents. Religious extremism also acts as an efficient incubator for violence, including terrorism, as is increasingly evident in Pakistan. “There is no political vision to deal with these types of sectarian clashes,” admitted Emad Gad of the Cairo‐​based Al‐​Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies.



While Washington cannot impose tolerance on the new Egypt, American officials can point to the danger posed by virulent Islamists to that nation’s future. If the radicals grow in influence, they are likely to sweep away more than the vulnerable Coptic population. They might take down the new political system, with dangerous consequences for Egypt and beyond. As Georgetown’s Thomas Farr testified before Congress last month: “There will be no real freedom in Egypt — period — and there will be no real stability in Egypt — period — unless there is full religious freedom in Egypt, not only for its Coptic minority but also for moderate and reformist Muslim voices.”



The Arab Spring risks turning into the Islamist Winter. The willingness to safeguard religious liberty has become a proxy for measuring the impact of the ongoing revolution. As go the Copts may ultimately go the rest of the Middle East.

It is a rhetorical question, because you all know the answer. Either the baby is wheeled out, or there is a puff piece on Jacinda Ardern. I waited for a baby pic on Friday, but this week has been so bad for the government, and for Jacinda in particular, that a baby photo was never going to cut it. Even Jacinda getting herself covered in baby poo was never going to cut it. This time, we need the big guns. This time, we need to be reminded how she might – please note MIGHT – be in line for a Nobel Peace Prize. 



Prime minister Jacinda Ardern, 39, is an unusual figure by American standards. Elected with little leadership experience two years ago, she is now “the most obvious candidate for a Nobel Prize,” says Kurt Campbell, a former assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs. 



She is likely to get the Nobel Peace Prize for hugging people? Is that all it takes nowadays? So, what this means is that Nobel Peace Prizes are given away in cornflakes packets. Before she is awarded anything, someone should consult the victims of the various Labour Party sex scandals, to see how they feel about it. 



Because, a year ago, at the UN General Assembly, Jacinda talked about how _#metoo_ should become _#wetoo_. How women should not have to put up with sexual assault. It was a powerful speech, but as we all know now, she didn’t mean a word of it. The victims of sexual abuse within the Labour party have been hung out to dry. Ignored, disbelieved, and told not to go to the police, they were assured that the Party would deal with the allegations, only for the Party to brush them under the carpet and find no case to answer. 



Are you seriously telling me that the leader of this Party might be in line for a Nobel Peace Prize? 



Seriously?



Well, Lally Weymouth of the _Washington Post_ thinks so. 



On the eve of her trip to New York for the first UN General Assembly meeting since the tragedy catapulted her to global renown, New Zealand’s Ardern chatted in her office with _The Washington Post’s_ Lally Weymouth about gun control, Chinese interference and whether she’d have a second child while in office. 



Have you ever seen so much media interference as happens around Jacinda Ardern? Why is it that, two years after her becoming prime minister, we are still reading articles about her ‘rise to power’ and the fact that she has had a baby? Did this happen with John Key? No, it didn’t because John Key, whose rise to power was far more meteoric than Jacinda’s, had one thing that she has never had. He had substance. 



When there is nothing positive that you can say about Jacinda’s time as prime minister, then you have no choice. You have to keep regurgitating the supposedly good stuff… that she won an election after being the Labour leader for only seven weeks (they did not win the election, if you remember, but if you say it often enough, it will become truth. Orwell called it “Newspeak”), and that she has had a baby. That is all there is. Really.



Q: You also created a gun buyback programme.



A: Yes, and it’s now brought in more than 17,000 semiautomatic and assault rifles. Over 70,000 banned parts have been returned as well. Initially, we said we were going to deal with the guns that we thought just weren’t necessary. That was done within 12 days. People now bring back their guns and acknowledge that it’s all about making New Zealand safer.



Yes, I feel really safe, knowing that responsible, licensed gun holders have given up their semi-automatic weapons while the gangs still hold whatever weapons they want. 



Q: Do you worry about China coming to dominate the Pacific Island states?



A: What dominates my concern with the Pacific Islands is climate change. That has been identified by the Pacific Islands themselves as their biggest regional security threat. Of course there is a debate about the presence of others in the region.



Yeah, don’t worry about Chinese influence in the Pacific, Jacinda. Climate change is the issue – where islands are disappearing because of abusing their own water systems and causing flooding and extreme water issues – is it? 



Q: Before the 2017 election, you weren’t the head of the Labour Party. Andrew Little, the leader, resigned shortly before the election and said you should take over.



A: Actually, I just told him no. I said he should stay, but he quit. I was already the deputy, and so I accepted the nomination to be party leader.



  
Yet here we are.



Jacinda is off to the UN next week, via Japan… no doubt to flirt with the All Blacks and have a few more photoshoots. There is no doubt, though, that her brand is tainted. I am not sure where exactly this will end, but her naivety and lack of substance is out there for all to see.



 _#metoo_ should be _#wetoo_? Ask the Labour Party sexual assault victims how exactly they feel about that.

"**The wearing of face masks in Jersey shops will be legally required from Tuesday at 10:00 GMT.**
Anyone older than 12 years old going into an indoor workplace as a customer must wear one, unless exempt for medical or disability reasons, the Government of Jersey said.
Failure to wear a mask could lead to a fine of up to Â£1,000.
The States Assembly voted to give ministers the power to introduce laws mandating masks on 24 November.
Mask-use will be compulsory in indoor public spaces which cannot guarantee physical distancing or other public health measures, including:
Mask exemption cards will be available for people whose health conditions mean they cannot wear them safely.
Application forms will be available online and in public locations, including parish halls, larger supermarkets and the bus station.
The law also includes a provision requiring passengers and drivers in taxis to wear masks, except where their use might impede safe driving.
This is also advised for car journeys involving people from different households, but is not required.
Masks remain strongly advised when close contact between people who do not live together is likely, particularly if it is likely to be for longer than 15 minutes, the government said.
Health minister Richard Renouf argued the law was needed to combat rising winter case numbers and the ""mixed success"" of the government's ""strong recommendation"" for indoor mask use.
He said: ""We are doing all we can to protect islanders and our health care system, while also keeping the island functioning as far as possible.""
Ministers have also been given the power to impose restrictions on gatherings of more than 10 people but ministers have not yet enacted this - current guidance suggests a limit of 10 for indoor gatherings.
An order to limit gatherings in the island in some capacity will be ""signed as soon as it is ready"", the government said."

You gotta hand it to startup, Sendle – they’re really ahead of the curve when it comes to corporate virtue-signalling. Most corporates wait until they’ve actually established a reputation before trashing it by getting woke and going broke. Not the bright young things at Sendle: they’re determined to hoist themselves on their own petard, right out of the gate.



Postal upstart Sendle is throwing down the gauntlet to its Goliath rival Australia Post, challenging the government-run giant to immediately go carbon neural in the midst of an “imminent climate emergency”…



Australia Post this month said it would move to offset emissions for parcel products sent through its Post Office and MyPost Business channels…In response, Sendle said it would offset the carbon emissions from all of Australia Post’s domestic parcels for one day – a volume estimated to be 1 million parcels – to coincide with the youth climate strike.



Well, of course, they are.



Naturally, too, no self-respecting millennial’s ignorant virtue-signalling is complete without a fawning reference to Swedish sour-faced know-nothing brat, Greta Thunberg.



“Greta Thunberg said it well, that we need to treat this like an emergency now,” he said.



Greta Thunberg also says she can see carbon dioxide. Greta Thunberg is an ignorant child.



But, as always, when they babble about “carbon neutral”, what these hypocrites really mean is that they’re going to be pumping out just as much of that evil, plant-feeding carbon dioxide as ever, they’ll just plough their investors’ money into dodgy green scams.



Sendle’s offsetting process involved the purchasing of carbon credits, and investing in environmental projects around the world designed to reduce future carbon emissions.



  
Will that include dispossessing poor African farmers to plant “biofuel” plantations? Or shipping American trees to burn in Germany as “biomass”?



If the slew of negative commentary on media articles about this latest display of corporate wokeness is anything to go by, this start-up may have spiked their guns spectacularly.

"Does the sky protect the Earth and if yes, then how? – Saskia, aged eight, Estonia. Thanks for the question, Saskia. The “sky” actually means everything above the Earth’s surface, including space. That’s why so many stars – like our own sun, but much further away – light up the night sky.  But in between our planet’s surface and outer space, there’s the atmosphere. The atmosphere is made up of gases, which do most of the hard work protecting the Earth as it goes around the sun.   Curious Kids is a series by The Conversation, which gives children the chance to have their questions about the world answered by experts. All questions are welcome: you or an adult can send them to curiouskids@theconversation.com – along with your name, age and place where you live. We won’t be able to answer every question, but we’ll do our best. Gases in the atmosphere like carbon dioxide, methane and water vapour trap some of the heat from the sun’s rays, which would otherwise go back out into space.   This keeps the Earth at a comfortable temperature, and prevents it getting too cold – like a giant greenhouse.  The Earth has always had these “greenhouse gases” in its atmosphere, but humans keep adding more and more, so the planet is warming up quicker than it would naturally. This has a big impact on life all over Earth, from the seas to the mountains.

      Curious Kids: how is global warming heating up the Earth?


 As well as greenhouse gases, the atmosphere also contains oxygen as a gas, which animal life needs to survive. Plants play a big role here, because they do photosynthesis – a natural process that helps them make food. During this process, they take in carbon dioxide from the air and let oxygen back out.  From ten to 50 kilometres above the Earth’s surface, you’ll find lots of a gas called “ozone”. Scientists call this the “ozone layer”, and it’s the Earth’s natural sunscreen.  The sun’s rays feel nice and warm, and in small doses they’re very good for us. But they also contain harmful ultraviolet (or UV) radiation, which is what gives you sunburn.  UV radiation can damage your skin, and even cause skin cancer – that’s why it’s so important to wear sunscreen when you’re outdoors.  The ozone layer protects us by absorbing a lot of the UV radiation from the sun’s rays, before they even reach Earth’s surface. But in the past, humans damaged the ozone layer by releasing chemicals which ate up some of this ozone, causing an “ozone hole”. Countries around the world agreed to stop releasing these chemicals about 40 years ago, and the hole in the ozone layer is now starting to close – though it probably won’t heal fully until 2050.  The atmosphere is also where weather happens – clouds, rain, lightning and storms all form in the atmosphere.  Without the atmosphere, rain would not reach many parts of the land, where plants and animals need it to survive, and farmers need it to grow food.  The Earth’s atmosphere also shields us from space rocks called meteoroids. Without the atmosphere, meteoroids would crash into the ground every day – and you can imagine how dangerous that would be.  But when a meteoroid starts falling towards Earth from outer space, it travels very quickly through the gases in the atmosphere, and this causes it to get very, very hot and shine brightly.  Most meteoroids burn up before they reach the surface. Those that don’t eventually hit the ground: these are called “meteorites” and they can tell us a lot about what’s in outer space.

If you’re sick of ‘woke’ corporations caving to the increasingly extreme demands of noisy far-left activists, you’re not alone. The Morrison government is putting corporate Australia on notice that it sorely needs to get back to its fulfilling its proper function: making money for shareholders, building the economy, and shutting the hell up about social issues.



Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister, Ben Morton, has lashed business for being seduced by “self-appointed moral guardians” and joining campaigns on social issues rather than on tax and industrial relations.



Mr Morton, who is driving Scott Morrison’s deregulation agenda, used a speech at an Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry event to attack the body for taking campaign advice from GetUp.



GetUp, like Sleeping ~~Bullies~~ Giants, are a tiny clique of leftists who use social-media astroturfing and rivers of dodgy cash to try and bully mainstream Australia into bowing to their extremist agendas, from climate change to LGBTQWERTY ‘rights’. Voters soundly rejected all but one of GetUp’s puppet candidates at the last election.



[Mr Morton] warned corporate leaders they should expect no favours from the government unless they were at the forefront of selling how business-friendly policies will improve the lives of “quiet Australians”.



“Last year I had some things to say about ACCI having the activist group, GetUp, address this summit on how to achieve campaign cut through. I think the expression is: That worked well, didn’t it?”



From Qantas’s endless virtue-signalling on gay marriage (a staggering hypocrisy, given Qantas’s partnerships with gay-hating Middle-Eastern countries), to the AFL hectoring its patrons about ‘wrongspeak’ or imaginary racism, too many corporates have fallen for the left-wing baloney about ‘corporate social responsibility’. Meanwhile, they neglect actual business issues.



Mr Morton said business had “too often” been on the frontline of social issues but “missing in action” on economic debates.



“Too often I see corporate Australia succumb or pander to similar pressures from noisy, highly orchestrated campaigns of elites typified by groups such as GetUp or activist shareholders,” Mr Morton said.



“Business should not be seduced by the noisy elites who try to bend business to their narrow viewpoints.



 **“I have an old fashioned view that business should act honestly and within the law, provide the best possible product or service, and maximise return to their shareholders.**



“So instruct your public affairs units. Instead of pretending you love paying tax or that you’re building electric cars rather than mining coal, or are in the solar panel rather than the oil or gas business, tell your employees and the quiet Australians in their communities – what you can do for them.”



  
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has also chimed in, warning them that the government wanted business “step up and focus discussions that led to better outcomes for workers and their families”.



 _The BFD_ has already written about [Harvey Norman’s rejection of diversity quotas](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/09/at-least-one-ceo-isnt-ready-to-get-woke-and-go-broke/), concentrating instead on the old fashioned business of actually making money rather than getting woke and going broke.



Former Business Council of Australia president and former Transfield chairman Tony Shepherd condemned business leaders who failed to concentrate on their core responsibilities, saying “this whole corporate social­ responsib­ility thing has got out of hand”.



“Companies should look after their employees, their customers, abide by the laws and they should care for the community in which they live in and operate. Harvey Norman are a great example.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’ve been going over and compiling the German reaction to the IPCC’s Summary Report for Policymakers, which tries to dismiss 15 years of global temperature stagnation and the fact that all its models have been wrong. There’s much to sort through.
If what I’ve seen so far is anything to go by, then from IPCC critics expect nothing less than an international tsunami of criticism and rebuttal in the days, weeks, and months ahead. The summary report itself is a disgrace.
Just one example reaction comes from the Baseler Zeitiung, which I wrote about in my last post.  The Baseler Zeitung commentary by its editor-in-chief Markus Somm is just a taste of what is coming from a large number of German scientists, journalists and leading skeptics.
IPCC AR5 SPM is a rank obscenity
In general these critics can’t believe that science could be so blind, flawed, and ideological. When it comes to science and the responsibilities therein, AR5 SPM is nothing short of a rank obscenity, and so it must be confronted accordingly.
In the days ahead NoTricksZone will be sorting through all the German reaction and bringing you reports about it. There’s no sense in blowing all the powder at once, even though it looks as if there’s going to be an infinite supply of it.
Stay tuned!

Boeing 747 Supertanker Very Large Air Tanker (VLAT) in action
AP labels the 2012 Colorado wildfires worst in state history in this story.
My friend and fellow climate skeptic, nationally syndicated radio host Lars Larson, asks some pointed and pertinent questions about what appears to be some of the most idiotic policy ever devised by government. Since we’ve been covering some of the folly of trying to link the fire to global warming, I thought this government folly with trying to put it out would go along with the issues discussed here. – Anthony
He writes in an email to me from Friday:
I have new questions rolling around in my head every day but there are at least four things I know for sure this morning.  This year the U.S. Forest Aervice will spend north of a billion dollars fighting forest fires across America.  Billions of dollars worth of trees owned by the American people will go up in flames.  And a $50 million dollar airplane that could put those fires out faster sits on the ground in Arizona because the U.S. Forest Service refuses to hire Evergreen Aviation.  Now you may be saying, “There must be a good reason”.  That’s what I thought, but then I remembered that government is capable of multibillion dollar stupidity on a daily basis.  The Forest Service offers no explanation whatsoever.  
And evergreen aviation points out that their 747 supertanker fire fighting plane has been hired by Mexico and Israel to fight fires and earned high marks.  It drops ten times as much water as the biggest forest service tanker in use…and does it at half the cost per gallon.  It’s big enough and fast enough to cover fires anywhere in America…and the forest service refuses to use it…and it’s your forests that are going up in flames.
Today’s statement from Evergreen Aviation about why the U.S. Forest service refuses to use its 747 flying supertanker firefighting plane.
http://www.evergreenaviation.com/pdf/Supertanker_Statement_062912.pdf
==========================================================

Date: 6/29/12
Evergreen International Aviation Statement Concerning the Supertanker
We felt compelled to release this statement due to the overwhelming amount of calls we have received concerning the availability of the Evergreen Supertanker. We at Evergreen are saddened by the fire devastation now taking place in many Western US states. For over 60 years, we have supported the US Forest Service in its important mission to battle and control fires, and it is our desire to continue this rich history of service. While our helicopters continue to work fires for the State of Alaska under State contracts, unfortunately, our Boeing 747 Supertanker Very Large Air Tanker (VLAT) aircraft awaits activation with the US Forest Service.
We have never been told why we have not been activated by the US Forest Service, so we can only speculate as to why we face this outcome:
1. We were offered a Call-When-Needed (CWN) contract a few years ago by the US Forest
Service (proving our technical viability), but we were never called into action resulting in
a multi-million dollar loss to our company as we were required to maintain and have
flight crew available should we be called. The only contract that will sustain a VLAT
program is an Exclusive-Use contract, which provides an income stream to sustain the
program even if the asset is not utilized. We invested over $50M to develop this asset in
the firm belief that we could better control fires as we proved in Israel and Mexico under
CWN contracts that we could afford to offer at the time.
2. There have been recent changes to the US Forest Service procurement policies. Today,
only small businesses are eligible for contract awards concerning air tanker assets;
Evergreen is not a small business and, therefore, is excluded from consideration for any
award.
3. The US Forest Service’s specification for Next Generation Air Tanker aircraft limits tank
size to 5,000 gallons. The Supertanker’s tanks hold about 20,000 gallons, which is
considered outside the USFS specification. The USFS just awarded contracts to four
small businesses with aircraft equipped with these smaller tanks, and excluded the
Evergreen Supertanker. Since World War II, tank capacities have been in the 3,000 to
5,000 gallon range, yet we continue to face the growing threat from mega fires today. We
believe the Supertanker represents an overwhelming response to this growing threat.
Please contact your state representatives in Washington DC to demand an examination of their current procurement policies concerning VLAT aircraft. The US Forest Service says it best: “Only YOU can prevent wildfires.”

American policy in Central Asia is threatened by Pakistan’s slow surrender to extremism and violence. The growing mistreatment of religious minorities demonstrates that many of Pakistan’s problems are rooted in the spread of hateful and intolerant beliefs. The State Department should cite Pakistan as a “Country of Particular Concern” under the International Religious Freedom Act.



Islamabad is not the only U.S. ally that persecutes Christians, Jews, and other religious minorities. In fact, most Muslim states mix discrimination, repression, and persecution in varying degrees.



Saudi Arabia is essentially a totalitarian state when it comes to matters of faith. Much of the Christian community has been driven from the new Iraq, and Coptic Christians are coming under increasingly violent attack in Egypt. Among the worst persecutors is Iran, which has been actively brutalizing religious minorities.



But it is Pakistan, perhaps America’s most obvious “frenemy,” that best illustrates why religious persecution is a problem transcending national boundaries. Freedom of conscience, the essence of religious liberty, is a foundation for all other human rights.



A national community that refuses to even accept, let alone defend, those who believe differently is likely to become a source of intolerance, hatred, and violence — which may end up directed well beyond its own country’s boundaries. A government unwilling to protect individuals worshiping and serving their creator, both singly and collectively, is not likely to respect the life, dignity, and freedom of its citizens, and even less so people from other nations. Such a regime certainly will find itself ill‐​equipped to confront the very extremist forces it has previously, even if inadvertently, encouraged.



The ongoing disintegration of Pakistani society was dramatically illustrated by the assassinations of Punjab governor Salman Taseer in January and Religious Minorities minister Shahbaz Bhatti in March. Taseer was a Muslim who opposed the religious parties and denounced Pakistan’s blasphemy law. Bhatti, known internationally, also opposed the blasphemy laws and said he was “speaking for the oppressed, marginalized and persecuted Christians and other minorities.” Although a few brave Pakistanis embraced the two men in death, many more, including in Taseer’s own ruling Pakistan People’s Party, stayed silent while extremists praised the murderers.



In such an environment, it should surprise no one to find official support for al‐​Qaeda and other terrorists. While civilian members of the Pakistani government may have had no idea about Osama bin Laden’s presence on Pakistani soil, it beggars belief that members of the military and Inter‐​Services Intelligence (ISI) agency did not know, and did not aid him. A poll last year found that some 60 percent of Pakistanis viewed America as an enemy. Rank‐​and‐​file military attitudes seem little different.



Much of America’s unpopularity results from Washington’s policies. The war in Afghanistan and especially drone attacks in Pakistan have created growing popular hostility.



But the spread of Islamic extremism has created an environment in which violence naturally flourishes. Even if those willing to strike remain a minority, they increasingly receive warm support from religious and other leaders.



In Pakistan, the social environment is toxic. The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom reported that “Pakistan continues to be responsible for systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of freedom of religion or belief.” The Commission pointed to the blasphemy laws which, along with “other religiously discriminatory legislation, such as the anti‐​Ahmadi laws, have created an atmosphere of violent extremism and vigilantism.”



The State Department’s assessment of religious liberty is equally blunt. Noted State: “Security forces and other government agencies did not adequately prevent or address societal abuse against minorities. Discriminatory legislation and the government’s failure or delay in addressing religious hostility by societal actors fostered religious intolerance, acts of violence, and intimidation against religious minorities.”



Both the Commission and State emphasize the blasphemy laws as a particular problem. Not uncommon around the world, the laws have become a particularly threatening tool of persecution against non‐​Muslims in Pakistan.



In a detailed study released last year, Freedom House concluded: “Although many other countries have laws against blasphemy, the situation in Pakistan is unique in its severity and its particular effects on religious minorities.” The extremist Jamiat Ulema‐​e‐​Islam party has even proposed banning the Bible as “blasphemous.”



The majority of those prosecuted for blasphemy are Muslim, but the law is disproportionately deployed against Christians, who also often find themselves targets of vigilante violence. At least 35 Christians charged with blasphemy have been murdered since 1986. “Many others have endured brutal rapes and beatings, while churches, homes and businesses have been ransacked, looted and burned,” added author Lela Gilbert.



Unfortunately, even before the Taseer and Bhatti murders, the situation in Pakistan was deteriorating. Last November the State Department declared: “the number and severity of reported high‐​profile cases against minorities increased” and “organized violence against minorities increased.”



The Commission only last month released its latest assessment: “The religious freedom situation in Pakistan deteriorated greatly during the reporting period.” Despite taking some positive steps, the Zardari government, added the Commission, “has failed to reverse the erosion in the social and legal status of religious minorities and the severe obstacles the majority Muslim community faces to the free discussion of sensitive religious and social issues.”



International Christian Concern, which placed Pakistan in its “Hall of Shame,” noted that Islamabad “absolutely refuses to progress toward a religiously free society.” Or a free society in any other way.



Washington obviously can do little to transform internal Pakistani affairs. But U.S. officials should make this toxic human environment an issue for bilateral discussion. The best way to do so would be to designate Pakistan as a Country of Particular Concern, which is warranted under U.S. law when there are “systematic, ongoing, and egregious” violations of religious liberty “engaged in or tolerated” by the relevant government.



A CPC rating requires State to act, such as imposing sanctions, or at least grant a waiver. Even in the latter case the designation should spark an ongoing dialogue and create a continuing threat of action at a time when many Americans, including congressmen, wonder why the U.S. continues to provide Pakistan with billions of dollars annually in foreign aid.



Pakistan’s geopolitical importance inevitably inclines State against holding Islamabad accountable for its dangerous religious climate. The Bush administration made political accommodations in applying the CPC label. However, Pakistan’s very centrality to U.S. policy makes the internal situation especially threatening for Americans as well as Pakistanis. Today the ministries of education and information may be almost as important as those of defense and foreign affairs.



Unless the current government confronts those promoting intolerance, moderate Muslims may vanish along with Christians. Three leading Pakistani Christian leaders issued a statement after Shahbaz Bhatti’s death: “We would also like to appeal to the federal and provincial governments to wake up to the challenge of protection of the citizens of Pakistan. If the country becomes a killing field of the democrat and liberal individuals who exercise their freedom of conscience and expression, it would embolden the criminals trying to take charge of the country.”



If the government is taken over by such “criminals” — or, more specifically, extremists advocating the use of violence — the U.S. and Pakistan risk moving from informal frenemies to formal enemies. The principal concern is not military cooperation in Afghanistan, which America should leave sooner rather than later. The primary issue is a nuclear‐​armed state in the hands of those shaped by a system that celebrates intolerance and murder.



Washington should do its utmost to avoid such a clash. Angering Islamabad today by raising the pressure through a CPC designation today might prove to be the best means to prevent a crisis in relations tomorrow.

The first press release announcement thread is getting big and unwieldy, and some commenters can’t finish loading the thread, so I’m providing this one with some updates.
1. Thanks to everyone who has provided widespread review of our draft paper. There have been hundreds of suggestions and corrections, and for that I am very grateful.  That’s exactly what we hoped for, and can only make the paper better.
Edits are being made based on many of those suggestions. I’ll post up a revised draft in the next day.
2. Some valid criticisms have been made related to the issue of the TOBS data. This is a preliminary set of data, with corrections added for the “Time of Observation” which can in some cases result in double max-min readings being counted if not corrected for. It makes up a significant portion of adjustments prior to homogenization adjustments as seen below in this older USHCN1 graphic. TOBS is the black dotted line.


TOBS is a controversial adjustment. Proponents of the TOBS adjustment (Created by NCDC director Tom Karl) say that it is a necessary adjustment that fixes a known problem, others suggest that it is an overkill adjustment, that solves small problems but creates an even larger one. For example, from a recent post on Lucia’s by Zeke Hausfather, you can see how much adjustments go into the final product.

The question is: are these valid adjustments? Zeke seems to think so, but others do not.  Personally I think TOBS is a sledgehammer used to pound in a tack. This looks like a good time to settle the question once and for all.
Steve McIntyre is working through the TOBS entanglement with the station siting issue, saying “There is a confounding interaction with TOBS that needs to be allowed for…”, which is what Judith Curry might describe as a “wicked problem”. Steve has an older post on it here which can be a primer for learning about it.
The TOBS issue is one that may or may not make a difference in the final outcome of the Watts et al 2012 draft paper and it’s conclusions, but we asked for input, and that was one of the issues that stood out as a valid concern. We have to work through it to find out for sure. Dr. John Christy dealt with TOBS issues in his paper covered on WUWT: Christy on irrigation and regional temperature effects
Irrigation most likely to blame for Central California warming
A two-year study of San Joaquin Valley nights found that summer nighttime low temperatures in six counties of California’s Central Valley climbed about 5.5 degrees Fahrenheit (approximately 3.0 C) between 1910 and 2003. The study’s results will be published in the “Journal of Climate.”
Most interestingly, John Christy tells me that he had quite a time with having to “de-bias” data for his study, requiring looking at original observer reports and hand keying in data.
We have some other ideas. And of course new ideas on the TOBS issue are welcome too.
In other news, Dr. John Christy will be presenting at the Senate EPW hearing tomorrow, for which we hope to provide a live feed. Word is that Dr. Richard Muller will not be presenting.
Again, my thanks to everyone for all the ideas, help, and support!
=============================================================
UPDATE: elevated from a comment I made on the thread – Anthony

Why I don’t think much of TOBS adjustments
Nick Stoke’s explanation follows the official explanation, but from my travels to COOP stations, I met a lot of volunteers who mentioned that with the advent of MMTS, which has a memory, they tended not to worry much about the reading time as being at the station at a specific time every day was often inconvenient.. With the advent of the successor display to the MMTS unit, the LCD display based Nimbus, which has memory for up to 35 days (see spec sheet here http://www.srh.noaa.gov/srh/dad/coop/nimbus-spec.pdf) they stopped worrying about daily readings and simply filled them in at the end of the month by stepping through the display.
From the manual http://www.srh.noaa.gov/srh/dad/coop/nimbusmanual.pdf
Daily maximum and minimum temperatures:
· Memory switch and [Max/Min Recall] button give daily
highs and lows and their times
The Nimbus thermometer remembers the highs and lows for
the last 35 days and also records the times they occurred. This
information is retrieved sequentially day by day. The reading
of the 35 daily max/min values and the times of occurrence (as
opposed to the “global” max/min) are initiated by moving the
[Memory] switch to the left [On].
So, people being people, rather than being tied to the device, they tend to do it at their leisure if given the opportunity. One fellow told me (who had a Winneabago parked in is driveway) when I asked if he traveled much, he said he “travels a lot more now”. He had both the CRS and MMTS/Nimbus in his back yard. He said he traveled more now thanks to the memory on the Nimbus unit. I asked what he did before that, when all he had was the CRS and he said that “I’d get the temperatures out of the newspaper for each day”.
Granted, not all COOP volunteers were like this, and some were pretty tight lipped. Many were dedicated to the job. But human nature being what it is, what would you rather do? Stay at home and wait for temperature readings or take the car/Winnebago and visit the grand-kids? Who needs the MMTS ball and chain now that it has a memory?
I also noticed many observers now with consumer grade weather stations, with indoor readouts. A few of them put the weather station sensors on the CRS or very near it. Why go out in the rain/cold/snow to read the mercury thermometer when the memory of the weather station can do it for you.
My point is that actual times of observation may very well be all over the map. There’s no incentive for the COOP observer to do it at exactly the same time every day when they can just as easily do it however they want. They aren’t paid, and often don’t get any support from the local NWS office for months or years at a time. One woman begged me to talk to the local NWS office to see about getting a new thermometer mount for her max/min thermometer, since it wouldn’t lock into position properly and often would screw up the daily readings when it spun loose and reset the little iron pegs in the capillary tube.
Some local NWS personnel I talked to called the MMTS the “Mickey Mouse Temperature System” obviously a term of derision. Wonder why?
So my point in all this is that NWS/NOAA/NCDC is getting exactly what they paid for. And my view of the network is that it is filled with such randomness.
Nick Stokes and people like him who preach to us from on high, never leaving their government office to actually get out and talk to people doing the measurements, seem to think the algorithms devised and implemented from behind a desk overcome human urges to sleep in, visit the grand-kids, go out to dinner and get the reading later, or take a trip.
Reality is far different. I didn’t record these things on my survey forms when I did many of the surveys in 2007/2008/2009 because I didn’t want to embarrass observers. We already had NOAA going behind me and closing stations that were obscenely sited that appeared on WUWT, and the NCDC had already shut down the MMS database once citing “privacy concerns” which I ripped them a new one on when I pointed out they published pictures of observers at their homes standing in front of their stations, with their names on it. For example: http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/coop/newsletters/07may-coop.pdf
So I think the USHCN network is a mess, and TOBS adjustments are a big hammer that misses the mark based on human behavior for filling out forms and times they can’t predict. There’s no “enforcer” that will show up from NOAA/NWS if you fudge the form. None of these people at NCDC get out in the field, but prefer to create algorithms from behind the desk. My view is that you can’t model reality if you don’t experience it, and they have no hands on experience nor clue in my view.
More to come…

The next major conflict will be held within 500km of the closest charging point and designated safe-space. Well, I presume that will be the case since the British Army has declared that they are going to switch to EVs to attract eco-friendly climate warriors as recruits.



Calling on British industry to lead the way on developing new sources of energy for the military, he added: “The challenge, and genuine commercial opportunity, is to aim high and lead the world in the development of military equipment which is not only battle-winning but also environmentally sustainable.



“That gives the British Army considerable operational benefits, such as reducing our logistical drag, and also puts the Army […] on the right side of the environmental argument, especially in the eyes of that next generation of recruits that increasingly make career decisions based on a prospective employer’s environmental credentials.”



  
Delingpole, as expected, rips into this:



There is so much stupid here that it is hard to know where to begin.



On the recruitment front, it surely ought to be obvious to almost anyone apart from this wooden-topped Rupert – with his lower second class university degree – that bunny-hugging eco-loons are the very last people ever to want to join the Army. The only thing that might change their dope-addled minds is if it redesignated itself the Peace Corps and renounced its combat role altogether. But that might leave an awkward gap in Britain’s defence capabilities.



Then again, what kind of loon would even want to join a military so careless of its proper purpose that it apparently puts more value on green virtue-signalling than it does on operational effectiveness?



There is currently no renewable energy source that could conceivably power the Army’s military equipment – nor is there likely to be any time soon.



Young men and women prepared to risk their lives for their country need to know that in return, their country is going to do its level best to ensure that they go into battle with best equipment for the job.



Once you start prioritising other goals — appeasing Mother Gaia; trying to get friendly write-ups from the Guardian and the BBC; trying to persuade recruits that war has more to do with saving polar bears than killing the enemy — then you send a very clear message to the taxpayers who fund you: we incapable of defending you properly. And an even clearer message to the enemy: we are not serious so please, walk all over us. […]



All our enemies will now have to do is wait for our tanks to trundle forward for a few miles, maybe leave it till darkness has fallen – then strike the moment their solar batteries have run out.



  
Maybe all the war documentaries and movies that I have seen have painted a false picture? Obliterating a location with bombs, waving flamethrowers about and generally devastating the opponent’s territory has never seemed to be a “battle-winning but also environmentally sustainable” pursuit.



What would a lithium powered tank look like after a hit from an RPG?

Share this...FacebookTwitterGlobal warming is not a religion, it’s a cult.
Peter Lilley’s commentary deserves broad attention. Here’s how he describes the global warming believers:
THE global warming doomsday cult is coming to an end. … Unfortunately, when doomsday forecasts fail, cult supporters don’t immediately give up. A US social scientist infiltrated a cult whose leader predicted the apocalypse would arrive on 21 December, as would a flying saucer to save her followers. When neither came on the appointed day, most of her followers, far from abandoning the cult, accepted their leader’s message that doom had been postponed and became even more fanatical. So it is with most merchants of global warming doom. Their models forecast that…

"**More than 3,000 fines have been issued by Welsh police forces for breaches of coronavirus since the start of the pandemic, new figures have shown.**
The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) said 3,028 fixed penalty notices were issued to people in Wales between 27 March and 16 November.
Dyfed Powys Police, handed out more than half of the fines in the country, with 1,759 notices.
Almost a third of all notices were given to people aged between 18 and 24.
Three-quarters of fines were issued to men.
Of the 3,022 fines in Wales, 2,215 of those related to breaking restrictions on movement.
This amounts to about 73% of all fines in Wales.
English forces issued just under 22,000 fines over the same period.
Elsewhere in Wales, North Wales Police issued 582 fines, South Wales Police gave out 425 and Gwent Police 232. The British Transport Police issued 30.
Over the weekend, South Wales Police was granted extra powers to check for coronavirus breaches in Cardiff.
The force said it stopped more than 200 cars coming into the city and issued eight fixed penalty notices, including to a couple from Essex who said they were dropping off Christmas presents.
It said it had given 69 fines in total over the weekend for various offences, including house parties.
The NPCC also said serious violent crime, shoplifting, vehicle crime and burglary were all lower compared to last year in the four-week period to 25 October.
Its chairman, Martin Hewitt, said: ""Crime is lower than at the same point last year, however the demand on the police service remains significant.
""Particularly during the month of December, officers and police staff will be working hard to tackle crime, keep communities safe, and play our part in reducing the spread of coronavirus.
""We encourage the public to follow the rules in place for their part of the country, and to remain vigilant as shops begin to open again in time for Christmas as criminals may seek to exploit opportunities to commit crime."""

The Hill reports:
A former Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) official who resigned earlier this year for comparing his work to crucifixion has found new employment with a leading green group.
The Sierra Club on Friday announced that Al Armendariz would be joining the group’s “Beyond Coal” campaign next month as a senior representative.
“As a third generation Texan, I’m proud to be taking on this new role to help protect Texas,” Armendariz said in a statement released by Sierra Club.
…
Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.), who released the video of the meeting, mockingly offered his congratulations to Armendariz on Friday.  
“Dr. Armendariz follows numerous Obama administration officials who have come from or moved to radical left and green groups,” Inhofe said in a statement. “It’s as if there is a revolving door between the White House and organizations such as the Sierra Club.”
“At least at the Sierra Club he won’t get into so much trouble for telling the truth that their true agenda is to kill oil, gas and coal,” he added.
=========================================================

You may remember this guy and what he said in that video:
“But as I said, oil and gas is an enforcement priority, it’s one of seven, so we are going to spend a fair amount of time looking at oil and gas production. And I gave, I was in a meeting once and I gave an analogy to my staff about my philosophy of enforcement, and I think it was probably a little crude and maybe not appropriate for the meeting but I’ll go ahead and tell you what I said. It was kind of like how the Romans used to conquer little villages in the Mediterranean. They’d go into a little Turkish town somewhere, they’d find the first five guys they saw and they would crucify them. And then you know that town was really easy to manage for the next few years. And so you make examples out of people who are in this case not compliant with the law. Find people who are not compliant with the law, and you hit them as hard as you can and you make examples out of them, and there is a deterrent effect there. And, companies that are smart see that, they don’t want to play that game, and they decide at that point that it’s time to clean up. And, that won’t happen unless you have somebody out there making examples of people. So you go out, you look at an industry, you find people violating the law, you go aggressively after them. And we do have some pretty effective enforcement tools. Compliance can get very high, very, very quickly. That’s what these companies respond to is both their public image but also financial pressure. So you put some financial pressure on a company, you get other people in that industry to clean up very quickly. So, that’s our general philosophy.”
The Sierra Club should be ashamed for hiring this man. But, then again, given their behavior, we’ve seen they don’t seem to have any shame at all.

"**Jersey has seen a ""surge"" of 84 new Covid-19 cases since Friday, according to the latest figures.**
This takes the island to 247 active infections, nearly three quarters of which are symptomatic.
Further public health measures and guidance are now due to follow the introduction of mandatory masks use in shops from Tuesday.
The updated government advice suggests islanders work from home where possible.
Those over the age of 70 will be advised to avoid socialising indoors with people they do not live with.
Public health officials explained the changes were needed as the island was experiencing ""complex, multiple clusters"" and a rise which cannot be attributed to a particular event.
More than 2,000 people, nearly 2% of Jersey's population, are isolating as a result of contact tracing, Chief Minister John Le Fondre confirmed.
The full list of measures to be introduced include:
Senator John Le Fondre said: ""This surge in cases is not down to one cluster.
""Health officials are seeing case clusters on a larger scale, and we are worried that the number of positive cases being picked up may indicate an increase in hospitalisation as we move forward.
""In the coming weeks we will see large numbers of returning students, family members and friends visiting for Christmas and enhanced social activity.
""Action is needed now to protect the vulnerable, to identify more cases earlier on and to slow the spread.""
Health Minister Richard Renouf said: ""If this doesn't bring down the numbers of positive cases we may, ultimately, have to move to another lockdown.""
""That's something none of us want to see,"" he added."
"A new form of politics is gaining steam as a solution to the climate crisis. Six parliamentary committees in the UK are to commission a citizens’ assembly, in which randomly selected citizens will consider how to combat climate breakdown and achieve the pathway to net zero emissions.  This unexpected move complements increasing experimentation with assemblies across the world. Having struggled to realise necessary action on climate breakdown through traditional routes, citizen assemblies could well help governments kick-start the tough but urgently needed steps to safeguard a healthy and stable world. In a nutshell, these assemblies bring together 50 or more citizens over a number of days or weeks to learn about a particular policy challenge, deliberate together and recommend how to deal with it. Citizens are selected to reflect the demographic diversity of the population. The process is typically facilitated by an independent and apolitical organisation, which brings in experts across a wide range of disciplines, as well as competing interest groups and the voices of those personally affected by the issue in question.  A growing evidence base suggests that this form of participatory politics works. The balanced and structured process of deliberation results in more informed preferences. A requirement to justify opinions, for example, counteracts the bias of prior beliefs. Opinions tend to be neither polarised nor uniform, with participants developing increased respect and understanding for opposing viewpoints. Such a respectful and deliberative context gives rise to considered judgements that can cut through political deadlock on even the most complex and contentious issues. Most famously, Ireland used such an assembly to decide on the constitutional status of abortion. Bridging charged emotions on both sides, the assembly confidently recommended liberalisation, which was backed by a national referendum and enshrined into law. Evidence from citizens’ assemblies and similar deliberative processes suggests that the broader public have confidence in the judgements of such bodies, especially when compared to traditional political institutions. This is true even of populist-minded voters, who appreciate that decisions are being made by citizens like themselves. As a particularly politically divisive issue, citizens’ assemblies could be vital in uniting populations around the challenges of responding to the climate breakdown – but the devil is in the detail. Past assemblies offer valuable lessons in how they can most effectively address the climate emergency. Ireland is the only country to have already run a national citizens’ assembly that addressed climate breakdown. The assembly considered a wide and diverse range of issues from transport to peat extraction – but only had two weekends to do so. This was not enough time to consider these challenges in depth, and made it easier for the government to drop more controversial proposals, such as the significant reduction of agricultural emissions. Given the diverse areas of policy that the climate crisis cuts across, it would be a herculean task for a single assembly to deal with. The amount of time it would take to consider issues in enough depth would place excessive demands on the selected citizens. Aspects of the climate crisis can be treated individually, as successful citizen assemblies and other similar deliberative models in the US, Australia, Canada, and the Polish city of Gdansk have shown. An alternative would be to run separate assemblies in parallel, each considering a digestible chunk of the agenda, with time set aside for assemblies to coordinate with each other when cross-cutting issues emerge. This has never been done before, but nor have humans ever encountered a problem of the scale of climate breakdown.  More radically, citizens’ assemblies on the climate emergency may need to be empowered to make binding decisions, not just advisory recommendations. Politicians are in a bind: they know that they need to act, but are constrained by their concerns over a public backlash and vested social and economic interests that profit from the status quo. Radical policy suggestions emerging from these assemblies are likely to be watered down – as may have been the case in Ireland, whose strong agricultural lobby cannot be ignored. Empowering assemblies could break political deadlocks on climate. In Poland for example, activist Marcin Gerwin successfully persuaded city mayors to implement any decision supported by 80% of an assembly, with the mayor having discretion when support is below that threshold. Resulting changes have for instance helped the city respond faster to severe flooding. Social movement Extinction Rebellion has been quick to criticise the proposed assembly in the UK for lacking such power. As it stands, the plans fall short of the direct action movement’s demand for a citizens’ assembly to have authority to tackle both the climate and biodiversity emergencies.  But the UK citizens’ assembly on climate breakdown can be seen as a positive development. The details of how focused the task will be, including whether the assembly will be empowered to consider a more demanding transition than the government’s current 2050 target, are yet to be made public. Nor do we know how much time the assembly will have to deliberate. And while it is primarily structured to inform parliamentary committees, its high profile means it could make a real difference to climate policy. If successful, it may well give rise to the type of empowered citizens’ assemblies that bring the wisdom of citizens fully to bear on the climate and ecological emergency.

"Australian taxpayers should underwrite a massive expansion of the domestic gas industry – including helping open new fields and build hundreds of kilometres of pipelines – according to a group advising on Covid-19 recovery. A leaked draft report by a manufacturing taskforce advising the National Covid-19 Coordination Commission (NCCC) recommends the Morrison government make sweeping changes to “create the market” for gas and build fossil fuel infrastructure that would operate for decades. Its vision includes Canberra underwriting an increased national gas supply, government agencies partnering with companies to accelerate development of new fields such as the Northern Territory’s vast Beetaloo Basin, and states introducing subsidy schemes for gas-fired power plants. It says the federal government should help develop gas pipelines between eastern states and the north, and potentially a $6bn trans-Australian pipeline between the east and west, by either taking an equity position, minority share or underwriting investments. The taskforce, headed by the former Dow Chemical executive and current Saudi Aramco and Worley board member Andrew Liveris, positions lower-cost gas as the answer to building a transformed manufacturing sector that it says could support at least 85,000 direct jobs, and hundreds of thousands more indirectly. But it does not consider alternatives to gas, or what happens if greenhouse gas emissions are cut as promised under the 2015 Paris climate agreement. Gas is usually described as having half the emissions of coal when burned, though recent studies have suggested it could be more. The Liveris report does not mention climate change, Australia’s emissions reduction targets or the financial risk, flagged by institutions in Australia and overseas, of investing in fossil fuel as emissions are cut. While several assessments have found renewable energy backed by storage is likely now the cheapest option for new electricity generation, the report says gas is “key to driving down electricity cost and improving investment in globally competitive advanced industry”. Its focus is consistent with the NCCC chairman, Nev Power, a former Fortescue Metals chief and current board member at gas company Strike Energy, who has said in interviews that cheap gas would be critical to Australia’s future. Gas has been strongly backed by the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, who has argued for a gas-fired recovery from the pandemic. Emma Herd, the chief executive of the Investor Group on Climate Change, representing investors managing $2tn in assets, said the taskforce’s proposals could expose Australia to future economic shocks and billions of dollars in public and private sector investment being wasted as global markets moved to cut emissions. “With the commission now making recommendations for decades-long economic, energy and industry policy, it must be required to integrate Australia’s long-term climate change commitments under the Paris agreement and consider all net-zero emissions options for recovery,” Herd said. “With the flow of international capital increasingly swinging to renewable energy, greener industry and electrified transport, all options to capitalise on this potential investment must be fully explored.” Taylor was asked on Wednesday if he supported the idea, raised in an interview by Power with the Australian Financial Review, of a pipeline to bring gas from Western Australia to eastern states. He said people were getting ahead of themselves. “What I do support very strongly is a strong gas market in Australia. That means having strong pipelines and strong investments in pipelines, and a good network of pipelines around Australia to support that,” Taylor told the ABC. The NCCC did not directly respond to questions on whether it had considered alternatives to gas, and the basis for the taskforce’s claim that it was key to reducing electricity prices. A spokesman said its focus was currently on supporting businesses to reopen. He said the NCCC had liaised with more than a thousand stakeholders, including some with renewable energy expertise, and the manufacturing taskforce was one of several working groups it had set up. Options for economic recovery would be provided to government in due course. In the draft report, the taskforce says its recommendations on gas aim to correct “market failures of our current energy supply”. It says an expanded gas industry should work closely with a developing hydrogen industry and Australia could become a world leader in exporting hydrogen developed with renewable energy and gas. Other recommendations from the taskforce include: Considering tax incentives for priority gas infrastructure. Lifting remaining gas exploration moratoria in New South Wales and Victoria, and easing regulations in the Northern Territory to allow quicker access to new supply from the massive Beetaloo Basin. Using a reverse auction “contract-for-difference” scheme, such as that used for wind and solar in Victoria, for state governments to buy gas-fired power at lowest cost. Providing support, such as low-cost capital, for existing small and medium-sized gas companies to invest. Rapidly cutting regulations, described as “green and red tape”, to allow developments. Introducing gas reservation policies for the NT and east coast developments, as exist in Western Australia, to ensure not all gas is exported. On electricity generation, the taskforce says gas-fired power is central to more rapid adoption of renewable energy at lowest cost, and could contribute 10-15% of total generation as back-up for wind and solar as coal declines. If gas prices stay low, it says combined-cycle gas generation – a form of “baseload” power that the federal government has not backed as part of the future – would “likely expand significantly”. Its assessment that gas is necessary to support variable clean energy is at odds with the Australian Energy Market Operator, which last year listed pumped hydro, batteries and “demand-side participation” schemes, which offer energy users cash to cut down consumption when needed, as potentially cheaper alternatives. The government’s push for gas escalated as the price plunged from about $12 a gigajoule to about $4. Analysts have said future investment will in part depend on whether it can settle at about $6. The NCCC taskforce says a huge government emphasis on gas development could keep it at $4 a gigajoule in the long term, below what most assessments have considered likely. Bruce Robertson, an analyst with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said the government risked backing a losing industry. He said major gas companies were losing money, and consultants Rystad had found 67% of Australia’s discovered but undeveloped gas reserves were currently uneconomic. “Governments are not meant to back winners, but they’re certainly not meant to back losers,” he said. Morrison established the NCCC in late March to advise the government on non-health aspects of its pandemic response. Its terms of reference were not published until May, and it has a broad remit. Concerns have been raised about its lack of transparency and the absence of a conventional governance framework for a taxpayer-funded enterprise. A Senate inquiry into the Covid-19 response last week heard Liveris, who is considered a special adviser to the NCCC, was not subject to the conflict of interest declarations that other commissioners faced. The NCCC’s chief executive, Peter Harris, said the manufacturing taskforce was “appended to the commission” and the group was “set up in an informal manner”. He said he did not believe Liveris was being paid for his advice. Harris said it was unclear how the manufacturing group’s advice would progress through government decision making after being handed to the NCCC. Analyses before Covid-19 hit suggested the government was not on track to meet the 2030 emissions target, a 26-28% cut below 2005 levels, without using a carbon accounting loophole. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found global emissions need to fall 45% below 2010 levels by 2030 and reach net zero by about 2050 to give the world a chance of limiting global heating to 1.5C."

American policy in Central Asia is threatened by Pakistan’s slow surrender to extremism and violence. The growing mistreatment of religious minorities demonstrates that many of Pakistan’s problems are rooted in the spread of hateful and intolerant beliefs. The State Department should cite Pakistan as a “Country of Particular Concern” under the International Religious Freedom Act.



Islamabad is not the only U.S. ally that persecutes Christians, Jews, and other religious minorities. In fact, most Muslim states mix discrimination, repression, and persecution in varying degrees.



Saudi Arabia is essentially a totalitarian state when it comes to matters of faith. Much of the Christian community has been driven from the new Iraq, and Coptic Christians are coming under increasingly violent attack in Egypt. Among the worst persecutors is Iran, which has been actively brutalizing religious minorities.



But it is Pakistan, perhaps America’s most obvious “frenemy,” that best illustrates why religious persecution is a problem transcending national boundaries. Freedom of conscience, the essence of religious liberty, is a foundation for all other human rights.



A national community that refuses to even accept, let alone defend, those who believe differently is likely to become a source of intolerance, hatred, and violence — which may end up directed well beyond its own country’s boundaries. A government unwilling to protect individuals worshiping and serving their creator, both singly and collectively, is not likely to respect the life, dignity, and freedom of its citizens, and even less so people from other nations. Such a regime certainly will find itself ill‐​equipped to confront the very extremist forces it has previously, even if inadvertently, encouraged.



The ongoing disintegration of Pakistani society was dramatically illustrated by the assassinations of Punjab governor Salman Taseer in January and Religious Minorities minister Shahbaz Bhatti in March. Taseer was a Muslim who opposed the religious parties and denounced Pakistan’s blasphemy law. Bhatti, known internationally, also opposed the blasphemy laws and said he was “speaking for the oppressed, marginalized and persecuted Christians and other minorities.” Although a few brave Pakistanis embraced the two men in death, many more, including in Taseer’s own ruling Pakistan People’s Party, stayed silent while extremists praised the murderers.



In such an environment, it should surprise no one to find official support for al‐​Qaeda and other terrorists. While civilian members of the Pakistani government may have had no idea about Osama bin Laden’s presence on Pakistani soil, it beggars belief that members of the military and Inter‐​Services Intelligence (ISI) agency did not know, and did not aid him. A poll last year found that some 60 percent of Pakistanis viewed America as an enemy. Rank‐​and‐​file military attitudes seem little different.



Much of America’s unpopularity results from Washington’s policies. The war in Afghanistan and especially drone attacks in Pakistan have created growing popular hostility.



But the spread of Islamic extremism has created an environment in which violence naturally flourishes. Even if those willing to strike remain a minority, they increasingly receive warm support from religious and other leaders.



In Pakistan, the social environment is toxic. The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom reported that “Pakistan continues to be responsible for systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of freedom of religion or belief.” The Commission pointed to the blasphemy laws which, along with “other religiously discriminatory legislation, such as the anti‐​Ahmadi laws, have created an atmosphere of violent extremism and vigilantism.”



The State Department’s assessment of religious liberty is equally blunt. Noted State: “Security forces and other government agencies did not adequately prevent or address societal abuse against minorities. Discriminatory legislation and the government’s failure or delay in addressing religious hostility by societal actors fostered religious intolerance, acts of violence, and intimidation against religious minorities.”



Both the Commission and State emphasize the blasphemy laws as a particular problem. Not uncommon around the world, the laws have become a particularly threatening tool of persecution against non‐​Muslims in Pakistan.



In a detailed study released last year, Freedom House concluded: “Although many other countries have laws against blasphemy, the situation in Pakistan is unique in its severity and its particular effects on religious minorities.” The extremist Jamiat Ulema‐​e‐​Islam party has even proposed banning the Bible as “blasphemous.”



The majority of those prosecuted for blasphemy are Muslim, but the law is disproportionately deployed against Christians, who also often find themselves targets of vigilante violence. At least 35 Christians charged with blasphemy have been murdered since 1986. “Many others have endured brutal rapes and beatings, while churches, homes and businesses have been ransacked, looted and burned,” added author Lela Gilbert.



Unfortunately, even before the Taseer and Bhatti murders, the situation in Pakistan was deteriorating. Last November the State Department declared: “the number and severity of reported high‐​profile cases against minorities increased” and “organized violence against minorities increased.”



The Commission only last month released its latest assessment: “The religious freedom situation in Pakistan deteriorated greatly during the reporting period.” Despite taking some positive steps, the Zardari government, added the Commission, “has failed to reverse the erosion in the social and legal status of religious minorities and the severe obstacles the majority Muslim community faces to the free discussion of sensitive religious and social issues.”



International Christian Concern, which placed Pakistan in its “Hall of Shame,” noted that Islamabad “absolutely refuses to progress toward a religiously free society.” Or a free society in any other way.



Washington obviously can do little to transform internal Pakistani affairs. But U.S. officials should make this toxic human environment an issue for bilateral discussion. The best way to do so would be to designate Pakistan as a Country of Particular Concern, which is warranted under U.S. law when there are “systematic, ongoing, and egregious” violations of religious liberty “engaged in or tolerated” by the relevant government.



A CPC rating requires State to act, such as imposing sanctions, or at least grant a waiver. Even in the latter case the designation should spark an ongoing dialogue and create a continuing threat of action at a time when many Americans, including congressmen, wonder why the U.S. continues to provide Pakistan with billions of dollars annually in foreign aid.



Pakistan’s geopolitical importance inevitably inclines State against holding Islamabad accountable for its dangerous religious climate. The Bush administration made political accommodations in applying the CPC label. However, Pakistan’s very centrality to U.S. policy makes the internal situation especially threatening for Americans as well as Pakistanis. Today the ministries of education and information may be almost as important as those of defense and foreign affairs.



Unless the current government confronts those promoting intolerance, moderate Muslims may vanish along with Christians. Three leading Pakistani Christian leaders issued a statement after Shahbaz Bhatti’s death: “We would also like to appeal to the federal and provincial governments to wake up to the challenge of protection of the citizens of Pakistan. If the country becomes a killing field of the democrat and liberal individuals who exercise their freedom of conscience and expression, it would embolden the criminals trying to take charge of the country.”



If the government is taken over by such “criminals” — or, more specifically, extremists advocating the use of violence — the U.S. and Pakistan risk moving from informal frenemies to formal enemies. The principal concern is not military cooperation in Afghanistan, which America should leave sooner rather than later. The primary issue is a nuclear‐​armed state in the hands of those shaped by a system that celebrates intolerance and murder.



Washington should do its utmost to avoid such a clash. Angering Islamabad today by raising the pressure through a CPC designation today might prove to be the best means to prevent a crisis in relations tomorrow.

A new Government Accountability Office (GAO) report claims that, among other issues, the Border Patrol is not efficiently deploying agents to maximize the interdiction of drugs and illegal immigrants at interior checkpoints. I wrote about this here. These checkpoints are typically 25 to 100 miles inside of the United States and are part of a “defense in depth” strategy that is intended to deter illegal behavior along the border. Border Patrol is making suboptimal choices with scarce resources when it comes to enforcing laws along the border. A theme throughout the GAO report is that Border Patrol does not have enough information to efficiently manage checkpoints. Contrary to the GAO’s findings, poor institutional incentives better explain Border Patrol inefficiencies, while a lack information is a result of those incentives. More information and metrics can actually worsen Border Patrol efficiency.   
  
_Inefficient Border Patrol Deployments_   
  
Border Patrol enforces laws in a large area along the border with Mexico. They divide the border into nine geographic sectors. They further divide each sector into stations that are further subdivided into zones, some of which are “border zones” that are actually along the Mexican border while the remainder are “interior zones” that are not along the border. The GAO reports that this organization allows officials on the zone level to deploy agents in response to changing border conditions and intelligence.   
  
The GAO states that Headquarters deploys Border Patrol agents to border sectors based on threats, intelligence, and the flow of illegal activity. The heads of each sector then allocate agents to specific stations and checkpoints based on the above factors as well as local ones such as geography, climate, and the proximity of private property. The heads of those stations and checkpoints then assign specific shifts to each agent. The time it takes for a Border Patrol agent to respond to reported activity, their proximity to urban areas where illegal immigrants can easily blend in, and road access all factor into these deployment decisions.   




All of the above factors that managers and supervisors consider for deployment are reasonable but it is still a management black box. How much does each of these factors matter in determining deployments? Does the relative importance of each factor shift over time or between sectors? How can we tell if one set of decisions is consistently better than another set?   
  
The GAO and other organizations always suggest the same solution to illuminate the black box of Border Patrol agent management decisions: more information. The Border Patrol has about 19,500 agents, about 43 percent of whom can be deployed in the field at any given time, and 143 checkpoint locations along the Southwest border. The GAO has access to extensive data on Border Patrol deployments from the Border Patrol Enforcement Tracking System (BPETS), GPS coordinates for some enforcement operations, seizure information, and the time use of Border Patrol agents by sector when they are on duty. Border Patrol likely has more information available that GAO has not analyzed.   
  
Yet, more information is always insufficient at gauging the efficiency of agent deployment at checkpoints. The recent GAO report notes that “checkpoints’ role in apprehensions and seizures is difficult to measure with precision because of long-standing data quality issues” that the GAO first complained about in 2009. Checkpoints did not consistently report apprehensions as some included any apprehension within a 2.5-mile radius of a checkpoint as apprehended _by_ the checkpoint, while others had different definitional radii and reporting standards. As a result, the number of apprehensions and seizures cannot be determined. The data reporting “issues continue to affect how Border Patrol monitors and reports on checkpoint performance results” despite several memoranda that were supposed to remedy the data collection issues. Border Patrol finally created the Checkpoint Program Management Office (CPMO) in 2016 that is supposed to remedy data collection inconsistencies.   
  
The GAO report calls for more detailed information, such as distinguishing whether an illegal immigrant detention occurs “at” rather than “around” a Border Patrol checkpoint. The GAO also suggests accurate “workplace planning needs assessments” to make sure that checkpoints are manned and operated properly. GAO asks Border Patrol to implement internal controls to ensure data accuracy, consistency, and completeness to overcome problems like supervisors who are not required to update BPETS if their actual deployments differ from those planned and recorded in BPETS. Border Patrol should also study the impact of checkpoints on local communities when considering agent deployment. Finally, GAO reiterates its call for an accurate “workplace planning needs assessment” to make sure that checkpoints are manned and operated properly. How Border Patrol is supposed to integrate these new metrics with existing metrics is a mystery.   
  
_The Incentive to Patrol the Border_   
  
Government law enforcement agencies do have difficult or, in many cases, impossible jobs. Interrupting supply and demand by stopping the flow of unlawful drugs and illegal immigrants into the United States is as Sisyphean a task as Soviet criminal investigators who attempted to stop the black market in gasoline or food. More information won’t remedy the agent deployment problems at Border Patrol, CBP, or any other government agency. The problem with these agencies is not a lack of information but bad incentives.   
  
The performance of government agents isn’t measured by profit and loss as it is in the private sector but by political factors. In the language of economics, Border Patrol faces a principal-agent problem. Principals are the owners and the agents work for them. That sounds simple enough but principals and agents have different incentives. For instance, principals in private enterprise want to maximize profit while many of their agents (workers) want compensation for doing as little as possible or diverting resources into their own pockets. Principals thus have to structure compensation and manage in such a way as to align the incentives of workers and employees through profit sharing, other financial incentives, or through myriad other ways to mitigate these problems. Information is vital to mitigating a principal-agent problem (it can never be fully solved) but more information by itself without the incentive to use it wisely is wasted.   
  
The Border Patrol principals are the politicians who ultimately determine its budget and appoint the heads of the organization. The incentive of the principals is to stay in elected office by winning elections. Border Patrol employees are the agents who supposedly work for the principals. Satisfying political constituencies has little to do with actually enforcing the law as written. For instance, enforcement of immigration laws typically declines during times of economic growth because businesses demand more workers and labor unions complain less about illegal immigrant workers. No lobbying of Congress is necessary, merely the reactions of Border Patrol employees to changing economic circumstances in anticipation of what they think politicians want.   
  
What those politicians want changes over time based on what they think the electorate wants. In the past, economic growth was a better predictor of immigration enforcement. Now, immigration-induced changes in local demographics, cultural complaints, and the idea that immigrants and their descendants will vote against incumbent political parties also drive support for immigration enforcement. Thus, removing illegal immigrants is the latest iteration of the Curley Effect. Countering this trend are pro-immigration local policies like Sanctuary Cities, as well as states like Illinois and California that restrict local police cooperation with federal law enforcement.   
  
_More Information Can Worsen Management_   
  
The call for more information and better metrics for measuring border security is well intentioned but it can also backfire. Some information is required to make accurate decisions but, beyond a certain point, too much information can produce information overload, whereby decisions become _less_ accurate as the decision maker learns more (Figure 1). Information beyond the overload point will confuse a decision maker, affect his or her ability to set priorities, and worsen recall of prior information. A fundamental concept in economics is scarcity, which occurs when there is not enough supply of a good to satisfy all demand at a price of zero. Information overload is a reminder that human attention span, information processing capacity, and accurate decision-making ability are also scarce resources.   
  
Figure 1   
  
Information Overload as the Inverted U-Curve   






_Source:_ _Martin J. Eppler and Jeanne Mengis._   
  
Information overload can take several forms. Some scholars emphasize how much time it takes to absorb new information, which can diminish the accuracy of decisions that require timely action. That case is most similar to the timeliness of intelligence reports in guiding Border Patrol agent deployment. The value of most intelligence depreciates rapidly and, if it is accurate, must be quickly acted upon to have an effect. Other scholars focus on the quality of information, as it is difficult to measure that without first absorbing it and comparing it to other information. Estimates of the size of black markets, a crucial metric for Border Patrol, are fraught with errors and it is nearly impossible to tell which one is correct. Tasks that are reoccurring routines produce less information overload than more complex and varied tasks. As mentioned above, the organizational design of a firm is another important factor that influences information overload.   
  
Smugglers and illegal immigrants compound the problem of information overload as they change their behavior in response to Border Patrol policies. Smugglers and illegal immigrants rarely want to be apprehended so they shift away from patrols or areas where there is more enforcement. In the mid-2000s, illegal Mexican border crossers moved east from California and west from Texas into Arizona because of border security. More enforcement in Arizona after 2010 then shifted illegal immigrant entry attempts back east toward Texas. Their constant movement and reaction to Border Patrol and immigration enforcement generally creates more complexity and information that the agency must process.   
  
The symptoms of information overload are a lack of perspective, cognitive strain and stress, a greater tolerance for error, low morale, and the inability to use information to make a decision. Those symptoms are all common at Border Patrol and its parent organization, the Department of Homeland Security. In terms of a lack of perspective, the chaos below the border is a supposed “existential threat.” Meanwhile, the tolerance for performance and discipline problems in Border Patrol personnel has festered for over a decade, producing numerous errors of all kinds. Morale has historically been low in Border Patrol and has only risen recently due to the election of President Trump.   
  
One common reaction to information overload is that decision makers become highly selective, ignore vast amounts of information, and cherry pick that information which confirms their biases. Information never speaks for itself and it must always be interpreted and applied. By increasing the quantity of information available to managers and supervisors at Border Patrol, their actions could become more erratic and less efficient because they will be able to pull from a vaster array of justifications for their decisions. Like any other self-interested actors, Border Patrol will always select and interpret information to justify the actions they want to undertake while discounting information that supports another course of action. The principal-agent problem means that this rarely gets corrected.   
  
For instance, 9.4 percent of Border Patrol hours were spent manning checkpoints from 2013–2016. Yet those checkpoints were only responsible for, _at most_ , 3.1 percent of all illegal immigrants apprehended by Border Patrol in those years and 5.4 percent of all marijuana seizures by weight (Figure 2). That might look like an inefficient allocation of Border Patrol agents, but a smart manager can always argue the opposite by saying, as an example, “we don’t catch many illegal immigrants at checkpoints because checkpoints are so effective at deterring illegal immigrants from even trying to use to the road. Imagine how many there’d be without the checkpoints!” That manager would have a good point.

Percent of Illegal Immigrant Apprehensions & Drug Seizures Made by Border Patrol by Location, 2013–2016   
  
  




_Source:_ _Government Accountability Office_ _, p. 41._   
  
A border wall that diverts illegal immigrants into the interior and away from cities can be used as support for a longer wall to “extend the gains” or as support for no wall at all because “illegal immigrants are just diverted to more remote areas where agents now have to patrol with greater hazards.” More information and data could worsen the decisions made by Border Patrol managers.   
  
_Back to Incentives_   
  
Firms employ countermeasures to information overload, such as better technology and algorithms to select the best data, but the countermeasures are only effective if the managers want to make more accurate decisions. The desire to make accurate decisions in a large organization comes back to incentives, which government agencies have a very difficult time aligning with the stated intent of the law.   
  
If the incentives to act efficiently are in place then the actor has the incentive to discover the information necessary to carry out his task. But perfect information cannot fix poor incentives and, in fact, can make them worse. Rather than focusing on hiring statisticians, econometricians, and other technocrats to create ever-new metrics to judge government efficiency, Congress should think carefully about aligning incentives to get the outcomes they want. That is a near-impossible job for politicians to tackle so, in most cases, they should just pull back the reach of federal law enforcement to focus on a handful of tasks.   
  
_Conclusion_   
  
The best information in the world cannot compensate for poor incentives and can make government management less efficient by providing cover for any choice. Government agents are not usually malevolent, or at least any more so than the rest of us, but they have incentives to satisfy political demands. Private firms that behave in these ways often fail or earn lower profits unless they are bailed out by the government, which is usually the source of these poor incentives in the first place. More metrics can even worsen efficiency. We should look to deeper structural reforms of government agencies rather than continuing to appeal to a priesthood of statisticians and econometricians to produce information to guide us.

"BP’s new chief executive said the impact of the coronavirus pandemic has deepened his commitment to shrinking the oil giant’s carbon footprint to zero. Bernard Looney, who took the helm of the oil firm in February, said he was “more convinced than ever” that BP must embrace the energy transition following the collapse of global oil markets. He told the Guardian that his commitment to steering BP towards its net-zero carbon ambitions, set out earlier this year, is “deeper” due to the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak. “I am more convinced than ever that this is the right thing to do, and we need to crack on with it,” he said. “The pandemic only adds to the challenge that already exists for oil in the medium to long term.” Some energy economists believe demand for oil may never recover to its levels before the pandemic if changes to business travel and commuting remain after the lockdown ends. This raises serious questions over the business models of major oil companies, which are already under pressure due to tougher climate action and the rise of renewable energy. “We’re all living and working differently right now. Not all of that will stick, but some of it will stick for sure. The question I have is whether consumers will consume less, and I think there is a possibility that they will,” Looney said. The world’s oil demand has fallen to 25-year lows following the outbreak of Covid-19, which has severely limited demand for transport fuels, causing global oil prices to fall by two-thirds. The oil market crisis has wiped billions from major oil companies, including BP which reported a loss for the first quarter of this year. “I think this will remind people of the fragility of the ecosystem that we work in; people are looking up at the skies and seeing less pollution, and I do hope that there will be an even greater appreciation for nature as we move forward, which should keep the climate at the forefront of public debate,” he added. Looney began his tenure as BP boss by promising that the oil company would invest more in clean energy and less in fossil fuels over the next three decades as part of an ambition to become a carbon neutral business by 2050. The plan will use carbon offsets, such as tree-planting and emissions capture technology, to mitigate the fossil fuels it will continue to produce by the middle of the century. “Do the near-term issues cause us to be able to invest a little less than I would have liked in these next couple of years? Possibly,” he said. “But I do believe that we will remain true to what we said on 12 February; that over time, we will invest more into non-carbon businesses and less into hydrocarbon businesses.” The pressure facing oil producers has increased as investors begin to turn their backs on fossil fuels in favour of green energy, which is cheaper and offers more predictable returns. This year, US oil prices plunged below zero for the first time, while BP’s solar energy business, Lightsource, struck new US solar power contracts totaling 400MW, Looney said, which underlines the resilience of the business. “This is a sector which continues to attract investment and I think that’s because it is what society wants,” Looney said. “These are the reasons why my commitment [to net zero] remains as deep, if not deeper than it has been.”"

The True Story About Who Destroyed a Genetically Modified Rice Crop
 By Mark Lynas
Did you hear that a group of 400 angry farmers attacked and destroyed a field trial of genetically modified rice in the Philippines this month? That, it turns out, was a lie. The crop was actually destroyed by a small number of activists while farmers who had been bussed in to attend the event looked on in dismay.
The nature of the attack was widely misreported, from the New York Times to New Scientist to BBC News, based on false claims by the activists. But then anti-GMO activists often lie. In support of the vandals, Greenpeace has claimed that there are health concerns about the genetically modified rice. In fact there is no evidence of risk, and the destruction of this field trial could lead to needless deaths.
The rice is genetically enhanced to produce the vitamin A precursor beta-carotene, giving it a golden color. …
Andrew Revkin on Greenpeace role in fighting Golden Rice:
I’ve been a fan of Greenpeace’s creative, but legal, work to press big companies over destructive forest practices. I called it “activism at its best” last year. But the group’s distorted and incendiary rhetoric on this issue, mashing up anti-corporate emotion with baseless or distorted arguments about this rice strain, is activism at its worst.” …

Climate alarmists have intentionally targeted children – to push their political objectives. Instead of holding an honest debate with adults, they have chosen to terrorize young people with their lies and propaganda. They are destroying science while simultaneously destroying the mental health of children.

"Former senior public servants have called for the re-introduction of a carbon price, saying it would be the least economically damaging way to cut greenhouse gas emissions and could deliver the technological solutions the Morrison government says are needed. In interviews on ABC TV’s Four Corners on Monday, several ex-top advisors expressed frustration and in some cases anger about the country’s failure to introduce durable policies to address climate change.  Ken Henry, the Treasury secretary between 2001 and 2011, said the question the government should be asking itself on climate was how to put a cap, or limit, on national emissions at least cost to the country. “The answer to that question – and everybody will tell this – is an emissions trading scheme,” he said. Martin Parkinson, a former secretary of Treasury and the now defunct climate change department, said it was incorrect to categorise carbon pricing as being “about taxing people”. “The carbon price is actually about creating the right sort of incentives to develop the technology and then use it,” he said. On national climate policy, Parkinson said: “What climate policy? I mean it’s basically … it’s a mess. It’s incoherent and has been for a decade.” Peter Shergold, the head of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet in the final years of the Howard government, was asked what he would say to the prime minister, Scott Morrison, if he held that position now. He said he would tell him: “My sense, prime minister, is that there is a mood to follow such leadership if it exists. Tell it honestly, and tell it truthfully, and don’t try and pretend there are not going to be costs imposed on industry and costs imposed on individuals, but it is worth that for the sake of your children and your grandchildren.” The former bureaucrats made the comments while reflecting on the bipartisan support for carbon pricing between 2007 and 2009. Their shared position is consistent with advice given to governments since before that period. The Morrison government has rejected calls for fossil fuel industries to have to pay for their emissions. Its central climate policy, the $2.5bn emissions reduction fund, uses taxpayer money to pay some businesses and landowners to limit carbon pollution, often by restoring and protecting native habitat. Angus Taylor, the energy and emissions reduction minister, told Four Corners the answer to reducing emissions was to use incentives and focus on “technology, not taxes”. The government has promised a “technology investment roadmap” this year. “Ultimately, reductions in emissions will happen when technologies that work, that are at parity with their higher-emitting alternatives, where rational people choose them because they’re good choices,” Taylor said. “That’s how we’ll bring down emissions globally, and Australia is absolutely committed not just to using those technologies within Australia, but playing a role in areas like hydrogen, integration of household solar, land management, to help other countries to reduce their emissions in that longer term timeframe as well.” Henry said the past decade of climate politics had left him in no doubt that “we have failed”. “I look back on it now and I still feel gutted,” he said. “I feel angry. I know that’s not a good thing, and I probably should get therapy, but I’ve asked myself this question many, many times: why do I still feel angry about it? And the reason I feel angry about it is that I feel angry about what Australia has lost.” There is a growing push internationally for governments and business to back a green recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. More than 120 countries and Australia’s six states have set a goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions. The Morrison government has not set this target, and has emphasised that gas, a fossil fuel, will be central to its economic recovery plans. It has also promised a long-term emissions strategy this year. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was commissioned at the 2015 Paris climate summit to report on what would be involved in limiting global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. It found it was likely it could be achieved by cutting global emissions 45% between 2010 and 2030 and reaching net zero by about 2050. Until this year, Australia’s emissions had largely flatlined since 2014, when the Coalition repealed the emissions trading scheme introduced by Labor with the support of the Greens and independents. Though often mis-described as a carbon tax, it was designed to become a trading scheme after three initial years of a fixed carbon price imposed on emitting businesses. Both Australian and global emissions have fallen this year due to the economic shutdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, but analysts say they are expected to rebound unless recovery plans incorporate policies to address climate change."

To: Dr. Roger Wakimoto



Director, National Center for Atmospheric Research



Boulder, Colorado



Roger, you are the head of what is perhaps the most prestigious atmospheric science laboratory on the planet, and, as such, I presume that you will always go the extra mile to protect the reputation of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and its related University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR).



I’m sure you have seen and discussed with your staff many of the “Climategate” emails released first in November, 2009, and then more recently, earlier this month.



Everyone agrees that the tone and content of many of them is a bit shrill and occasionally intolerant (kind of like University faculty meetings), but there is one repeating thread, by one of your most prestigious employees, Dr. Tom Wigley, that is far beyond the pale of most academic backbiting.



The revoking of my doctorate, the clear objective of Tom’s email, is the professional equivalent of the death penalty. I think it needs to be brought to your attention, because the basic premise underlying his machinations is patently and completely false. Dr Wigley is known as a careful scientist, but he certainly was careless here.



The global circulation of this email has caused unknown damage to my reputation. Also, please note that all communications from Dr. Wigley to his colleagues on this matter were on the NCAR/UCAR server.



The relevant email was sent to Rick Piltz, a UCAR employee at the time, and copied to Michael Mann, Pennsylvania State University, James Hansen and Gavin Schmidt, NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, Benjamin Santer, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,the late Steven Schneider, Stanford University, and several other very prominent climate scientists. The influence of these individuals is manifest and evidence of a very serious attempt to destroy my credential.



What Dr. Wigley wrote to this group of individuals was:



“You may be interesting [sic] in this snippet of information about Pat Michaels. Perhaps the University of Wisconsin ought to open up a public comment period to decide whether Pat Michaels, PhD needs re‐​assessing?”



As I said, revoking the doctorate of a scientist is the equivalent of imposing a professional death penalty. Unfortunately, Wigley’s rationale for organizing this effort was based upon a pure fabrication.



Wigley’s call for a “re‐​assessing” of my dissertation stems from his contention that I either misled my academic committee or my committee was guilty of professional malfeasance, both very serious charges. (His email is reproduced in its entirety at the end of this note.)



My 1979 dissertation was a model relating interannual and interseasonal variations in the shape of the atmosphere, as reflected by the surface barometric pressure field, to variations crop yields across the United States.



In this type of model, one usually factors out the technological component of crop yields (which, incidentally, explains much more variation than any climate component) and then models the remaining variation in yield with the climate factor, in order to “isolate” the climate component. The explained variance of this residual yield by climate is generally about 50%, which is very close to the average I found for corn, soybeans, and winter wheat.



Wigley said in his email that I claimed to have explained 95% of the variation in crop yield, which he said “would have been a remarkable results” [sic]. In fact, there is no such statement, nor anything related to that, in my dissertation. He went on to state that I did this by simultaneously modelling the technological, spatial and climate components of agricultural yield, instead of separating out technological components first.



Despite his claimed familiarity with my dissertation, I did no such thing. Table 2, beginning on page 154 of the dissertation, is labelled “DETRENDING FUNCTIONS”, and gives the equations that were used to remove the technological component. All subsequent analyses were on the detrended data.



Wigley then alleged that either I lied to my examination committee, or that they were buffoons. It is worth noting that the committee included the famously tough Reid Bryson, father of the modern notion that human beings could change the climate.



“Apparently, none of Michaels’ thesis examiners noticed this. We are left with wondering whether this was deliberate misrepresentation by Michaels, or whether it was simply ignorance.”



This came to my attention with the release of the first East Anglia emails in November, 2009. This email and other, new statements by him about my dissertation have surfaced with the recent release of additional emails, and his letter about my dissertation is again being circulated around the web.



I think you will agree that it is time for Dr. Wigley to state that his attempt to generate a movement to remove my doctorate was based upon clear errors on his part, errors that he should have known about, and yet he has let the record stand for over two years. What he “discovered years ago” was certainly not in my dissertation.



Roger, I don’t think you would put up with this, and I think Wigley must be compelled to come forth. Remember that he did this on NCAR’s (and the taxpayer’s) dime.



Thank you very much.

Cc: [E-MAILS REDACTED]



Dear folks,



You may be interesting in this snippet of information about Pat Michaels. Perhaps the University of Wisconsin ought to open up a public comment period to decide whether Pat Michaels, PhD needs re‐​assessing?



Michaels’ PhD was, I believe, supervised by Reid Bryson. It dealt with statistical (regression‐​based) modeling of crop‐​climate relationships. In his thesis, Michaels claims that his statistical model showed that weather/​climate variations could explain 95% of the inter‐​annual variability in crop yields. Had this been correct, it would have been a remarkable results. Certainly, it was at odds with all previous studies of crop‐​climate relationships, which generally showed that weather/​climate could only explain about 50% of inter‐​annual yield variability.



How did result come about? The answer is simple. In Michaels’ regressions he included a trend term. This was at the time a common way to account for the effects of changing technology on yield. It turns out that the trend term accounts for 90% of the variability, so that, in Michaels’ regressions, weather/​climate explains just 5 of the remaining 10%. In other words, Michaels’ claim that weather/​climate explains 95% of the variability is completely bogus.



Apparently, none of Michaels’ thesis examiners noticed this. We are left with wondering whether this was deliberate misrepresentation by Michaels, or whether it was simply ignorance.



As an historical note, I discovered this many years ago when working with Dick Warrick and Tu Qipu on crop‐​climate modeling. We used a spatial regression method, which we developed for the wheat belt of southwestern Western Australia. We carried out similar analyses for winter wheat in the USA, but never published the results.



Wigley, T.M.L. and Tu Qipu, 1983: Crop‐​climate modelling using spatial patterns of yield and climate: Part 1, Background and an example from Australia. Journal of Climate and Applied Meteorology 22, 1831–1841.

 **Albert-Eden Local Board (Owairaka subdivision)**



 **Albert-Eden Local Board**  




 **RATINGS GUIDE:**



 **$** to **$$$$$** with **$** being a leftist trougher and **$$$$$** being small government dynamo



For some however, a clown is more appropriate. More than one may be awarded.  




I note that the candidate profiles on [voteauckland.co.nz](http://voteauckland.co.nz/) now have some questions included:



In the interests of fairness, I’ll be linking each candidate profile to their name and affiliation.



 **Owairaka Subdivision**



There are 10 candidates for this 4 seat subdivision of the Albert-Eden Local Board. You may cast up to 4 votes in this FPP contest



[ **Megan Earley –**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=922262fa-9c0a-46e5-b01d-4449129edcb7&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Albert-Eden%20Local%20Board%20\(Owairaka%20Subdivision\))Independent **$$$$**  




To me, Megan represents the best of those who seek to represent their community on the Local Board. From what I can tell, this is her first attempt at standing for election, she isn’t affiliated to a ticket, isn’t a professional politician and has the sort of background that screams ‘doing this for the right reasons!’



Aside from being a school teacher, she is also a volunteer, sports coach and manager and committee and board member (presumably for a local softball club). Club Administrator of the Year in 2009, followed up by Volunteer of the Year this year. 



All her reasons for standing, what she loves about Owairaka and her priorities should she be elected come down to one thing: mucking in with other community volunteers to make her neighbourhood a better place to live.



Brilliant!



[ **Graeme Easte –**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=c745b5ac-7752-4ab4-90d8-eb7ef168600f&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Albert-Eden%20Local%20Board%20\(Owairaka%20Subdivision\))City Vision **$**



“A community activist for many years…” reeks of left-wing busybody. Easte is the founder of the Campaign for Better Transport, trying to make our streets safer through ‘traffic calming’. A term I’ve never seen before, conjuring up images of a wizard blowing copious amounts of marijuana smoke at traffic lights or blasting mindfulness tunes to drift you to sleep while angels push your car in neutral (I might have stolen that from The Simpsons).



[This 16 page report from NZTA](https://www.nzta.govt.nz/assets/userfiles/transport-data/Traffic%20Calming.pdf) reveals it is actually all those annoying bloody obstacles sprayed across the street to make driving less fun. After reading the first page crowing the benefits of 20 mph zones in London, vertical features, horizontal features and zonal treatments, I needed pharmaceutical calming.



He appears to endorse the city intensifying and ‘growing up’ rather than sprawling and is very concerned about pressure on facilities, infrastructure and threats to “their very character”.



Well, what is it East with an E? You can’t have everything your own way. Preserving character while intensifying through regulatory extremism is nonsense. There will be no intensification in YOUR neighbourhood but land prices will skyrocket as nosy noddies use every possible legal tool they have to make your neighbours’ lives miserable.



What’s more, he’s concerned that local shopping centres (ie, street corner collections of small businesses) are facing strong competition from the new mall in Newmarket and expansion of St Lukes. He proposes flinging your rate money into subsidising these businesses in a hopeless battle against the malls. They’re large, they’re profitable, they’re clearly where most of us want to shop.



Finally, because we are becoming short on open space, he proposes slicing Chamberlain Golf Course in half. Generally speaking, I’m pro-privatisation but this shortage of open space is Easte’s ideological creation. Abolish the urban boundary and then reduce the pressure on limited open spaces within it!



Finally, he wants to expand his traffic calming hoo-hah while curbing climate change. How are you going to achieve that with slowed, congested traffic idling at your zonal treatments?



[ **Jose Luis Fowler**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=1e286be6-d7f1-4ffe-ac50-31b17e515810&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Albert-Eden%20Local%20Board%20\(Owairaka%20Subdivision\))– C&R – Communities & Residents **$$$$$**



Local businessman, Chair of the local neighbourhood association and a cycling coach at Diocesan (wait, hear me out!).



 _“Running a local business, I understand how poor decision-making and communication by Council, Albert-Eden Local Board and Auckland Transport causes real-world chaos, costs and delays.”_



Unlike some zonally treated twats who’ve spent decades table-thumping inside freezing historic micro-councils, Jose lives in the real world and he’s tired of City Vision’s shit.



Fowler is offering safer neighbourhoods, better community consultation (maybe not the best idea in a City Vision dominated subdivision) and cutting wasteful spending.



Good. More of that!



[ **Julia Maskill –**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=2f253153-d50d-4a37-ab29-761364669e38&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Albert-Eden%20Local%20Board%20\(Owairaka%20Subdivision\))City Vision ****



Just when my blood pressure was about to return to normal, I have to review another City Vision candidate.



 _My vision is for a safer community that is caring and inclusive. I will support local business success and sustainability._



 _I will fight to protect our heritage and ensure well-designed development for our growing population. I stand for protecting nature, a cleaner environment and climate action. I want to help everyone reduce environmental harm, with improved recycling and transport choices._



Uh oh.



 _I’m a new candidate, standing to fight for Owairaka’s communities and natural environment. I want Owairaka to be a great place to live in 10 and 20 years’ time, and for future generations, even with increasingly intensive development and extreme weather events._



Please, no.  




 _I think that Local Board decision-making is important because it affects everything we come into contact with as soon as we leave our homes – the air that we breathe, the water we rely on and how we get around. I want to help the Local Board fully flex its muscle (sic) and support communities’ responses to the **climate change emergency,** both by reducing carbon emissions and adapting to survive predicted extreme weather events and sea level rise._



Oh, fuck off! I’m sorry. I know that language brings down the standard of this voting guide even further. But this is a serious candidate standing for a serious citywide political ticket offering the biggest bucket of crap I’ve come across. We’re only up to the second ward!



 _If I’m elected, I will use my “ **climate emergency glasses”**_



Ladies and gentlemen, your low voter turnout.  




[ **Anthony McGivern –**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=fb12f4a5-ac28-4e93-8094-c43a9cb6f431&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Albert-Eden%20Local%20Board%20\(Owairaka%20Subdivision\))C&R – Communities and Residents **$$$$**



McGivern reckons the current Local Board is not working for Owairaka. If the current Local Board just stopped working completely, they would triple their effectiveness.



Anthony has a commercial background in infrastructure and strategic leadership across private and public sectors. If I were elected to this Local Board, I’d show up 5 minutes early and lock the doors. Looks like Anthony is probably better qualified for the position.



He supports several charities and coaches school orienteering. It sounds like nerds going outside but maybe I’m just a little grumpy after reading that Maskill idiot’s profile.



Anthony looks like he’s had his profile written for him because it also mentions cutting wasteful spending and prioritising outcomes communities want. That’s fine by me.



[ **Monique Poirier – C &R – **](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=a3a1ab84-ce69-4275-98cd-cc076381206e&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Albert-Eden%20Local%20Board%20\(Owairaka%20Subdivision\))Communities and Residents **$$$**



I’m a little worried by Monique. She has a Master’s degree in political studies and easily looks young enough to have completed that under the Post-Modernist Social Justice regime which pervades the humanities departments in universities now.



However she is a business owner, has had enough of the council and wants to cut wasteful spending. I’d have thought a Master’s degree in political studies was wasteful spending but at least that’s her own money.



I’m sure Monique would be a great improvement on the existing four City Vision incumbents.



[ **Christina Robertson –**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=5b944919-65b1-4fd4-80db-0b6bc0531d24&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Albert-Eden%20Local%20Board%20\(Owairaka%20Subdivision\))City Vision ****



Maybe it’s a Freudian trick of the light, but at least one of Christina’s lenses appears to be rose coloured.



Christina needs to understand that less is more when it comes to pitching for people’s votes. Eleven paragraphs of sparkles, lollipops and psilocybin poetry splattered with quad-syllabled enviro-nut, calligraphic interpretative dance ain’t gonna cut it with me.



[ **Victoria Tupou –**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=8f17f86b-4a82-4386-92f5-b30e3c5a3be9&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Albert-Eden%20Local%20Board%20\(Owairaka%20Subdivision\))Independent **$**



Victoria has a cat. I like cats. Spaced out City Vision candidates probably don’t. I like Victoria.



She does claim to be experienced in community building. I’m not sure what that means. Is she going to knock on my door with a cake or knock down the fence dividing our properties?



Further reading of her profile reveals a lot of communitarian themed words indicating she is going to keep everyone happy. I’ve changed my mind.



By the way, cats lie on you because you’re a source of heat.



[ **Kristina Walkley –**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=5ed66990-8ab7-41d2-9058-d91a834475ac&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Albert-Eden%20Local%20Board%20\(Owairaka%20Subdivision\)) C&R – Communities and Residents **$$$**



Walkley is Head Teacher at a Pt Chev community kindergarten. That’s plenty of real world experience right there. Point Chevalier has an assortment of socio-economic demographics so when Kristina says she knows how hard families have to work to provide for their children, I believe her.



Her profile isn’t too different from the other C&R candidates, though it doesn’t mention anything about wasteful spending. Maybe she’s the mild-lefty of the bunch?



[ **Margi Watson –**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=02901c2e-bf9e-4ab8-a361-9552103846db&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Albert-Eden%20Local%20Board%20\(Owairaka%20Subdivision\))City Vision **$$$$**



Margi is the only City Vision candidate that has gone to the effort of putting statistics and facts into her profile. That deserves some respect and also explains why she was the highest polling candidate of both subdivisions of the Albert-Eden Local Board in 2016 with 7292 votes. 



How the hell Peter Haynes, with 5142 votes, the lowest of all the successful candidates, became Chairman of the Local Board is absolutely baffling. He must have some serious dirt on his colleagues.



Margi claims that following the opening of the SH20 Waterview project, she fought for and secured $64 million of benefits for the surrounding communities. Now I understand if you think she’s overplaying her hand, being just one of eight Local Board members. However, Local Board’s aren’t known for being crammed with insanely dedicated workaholics, speed-reading volumes of reports til midnight before waking at 4am for tai-chi and motivational podcasts. Maybe she did do it single-handedly.



She appears to have an eye for detail, an impressive knowledge of the area and her job and hasn’t mentioned “climate emergency” once. 



Oh, “climate change action” is right down the bottom. Probably for tokenism’s sake.

 **$** to **$$$$$** with **$** being a leftist trougher and **$$$$$** being small government dynamo



For some, however, a clown is more appropriate. More than one may be awarded.



 **  
Candidates – Council**



 **Alezix Heneti**



It would be incredibly rude to call Alezix batshit crazy. Bat shit can be used as a soil conditioner, fungicide and is excellent for speeding up the decomposition process in compost. Ms Heneti’s talents extend to [talking extremely fast about very little of interest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmhKIdKv3GI&list=PLlToPizPkEm7bIdD89TQYufF7aSrjGBPf&index=4&t=0s), writing confusing, rambling and irrelevant [candidate statements](http://ndhadeliver.natlib.govt.nz/webarchive/wayback/20160905080219/http://www.voteaucklandmayoralezixheneti.com/430068222) in UNDERLINED CAPITAL LETTERS, and packing her wardrobe with enough orange to replace the orange stickman working for the electoral commission.



If her autobiography is accurate, she has been a security guard working 7 nights a week, led a 120 staff telemarketing team, made $1.4 million in 22 minutes, stood in multiple elections in countless cities, lived all over the world while training sports teams 6 days a week every year for 25 years. Despite that, in 2016 she campaigned for Auckland Mayoralty and Albany Councillor, and despite breaking electoral law, remained fully confident in her ability to do both jobs at the same time. Based on this [notorious 2016 Mayoral Campaign Debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFR6QNjYzAg), I suspect she’d be trespassed from the Town Hall within a week.   
  
Her 2016 policy program for Albany included cutting rates in half, doubling benefits for superannuitants, building KIWI Disneyland and [improving everything in Council by 10-1000%.](https://www.localmatters.co.nz/news/151-features-candidates-hibiscus-candidates-alezix-heneti-albany-ward.html)   




Her 2019 candidate profile reveals she is “outstanding and awesome.” On her way to becoming a “John Kehoe Mind Power Quantum Leap Graduate trained by Robin Banks, I discovered I am outstanding, awesome and amazing.”



Keep an eye out for this lady. Who says local elections have to be boring?



 **Julia Parfitt –** Independent **$$$**  




Julia was Deputy Mayor of the North Shore Council under Andrew Williams. Whether that makes her hungry for power under any circumstances or a tough cookie is for you to decide. Julia wants more funding for Local Boards and for the decisions that affect them to be made locally. Once I would have called that pork-barrelling to shore up her Local Board supporters, but as the amalgamation of the councils in 2010 has failed to result in efficiencies, I think that position has some merit.  




The growth of the city should be “environmentally sustainable and designed to enhance existing communities.” That’s politician speak for ‘I’m a red-tape NIMBY.’  




She wants money to be spent wisely (who doesn’t) and debt reduced but opposes asset sales. As for development contributions, Parfitt advocates spending those in the area from which they are sourced. Greater accountability for CCO’s and a new harbour crossing. I’m 100% on board with that but need to see more detail. If it is going to run parallel to the existing crossing then it’s a waste of money.



 **Wayne Walker –** Putting People First **$$**  




Walker is an award-winning speaker, having won non-specified NZ speaking competitions. Having listened to his slow, dull nasal tones in council meetings, where there is more silent space between each word uttered than actual speech, it just doesn’t seem possible. Surely he wouldn’t lie.



Walker is the consummate NIMBY, having fought against high-rise development proposals in Browns Bay, Milford and Orewa. He claimed that increased density drives up land prices, which is nonsense. Artificial land scarcity caused by excessive regulation drives up land prices, incentivising high-rise developments.  
  
This environmental warrior has put some truly stupid proposals to the council, such as advocating that half of the Chamberlain Golf Course be transformed into a wildlife sanctuary. “If ever there was a place where you could also have a wildlife sanctuary because golf courses essentially are fenced in part, then this is it,” he said.



Walker isn’t just an advocate of declaring a climate emergency, he actually went to Paris to witness the signing of the Paris Agreement.  
  
Walker has previously voted against large rates increases but never backed this up by trying to reduce spending. The only redeeming feature Walker has is his opposition to moving Western Springs Speedway.  




 **John Watson –** Putting People First **$$**  




This Putting People First ticket candidate claims to be 100% independent. He’s already pissed me off because he also claims to provide “honest, open leadership.”  




Watson also says he is committed to improving transport “getting people to destinations quicker through bus/ferry/northern motorway enhancements, congested intersection upgrades/parking and Penlink. Aside from the mention of ferries which are incredibly uneconomical and heavily subsidised, there is little else for me to object to but we have been hearing about Penlink for a very very very long time. How many more election campaigns can supporting a never built Penlink be a positive for Watson?



Watson, like Walker, voted for a $9.8 million grant to Eden Park. The alternative was making it an interest-free loan with no end date payable only if the land were to be sold. Like Walker, he congratulated AT on providing 20 more ferry sailings for Hobsonville and Beach Haven ferry users. Unlike Walker, he voted against the notorious 2015 budget which resulted in 9.9% rates increases. 



Not exactly independent but infinitely less annoying than his Putting People First running mate.



 **MY RECOMMENDATION:** There are two positions in Albany ward, so you get two votes. Julia Parfitt and John Watson.

Guest post by David Middleton
GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney recently released an outline of his plan to achieve “North American energy independence” by 2020. While the white paper (1) is short on specific details, it does contain quite a few good ideas and some supporting documentation. For anyone interested in a business plan approach to energy policy, it’s well worth reading. Rather than focus on the details of the plan, I thought it would be an interesting exercise to see if “North American energy independence by 2020” was even technically possible. If it’s not technically possible, then it’s not really relevant whether or not it would be economically advisable or politically achievable. Since North America already pretty well has the capacity to be energy independent in terms of coal, natural gas, uranium and electricity generation, I’m only going to look at oil and natural gas liquids.
So, without any further prologue, I’m going to jump right into some numbers.
Can we “get there from here”?
According to the American Petroleum Institute (2) the current estimate of undiscovered technically recoverable Federal resources (UTRR-Fed) of crude oil currently stands at 116.3 billion barrels.
Figure 1. U.S. Crude Oil and Natural Gas Undiscovered Technically Recoverable Federal Resources (American Petroleum Institute).
The UTRR-Fed are concentrated in areas close to existing exploration and exploitation infrastructure. The Gulf of Mexico, Alaska and the Lower 48 States comprise 88% of the UTRR-Fed.

There is no reason that these potential resources could not be exploited within the next few decades if the U.S. government adopted regulatory policies geared toward exploitation.
If industry converted the UTRR-Fed into proved developed producing reserves of crude oil over the next 25 years, this is what might happen to U.S. domestic crude oil production:
Figure 2. Potential exploitation scenario for the UTRR-Fed.
I think that it is technically possible that US crude oil and natural gas liquid production could reach 14.4 million BOPD by 2028 and peak at 15.7 million BOPD by 2032. If U.S. demand remained in the 18-20 million BOPD range, the United States could come very close to being self-sufficient in crude oil. I also took the liberty of including 73 billion barrels of Green River Oil Shale production from 2022-2100 (more on this later).
Canada expects to double its oil production by 2030 (3). Assuming that Canada’s domestic consumption remains stable and the U.S. remains Canada’s primary export market, Canadian imports could also be expected to double by 2030. While Mexican oil production is currently in decline and Pemex is one of the most poorly managed national oil companies (NOC) in the world, Mexico has huge potential in the area of undiscovered resources (4). Mexico does have the potential to stabilize its current production levels. If Canada doubles its production by 2030 and continues to increase its production through the end of this century and Mexico stabilizes at roughly its current levels, this is what U.S. domestic production plus Canadian and Mexican imports might look like:
Figure 3. U.S. UTRR-Fed plus Canadian and Mexican imports.
Based on these numbers, North American energy independence could be achieved by 2027.
116 billion barrels of ”undiscovered technically recoverable oil” is equal to about 16 years worth of current US consumption. However, past history shows us that gov’t agencies always grossly underestimate what the oil industry will find and produce. Alaska’s North Slope has already produced 16 billion barrels of petroleum liquids. Currently developed areas will ultimately produce a total of about 30 billion barrels. The government’s original forecast for the North Slope’s total production was 10 billion barrels. The current USGS estimate for undiscovered oil in the Bakken play of Montana & North Dakota is 25 times larger than the same agency’s 1995 estimate. In 1987, the MMS undiscovered resource estimate for the Gulf of Mexico was 9 billion barrels. Today it is 45 billion barrels (2).
The MMS increased the estimate of undiscovered oil in the Gulf of Mexico from 9 billion barrels in 1987 to the current 45 billion barrels because we discovered a helluva a lot more than 9 billion barrels in the Gulf over the last 20 years. Almost all of the large US fields discovered since 1988 were discovered in the deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1988, it was unclear whether or not the deepwater plays would prove to be economic.The largest field in the Gulf of Mexico, Shell’s Mars Field, was discovered in 1989. Prior to this discovery, no one thought that economically viable Miocene-aged or older reservoirs existed in deepwater. Mars has produced 1 billion barrels of oil and 1.25 TCF of natural gas since coming on line in 1996. It is currently producing over 100,000 barrels of oil per day. Dozens of Mars-class fields have been discovered over the last 20 years… Most of those have only barely come on line over the last 5 years.
The most significant play in the Gulf of Mexico, the Lower Tertiary, wasn’t even a figment of anyone’s imagination in 1988. These are massive discoveries – BP’s recently discovered Tiber Field on Keathly Canyon Block 102 is estimated to contain 3-6 billion barrels of recoverable oil. Several recently discovered fields are expected to come on line at more than 100,000 bbl/day. This play is still in its infancy.
Based on the gov’t’s track record, the estimated 116 billion barrels of undiscovered oil under Federal lands is more likely to be 680 billion barrels. That’s close to 100 years worth of current US consumption – And that’s just the undiscovered oil under Federal mineral leases.
When you factor in shale oil (kerogen) plays, the numbers become staggering. The Green River formation oil shale has more than 1 trillion barrels of recoverable oil just in the Piceance Basin of Colorado.

There are at least 1.8 trillion barrels of undiscovered technically recoverable oil in just the Green River formation (DOE).
Oil shale deposits like the Green River formation (technically a marl) are currently economic at sustained oil prices of $54/bbl, possibly as low as $35/bbl (DOE).

In my hypothetical production forecast, I projected Green River oil shale production to reach 15 million BOPD by 2096. Am I being overly optimistic in projecting more than 15 million barrels per day (BOPD) of production from oil shales by 2100? Shell estimates that they could be producing 500,000 barrels per day from the Picenance Basin with a very small footprint using an in situ recovery process (5):
Technical Viability and Commercial Readiness (pp 18-24)
Shell has tested its in-situ process at a very small scale on Shell’s private holdings in the Piceance Basin. The energy yield of the extracted liquid and gas is equal to that predicted by the standardized assay test.13 The heating energy required for this process equals about one-sixth the energy value of the extracted product. These tests have indicated that the process may be technically and economically viable.
This approach requires no subsurface mining and thus may be capable of achieving high resource recovery in the deepest and thickest portions of the U.S. oil shale resource. Most important, the Shell in-situ process can be implemented without the massive disturbance to land that would be caused by the only other method capable of high energy/resource recovery—namely, deep surface mining combined with surface retorting. The footprint of this approach is exceptionally small. When applied to the thickest oil shale deposits of the Piceance Basin, drilling in about 150 acres per year could support sustained production of a half-million barrels of oil per day and 500 billion cubic feet per year of natural gas.
[…]
Once oil shale development reaches the production growth stage, how fast and how large the industry grows will depend on the economic competitiveness of shale derived oil with other liquid fuels and on how the issues raised in Chapter Five are ultimately resolved. If long lead-time activities are started in the prior stage, the first follow-on commercial operations could begin production within four years. Counting from the start of the production growth stage and assuming that 200,000 barrels per day of increased production capacity can be added each year, total production would reach 1 million barrels per day in seven years, 2 million barrels per day in 12 years, and 3 million barrels in 17 years.
Assuming a 12-yr lead time to reach the production growth stage, it will take ~30 years to reach 3 million barrels per day. If production continued to grow at a rate of 1 million BOPD every 5 years… Oil shale production from just the Piceance Basin could reach 15 million BOPD by the end of this century.
The hydrocarbon characteristics of the the oil shales of the Green River formation in the Piceance Basin are superior to those of the Athabasca oil sands. The hydrocarbon areal density is about 13 times that of the Athabasca deposits. The Green River hydrocarbons are not technically “oil;” it’s a form of kerogen. But, for or refining purposes, it’s oil. It will be booked as oil, just like the Athabasca tar sand oil is. It’s a high-grade refinery feedstock…
“Kerogen can be converted to superior quality jet fuel, #2 diesel, and other high value by-products.”
Canada is currently producing ~ 1 million barrels of oil per day from Athabasca oil sand deposits. They expect to increase that to 2 million barrels per day over the next decade. The Green River oil shale deposits in the Piceance basin could easily outperform Athabasca within a decade and with a much smaller environmental footprint.
Athabasca oil sands are currently economically competitive with the OPEC basket. Green River formation oil shales are superior, by a wide margin, to Athabasca oil sands. The Green River oil shales would yield 100,000 bbl of 38° API sweet refinery feed per 160,000 tons of ore & overburden. Athabasca oil sands yield 100,000 bbl of 34° sweet refinery feed per 430,000 tons of ore & overburden. The unconventional oil is actually very light and very sweet; the OPEC Basket is actually heavier (32.7° API).
Athabasca is economically competitive now. Green River could be economically competitive now. The only obstacles to US energy security are environmental terrorists activists and the U.S. government.
“Peak Oil,” if it exists, won’t be reached for hundreds of years if the U.S. government would just get out of the way. About 80% of the most prospective Green River deposits are under Federal leases. The Obama administration effectively blocked exploitation of the Green River oil shale earlier this year.
Does Policy Matter?
Bad policy certainly matters. “One bipartisan policy tradition is to deny Americans the use of our own resources” (6):
Figure 4. Bad Policy Matters.
The Obama administration’s energy policy has been disastrous as it relates to oil production. While it is true that U.S. domestic oil production has been rising over the last few years, all of the growth has come from onshore plays in Texas and North Dakota:
Figure 5. Comparison of daily oil production rates: Federal Gulf of Mexico, Texas and North Dakota (EIA).
Some of the Texas (less than 1%) and North Dakota (~11%) production is from Federal leases. I downloaded the onshore Federal lease production data for Texas and North Dakota from Office of Natural Resource Revenue (ONRR) and subtracted the minuscule Federal lease production from the State and private lease production in those two States. I added that to theFederal Gulf of Mexico production (the GOM is the Big Kahuna of Federal lease oil production):
Figure 6. State and private lease production in Texas and North Dakota vs. Federal lease production in the Gulf of Mexico, North Dakota and Texas.
All of the net growth in US domestic oil production since 2009 has come from State and private leases in Texas and North Dakota.
Since President Obama took office, Federal lease oil production in the GOM, TX and ND has declined by 79 million barrels per year; while State and private lease production in TX & ND has grown by 205 million barrels per year. The decline in Gulf of Mexico has occurred during a period of high oil prices and is directly attributable to the unlawful drilling moratorium and “permitorium” imposed in the wake of the Macondo blowout and oil spill. Drilling permits that once took 30 days to be approved now take more than 300 days. Even relatively simple things like the approval of development plan (DOCD) revisions are being drawn out to nearly 300 days. The average delays for independent oil companies are currently 1.4 years on the shelf and almost 2 years in deepwater (7):
Figure 7. Average Gulf of Mexico permit delays (Quest Offsore Resources).
Between the “permitorium” and high product prices, many of the best, most capable drilling rigs have been moved overseas. Once we manage to get permits approved, the delays in obtaining a rig can be almost as long as the permit delays were. In this “dynamic regulatory environment,” wells can’t be drilled quickly enough to compensate for decline rates, much less to increase production.

Simon Bridges left the door open in opposing the second reading of the Zero Carbon Bill and while he was still making up his mind about it, two of his ministers came out in opposition. 



In this interview with Corin Dann, Bridges says he expects his ministers to toe the party line – even though they don’t know what that is!



 **Corin:**



Are you prepared to let any of you MPs cross the floor on a potential vote on a carbon ah zero bill? There has been some speculation from Richard Harman that Judith Collins may be open to crossing the floor if that bill is not ah to her liking. 



**Simon:**



N…no I don’t accept that MPs can or should cross the floor. It’s a situation in the National Party where on conscience issues you get a free vote – you certainly don’t where the party has decided the position.



To be clear on our position on that bill we haven’t decided yet, we may well vote against it, which I think was the tenor of the Harman ah piece ah there. Ah but we know our position quite clearly on methane targets and the economic impact and we will be pushing for changes so that we can support it. 



**Corin:**



So, sorry have you hardened your position here? You might vote against this bill? 



**Simon:**



I don’t think it’s a hardening. I think if you go back ah, I’ve said this before, but you go back over a year ago to a speech I gave at the field days… I… I’ve known exactly where National stands on these issues. Those positions haven’t changed, we worry about the methane target, we worry about the wider economic impact, we will be pushing for changes in the committee of the whole house ah as they call it, if they don’t ah… if we don’t see changes we may well vote against it, but of course we would like to support it because the majority of the bill, the architecture if you like, actually is much of our plan. 



**Corin:**



Has Judith Collins indicated she would vote against it, to you? 



**Simon:**



Ah, look I’m not going to characterise what happens in caucus, what is said, there’s a range of views in National. I could be candid with you about that. From those who say, you know what, we really should be supporting this, through to those who are much more reluctant given the rural supporters they have in rural NZ and the clear worry from farmers about this. 



Look, I’m not pretending it’s an easy issue for National, or indeed for NZ, and we are grappling with those things right now. We do know our position though and we will be seeking changes in the ah process through parliament. 



Judith Collins publicly opposed the bill. 



“National MP Judith Collins says she will vote against the Zero Carbon Bill in its present form thus apparently pre-empting her Leader and caucus who have made no final decision on what to do.



Her statement is being interpreted to mean that she would be prepared to vote against National if they agree to support the Bill. 



**And in making her pledge she is leaving National Leader Simon Bridges facing a political dilemma which could see him lose support whichever choice he makes.”**



  
Matt King has a bob each way. He supports the farmers but also doesn’t want to abandon the party position, describing himself as a “climate enquirer”. 



“The Northland MP [Matt King] copped heavy criticism over the weekend for a social media post that claimed climate change “is natural” and accused the Government of unfairly targeting farmers in efforts to lower carbon emissions.”



[…] On Sunday King tweeted that he’s a “climate inquirer” rather than a denier.



“I think everyone’s an enquirer, aren’t they?” he said on Tuesday when asked about the term. “We’re all finding out what the story is.” 



His National Party colleagues were less enthused about embracing the identity of “climate enquirer”, with Gerry Brownlee, Chris Penk and Nicky Wagner all denying they’d encountered the term before. 



[…]” **Everyone in the National Party believes that climate change is real,”** Chris Bishop told media.”” 



  
Bridges should thank Chris Bishop for taking the party line despite not knowing quite what that line is. 



But Bridges has a bigger problem with Collins who outstrips him in the popularity polls and now in climate change as well; showing decisive leadership where he did not. 



Collins gave Bridges a golden opportunity to establish his leadership by propelling the party into a decisive stance against the bill, but instead, he prevaricated. 



Bridges defended his party’s acceptance of the large $150,000 Chinese donation. [He argues that no laws were broken](https://thebfd.co.nz/wp-admin/post.php?post=494083&action=edit) but conveniently forgets the spirit of that law, which is to avoid political parties being influenced by representatives from foreign countries. It is highly doubtful that someone giving a large sum of money would not expect some sort of consideration. It’s another example of weak leadership.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe IPCC has issued a press release on the release of the AR summary report for policymakers. You can find it here. 
We are witnessing a disgraced science, one that is desperately clinging to catastrophe and relevance. The Summary Report for Policymakers (SPM) resembles an amateur magician’s show where everybody already knows all the tricks used to create the illusions. But the policymakers will act like they’ve seen the show for the first time.
The press release says “it is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century“. The report fails to acknowledge that global temperatures have been at a standstill for the last 15 years, claiming rather that “each of the last three decades has been successively warmer at the Earth’s surface than any preceding decade since 1850” – a statistical sleight of hand.
In the Summary Report for Policymakers (SPM), the hockey stick chart disappears completely. There’s no mention of temperature conditions during the Little Ice Age and Medieval Warm Period. Almost all the charts shown in the SPM go back only to the 20th century, and thus provide an incomplete and misleading picture of historical temperature developments. The Medieval Period was as warm, if not warmer, than today’s temperature. Obviously the concept of the temperature hockey stick is an embarrassment that the IPCC is eager to relegate to the dustbin of history.
The SPM also completely neglects solar activity and its possible connection to the current global cooling taking place. In Figure SPM.5, the chart attributes practically no climate impact from the sun, although the historical data shows there’s a powerful correlation between solar activity and global temperature.
The IPCC also fails to report that global temperatures have not risen at all since the Third Assessment Report of 2001. Moreover, the chart comparing model projections to observations, which appeared in a draft report leaked late last year, disappeared in the new Summary Report for Policymakers.
CO2 climate sensitivity figures have also been scaled back. The IPCC now projects a warming of only 1.5°C or more over the 21st century. In the 2007 report that figure was 2°C and up.
The press release, however, insists that sea level rise will accelerate, later in the future. But until then we will just have to remain patient. Strangely the sea level projection chart on page 35 deletes the past, and begins only at 2008.
This is going to be an easy report to dismantle. Global warming “science” is on its last leg.

"**New rules for pubs are ""insulting"" and ""a huge slap in the face"" for the sector, said the boss of Wales' biggest brewers.**
Alistair Darby of Brains called on politicians to ""stop changing their mind"" on what is required.
Welsh pubs, restaurants and cafes will be banned from selling alcohol from Friday and will be unable to open to customers beyond 18:00 GMT.
Mark Drakeford said the new rules will tackle a rise in coronavirus cases.
Health Minister Vaughan Gething said he understood why companies in the industry are upset, but admitted there is ""no perfect balance"" between protecting public health and businesses.
Speaking on BBC Radio Wales Breakfast with Claire Summers, he added: ""What we can do is make sure more of us will be here in the future to celebrate life events.""
However Mr Darby said the move suggests pubs and restaurants are areas of ""high transmission"".
""It's hugely frustrating and a bit insulting. It says people are not making the effort being asked of them,"" he said.
UK government Cabinet Minister Michael Gove said restrictions had been lifted too quickly after Wales' 17-day firebreak.
He told BBC Breakfast he sympathised with the Welsh Government, but added: ""As a result of doing that, the virus once more got out of control, so they've had to slam the brakes on again.
""The example of Wales shows what can happen if you lift the restrictions in too blanket a way too soon.""
The Welsh Conservatives have accused the Welsh Government of putting jobs at risk with the new rules.
Brains employs 1,400 people and has 104 pubs, but Mr Darby said the move will be felt by many thousands of other workers who supply the industry, such as electricians, plumbers and caterers.
""It will have an impact on a huge number of people who make a living from the sector and our communities who, I fear, will be deprived the opportunity to visit a pub this Christmas.""
Mr Drakeford said new measures are necessary or there could be between 1,000 and 1,700 preventable deaths this winter.
The Brains boss said: ""The sector has done more than its fair share to ensure those potential deaths are avoided.
""And at the end of this, we will be asking, if lives aren't saved, what the answer will be?""
The first minister said firms hit by the restrictions would be offered Â£340m in support which he claimed was ""the most generous package"" anywhere in the UK.
However Mr Darby said the support ""would not touch the sides"".
As an Â£80m turnover business, Brains spent Â£500,000 in personal protective equipment (PPE) and digital technology for pre-booking, while it has ""surrendered"" huge capacity and lost summer trading, Mr Darby added.
He said: ""My message to politicians is 'you have to stop changing your mind on what is required in the sector'.
""We have done more than our fair share to ensure potential deaths are avoided at the end of this.""
David Cattrall, managing director of Harlech Foodservice, warned that many hospitality businesses would not survive the latest round of restrictions.
""There is a palpable sense of frustration, bewilderment and anger at the restrictions being placed upon the hospitality sector in north and mid Wales,"" he said.
""The rate of the virus is lower here than in south Wales so it defies logic that we are being subjected to this damaging one-size-fits-all policy.
""The run-up to Christmas is when the sector makes enough money to keep them going through the quiet months of January and February but it's clear now that Christmas has been cancelled as far as the hospitality sector is concerned.""
Businesses need an exit plan and reassurance they will be able to open at Easter ""as a matter of urgency"", he added.
KellyÂ Jolliffe, owner and landlady of The Greyhound Inn in Usk, Monmouthshire, said she was ""gutted"" about the new restrictions.
""I was expecting it, I was hoping that it would only be shutting at 6pm, which I think we could all have managed with and could have all worked around,"" she said.
""But when he banned the alcohol, I just thought there's no point really - we're a pub!""
She told Radio Wales Breakfast she has decided to close, despite having got the pub ready for the Christmas trade.
""We were all decked out, all socially distanced, bookings coming in, everybody working around the regulations,"" she said.
Tory covid recovery spokesman Darren Millar said the restrictions could affect jobs across Wales.
He added: ""With one in 10 of the Welsh workforce employed by hospitality enterprises and with so many relying on pre-Christmas trade, the Welsh Government is now putting tens of thousands of jobs and livelihoods at risk."""

"**No 10 has published data behind its decisions over England's new tier system as it tries to win MPs' support.**
Downing Street's report said it sought to ""balance the many complex impacts"" of restrictions and keep them in place ""for as short a time as possible"".
It said allowing the virus to spread exponentially ""would lead to impacts... considered intolerable for society"".
But senior Tory MP Mark Harper said the ""wheels are coming off the government's arguments"".
MPs will vote on the plans on Tuesday.
The government announced its tougher three tiers to tackle the virus last week, with Boris Johnson telling reporters on Monday: ""We can't afford to take our foot off the throat of the beast... to let it out of control again.""
But a number of Tory backbenchers have threatened to vote against the motion when it comes to the Commons, including the Covid Recovery Group (CRG) of MPs - chaired by Mr Harper.
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party would abstain on the vote, saying he had ""serious misgivings"" about the measures.
But he said it was ""in the national interest"" to let the restrictions pass through the Commons without Labour's opposition to ensure some measures were in place.
A No 10 spokesman accused Sir Keir of ""playing politics in the middle of a global pandemic, instead of working with the government to find a way through this difficult time for the British people"".
England's current lockdown will end in the early hours of Wednesday 2 December and will see the country placed into one of three tiers: medium (one), high (two) and very high (three).
However, the majority of the country, over 55 million, will be under the strictest two sets of measures.
The announcement led to criticism from some Tory MPs, who were concerned about the impact in their constituencies.
Mr Johnson wrote to his party twice over the weekend to appeal for their backing and to grant some of the CRG's demands.
They included the publication of the data on the health, social and economic impact of the tiers, and the promise MPs could vote again on the measures in January - with the possibility the tier system could end on 3 February.
But the government report - published on Monday \- said it was ""not possible to forecast the precise economic impact of a specific change to a specific restriction with confidence"".
The document is largely made up of information already available.
It said the challenge of balancing health and societal impacts was not straightforward, but the government would continue to pursue the best overall outcomes.
The chair of the Treasury select committee, Tory MP Mel Stride, condemned the report as ""a rehashed document [that] offers very little further in economic terms"".
He told the BBC he would support the government to ensure there were some restrictions in place, but added: ""It's frustrating that there is little here that sets out how the different tiers might impact on the specific sectors and regions across the country.
""Those looking for additional economic analysis of the new tiered system will struggle to find it in this document.""
The CRG chair, Mr Harper, said the report ""seems to be collapsing under the glare of scrutiny"".
He repeated accusations that the government's modelling on deaths and hospital capacity had been wrong, adding: ""We have asked repeatedly for the information that vindicates these hospital projections and they have not been forthcoming.""
While Labour will abstain, the Liberal Democrats have said they will not back the plan - although it is not clear whether they will vote against or abstain.
The SNP will abstain in the vote, as it only covers restrictions in England.
With many of the opposition MPs abstaining, it would take a huge Tory rebellion for the measures to fall, which is unlikely.
At first glance there doesn't appear to be much, if any, new information in this document.
The government's analysis draws on studies and data already in the public domain to try to assess the impact of the tiered system of restrictions.
So will it convince Conservative MPs sceptical about the need for tighter restrictions that they are, in fact, necessary?
Yes and no.
Some Tory backbenchers may be satisfied the government has at least attempted to provide further evidence that tougher measures are needed. They've made their point.
Others will flick through the 48 pages and discard it, knowing all along that without some elusive magic formula the government could provide, they would never have been convinced.
The government is likely to win Tuesday's vote, but as the pandemic wears on, it is having to go to greater and greater lengths to keep its own MPs on side.
Speaking shortly before the data was published, Mr Johnson said he ""understood people's frustration"" with the stricter tiers.
He said: ""The tiering system is tough, but it is designed to be tough to keep [the virus] under control.""
""What we can't do is forsake and abandon all the gains we have made now just when we are starting to see real progress in the science.""
In the report, the government pointed to data from the Office for National Statistics, showing a rapid increase in people testing positive for the virus between September and November - from 59,800 a week to 633,000 a week.
It said the new ""strengthened"" tier system was ""designed to keep R [the infection rate] below one so that prevalence continues to fall, the significant impacts of the virus are reduced, and so that, ultimately, fewer restrictions are required.""
It added that a ""stable and fully functioning health system is one of the pillars that underpins our society and our economy"", with the government's view being ""the severe loss of life and other health impacts of allowing the NHS to be overwhelmed would be intolerable for our society"".
The document also pointed to the economic forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility - which were published alongside Chancellor Rishi Sunak's spending review last week - predicting the value of the economy will fall by 11.3% by the end of the financial year.
But, while the report conceded there would be ""major impacts"" on the economy from the restrictions, it added: ""Any attempt to estimate the specific economic impacts of precise changes to individual restrictions for a defined period of time would be subject to such wide uncertainty as to not be meaningful for precise policy making"".
Labour leader Sir Keir defended his party's decision to abstain on the vote for measures, saying it was ""better that these regulations can be amended and put in place than if there are no regulations"".
He said the ""serious misgivings"" he had included over the performance of the test and trace system and ""real concerns"" over the level of economic support for those in the highest tiers.
But, Sir Keir added: ""Although the number of cases is coming down as a result of lockdown, the virus is still a significant risk and in principal we accept there is going to have to be continued restrictions.""
However, one Labour MP, Richard Burgon, has already said he will vote against the tier system, arguing that it will fail to lower the infection rate and make another lockdown more likely.
Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey described the system as ""chaotic"" and said his party would not back the measures until the prime minister addressed their concerns - such as working with local authorities and supporting pubs."

Abstract:
Increasing urban surface temperature due to change of natural surfaces is one of the growing environmental problems in urban areas, especially in cities like Delhi. The present work is an attempt to assess the urban surface temperature in Delhi using remote sensing and GIS techniques. ASTER datasets of thermal bands were used to assess the land surface temperature (LST) using temperature emissivity separation technique. Ward-wise population density was calculated from the Census of India 2001 data to correlate the population density with LST. The study shows that surface temperature changes with the increase in the impervious surface area, which is related to the increase in the population density.
From the discussion: 
Figure 4 shows the correlation between surface temperature and population density. A strong positive correlation between the two can be seen. The value of logarithmic regression (R2) is 0.748. The logarithmic regression equation between surface temperature and population density is Y = 1.059ln × Pop-density + 22.40. It means that with the increase in population density, surface temperature also increases. Furthermore, it is possible to predict night-time surface temperature on the basis of known population density.
….
Oke used the empirical method to represent the relationship between urban–rural temperatures as concentration on population. It is not easy to separate many contributors to the problem. However, one of the most noticeable and one that has proven to have an
extremely strong correlation with the UHI phenomenon or urban surface temperature is the population density of major cities32. The present study demonstrates a close
relationship between the population density, built-up area and surface temperature. The statistical analysis of nighttime surface temperature with population density indicates
that population growth tends to contribute to the urban surface temperature rise or UHI intensity and also to the micro-climate of Delhi.
In earlier times and even now, there are very few meteorological stations to record the surface temperature, and they may not be the true representative for the whole city. In such situations, LST derived from thermal satellite data are useful to study the variation of surface temperature over the entire city area that is an important parameter for micro-climate of urban areas. This study clearly shows spatial variation of LST over entire Delhi.
By superposing the population density map of Delhi over the surface temperature map, it can be clearly seen that high population density is one of the main contributing
factors for the high surface temperature, UHI intensity and also micro-climate of Delhi. To assess and address the issue of micro-climate and also to mitigate the impact of UHI on the city population, the outcome of such types of studies may be useful.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSatellite Measured Sea Level Is Measuring Ocean Heat
By Ed Caryl
Sometime in the last year, someone commented in some article that sea level rise as observed by satellite radar altimetry was overstated due to the fact that as warm water expands, it gets lighter, gravity has less pull on it, and it bulges up. Since then, a couple of global maps have come to my attention. First, a map of sea level rise.

Figure 1 is sea level rise trend since 1993. Source University of Colorado.
Now compare this to the ocean heat content anomaly map for roughly the same period.

Figure 2 is ocean heat content anomaly 0 to 300 meters as of January 2012. Source.
They look alike, don’t they? The colors in most of the two map areas match. They would match almost exactly if the scale colors were the same. But they are supposed to be measuring different things. But where there is ocean heat (red and orange) in Figure 2, there is sea level rise (red and orange) in Figure 1. Conversely, where the ocean is cooler it is lower. Hot is higher sea level, cool is lower sea level. The western Pacific is warmer and higher than the eastern Pacific. The warm current east of Japan is higher in sea level. Cool spots in the Southern Ocean are lower in sea level.

As was suggested in the first paragraph, as a particular spot in the ocean warms, like the western Pacific warm pool, the surface expands upward. This has nothing to do with most of the coastlines of the world. Where the water is shallow, the slight expansion will not be noticed. As you can see on the map, sea levels all along the west coast of the Americas, and some other areas, are falling because those ocean areas are cooling. For other coastal areas, sea levels are rising slowly, at about the rate measured by tide gauges since the 19th century, 1.7 mm/year.
Sea level rise as measured by satellites is measuring mid-ocean sea level heat differences. The most glaring example is the western Pacific warm pool. They are not measuring coastal sea levels where people live. In fact, the satellite radar altimetry measurements specifically reject measurements within 50 km of a coast.
All of this means that radar altimetry is useless for measuring sea level that makes any difference to infrastructure planners. It is only useful as another CAGW bogeyman. The University of Colorado even admits this here, (my emphasis):
“GMSL is a good indicator of changes in the volume of water in the oceans due to mass influx (e.g., land ice melt) and density changes (e.g., thermal expansion), and is therefore of interest in detecting climate change.”
Coastal infrastructure planners don’t care about volume, they care about depth, at the shore, at high tide, and that has nothing to do with “climate change”.

"If you could ask British insects about the habitats they prefer, they’d probably tell you that you can’t improve on grassland that’s rich with wildflowers. For farmers, though, grassland is said to be “improved” if it has been treated with fertiliser and sown with fast growing grasses.  “Unimproved” grasslands are those that have not had their productivity improved for agriculture. They’re semi-natural habitats, because if mowing or grazing stopped, they’d quickly turn to scrub and then woodland. These unimproved grasslands are extremely rich in the number of species they can support, sometimes having well over 40 species of flowering plant in a single square metre.  But since World War II, 97% of unimproved grassland habitats have vanished from the UK. This has contributed to the loss of pollinating insects – and the distribution of one third of species has shrunk since 1980.

      Insects: species that prefer crops prosper while majority decline


 If you’re lucky enough to have a garden, your lawn can be thought of as a small patch of artificial grassland, which will usually have only a few species of turf grass. Most suburbs and villages still have around a quarter to a third of their area covered by grass.  Unfortunately, lawns are largely featureless and offer little refuge for small creatures like bugs and other invertebrates. Regular mowing also prevents plants from flowering and producing seeds, which is why carefully maintained lawns are mostly barren.  But lawns can be made into important wildlife habitat by changing how they’re managed. This is an idea that’s gaining traction – campaigns such as “Say No to the Mow” have made an “unkempt” garden more socially acceptable. For anyone wanting to create a wildlife lawn in their garden, there are four important steps to follow. The first step is simple. By raising the height that the mower blade cuts the grass to its highest setting – usually about 4 cm off the ground – you can provide more variety in the lawn’s structure and more refuge for other plant and invertebrate species.  By mowing less often you can allow plants time to flower and provide a food source for bees and other pollinators. Leaving gaps between mowing in spring gives time for species like the cowslip to flower – a plant which has declined markedly in the UK but which butterflies like the Duke of Burgundy depend on for laying their eggs.  Summer gaps can allow species like cat’s ear and fox-and-cubs time to flower, providing an important source of food for species of leafcutter bee. Deciding how long to wait between mowing isn’t an exact science, but can be judged by seeing whether or not the plants in your lawn have had a chance to flower.  “Weed and feeds” are used on lawns in a one-bottle mix of herbicide – used to kill non-grass species that we’d usually consider weeds – and fertiliser, to add nutrients to the soil. Herbicides reduce biodiversity by killing other species, but it may surprise you to learn that fertilisers are no friend to biodiversity either. When gardening or farming, usually the more fertility in the soil the better, because this promotes greater productivity. In other words, more grass, greener grass, more flowers and larger flowers. The selective actions of the gardener or farmer to promote the target species, whether prized rose or crop, means that only the target species benefits.  Without this selectivity, more fertility in your lawn only favours the one or two turf species that are best able to take up nutrients and outcompete other species. So, more fertility means fewer plant species, despite the more luxuriant green colour. Removing the grass clippings after you’ve mowed the lawn also reduces the fertility in your lawn, preventing it from becoming dominated by one or two competitive turf species. Removing and composting grass clippings will gradually remove nutrients from the soil, lowering the fertility with each cut.  Beyond these four steps for improving the value of your lawn to wildlife, there are other things that can be done by the more committed gardener. Leaving small areas of the lawn deliberately uncut – such as strips at the sides or patches in the corners – can help small wildflower meadows to form. Cutting these at the end of summer will prevent them overgrowing into rank grassland with few species.  Wildlife value can also be added by spreading some locally-sourced wildflower seed on your lawn. If you’re gathering seeds from elsewhere, make sure to ask permission and don’t take too much. Wildflower lawns can have a variety of other surprising benefits, not least helping to slow global warming. Some studies have shown that lawns are actually sources of carbon dioxide due to the amount of energy needed to power the mower and manufacture “weed and feeds”. Reducing how often you mow, not applying “weed and feeds” and even using a manual lawn mower can change your lawn from a carbon source to a carbon sink.  Having taller vegetation in your lawn shades the ground, thereby reducing evaporation from the soil and reducing the need for sprinklers and hosepipes. Less mowing means less work to do and more time for you to enjoy watching the bees gathering nectar and pollen from your wildflower lawn.  Wildflower lawns, with spikes of colourful flowers and attendant bees, at least to my eyes, are far prettier than a carpet of grass, whether it’s stripy or not. Grass – especially when not in flower – is the most aesthetically boring part of a grassland. The species that have traditionally been disregarded as “weeds” are far more interesting.

"The conservative International Energy Agency in May warned against governments developing Covid-19 recovery plans that back fossil fuels for fear they’d expose nations to “escalating financial, health and social risks”. The thinking is sound. Unfortunately, governments seem incapable of learning from past catastrophes, or thinking long term and strategically to prepare better for those to come. Covid-19 is very much a dress rehearsal for what awaits us with climate if governments continue to ignore the science, and the policy demands for an effective response.Last summer’s devastating bushfires proved Australians are highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. So too are our insurers. As of 23 January the Insurance Council of Australia had tallied 20,000 bushfire-related claims, with insured losses estimated at A$1.65bn.  Climate change carries massive business risks, and acting to reduce emissions is in the best interests of insurance companies. Thermal coal is the biggest single contributor to climate change. Reliable modelling and analysis suggest that at least 90% of existing coal reserves can’t be mined for electricity generation if we are to meet the imperative of a low carbon world by mid-century. Renewable energy is now cheaper and a safer bet for investors. Nineteen of the world’s largest insurance companies have now adopted policies ending or limiting cover for, and investment in, coal projects. As some insurance companies begin to take much-needed responsibility and act on climate change by restricting their involvement in coal projects, insurance brokers, who arrange insurance deals for big corporates, can no longer sit on the fence. Brokers need to lead from the front by refusing to arrange insurance for new coal projects that are fuelling dangerous climate change, such as Adani’s controversial Carmichael mine. Global insurance giant Marsh has a unique opportunity to be a global leader. Marsh has acted as a broker for Adani mining since 2015, helping to facilitate Adani’s controversial Carmichael coal project. Adani’s giant coalmine will help open up the Galilee Basin, one of the largest unexploited coal reserves on Earth, making it impossible to limit warming to 2C. Marsh has been vocal in acknowledging the huge risks climate change poses to the insurance industry. It co-authored the 2020 World Economic Forum’s Global Risks Report that highlights the economic and environmental vulnerabilities of not acting to rapidly reduce emissions. Dan Glaser, the president and chief executive officer at Marsh, has publicly spoken about climate change as one of the top risks for the company, particularly in relation to the climate-driven impacts of wildfires and hurricanes and the costs for the insurance industry. Marsh talks the talk when it comes to climate risk but, by working with Adani to help broker insurance for the Carmichael coal project, it is walking us all into a dangerous future. In March, staff bravely raised concerns about their company’s involvement in the project and were told senior US executives were meeting to decide a position on the Carmichael mine and Marsh’s involvement with other coal projects. At their AGM this week, Marsh is expected to announce a new climate policy. By continuing to provide support for new coal projects such as Adani’s, Marsh is not only jeopardising the future of its own business interests and those of its customers, it is also undermining a safe climate for future generations. The insurance industry and global markets are moving away from coal. Westpac recently announced plans to divest from thermal coal by 2030 and 16 major insurers – including Allianz, AXA and Swiss Re – have so far refused to underwrite the Adani Carmichael project. It’s time for brokers like Marsh to join them by ruling out brokering insurance for Adani. Marsh must insure our children’s future against catastrophic climate damage, not a billionaire’s coalmine that will rob future generations of a safe climate and drive up risks for the entire insurance industry. • Dr John Hewson is an honorary professor at the Crawford School of Public Policy, Australian National University, and a former leader of the Liberal party"
"Alan Jones breached broadcasting codes for decency in his use of “violent metaphors” about New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern and accuracy in his comments about climate change, the media watchdog has found days before the shock-jock retires after a 35-year career. The Australian Communications and Media Authority ordered the 79-year-old to make an on-air correction about the climate change comments but found he has already apologised for his criticism of Ardern. Jones said on air on Thursday morning that he had incorrectly asserted that biomass is a fossil fuel. The Acma found he presented figures relating to Australia and New Zealand’s percentage of energy use from solar and wind that were incorrect. The now infamous August 2019 broadcast – which led to an unprecedented advertiser boycott – attracted more than 125 complaints and was found to have “offended against generally accepted community standards of decency”. The offensive statements included: “I just wonder whether Scott Morrison’s going to be fully briefed to shove a sock down her throat”, “Now I hope Scott Morrison gets tough here with a few backhanders”, and “I hope he goes for the throat this morning.” Jones is retiring just one year into a two-year $8m contract with Nine Radio after an advertiser boycott stripped 50% of the show’s revenue and caused the entire network to suffer. His advertisers were targeted by social media activists Sleeping Giants and Mad Fucking Witches after the Ardern comments last year. The Acma chair Nerida O’Loughlin said the comments were not appropriate for public radio broadcasting in today’s Australia. “The repeated use of violent metaphors by Mr Jones and his apparent encouragement of aggressive silencing of Ms Ardern was highly offensive and did not meet contemporary community expectations,” O’Loughlin said. “This was evident in the public display of outrage from the community, actions by advertisers and actions by then chairman of Macquarie Media who publicly stated any recurrence of this type of comment would result in the termination of Mr Jones’ contract.” Because Jones made an on-air and a written apology and received counselling from management, no further action was taken on the decency breaches. “Given the imminent retirement of Mr Jones from 2GB and the actions taken by Macquarie Media and Mr Jones at the time, the Acma is not taking further action against the licensee for breach of the decency rules,” O’Loughlin said. Jones did not use like-for-like data in his statements about climate change policy, the authority found, in contravention of the industry code which requires broadcasters to “use reasonable efforts to ensure the facts they are presenting are accurate”. “The factual error and inconsistent information were used to incorrectly portray that Australia generates more of its energy from renewables than New Zealand,” O’Loughlin said. His retirement comes nine months after the station’s management said Jones was on his final warning for offensive comments and took the unprecedented step of scolding him publicly. Despite dominating breakfast radio in Sydney for 35 years, recording an unequalled 226 survey wins, his conduct on air has led to the radio station losing advertisers and haemorrhaging revenue. The incident will be used in staff training at 2GB, the authority said."
"**A ""high proportion"" of planned operations at a city hospital have been cancelled due to record numbers of coronavirus patients.**
The NHS trust which runs Bristol Royal Infirmary (BRI) has told board members it is under ""significant pressure"".
Chief executive Robert Woolley added: ""We are in excess of the first wave, without doubt.""
Only urgent treatment is going ahead such as cancer surgery, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.
Mr Woolley, of the University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust (UHBT) said pressure on critical care facilities and ward beds had led to cancellations.
""We are making every effort to make as much elective planned care as we can but it is true that we are seeing a higher proportion of cancellations of surgery than we would like.
""We have very little in the way of lower priority elective care going on, particularly at the BRI.
""We are maintaining as much of the high-priority elective surgery, particular cancer surgery, as we can,"" he added.
The Nightingale Bristol hospital is being used for children's day case and outpatient procedures and the trust is also commissioning 300 community beds to help discharge patients more effectively.
Mr Woolley also said that the trust has increased the number of patients assigned to each nurse in general wards from six to 10 during the day.
The new ratio, which applies at the BRI and Weston General Hospital, has gone up during night shifts from eight to 12.
The chief executive reassured board members that it is was not a permanent measure and was introduced so that more nurses could care for coronavirus patients on ventilators.
""I know that has created some concern across the trust but it has been done as a very temporary measure in a very considered way, taking account of the balance of safety risks for patients and staff right across the trust,"" he added.

You really need to understand the anti-car attitude that this government has got. We really do need to be concerned about this. While I have nothing against electric cars in principle, acknowledging that they will work well for some people, clearly they will not work for everyone. They simply do not have the range, the power or the towing capacity to replace every other vehicle on the road. 



I cannot see a problem with making them available for those that want them, although I am absolutely against them being subsidised by taxpayers. I envisage that, in a few years time, there will be quite a few electric vehicles on our roads, and so long as everyone who wants to drive a non-electric vehicle still has the choice to do so, then I have no problem with them. 



Our government has a different view, however, and is anxious to take away any choice in the matter. Once again, practicality takes second place to ideology, as this hopeless government once again tries to take away all options, except one.



Associate Transport Minister Julie Anne Genter ordered an investigation into a total ban on petrol car imports by 2035 among a range of options to reduce emissions in the national transport fleet.



An array of documents, including an excerpt from a draft cabinet paper from April last year, reveal Genter instructed officials to work on the policy, before scrapping the plan.



Thankfully, this government will be nowhere near power by 2035, but that is hardly the point. Once again, ideology rides roughshod over reality, and we could have been in real trouble because of this bunch of idealistic idiots.



A Ministry of Transport (MoT) report from September last year showed officials had been instructed to “progress an initiative to regulate an end-date of 2035 to the import of light vehicles that are unable to be driven without fossil-fuels”.



 **In other words, Genter wanted to ban the import of all cars which still use petrol by 2035.**



This was an idea first floated by the independent Productivity Commission, Genter said.



“It’s normal for officials to investigate and recommend a wide range of options to ministers,” she told the Herald in a statement.



Maybe, but to ban cars that are powered by fossil fuels even though there is quite simply no way that electric vehicles will be sufficiently advanced to replace all cars, utes, vans and trucks by that time is madness.



Then there is the small but somewhat inconvenient fact that the national grid will simply never cope with the extra load required if everyone suddenly started driving electric cars. And why not? Because the Greens will not allow any new dams to be built.





But, due to the “lack of information, time and resources”, the cost-benefit analysis was not able to take a number of key issues into consideration.



For example, how such a ban would affect EVs was not looked into, nor was the impacts on electricity prices and the road safety impacts of changing New Zealand’s vehicle fleet so dramatically.



The report said the main benefit for consumers would be the saving people would make when it comes to not having to buy petrol.



Fantastic… but then there is the very small question of replacing the battery on the EV every 5 years or so, at an approximate cost of $30,000 each time. Nobody is saving anything by doing this. We are all being taken for fools.



Genter’s proposal was never taken to Cabinet – “it was rejected and ruled out”. 



National transport spokesman Chris Bishop said **the fact a cabinet paper was produced showed she was working behind closed doors to change the law.**



  
“Reducing emissions from our vehicle fleet is an important step in the fight against climate change.  
“But it would be irresponsible to make petrol cars illegal so soon without a solid plan to help people into electric vehicles,” he said.



  
We all know how Julie Anne Genter likes to work in secret, even though she is part of our ‘open and transparent government. Her letter to Phil Twyford about Wellington’s transport woes still has not been released, and she is dying in a ditch to keep it that way. And now this.



Chris Bishop is my local MP, and I have a lot of respect for him, but I disagree with him over this. Electric vehicles will never be a ‘one size fits all,’ and it is all very well to say that they reduce emissions, but that completely ignores their carbon footprint during the manufacturing stage, not to mention the disposal of batteries. That will be the next ecological headache that no one seems to have foreseen.



I am all for being given choices. If someone wants to buy an EV, let them do it, but let them pay the full price, without taxpayer subsidies. But for a government that is completely ideologically driven, and which is completely blinkered in their view of the world, this is a dangerous precedent. Okay, the plan may have been scrapped… this time. How long will it be before it rears its ugly head again?



Remember, this is from an associate minister of transport who calls people who want to drive – presumably including driving EVs – ‘car fascists’. That tells you all you need to know.

In the above interview, Julie Anne Genter (to use a vulgar phrase) got her arse handed to her by the very polite Peter Williams. She was asked about points made in Troy Bowker’s [NZ Herald article](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/09/nz-herald-tells-the-truth/) and her response was that it was fake news and that it is just the fossil fuel industry spreading misinformation. No doubt Bowker will respond to her accusations in a second article which I look forward to reading.



In the interview Genter spoke almost continuously and seemed to think that if she talked fast enough people wouldn’t notice that she didn’t answer the question or that what she was saying wasn’t true.



She deflected, distracted and talked and talked until finally, she had had enough of the hard questions and used the excuse that she had to go to another meeting and very abruptly hung up. 



She didn’t answer any of the questions put to her properly. She tried the fake news claim and said that Troy was part of the fossil fuel industry. She tried to claim when challenged about cobalt being mined by child labour for batteries that cobalt was not part of all batteries, that its in other things and, that of course, New Zealand follows UN guidelines on child labour. It was hard to believe that claim since in the same breath she was also claiming without evidence that our railways are profitable! It is claims like that one that reminds us that she is an American import since any born and bred Kiwi would know that our railways have never ever been profitable.



Another stand out from the interview was her statement that the ministry for the environment is looking at recycling the waste. **In other words, they don’t have a solution.** She also claimed that the Climate emergency is real and we have to act now because in 10 – 12 years it will be too late. Someone needs to remind her that most of the world believed that the world was flat… until they didn’t.

"As the climate crisis is increasingly felt across the globe, protesters take to the streets and politicians scrabble to respond, a crucial question is beginning to emerge. How can governments develop climate strategies which build public support for action? An announcement by six UK parliamentary committees that they will hold a citizens’ assembly on the climate emergency is a crucial step toward answering that question. There are no shortage of prescriptions for climate action. From economists calling for an economy-wide carbon tax, to scientists advocating “earth system governance” at the planetary level, there are experts assuring us that they have strategies to cut greenhouse gas emissions quickly and effectively. But there’s a dangerous illusion sitting behind these prescriptions – what the social scientist Maarten Hajer called the illusion of “cockpitism”. Cockpitism describes the assumption that you can dictate climate solutions the same way a pilot might fly a plane, sitting in the cockpit charting the most efficient course, with perfectly calibrated instruments and levers. This illusion is very problematic – and not just because the climate system is an entity far more complex than a plane. It is problematic because it cuts people out. It is a seemingly apolitical view that self-defined “experts” can decide what is best for people and impose those solutions. At its most extreme, it suggests that democracy is the problem, not the solution – as veteran earth scientist James Lovelock once said, “climate change may be an issue as severe as a war. It may be necessary to put democracy on hold for a while.” My own research suggests that the opposite is true. To tackle the climate crisis, we need more, and better, democracy, not less. My interviews with politicians showed that they were convinced of the need for action on climate, but did not know what support there would be from the electorate. As one told me: “I’ve had tens of thousands of conversations with voters, and I just don’t have conversations about climate change.”  But this may be about to change, as we know from polling data that generalised concern about climate change is now at an all-time high. Yet how does this translate into support for far-reaching climate action? Would people be more likely to support locally based programmes, with powers given to cities and towns to cut emissions? Would there be support for introducing a ban on petrol and diesel vehicles, over the next decade? Would people support higher taxes on carbon, if the money was invested in low-carbon solutions and support for vulnerable households? And crucially, how could this all link together into a credible, effective climate strategy that would build the mandate for further action toward a net-zero carbon target? This is where processes such as a citizens’ assembly, or other deliberative processes such as citizens’ juries or deliberative workshops, can help. These processes allow a representative group of citizens to meet with experts on equal terms, assess evidence, debate and suggest solutions. They are not a substitute for electoral politics, but they provide a more nuanced and detailed understanding of voters’ viewpoints than traditional political polling or focus groups.  At the recent Citizens’ Assembly on climate change held in Ireland, citizens offered up a surprisingly radical and confident set of suggestions, most of which the government is now taking forward. In the UK, many local areas are now setting up deliberative processes to decide their own next steps on climate. Done well, such processes can help to develop a more inclusive, less divisive politics, countering the distrust of “experts” and allowing a constant interplay between the views and values of the public and politicians. A citizens’ assembly is not a panacea. Deliberation won’t, in and of itself, solve the problem. We need far-reaching action which will require radical policy and confrontation of vested interests. But this policy and action will only be achievable if people understand and support it. The more we find out about how to build a public mandate for climate action, and the more we include people in genuine debate and deliberation, the more likely we are to find a way through the climate crisis. If it’s not democratic, it’s not realistic. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter. Climate change is inevitable. Our response to it isn’t."

Harvey. Irma. Maria. Michael. Four strong (category 3 or higher) hurricanes in 14 months. Something is happening, right?   
  
When category 4 hurricane Harvey banged into Rockport, Texas, and then decided to hang around for five days visiting the fine folks of Houston and vicinity, it broke the 11.8 year “hurricane drought”, by far the longest period in the record without a major (category 3 or higher) landfall.[1],[2] Because of its unfortunate stall, Harvey also broke the record for a single-storm rainfall in the U.S., with 60.58 inches at Nederland, Texas.   
  
What about a human influence from dreaded carbon dioxide? The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations (NOAA) Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) dryly stated on September 20:   




In the Atlantic, it is premature to conclude that human activities–and particularly greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming–have already had a detectable impact on hurricane activity.



This was from a GFDL publication “Global Warming and Hurricanes”. This is a frequently revised publication designed to keep readers current with the evolving scientific literature on the subject, but the statement about prematurity has been in the document for many years.   
  
But wait. Everything else being equal,[3] (“EEBE”) hurricanes—and their generic name, tropical cyclones—acquire their energy from warm water, and, globally, sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are around 0.5°C warmer than they were when the data become reliable around 1880. There was a decline of around 0.3°C from then to the low point in the record, around 1910, which means from bottom to top (1910 to 2016) there’s a change of around 0.8°C for the past 100 years or so.   
  
There’s usually not enough energy to fuel a tropical cyclone if the ocean’s upper layer temperature is less than 26.5°C which limits their “seasons” to the late summer and early fall in each hemisphere, with the exception of the western Pacific, where there’s enough warm water to spin up storms year-round, although the maximum occurs at nearly the same time as it does in the North Atlantic. Owing to climatologically cooler temperatures, there are very few tropical cyclones in the South Atlantic.   
  
Beyond the threshold, increasing the oceanic heat content (i.e. the vertically integrated temperature) should, EEBE, increase either the number of storms (holding their power constant), or their power (holding the number constant).   
  
Meteorology wizard (and Cato adjunct scholar) Ryan Maue’s relatively recent PhD from Florida State was squarely over the bridge between tropical and temperate-zone storm climatology. Ryan knows hurricanes, and, beginning in grad school, has generated the comprehensive history of global tropical cyclone power. Although some tropical cyclones occur in pretty remote places, the onset of global weather satellite coverage in 1970 means his record is largely complete   
  
Obviously EE is not E. Despite an SST rise of nearly 0.5°C since 1970 and a global surface temperature rise of around 0.65°C[4], there’s simply no warming-related trend in tropical cyclone power:   






_Figure 1. Maue’s Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) Index shows no changes that can be related to overall temperature trends since 1970. Figures are 24-month moving averages. The top circles are for the globe, and the bottom ones for the Northern Hemisphere. If you’re paying attention, the space between the two gives the ACE index for the Southern Hemisphere._   
  
As Roy Spencer (www.drroyspencer.com) recently has shown, there’s been a decline in the number of category 3 or higher storms hitting the coterminous US.   






_Figure 2. Roy Spencer’s plot of major (category 3 or higher) hurricanes hitting the lower-48 states. Note that there’s still two years to go for the decade beginning in 2011. There certainly could be more by 2020; if we take the historical average frequency of major hurricane hits and add that in, there’s nearly a 50-50 chance that the actual number will be four instead of three. Does not include two strikes in Puerto Rico (Cat 4 Maria last year and Cat 3 Hugo in 1989)._   
  
**Historical Perspectives**   
  
The 2014 “National Assessment of Climate Change Impacts on the United States” made a big deal out of a seemingly large increase in the hurricane Power Dissipation Index. The principal difference between it and Maue’s Accumulated Cyclone Energy index is the PDI uses the cube of the wind speed while the ACE index uses the square. The National Assessment highlighted a rise from 1980 through 2009. But the authors certainly had data through 2013 at their disposal.   
  
There is also is another record of Atlantic hurricanes back to 1851, called HURDAT and put together by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Hurricane Research Division. Prior to satellites (pre-1970) and aircraft reconnaissance (beginning in World War II), it would likely to have missed some storms, but HURDAT is about a complete a record as can be generated. Further, any errors in it are likely to be omissions of storms rather than calling ones that actually didn’t exist.   
  
Ryan Maue used HURDAT and calculated the PDI back to 1920, and his analysis shows that the 2014 National Assessment picked a rather prominent cherry when it decided to emphasize the 1980-2009 rise.   






_Figure 3. North Atlantic hurricane Power Dissipation Index (PDI). Despite being published in 2014, the most recent National Assessment emphasized the period 1980-2009, displaying an upward trend line during that time. It’s quite clear that the increase from the 40s to the early 60s is quite similar to what was displayed in the Assessment._   
  
Roy Spencer recently looked at the frequency and windspeed of landfalling Category 3 or higher storms striking Florida. There’s obviously no trend, either in intensity or in frequency.   






_Figure 4. Category 3 strikes in Florida since 1900, along with highest sustained winds. Maximum gust speeds are higher. Category 3 hurricane Matthew in 2016 is not listed as the center never crossed the coast—but the Cape Canaveral area was very close to the western eyewall, and experienced considerable damage._   
  
**Hurricane Damages**   
  
Colorado State’s Phil Klotzbach and three co-authors recently published what should be the last word on U.S. hurricane frequency and damages. One of the co-authors was University of Colorado’s Roger Pielke, Jr., who contributed a plot of what he calls “normalized hurricane damage”, which essentially projects current property values onto past hurricanes.   
  
Again, there is no significant trend. 2017 had the third-highest normalized damage total in the continental US (note that does not include Puerto Rico), around $130 billion. That pales, compared to 1926, when total damages would have been around $230 billion for today’s property values.   






All in all, recent hurricane activity isn’t particularly remarkable. Following a record 11.8-year major hurricane drought, recent activity is surely impressive, but imparts no overall trend when viewed in terms of the entire record since 1900. Further, Maue’s global accumulated cyclone energy, going back to 1970 (the start of global weather satellite coverage), shows no relationship to global surface temperature. 2018 appears to be a record for activity (not number) in one basin—the Eastern North Pacific, but, again, that isn’t going to impart a trend.

"At the time of writing, it is 77 days since Australia’s prime minister, Scott Morrison, mentioned climate change in his official transcripts. The last mention came at the tail end of Australia’s disastrous Black Summer bushfires when Morrison declared that his government will not be adopting a “net zero by 2050” target, in favour of a “technology roadmap”. Since that moment, the world has changed. Hundreds of thousands of people have lost their lives to a frighteningly infectious new virus. And as countries around the world begin to toy with the thought of recovery, there are increasing efforts to ensure our climb out of the hole comes paired with a permanent shift towards a deeper decoupling from our current heavy reliance on fossil fuels.  The pandemic is changing us, but not all of us. After climate-intensified bushfires tore through Australia, the government’s position on climate remained utterly unchanged, as did the opposition party’s support for the large-scale extraction and sale of fossil fuels. The pandemic, and the opportunity that recovery brings for wholesale reimagination of our relationship with energy has landed with a dull, unceremonious thud. It is a stark reminder of what we need to do to bring about true change within one of the planet’s most carbon-intensive countries. For several months now, Australia’s energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, has been insisting on a “tech, not taxes” approach to climate policy. This shuns concepts like net zero targets, and opts instead for the incentivisation of technological advancements (using money acquired through taxation, strangely enough). To help develop this philosophy, Taylor opted to hold a secretive review of the government’s emissions reduction fund (ERF) policy, in which public money is handed to projects that suck carbon out of the air, alongside the establishment of “baselines” for high emitters. It was helmed by former head of Origin Energy Grant King, who is also former director of Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association Ltd (Appea) and BHP Billiton. The King review puts forward a range of tweaks to the ERF that seem likely to create far more problems than they solve. Historically, baselines have been weak and flexible, meaning large emitters simply chug along as normal without consequence. The new policy proposals include the prospect of tradable rewards for those that have emissions well underneath their baselines. But if those baselines are set ludicrously high already, this might simply become a conduit for taxpayer funding for high emitters. The prioritisation of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, which stores emissions before they are released into the atmosphere, is where things go from potentially problematic to verifiably disastrous. The review suggests two major agencies – the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena, a former employer of mine) and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) – change their remit so they can fund CCS (normally excluded due to the fact it is not zero emissions). This is in addition to opening up the ERF for potentially funding CCS projects too. “Technology neutral” is the plea here, but this phrase has always been an infuriating euphemism for “can we just ignore emissions, please?” The King review and Taylor’s response to it are not neutral: these are active efforts to shift focus away from cheap, effective emissions reductions and towards expensive, ineffective emissions reductions. Carbon capture and storage is the preferred vehicle for perpetual climate delay. It is an eternal gravity well for public money with nearly nothing to show for it. To invest heavily in this instead of working towards fully decarbonising electricity and transport is like eating a crab with a gold-plated baby spoon, and then shrugging with feigned surprise as you stab pointlessly at the shell. CCS is not “low emissions”. Those insufficient emissions reductions come at an incredible cost, even when emissions reductions from wind and solar are becoming ludicrously cheap. “The only way CCS on coal will ever be built at scale is with a carbon price so high it’d kill the rest of the coal sector,” wrote energy expert Simon Holmes à Court.  The prospects for CCS are so dire that Australia’s coal lobby, the Minerals Council of Australia, ended up taking the funds it set aside for CCS research (“Coal21”) and redirected them to an advertising campaign for coal. CCS may have some niche applications, but to be put forward as the main show for climate action is a clear plan for intentional failure. To be funding it instead of integrating new wind and solar and leaving fossil fuel fuels in the ground is to loudly declare an intent to delay climate action as long as possible. As I wrote here, this has been happening for a while. Leaked notes from a 2004 government meeting with the fossil fuel industry declare that: [The prime minister] advised that he had interest in government and companies addressing the issues together in the establishment of a low emissions energy fund. This would be focused on accelerating Super Dooper (his words) technology progress aimed at significantly reducing emissions.” The fossil fuels industry was wringing its hands about the effectiveness of wind and solar and urging the blocking of any policy supporting them, while pleading for cash injections for CCS. In fact, John Howard’s original clean energy target scheme, put forward in 2007, included CCS in its subsidy remit. I don’t want to be writing this article again in 2034. As this debate about technology and recovery plays out, the government will no doubt reactivate its dog-eared, well-worn lines about strong climate action being toxic for the economy and jobs. There is a simple way to break this infinite loop of industry sabotage and government malfeasance, and to shatter the tactic of using ineffective technology as a conduit for eternal inaction. Climate action that brings both immediate benefits and long-term benefits is the key, here. We know, with confidence, which technologies are duds, and which are likely to serve as the workhorses of climate action. But the pandemic is highlighting that broader factors like justice, equity and fairness are on our minds, at a time of stress and economic pressure. We know that climate action is beneficial for human life even when you exclude the impacts of reduced emissions on the Earth’s atmospheric and ocean systems. The air is cleaner, the power is cheaper and more democratised, the transport is more accessible, and business and investment work better. Good climate action won’t happen until the infinite loop is broken. We know that we can’t wait for the next crisis – and there will be many, in the coming years – to snap those locked into inaction out of their stupor. We must build a better case for the immediate curative power of climate action. • Ketan Joshi is a freelance writer specialising in climate and energy, formerly having worked for private and government (including the Arena) clean energy organisations in Australia.

"**The wearing of face masks in Jersey shops will be legally required from Tuesday at 10:00 GMT.**
Anyone older than 12 years old going into an indoor workplace as a customer must wear one, unless exempt for medical or disability reasons, the Government of Jersey said.
Failure to wear a mask could lead to a fine of up to Â£1,000.
The States Assembly voted to give ministers the power to introduce laws mandating masks on 24 November.
Mask-use will be compulsory in indoor public spaces which cannot guarantee physical distancing or other public health measures, including:
Mask exemption cards will be available for people whose health conditions mean they cannot wear them safely.
Application forms will be available online and in public locations, including parish halls, larger supermarkets and the bus station.
The law also includes a provision requiring passengers and drivers in taxis to wear masks, except where their use might impede safe driving.
This is also advised for car journeys involving people from different households, but is not required.
Masks remain strongly advised when close contact between people who do not live together is likely, particularly if it is likely to be for longer than 15 minutes, the government said.
Health minister Richard Renouf argued the law was needed to combat rising winter case numbers and the ""mixed success"" of the government's ""strong recommendation"" for indoor mask use.
He said: ""We are doing all we can to protect islanders and our health care system, while also keeping the island functioning as far as possible.""
Ministers have also been given the power to impose restrictions on gatherings of more than 10 people but ministers have not yet enacted this - current guidance suggests a limit of 10 for indoor gatherings.
An order to limit gatherings in the island in some capacity will be ""signed as soon as it is ready"", the government said."
"“The political moment is now” to address the climate risks posed by the aviation industry, analysts, insiders and campaigners say, as governments across the world weigh up bailouts for airlines grounded by the coronavirus pandemic. Rescue packages need to come with green strings, such as reduced carbon footprints and frequent flyer levies, they warn, or the sector will return to the path that has made it the fastest rising source of climate-wrecking carbon emissions over the past decade.  Old passenger jets also need to be rapidly retired or cheap oil prices will encourage budget airlines to run services almost empty, which could push up emissions even if passenger numbers stay low, they say. As did banks after the 2008-9 financial crisis, many aviation companies are appealing for government support to escape from a problem they partly caused. The expansion of flight networks, packed seating and a reluctance to accept quarantine measures have contributed to the rapid transmission of the Covid-19 virus across the globe. Until the pandemic, governments were so focused on keeping airlines globally competitive that they largely gave the sector a free ride in terms of emissions cuts and contributions to public revenues. Aviation fuel is completely untaxed in most countries. But the crisis has weakened airline claims that they should be treated as profit-seeking independent companies rather than public entities with social responsibilities. Thousands of planes have been grounded for two months. Even if the lockdown is lifted soon, the industry expects revenues to halve this year. Many airlines are now begging for taxpayer support. European governments have agreed €12.7bn (£11.35bn) in bailouts, with another €17.1bn under discussion, according to a tracker compiled by Carbon Market Watch, Greenpeace and Transport & Environment. The US approved $25bn (£20.6bn) support for the industry in April. If public funds are used to save companies, there is a growing argument that society should get something in return in terms of environmental improvements. Hopes were raised when the French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said Air France would have to become “the greenest airline in the world” in return for a €7bn bailout. This meant reducing the carbon intensity of their overall operations by 50% by 2030, cutting absolute emissions within France by half by 2030, using 2% renewable jet fuel by 2024 and drastically reducing the number of flights of less than 2hr 30mins duration that compete with rail services. Although these conditions are currently non-binding, campaigners said they were hopeful they will be supported by new laws in the coming years. Andrew Murphy, an aviation policy officer at the NGO Transport & Environment, said this could be a turning point after decades of inaction. “Before the Covid crisis, aviation emissions were going in the wrong direction. This is a moment that has shaken up the industry and raised questions about subsidies, tax breaks, and frequent flying. It is an opportunity for governments to think how they support the airline industry.” He said he was also encouraged the UK has not yet committed public funds to bail out airlines, which would gives them the incentive to put planes back in the sky too soon. A more important step, he said, would be for government to include aviation emissions in their climate targets. “It’s not sexy, but it’s very important,” he said. “Without this, nations’ climate calculations are based on dodgy accounting, as Greta [Thunberg] pointed out when she was in the UK last year.” Some environmentalists such as George Monbiot argue airlines should not be rescued. This is echoed by Extinction Rebellion. “With 90% of UK planes grounded, and knowing we need to halt polluting industries, there can be no justification for the government to financially support restarting flights. Let’s embed this change rather than bail out this destructive industry and its tax-avoiding owners,” the group’s UK spokesperson, Sarah Lunnon, said. Other climate campaign organisations, including Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace, say bailouts are only acceptable if they come with green conditions. They say airline companies should pay a fair share of taxes and not rely on offsets to reduce emissions, as they are currently doing. Among the measures they propose are fuel taxes on domestic flights (which are currently tax free) and the introduction of a frequent flier levy. In the UK, 15% of people take 70% of flights. Globally, only 3% of the world’s 7.6bn population flies frequently. “If governments want to address the twin challenges of Covid and climate change, the political moment is now,” says Dan Rutherford, aviation director at the International Council on Clean Transportation. “Policies to curb frequent flying could benefit both public health and the global environment.” He said passengers should also be given information about the carbon costs of their flights, which would allow them to support more efficient airlines. The difference between companies can be as much as 80% on the same city-to-city flight depending on the type of aircraft, load factors and routes. Even before the pandemic, the airline industry was feeling public pressure from “the Greta effect”, direct action by Extinction Rebellion and the high court decision to block Heathrow expansion because it posed unacceptable climate risks. The Heathrow chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, said the UK should build back better after the Covid-19 crisis. “The government can accelerate the decarbonisation of aviation, by helping to scale up new energy sources, such as sustainable aviation fuels, just as they did successfully for solar and wind. Any company that is bailed out by the government should commit to net-zero emissions well before 2050.” Passenger numbers at the UK’s largest airport fell by 97% in April, prompting hundreds of job losses and fears of many more to follow. British Airways and its parent company AIG did not respond to the Guardian’s request for a comment about their willingness to accept tighter controls on emissions. The UK chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has said he will not treat the aviation industry as a special case, but might consider bailouts on a case-by-case basis. Green party politicians say a clearer position is necessary to help workers in the sector to transition to other jobs. “Whilst a reduction in flying will have a tremendously positive impact on the environment, we need to ensure jobs are created elsewhere for those currently working in the aviation industry,” the Brighton mayor, Alex Phillips, said. “This could mean, for example, that workers are either offered the opportunity to retire in dignity or to retrain in new sectors – whether they be in zero-emission transport or low carbon jobs that we are in need of both now and in the future.” The issue is likely to linger long after the lockdown. The International Air Transport Association says demand for air travel will not recover until 2023 at the earliest. Reduce flights. Demand is unlikely to recover for at least three years so the simplest way to reduce aviation emissions is to have fewer planes in the air. Tax aviation fuel. Initially just for domestic flights so they do not have an unfair advantage against low-emission rail services. Air France has been told it cannot have a bailout unless it phases out flights that compete with train journeys of 2hr 30mins or less. This should later be widened to international flights, which are responsible for 90% of airline emissions in Europe.. Introduce a frequent flyer levy. In the UK, 15% of people take 70% of flights. Globally, only 3% of the world’s 7.8bn population flies frequently. Increasing costs for them would make a bigger difference than asking people to end their annual overseas holiday. Provide transparent data on carbon emissions of flights so customers can avoid less efficient airlines. Few people are currently aware of the data, but the difference can be as much as 80% on the same city-to-city flight depending on the type of aircraft, load factors and routes. Incorporate the aviation sector into national climate targets. Currently the UK’s Climate Change Act only mentions airlines rather than making them part of the country’s emissions calculations, which Thunberg described last year as “extremely creative accounting”. Reduce fleet sizes by scrapping old, gas-guzzling planes. This would also reduce the risk that low petrol prices will prompt budget airlines to rent cheap planes and run them almost empty, which would keep them in business but increase emissions per passenger. Halt airport expansion. Campaigners won an important victory in February when the high court ruled against Heathrow expansion due to the climate risks. But many other airports plan to open new terminals and runways in the UK and elsewhere in the world. Invest in green fuel and tech. The French government has said Air France must use alternatives to fossil fuels for at least 2% of flights by 2024. Norway is pioneering electric planes and biofuel from waste products. Heathrow says the UK government should also promote cleaner fuel."
"**The total number of people dying in the UK is a fifth above normal levels for this time of year, figures show.**
There were 14,276 deaths registered in the week to 20 November - nearly 2,500 higher than the five-year average.
Just over 3,000 of those deaths involved Covid - 199 above the previous week, the data from the national statistics agencies showed.
That rise does though represent a slowing in the increase in Covid deaths that have been seen through the autumn.
The previous week the Covid death toll had jumped by 600.
These figures are based on death certificates that are filled in by doctors.
They differ from the daily figures produced by the government that rely on someone testing positive for Covid.
The two systems are showing very similar numbers in terms of Covid deaths.
Yorkshire and the Humber and the North West saw the highest rates of death during the period.
Sarah Scobie, of the Nuffield Trust, said the death toll ""brings home the reality"" of why continued restrictions are needed.
But she also pointed to the ""untold impact"" of the extra deaths at home - they are around 1,000 higher than normal.
She said this suggests people may not be getting the support they need for other conditions while the NHS is under pressure from Covid."
"The lionfish is a stunning, mesmerising and highly adorned creature that drifts slowly through coral reefs, seemingly unaware of its natural beauty. But it is quickly causing devastation and destruction to the nature it inhabits, decimating biodiversity in the marine environment. The lionfish hails from the warm, marine waters of the South Pacific and Indian oceans. Here it feeds on a huge variety of prey including smaller fish, molluscs and invertebrates, sometimes blowing water to disorient its prey before consuming them.  The most noticeable feature of the lionfish is the line of spines that runs along the length of its body, with more fanning out from the fins. These spines are striped, brown and white, providing a warning colouration to indicate that they are highly venomous, even to humans. This results in few natural predators, with the exception of moray eels and sharks.  In their natural habitat, lionfish are part of a marine ecosystem that has evolved to interact in harmony, with each species playing a vital role. So, how has the lionfish gradually become responsible for creating havoc across the oceans?  Unfortunately, the lionfish has established populations off south-eastern USA, in the Caribbean and more recently, the Mediterranean. Here, they have essentially invaded the area, preying voraciously on native fish species, increasing rapidly in abundance, and expanding over a vast range.  For example, the first lionfish were reported near Florida in 1985 but by 2001 they had become established across the eastern seaboard of the USA, with densities of more than 100 fish per hectare. Lionfish now outnumber native fish across many sites, and in parts of the western Atlantic are over four times as abundant as they are in their native area. It is not known exactly how lionfish populations first colonised these locations, but theories include the intentional release from the aquatic trade, and unintentional release through Hurricane Andrew washing captive specimens into the sea, or via boat ballast tanks accidentally containing specimens. After arriving in a new part of the sea, the lionfish reproduces at an astonishing and alarming rate, capable of spawning every two to three days, all year round. The eggs are released into open water where they hatch and drift in the plankton, before settling onto a reef.  This means there are potentially millions of eggs hitching a ride on the ocean currents for around a month at a time, giving lionfish huge potential to spread fast and wide across a continually moving body of water.  Alongside their voracious appetite – their stomach can expand up to 30 times its size – the local prey are unfamiliar with this new predator, making the new environment an ideal hunting ground. The indirect effects of this include a reduction in prey for the native predators, causing a major imbalance of the ecosystem. The lionfish also has no known natural predators outside of its native range to keep its populations in check. Even predators of eggs and juvenile lionfish across the globe currently remain unknown.  We are left with the only true predator being humans – and the need to cull lionfish is becoming an urgent priority for conservation. There have been many calls from both nature and economic groups, stating that targeted culling of this invasive species is the only effective way to reduce their numbers. There are several ways this can happen. Firstly, recreational scuba divers have been trying to keep numbers in check by culling them. But the venomous nature of lionfish means that divers need to be specially trained. Consequently, groups such as the Fraternal Order Of Lionfish Slayers (FOOLS) have been set up to maintain care for divers who can help reduce the amount of lionfish safely. Some divers are trialling the use of traps to aid safer and more rapid culling of larger numbers. In the Caribbean, the answer to culling has come from researchers at Robots In Service of the Environment (RSE) with their “Lionfish Terminator”.  This robotic zapper has been developed in an attempt to cull lionfish remotely. While there is still a long way to go in terms of full ocean deployment, this could restore the native balance of the ecosystem. However, another way to control lionfish numbers is to eat them. They are quickly becoming a delicacy on restaurant menus, and have also found their way onto supermarket shelves. Hopefully this opportunistic demand will help to reduce their numbers drastically – but even this could be too little too late.  Eventually, as with all invasive species, the lionfish will find its functional niche and the balance of the ecosystem will be restored. But the current invasion into the Mediterranean has sent a ripple through the natural dynamics of predators and prey, with serious effects on local fisheries and tourism.  We cannot simply wait for balance to be restored. We need to restore the health of the regional marine ecosystems and eradicate such a visually alluring threat before the inevitable apocalyptic destruction."

The European Union’s leaders said they wanted the United Kingdom to remain in the EU. But Brussels offered only minimal concessions to British Prime Minister David Cameron, undercutting his effort to sell the benefits of continued EU membership. Now the Eurocrats who dominate EU policy are attempting to push the UK out the door. London should refuse to play their game: slowing down the process would maximize its leverage.



The principal argument for the EU is that it has created a common economic market. The most powerful argument against it is that continental elites are attempting to create a superstate by stealth. The EU’s post‐​vote behavior reinforces this criticism.



The vote to Leave shocked Eurocrats across Europe. Even many Brexit advocates believed that Remain would carry the day. Thus, the UK is just coming to terms with the magnitude of its people’s decision. The British government is not prepared to announce a Brexit program.



However, EU leaders almost immediately began pressing London to act. They want the UK to trigger Article 50, which begins a two‐​year process to renegotiate a departing member’s relationship with the EU. Once taken the decision cannot be reversed. And if no agreement is reached within two years the country is unceremoniously defenestrated without any special access to the European market. The provision almost certainly was drafted to maximize the EU’s leverage.





London should refuse to play their game: slowing down the process would maximize its leverage.



Pushing the Brexit button would be a bad idea. The UK need not hurry. Nothing will change until Article 50 is implemented. The British government should hold off until it is ready.



First, the situation is chaotic. The prime minister is resigning. The opposition leader might be forced to resign. Scotland might again vote for independence. Northern Ireland might be forced to choose between its island neighbor, the Republic of Ireland, and its political home, the UK. No one is ready to discuss Brexit terms.



Second, with both leading parties in flux, waiting would allow a new government and opposition to emerge. The four largest parliamentary parties supported remaining in the EU, so they should attempt to reach a common exit program. While it is difficult to imagine legislators refusing to respect the popular will, how to implement the vote remains to be decided. A new government should be in office first.



Third, the Eurocrats have split between those determined to impose punitive terms in order to discourage other states from leaving and those who prefer to be generous and maximize continued cooperation. Better to let passions cool before beginning negotiations. It is in everyone’s interest to preserve economic relationships and make Britain’s exit as smooth as possible.



Fourth, when the Brexit trigger is pulled is a political, not legal issue. The referendum was advisory. No enabling legislation has been passed. A Leave majority does not exist in Parliament. The existing government and opposition backed staying. Effective negotiations won’t be possible until a government, backed by a stable majority, is prepared to act. Even a new government might want to move slowly, perhaps empaneling a commission of worthies to work through the complicated issues, followed by a public discussion. Indeed, with the Conservatives so badly split while enjoying only a small majority, a new election might be necessary.



Fifth, waiting would increase London’s bargaining power. EU officials are divided over Brexit’s timing. Everyone would like to resolve the UK’s status to promote economic as well as political stability. However, since negotiations most likely will take years, even starting now would have no impact until well into the future. The Eurocrats understand that accelerating the process would put greater pressure on London to make concessions, since a shorter deadline would threaten to leave the UK outside of the EU without any special access to the European market. However, Britain can play the same game by delaying.



Sixth, as passions cool the desire to exact revenge — to punish Britain to discourage other exiteers — likely will fade. German Chancellor Angela Merkel differed from her colleagues, indicating that there is “no reason to be in a way especially nasty during the negotiations.” While punitive measures might provide emotional satisfaction for some, failing to reach an agreement with the world’s fifth and Europe’s second largest economy would hurt everyone. Continued commercial links between the UK and continent are too important to sacrifice in a fit of pique. Ironically, a vengeful, arbitrary Brussels would reinforce the very behavior which has generated popular antipathy. In the meantime London could begin informal chats with other governments in an attempt to build support for a smoother exit.



Seventh, slowing the process would give Washington more time to play a positive role. It should start by indicating its willingness to begin negotiations with the UK over a free trade agreement as soon as the Brits are ready. The U.S. also should indicate that a smoother UK-EU divorce would improve the chances of a U.S.-EU trade pact. The last thing America wants is intra‐​European hostilities.



Eighth, holding off on the official trigger creates at least a possibility of rapprochement between the UK and EU. Brexit just might shock Europe’s leading powers toward serious reforms — blocking further political unification, ensuring democratic accountability, and protecting national sovereignty, for instance. Although a few deluded EU officials speak of accelerating and deepening European integration — “more Europe,” as they say — German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble called the idea “crazy” after the British vote. Donald Tusk, one of the EU’s many presidents (of the European Council), admitted that “ordinary people, the citizens of Europe, do not share our Euro‐​enthusiasm.” Even a “two‐​speed” Europe with countries agreeing to different degrees of integration appears far‐​fetched with populism on the rise across the continent.



The EU will have to work to regain public trust and support. If successful, the EU might even change attitudes in the UK. After all, upcoming elections in several nations could dramatically change the continent’s political climate. Even the French economy minister Emmanuel Macron proposed “to organize a true European referendum in its real sense” on a “new project” and “road map.” That would be unprecedented.



The ultimate impact of Brexit remains to be seen. Much of Europe is aflame, with the political center contracting in one country after another.



In such a world, all parties should allow the passions political battle to cool. Pressure from Brussels on the Cameron government is empty: neither the EU nor other member states can force London to leave. The UK likely will voluntarily yield its turn next year at the rotating Council presidency. The majority could exclude British officials from meetings; the Commission could fire British staff. But London still need not prematurely trigger Brexit.



In fact, slowing down the process would benefit Europe as well as the UK. A hasty, angry negotiation would serve no one. The British vote could change the EU for the better. There’s no need to hurry Brexit.

In his latest article he claims that 2013 December Arctic sea ice is less than 2006 summer sea ice, and is less than every summer before that – probably for the last 1000 years! The chart he presents is as follows:

Do you see how the curve is currently less than what it was in the summer of 2006?
Unfortunately Mr Naam is not able to read a chart correctly and so he draws a totally preposterous conclusion. The chart on which he bases his conclusion is not one that shows absolute Arctic sea ice volume, but one that shows Arctic sea ice volume ANOMALY.
Although it’s possible that there have been years in the last 1000 years where summer volume has actually exceeded the current December 2013 volume, there’s no way in hell that volume now is less than it was in September 2006.
Naam actually gets invited on television as an expert on climate economics and energy policy, see here for example, has over 5000 Twitter followers, has authored books and won awards.
Honest mistakes can happen, and hopefully Naam will issue a correction.

"The former Queensland deputy premier and treasurer, Jackie Trad, says her outspoken progressive views – including a successful push to reform abortion laws – made her the target of a “concerted campaign” by political opponents and media commentators in the state. Trad resigned from the cabinet last week amid an integrity scandal. The state’s corruption watchdog is investigating allegations the influential Labor left MP interfered in the recruitment process for a local school principal.  She tells Guardian Australia – her first interview since standing down – that the past week had been a “bruising time”. In broad-ranging comments about coal and climate, Trad says the sort of partisan “zero-sum” politics that has taken hold in Queensland, including the pre-federal election convoy to the Adani coalmine site, has undermined genuine action to address the climate crisis. Her decision to leave the ministry was made out of concern she would become a distraction for the government in an election year. A contributing factor was the way in which she had become the constant subject of personal and political attacks. “I made that decision in consultation with my husband,” Trad says. “There’s no doubt that I’ve been a target for quite some time and I just didn’t want that to be a distraction for the party that I have worked with and for so long. I didn’t want it to be a distraction for my work in my community. But I also need to take stock. “There’s a concerted campaign against me because I guess I’ve stood up, I’ve stood up for the values my community care about and because there have been positive outcomes in that respect. “I’ve not decided to be a small target. I’ve not decided to sit down and write polite letters and I get that. I get that the LNP have an agenda of payback because of the leadership role I played in the abortion law reform debate.” In some premature political obituaries last week, Trad was described as a “defining influence” on the Palaszczuk government; in others her portrayal was as unpopular, double-crossing, ruthless, self-confident, ambitious, arrogant and dodgy. There’s an investigation into Trad (no findings)on the appointment process of a school principal. Result:10 pgs of Murdoch coverage. I await attention to a)Morrison's involvement in sports rorts b)Morrison misleading parliament on Angus Taylor c)Taylor refusing a police interview pic.twitter.com/LWAfbua71w “There is a particular world view that is pushed by a lot of media outlets – it’s not my world view, it’s not the world view of my community,” Trad says. “There is a characterisation that’s happening that I think completely misses the mark. “There are lots of commentators in the business of politics and the business of government and the media. There are a lot of people wanting to have a snipe. In every community I have been to, that’s in Julia Creek or Cairns or Maryborough, Queenslanders are nothing but respectful, appreciative of your time and efforts. “There is a world of difference between what I experience on the ground and what people will say in their commentary.” The portrayal of Trad as too progressive or extreme for Queensland plays into the binary way many seek to divide the state into tribes from “the city” and “the regions”. Trad’s home for 40 years, and the heart of her electorate, is Brisbane’s eclectic and progressive community of West End. Her seat of South Brisbane is broadly considered at serious risk of falling to the Greens. That political dynamic has created a narrative that has placed Trad at the centre of each government policy shift, to the left or right. Every government position has been scrutinised as if the folks of West End and broader Queensland are at crossed purposes. That sort of partisan “zero-sum politics” is what leaves Trad cold.She says: “There are big idiosyncrasies right through Queensland. We have such a deep rich identity throughout the state but I think what the last federal election showed was that zero-sum politics throughout our state creates so much division. “One of the things that really does divide our community is this zero-sum game that many political parties play, political parties on the left and the right. [They say] the system is broken, there’s no use operating under that system. “As hard as it is to be plugging away and chipping away, that is more important.” Trad has often championed progressive reforms in Queensland and often finds herself the lightning rod for critics. She had campaigned since the 1990s for the legalisation of abortion in Queensland, achieved in 2018. Hey, @LyleShelton, QLD abortion law reform done and dusted ✅ Time you toddled off to find another 21st Century progressive cause of equality and fairness to campaign against... and lose. https://t.co/20LMcfpdU7 On energy and climate change, Trad has found her efforts hemmed into an increasingly partisan public debate. She is still criticised for comments, made in parliament last year, that a global shift away from thermal coal use should require a transition and reskilling plan for Queensland workers and communities. On the other hand, Queensland Labor’s coal-friendly policy shift last year means Trad is no favourite of the Stop Adani crowd. She says opponents of coalmining and the Adani Carmichael project in north Queensland have played into a binary, divisive narrative that has set back efforts to address the climate crisis. “The convoy that went up to Clermont [led by former Greens leader Bob Brown, before the federal election], there were no winners out of that,” Trad says. “There was no outcome to that protest. There was no change in policy. It caused a great sense of anger and fear in the community and I guess my view as a progressive has been around achieving the change that’s necessary incrementally. You’ve got to bring people along, you can’t do it like that. “I’ve sat down with so many people and had so many conversations on Adani, thermal coal, metallurgical coal – this is something that a lot of people want to talk about, and I understand that and I understand that climate change is making people fearful. “What motivates me is how do we harness cheap clean electricity to create the industrial jobs that our community needs. There are many examples of industry moving towards renewable energy. It can make operations more competitive ... right throughout the state.” Pressed on her position on the Adani coalmine, Trad says: “Again I think that points to a zero-sum outcome. At the end of the day, there are export markets and while the world continues to change to clean renewable energy those export markets will be functioning. “I think communities are best placed to understand their own challenges, and to engage with policymakers around their own challenges. If we had 10 years ago adopted Kevin Rudd’s emissions trading scheme we would not be talking about these issues because quite frankly, we would have harnessed so much more cheap, clean renewable energy there would have been so much industrial change in Queensland. “That is a perfect example of the zero-sum game of politics. On the left it got defeated because it wasn’t good enough. On the right it was too [strong].” Last year, Trad was cleared by a Queensland Crime and Corruption Commission assessment of her purchase of a $700,000 investment property at Woolloongabba near the Cross River Rail project she oversaw. The CCC recommended legislative reforms as a result. The CCC has now decided to launch a formal investigation – a step beyond the assessment of Trad’s house purchase – into the appointment process for a principal at a new South Brisbane high school and allegations Trad interfered. She denies knowing any of the candidates. “It is an investigation under foot and I really can’t prejudice that investigation [by commenting], but I do see there’s an irony here in that the LNP are claiming there was interference in that process, but they’ve initiated a process with the CCC and want to interfere with that,” Trad says. On Monday, having stepped away from the ministry, Trad announced on Facebook that she would recontest South Brisbane, where the Liberal National party has pledged to direct preferences to the Greens and many pundits have written off her chances. She was also expected to lose in 2017, but has consistently rejected suggestions she could move to a safer seat. “This is my home, my lifelong home,” Trad says. “I’m really keen to get out and about in South Brisbane. What else we need to do as a community to make sure we are fairer, we don’t leave people behind. I got into politics … to actually improve the lives of people, I’m motivated by things like injustice and unfairness. “It’s been a bruising time for me, but I’ve been so overwhelmed by support for people locally and I understand they have great ambitions to see some good things happen. Their unfinished business is my unfinished business.”"
"Anti-Adani activists will bombard the world’s largest insurance broker with calls, emails and social media messages in a virtual protest on Tuesday ahead of its annual general meeting in New York. Campaigners have already managed to speak directly with Marsh executives, who are understood to be considering a new climate policy at this week’s meeting. The company is understood to be working for Adani to find insurance policies for the Carmichael mine. This year was supposed to be Australia’s climate flashpoint. Activists had begun arriving in central Queensland for a “red alert” campaign of daily physical protests to disrupt construction of the world’s most controversial coalmine. Instead, amid the coronavirus crisis, Adani has made sober, unhindered progress on its Carmichael coal project. Opponents have been forced to abandon plans for escalating civil disobedience. The Indian miner told Guardian Australia the campaign against it has “failed”. But while the public health emergency has placed physical activism into hibernation at a critical point for Adani, the climate movement has pivoted its tactics in a way that some hope could more effectively disrupt the project and the global coal sector. “In many ways, we think the online rally will be more effective than a rally outside an office,” says Carrie Tsai, the coordinator of Stop Adani Redfern. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “We’re expecting a lot of people from the US to join the online rally. Marsh is based in the US and Stop Adani is a global campaign. Moving online has meant we’ve been collaborating more with people around the globe. “We know the executives of Marsh are listening to our campaign, because they’re on the other side of the phone.” The school climate strikers, who protested in their hundreds of thousands last year, sought to maintain momentum during the enforced isolation of the coronavirus crisis by rallying from their bedrooms. Other groups have run targeted online campaigns. Galilee Blockade, which typically seeks to target businesses in the Adani supply chain, has focused on the construction firm BMD, which has a contract to build parts of the Carmichael rail corridor. Activists believe they can continue to run effective campaigns in isolation. “During this pandemic our movement has turned to a lot of online organising to keep the community aware and informed of what the mining industry has been doing in this period,” says Amy Booth, a spokeswoman for Frontline Action on Coal. “That has made so many people impassioned to take a stand as soon as restrictions allow them to, to head to the Galilee coal basin region to stop work. “The frontlines movement is still as strong as ever, and as soon as restrictions allow us to start being in areas where we need to stop work, we’ll be doing just that.” Meanwhile, work continues on the mine and Adani says it remains on schedule to send its first shipment next year. Many activists are sceptical about that timeline – especially given the likely impact of the Covid crisis on the world’s coal markets.“We recognise how important it is to continue our operations where safe to do so to provide certainty of employment for our staff, contractors and the thousands of people across north and central Queensland who indirectly rely on our project for their livelihoods,” an Adani spokeswoman said. “Anti-mining activists and the so-called charities that fund and employ them have thrown everything but the kitchen sink at us to try and stop us building the Carmichael mine and rail project and they have failed. “After more than eight years of working on our project we have repeatedly demonstrated that we will not be intimidated or deterred from delivering on our promises to Queenslanders and we continue to get on with the construction of the Carmichael project.”"

Hurricane season is here again, and the good people at the National Hurricane Center are predicting a 70% chance of more activity than normal this year. I’m predicting a greater than 99.9% probability that this season’s windbags will be conflated with global warming.



We can look forward to another year of numbing hurricane hype. Tropical cyclones (the generic for hurricanes, typhoons, willi‐​willies, etc…) are the sexiest weather beasts on TV, with seductive eyes surrounded by towering _cumulonimbi_. A category 3 (out of 5) storm within a week’s distance from the East Coast commands 24/7 attention from The Weather Channel and at least 50% of CNN’s time. Given that storms get this close (or closer) a couple of times every year, the coverage seems a bit out of proportion.



It’s part of our culture. Hurricanes became media stars when Dan Rather, a cub reporter from Houston, convinced CBS headquarters in 1961 to add 15 minutes to the (then) 15 minutes of network news featuring — surprise — him, braving the Galveston Seawall while big, bad Hurricane Carla languorously eyed the Texas Coast. While there’s still debate about whether Carla may have actually been more powerful than 2005’s legendary Katrina, it is certainly true that she made Dan a rather big man.



So this year is supposed to be another big one. The planetary surface temperature is warmer than it was back in Carla’s day. Aren’t these two things related?



Hurricanes long since graduated from being singular weather events to becoming climatic signposts. After all, it seems pretty logical that they should be enhanced by global warming, as the thermal source that they convert to destructive kinetic energy is the heat of the ocean, which should go up with the surface temperature.



Tropical cyclones are a bit more complicated than “warmer ocean in, bigger hurricane out”. For months on end, the vast majority of the earth’s tropical oceans sport surface temperatures above 80°F, the threshold required for their formation. Given this massive amount of suitable ocean surface, why are there so few hurricanes? And why would warming of a degree or two really change this?



Under global warming, it turns out that the threshold temperature goes up too. A report published last November in _Nature Geoscience_ found a rise of about 0.5 degrees in that temperature in recent decades paralleling the observed rise in tropical ocean surface temperatures. Everything else being equal (which never occurs), this would mean no increase in hurricane frequency and intensity.



For over a decade, federal climatologist Kevin Trenberth has claimed that global warming will increase the frequency and strength of El Niño, the large periodic warming of the tropical Pacific. One of the few sure things about hurricane climatology is that Los Niños destroy Atlantic storms as they unfavorably shift the winds aloft.



The global warming‐​hurricane war has been raging in the scientific literature for over a decade. One of the major battles is over the quality of historical data, and whether or not hurricane statistics are being inflated by nonclimatic forces.



A few years ago I began to notice that cloud blobs of decidedly unseductive proportions began to be named as tropical cyclones.



While I’ve published some papers in the scientific literature on hurricanes and climate change, I never figured how to test that surmise. To my surprise, two weeks ago, my hypothesis was tested in a paper in _Journal of Geophysical Research,_ and it appears to be supportable. The paper shows that there has been no increase whatsoever in the number of Atlantic storms that last more than 48 hours. There has been a major increase in the number of short‐​lived storms; i.e. ones which the Hurricane Center wouldn’t have named decades ago.



On reason is because we have learned that even relatively weak tropical storms can produce extreme floods. People began to pay attention to this in 1979, when tropical storm Claudette drowned Alvin, in southeast Texas, under 45 inches of rain. In 1994, weak tropical storm Alberto killed 33 in the southeast, largely a result of over two feet of rain. Tropical storm Allison, in 2001, dropped 40 inches, again in southeast Texas.



While slightly warmer oceans should slightly enhance rainfall from tropical cyclones, all the refereed research out there indicates that such an effect won’t be detectable for decades, in part a result of the obviously great variability that exists in rainfall from these storms.



So we can go back and forth on whether or not hurricanes are getting worse because of global warming. But while we debate, nature adjudicates.



Ryan Maue at Florida State University has been tracking hurricane power over the years. That’s the square of the maximum wind speed summed over the lifetime of each storm. His results tell you everything you need to know:





Maue’s hurricane power index shows that current values are near the lowest ever measured, both in our hemisphere (black dots) and globally (blue dots), and exhibit no overall trend, effectively blowing any linkage between recent storms and global warming out of the water.



Both globally and in our hemisphere, total hurricane power is at or near the lowest it has ever been measured. So much for Hurricane hype.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI had to laugh reading the French reports I mention below.
A few days ago I saw the same kind of stuff in the Russian and Italian media: meteorologists and meteorological institutes forecasting a “killer 100-year 2013/14 winter“. It’s all over Europe. Where does this come from?
It seems that meteorologists Joe Bastardi’s and Dominik Jung’s preliminary, legitimate speculation of a possible colder-than-normal 2013/14 winter has been miscommunicated and morphed into a serious forecast of “a killer 100-year winter“. Everywhere in the European media I’m now seeing reports that a “really hard winter may be on the way“. Dude, fear and a rush for snow shovels is about to break out!
First the Belgium-based, French-language news site DH.be has an article titled: “On The Way To A Winter Of Death?“.
The piece cites German meteorologist Dominik Jung, who runs the site wetternet.de. Lately Jung has been analyzing European and American weather charts in order to try to get a heads up as to how the winter could shape up, which could serve as especially valuable information for a host of industries, e.g. tourism or retailing. But the DH.be writes:
Awaiting the arrival of winter, European meteorologists are already predicting an icy season, and not one that’s just run of the mill, but rather the coldest one in 100 years.
A natural phenomenon will be the source of the cold wave that is about to strike Europe head-on: the melting of Arctic ice which is cooling the oceans, which in turn leads to the formation of cold air currents that will plunge into our regions this winter.”
At this point, the reader already has the idea that it’s going to be a really harsh winter, and next thing you know he’s spreading it all over town.
DH.be later in the article does add that meteorologist Marc Vandiepenbeeck at the Royal Meteorological Institute (IRM) warns that the atmosphere is far too complex to make such predictions with any real degree of certainty, and that making such predictions is “wacky”.
DH.be writes Jung says that predictions of the most horrible winter in a 100 years must be taken with healthy dose of doubt. But then it writes:
…he maintains that the winter 2013/2014 will probably be ‘extremely bitter’.”
Where did the predictions of a bitter cold winter get started?

So we ask in this case, what is original source of this “super-winter forecast“? How did it all get started? The answer is a classic example of how normal, innocent speculation unintentionally can morph into a much huger story, eventually get accepted almost as a scientific fact, and then start to spread across the land.
Website CatNat.net here gives us good evidence of where the seed for the “100-year killer-winter” inadvertently got planted. CatNat writes:
…many European forecasters are predicting a cold one for 2013/2014. ‘Dominik Jung, German meteorologist, explains that next winter will be abnormally cold, and so does American Joe Bastardi, who works for weather giant AccuWeather, and who explains that ‘it’s going to be very cold’.”
Little of this is accurate, of course. Firstly, Joe stopped working for Accuweather a long time ago. Secondly I’m not aware of Joe ever saying: “It’s going to be a very cold winter.” I do recall him saying that NOAA was looking at the probability of a cold winter and that there were a couple of factors pointing to a cold winter. But he never predicted it to my knowledge.
Anyway, it seems that Joe’s Saturday Summary is gaining a good sized audience in Europe.
CatNat then explains that the cold winter prediction is “based on climatic indicators” which indicate that “Arctic air will plunge into Europe. The abnormal cold are also influenced by the Arctic oscillation (variation in atmospheric pressures at sea level between 20°N and the pole), one of the principal factors of influence on winter temperatures in the northern Hemisphere.”
CatNet adds:
For Americain meteorologist Joe Bastardi, low solar activity is also in play. A similar cycle was observed during the 1950s, with cold waves extending until spring.”
Near the end, CatNat does add that seasonal forecasts are weak in reliability, and that seasonal forecasts are barely better than flipping a coin. Yet, it’s doubtful that most readers ever got that far.
And now it’s too late. All of Europe it seems is now convinced that the coming winter is going to be a real tough one – maybe even the worst in a 100 years! Not because Joe Bastardi and Dominik Jung predicted so, but because their original speculation somehow got miscommunicated and morphed into a dire prediction as it passed through the media grapevine.
The two recent French reports cited above are just the latest. A few days ago I saw the same stuff in Russian and Italian media. I expect to see more such reports – maybe even soon at the Beeb.
Makes you think that maybe the same type of runaway fantasy occurred in climate science. An increase in the atmospheric concentration of a trace gas exploding into a multi-trillion dollar global panic.

Share this...FacebookTwitterVeteran journalist Ulli Kulke of the online flagship daily German Die Welt here writes a blog commentary titled: “German Politicians Want To Sex Up Climate Report“.
Chart right: Global temps tending downwards since 2007 IPCC AR4. Source: www.woodfortrees.org/.
Kulke writes that Germany’s political delegation steadfastly refuses to give up its cherished climate catastrophism. According to Kulke, in the previous IPCC reports bureaucrats used to be accused of watering down the results of the scientists in order to avoid having to implement draconian measures at home. But that’s not the case for Germany’s bureaucrats.
Kulke writes, “Especially considering the discussion from Germany’s hefty ministries, no efforts in watering down the catastrophic passages are expected to be made. To the contrary.”
When it comes to the AR5 Summary Report, which is set to be released Friday, Kulke writes that in its current draft:
…the ongoing one and half decades long pause in global warming is mentioned, for example, together with the notation that the models from climate scientists are unable to provide an explanation for it. The scientists working on this report feel it is necessary and important to mention this pause, but not some representatives of governments who would prefer to delete this passage. And it’s not just some politicians, but rather it’s foremost the delegates from two German ministries, mind you.”

Kulke adds that the German bureaucrats fear losing the scientific legitimacy that underpins their cause and are behaving is if to tell us:
We are not going to let our climate catastrophe to be taken away.”
Kulke then writes that it’s fortunate that a draft was made available to the public “even though this did not suit some IPCC strategists so well.” Kulke concludes:
Because of the current situation, it will be difficult to remove the passage about the warming pause from the summary report just because so much truth does not suit a few German ministry representatives.”
Also yesterday the online edition of Die Welt featured another piece, also written by Kulke, titled: “The Earth Is Warming Much More Slowly Than First Believed“.
Unfortunately the article is behind a paywall, but the title sums it all up. No matter what the IPCC decides to put in its final draft summary report, climate science will end up having been soiled – thanks to activist bureaucrats and scientists.

Andrew Revkin asked me to provide comments on this article of his where the National Climatic Data Center was asked to respond to Watts et al 2012:
A Closer Look at Climate Studies Promoted Before Publication
Here is what I sent to him:
My comments on Thorne’s response are pretty simple.
They still refuse to get out of the office, to examine firsthand the condition of the network and try to come up with hands on approaches for dealing with station inhomogeneity, but instead focus of trying to spot patterns in data and massage it. In my view this is the wrong approach and the reason that we are in this polarization  today.  We are conducting a grand experiment, and like any scientific experiment, you have to carefully watch how the data is being measured in the experiment environment, or problems will invalidate the measurement. If Climate Science operated under the same rules as Forensic Science, the compromised data would be tossed out on its ear. Instead, we are told to accept it as fully factual in the court of public opinion.
Until I came along with Watts 2009, they really weren’t looking closely at the issue. The SurfaceStations photography forced them into reaction mode, to do two things.

1. Close the worst USHCN stations, such as Marysville, CA (the station that started it all), Tucson, AZ (the University Science Dept/Weather Service Office that had the USHCN weather station in the parking lot), and Ardmore, OK (the USHCN station on the street corner). There are many others that have been closed.
If they are able to correct the data gathering problems back in the office with algorithms, why do they need to close these stations? Additionally, if they think they can get good data out of these stations with the myriad of adjustments they perform, why did they need to spend millions of dollars on the new Climate Reference Network commissioned in 2008 that we never hear about?
According to communications I received from Texas State Climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon, the National Weather Service is developing plans to eliminate up to half of all COOP network stations (of which USHCN is a subset) as a potential cost-cutting measure.
Some possible reasons: (1) not central to the core mission of the NWS; (2) poor data quality; (3) too much of a public relations headache with people putting embarrassing photographs online.
I would argue not for removal of bad stations,  but rather for the replacement of bad stations with well-sited stations, with simultaneous overlapping data collection so that biases can be both measured directly and permanently eliminated. I don’t see anything in what they are doing with Thorne that addresses this. To me, all they are doing is trying to put lipstick on a pig.
2.  Attack me without publishing an appropriate paper intended for peer review first, such as the ghost authored “Talking points” memo issued by NCDC’s Dr. Thomas Peterson, who wouldn’t put his name on it, yet circulated it to every NOAA manager and the press. If the data from these stations is so strong, and the adjustments and corrections so valid, why the cloak and dagger approach?
Note, that in the Thorne response, they carefully avoided saying anything about station siting, preferring instead to focus on data manipulations.  From my viewpoint, until they start worrying about the measurement environment in which our grand global experiment is being measured, all they are doing is rearranging data without looking at and learning from the environment and history that created it.
Perhaps they should follow the advice of the General Accounting Office report that backed up my work:
GAO-11-800 August 31, 2011, Climate Monitoring: NOAA Can Improve Management of the U.S. Historical Climatology Network Highlights Page (PDF)   Full Report (PDF, 47 pages)   Accessible Text Recommendations (HTML)
Finally, let’s spend a few moments looking at another network in the USA that doesn’t seem to suffer from the same sorts of magnitude of issues. The U.S. Population-Adjusted Temperature Dataset (PDAT) developed by Dr. Roy Spencer, which better handles UHI.
The following plot shows 12-month trailing average anomalies for the three different datasets (USHCN, CRUTem3, and ISH PDAT)…note the large differences in computed linear warming trends (click on plots for high res versions):

"**There have been more than 1.6 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and about 60,000 people have died, government figures show.**
However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus and other measures suggest the number of deaths is higher.
**Find out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:**
If you can't see the look-up click here.
After the first peak in April, cases started rising again in July, with the rate of growth increasing sharply in September and October, before falling again in the past two weeks.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 16,170 confirmed cases.
It is thought the infection rate was much higher during the first peak in spring, but testing capacity at the time was too limited to detect the true number of daily cases.
The data for cases can also be broken down by region and comparing the change in those figures by week gives a sense of where there has been a recent increase in newly-reported infections.
Coronavirus infections in England have fallen by about a third during lockdown, according to a major study carried out by Imperial College London.
While some of the worst-hit areas saw the biggest improvements, cases have remained relatively high across England, according to the React-1 study, which is based on tests of more than 100,000 people between 13-24 November.
The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), suggest about one in 185 (16,400 people) in Wales had the virus in the week ending 21 November.
In Northern Ireland rates are thought to be decreasing at around one in 145 people (about 12,700 people), while in Scotland, the figure was one in 115 (about 45,700 people).
The average number of daily deaths began to rise again in September, following the first peak in April.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 648 deaths.
Of these, 555 deaths were in England, 51 in Wales, 38 in Scotland, and four in Northern Ireland.
Rules were amended over the summer to include deaths in the coronavirus total only if they occurred within 28 days of a positive test. Previously in England, all deaths after a positive test were included.
England has seen the majority of UK deaths from Covid-19. Using the 28-day cut-off, there have been more than 52,000.
Although hospital admissions for Covid-19 remain below the levels seen in the spring, there are big regional disparities.
The North West, North East and Yorkshire, and Midlands have seen the highest number of admissions but the situation in all three now appears to be improving.
Cases have risen across large parts of England, with other spikes in areas of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The red areas on the map below are those currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people.
Restrictions have been tightened across the UK in an effort to tackle the number of rising cases.
In England, each local authority has been placed in one of the new three tiers following the end of the recent national lockdown.
Wales has announced a range of further measures, including a ban on pubs, restaurants and cafes serving alcohol, from Friday 4 December.
In Northern Ireland, a further two-week ""circuit-break"" lockdown began on 27 November.
Scotland has a five-tier system of alert levels with different measures in place in different parts of the country.
UK leaders have agreed to allow up to three households to meet indoors during a five-day Christmas period of 23-27 December.
When looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways.
Government figures count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus.
But there are two other measures.
The first includes all deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, even if the person had not been tested for the virus. The most recent figures suggest there had been almost 70,000 deaths by 20 November.
The second measure counts all deaths over and above the usual number at the time of year - that figure was more than 75,000 by 20 November.
The most recent figures available from the ONS are for the third week of November, which show there were 14,276 deaths registered in the UK.
Some 3,038 of these deaths involved Covid-19 - 199 more than the week before.
Deaths normally do rise at this time of the year, but the data from the ONS and its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland show the second wave of the virus has pushed the death rate above the average seen over the past five years by about 21%.
Overall, the figures are still well below the peak of 9,495 deaths recorded in a week, reached on 17 April.
The ""R number"" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to.
If R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow.
The government's current estimate for the R number across the whole of the UK is 0.9 to 1.
The estimate for England is 0.9 to 1, while for Scotland it is 0.8 to 1. The estimate for Wales is 0.8 to 1 and in Northern Ireland it is 0.9 to 1.1.
The government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions."
"**Jersey has seen a ""surge"" of 84 new Covid-19 cases since Friday, according to the latest figures.**
This takes the island to 247 active infections, nearly three quarters of which are symptomatic.
Further public health measures and guidance are now due to follow the introduction of mandatory masks use in shops from Tuesday.
The updated government advice suggests islanders work from home where possible.
Those over the age of 70 will be advised to avoid socialising indoors with people they do not live with.
Public health officials explained the changes were needed as the island was experiencing ""complex, multiple clusters"" and a rise which cannot be attributed to a particular event.
More than 2,000 people, nearly 2% of Jersey's population, are isolating as a result of contact tracing, Chief Minister John Le Fondre confirmed.
The full list of measures to be introduced include:
Senator John Le Fondre said: ""This surge in cases is not down to one cluster.
""Health officials are seeing case clusters on a larger scale, and we are worried that the number of positive cases being picked up may indicate an increase in hospitalisation as we move forward.
""In the coming weeks we will see large numbers of returning students, family members and friends visiting for Christmas and enhanced social activity.
""Action is needed now to protect the vulnerable, to identify more cases earlier on and to slow the spread.""
Health Minister Richard Renouf said: ""If this doesn't bring down the numbers of positive cases we may, ultimately, have to move to another lockdown.""
""That's something none of us want to see,"" he added."

Hurricane season is here again, and the good people at the National Hurricane Center are predicting a 70% chance of more activity than normal this year. I’m predicting a greater than 99.9% probability that this season’s windbags will be conflated with global warming.



We can look forward to another year of numbing hurricane hype. Tropical cyclones (the generic for hurricanes, typhoons, willi‐​willies, etc…) are the sexiest weather beasts on TV, with seductive eyes surrounded by towering _cumulonimbi_. A category 3 (out of 5) storm within a week’s distance from the East Coast commands 24/7 attention from The Weather Channel and at least 50% of CNN’s time. Given that storms get this close (or closer) a couple of times every year, the coverage seems a bit out of proportion.



It’s part of our culture. Hurricanes became media stars when Dan Rather, a cub reporter from Houston, convinced CBS headquarters in 1961 to add 15 minutes to the (then) 15 minutes of network news featuring — surprise — him, braving the Galveston Seawall while big, bad Hurricane Carla languorously eyed the Texas Coast. While there’s still debate about whether Carla may have actually been more powerful than 2005’s legendary Katrina, it is certainly true that she made Dan a rather big man.



So this year is supposed to be another big one. The planetary surface temperature is warmer than it was back in Carla’s day. Aren’t these two things related?



Hurricanes long since graduated from being singular weather events to becoming climatic signposts. After all, it seems pretty logical that they should be enhanced by global warming, as the thermal source that they convert to destructive kinetic energy is the heat of the ocean, which should go up with the surface temperature.



Tropical cyclones are a bit more complicated than “warmer ocean in, bigger hurricane out”. For months on end, the vast majority of the earth’s tropical oceans sport surface temperatures above 80°F, the threshold required for their formation. Given this massive amount of suitable ocean surface, why are there so few hurricanes? And why would warming of a degree or two really change this?



Under global warming, it turns out that the threshold temperature goes up too. A report published last November in _Nature Geoscience_ found a rise of about 0.5 degrees in that temperature in recent decades paralleling the observed rise in tropical ocean surface temperatures. Everything else being equal (which never occurs), this would mean no increase in hurricane frequency and intensity.



For over a decade, federal climatologist Kevin Trenberth has claimed that global warming will increase the frequency and strength of El Niño, the large periodic warming of the tropical Pacific. One of the few sure things about hurricane climatology is that Los Niños destroy Atlantic storms as they unfavorably shift the winds aloft.



The global warming‐​hurricane war has been raging in the scientific literature for over a decade. One of the major battles is over the quality of historical data, and whether or not hurricane statistics are being inflated by nonclimatic forces.



A few years ago I began to notice that cloud blobs of decidedly unseductive proportions began to be named as tropical cyclones.



While I’ve published some papers in the scientific literature on hurricanes and climate change, I never figured how to test that surmise. To my surprise, two weeks ago, my hypothesis was tested in a paper in _Journal of Geophysical Research,_ and it appears to be supportable. The paper shows that there has been no increase whatsoever in the number of Atlantic storms that last more than 48 hours. There has been a major increase in the number of short‐​lived storms; i.e. ones which the Hurricane Center wouldn’t have named decades ago.



On reason is because we have learned that even relatively weak tropical storms can produce extreme floods. People began to pay attention to this in 1979, when tropical storm Claudette drowned Alvin, in southeast Texas, under 45 inches of rain. In 1994, weak tropical storm Alberto killed 33 in the southeast, largely a result of over two feet of rain. Tropical storm Allison, in 2001, dropped 40 inches, again in southeast Texas.



While slightly warmer oceans should slightly enhance rainfall from tropical cyclones, all the refereed research out there indicates that such an effect won’t be detectable for decades, in part a result of the obviously great variability that exists in rainfall from these storms.



So we can go back and forth on whether or not hurricanes are getting worse because of global warming. But while we debate, nature adjudicates.



Ryan Maue at Florida State University has been tracking hurricane power over the years. That’s the square of the maximum wind speed summed over the lifetime of each storm. His results tell you everything you need to know:





Maue’s hurricane power index shows that current values are near the lowest ever measured, both in our hemisphere (black dots) and globally (blue dots), and exhibit no overall trend, effectively blowing any linkage between recent storms and global warming out of the water.



Both globally and in our hemisphere, total hurricane power is at or near the lowest it has ever been measured. So much for Hurricane hype.

By now, everyone who isn’t a complete idiot or a blind eco-fanatic (is there a difference?) knows that the “Amazon is burning!” panic is a thoroughgoing lie. Not that you can rely on the so-called “fact-checkers” of the left-wing media to come clean about that.



But the truth really is inconvenient to the green-left. If everyone acknowledged the truth about the global environment (it’s not perfect, but it’s doing pretty well, and way better than it used to be), the donations would stop rolling in and the left would be shorn of much of their power.



I sometimes wonder if the line wrongly attributed to Mark Twain, ‘a lie is halfway round the world before the truth has got its boots on’, is now taken as an instruction by environmental pressure groups. They operate in a viciously competitive market for media attention and donations, and those who scream loudest do best, even if it later turns out they were telling fibs.



As Michael Crichton’s _State of Fear_ argues, the media and the green-left (again – **is there a difference?** ) have a vested interest in creating spurious panics, in defiance of plain fact.



Around the world, wild fires are generally declining, according to Nasa. Deforestation, too, is happening less and less.



Or even reversing.



A study in _Nature_ last year by scientists from the University of Maryland concluded that […] ‘contrary to the prevailing view that forest area has declined globally — tree cover has increased by 2.24 million km2 (+7.1 per cent relative to the 1982 level).’



[…]Possibly the biggest driver of this encouraging trend is the rising productivity of agriculture. The more yields increase, the less land we need to steal from nature to feed ourselves. Jesse Ausubel of Rockefeller University has calculated that the world needs only 35 per cent as much land to produce a given quantity of food as 50 years ago. That has spared wild land on a massive scale.



Environmentalists’ lies have real consequences, beyond lining the pockets of quangos and shoring up political careers. Some years ago, I interviewed the CEO of a company proposing to operate a big, scary “super-trawler” in Tasmanian waters. He was adamant that they had bent over backwards to deal with environmental issues, and that all had been going swimmingly – until a global e-ngo stepped in. The proposal was scrapped. Yet, now fish stocks such as flathead are threatened in Tasmanian waters – but from recreational, not commercial fishing. The very people who were hoodwinked by environmentalists into fiercely campaigning against the trawler are themselves responsible for largely uncontrolled over-fishing.



It may seem paradoxical, but often the commercial exploitation of a resource is the very thing that preserves it – and contributes the most to human well-being.



Likewise, getting people on to fossil fuels and away from burning wood for fuel spares trees. It is in the poorest countries, mainly in Africa, that men and women still gather firewood for cooking and bushmeat for food, instead of using electricity or gas and farmed meat.



Environmentalism is adamantly opposed to it all. Forests that were being replenished are being cut down again, as fossil fuels are replaced with “biofuels” (a fancy euphemism for “burning plants”).



The obsession with climate change has slowed the decline of deforestation. An estimated 700,000 hectares of forest has been felled in South-East Asia to grow palm oil to add to supposedly green ‘bio-diesel’ fuel in Europe, while the world is feeding 5 per cent of its grain crop to motor cars rather than people, which means 5 per cent of cultivated land that could be released for forest. Britain imports timber from wild forests in the Americas to burn for electricity at Drax in North Yorkshire, depriving beetles and woodpeckers of their lunch.



There is a human cost, too: poor farmers and herdsmen in Africa and South America are [being driven off their lands](https://www.grain.org/e/4653), often violently, to make way for biofuel plantations.



The temptation to moralise on social media is so strong among footballers, actors and politicians alike that it is actually doing harm. Get the economic incentives right and the world will save its forests. Preach and preen and prevaricate, and you’ll probably end up inadvertently depriving more toucans and tapirs of their rainforest habitat.

"Carbon capture and storage is a hot topic among researchers striving to save the planet from climate change. Scientists are constantly trying to develop and improve materials which can capture carbon dioxide (CO₂) from the atmosphere. At the Energy Safety Research Institute (ESRI) at Swansea University, we’ve developed a promising new material from a liquid amine - a chemical which is known for its ability to react with CO₂, but in liquid form can’t do so effectively. By adding just enough glue to make the liquid amine fluff up into a solid, the resulting new material is capable of capturing one-fifth of its own weight in CO₂. The glue is a type of epoxy resin – used everywhere in paints, varnishes and flooring. Our work shows that epoxy resins can be a key ingredient in making effective carbon capture materials – and they have been staring us in the face for more than 70 years. Since huge advances are being made in renewable energy – and the UK’s reliance on fossil fuels has reduced – is carbon capture technology becoming redundant? Unfortunately not. There remains about 1.5 times the concentration of CO₂ in the atmosphere that there was in pre-industrial times. If we are to limit global warming to 1.5°C to avert the worst consequences of climate change, atmospheric CO₂ will have to be captured on an industrial scale, and either made into useful new chemicals or buried deep underground in depleted oil reservoirs.

      COP24: here's what must be agreed to keep warming at 1.5°C


 For all the damage it’s causing, CO₂ actually makes up only 0.04% of the atmosphere by volume, making it very hard to extract directly from the air, which is the ultimate challenge. Our work was focused primarily on capturing CO₂ before it leaves smoke stacks at power stations where CO₂ concentrations range from 8-15% and temperatures can be between 40 and 100°C.  Power stations around the world will continue to burn fossil fuels until clean energy technologies are ready to fully replace coal and gas-based energy production, so their emissions have to be reduced as soon as possible. Industrial processes that carry out CO₂ capture currently use liquid amines, but this technology comes with problems. It’s very expensive, not very efficient and the chemicals are highly corrosive and toxic to the environment. This is why we need something better which can match the scale of this problem. So what’s special about this new glue-assisted CO₂ sponge? It’s a polymer made mostly from liquid amines which bind CO₂, and epoxy resin glue. We showed that the glue molecules stick the liquid amine molecules together into one solid mass. Being a solid makes it easier and safer to handle and much cheaper to reuse, compared to the current carbon capture materials which are liquid. The epoxy resin is also cheap and widely produced. When this and the liquid amine are combined, the solid material that forms is very effective at capturing CO₂. One variant was found capable of capturing almost 20% of its weight in pure CO₂ at 90°C. This was a good indication that we had made a material that could suck up a lot of CO₂. But in the conditions of a smoke stack, the material would be exposed to a mixture of gases and would have to exclusively capture CO₂. We ran an experiment to see if it would take up nitrogen (N₂) – the most abundant gas in Earth’s atmosphere – but it didn’t, confirming that the material selectively binds CO₂. We next wanted to test the material’s ability to capture CO₂ under the replicated conditions of the smoke stack. We tested the material with a stream of gas that was 10% CO₂ and 90% N₂ at 90°C. Once CO₂ was captured, the temperature was increased to 155°C to remove the captured CO₂ and regenerate the material so that it could be used again. The material captured 9.5% of its weight in CO₂ over 29 successive cycles – a pretty good performance for a material that would have to work constantly to capture and release CO₂ within a smoke stack. The next test of this material’s performance was its ability to capture CO₂ under humid conditions as water is present in gas from a smoke stack. Humidity often causes solid CO₂ capture materials to perform badly as they suck up water instead of CO₂. But rather than hinder uptake, water actually helped this material capture more CO₂. Under humid conditions and at only 25°C, the CO₂ uptake from pure CO₂ was a huge 23.5%. This bodes well for one day capturing CO₂ directly from air. This material could be the next generation in solid carbon capture materials. Glue: common, cheap and abundant, could yet find a new and valuable role in the fight against climate change.

"After increasingly stark scientific warnings and unprecedented mass mobilisations of school children and rebellious citizens, the climate crisis is finally starting to be acknowledged in the halls of decision making. The UK has now committed to achieving net zero emissions by 2050, mirroring momentum in France and the rest of the EU for similar targets. But there’s a long way to go yet. Government targets to date still vastly underestimate the urgency of the climate crisis. And in terms of concrete action, the world is way off; based on current policy plans, the science indicates that we’re heading for a world that will be three to four degrees hotter by 2100. As the source of much of the very research that has alerted us to the true scale of the crisis we face, it is up to universities to take the lead in showing society how to act on it. If they don’t, then how can they justify taxpayers funding the research in the first place? Such leadership starts with rallying behind a zero carbon target that takes climate breakdown seriously. The UN recently released a key report on the catastrophic effects of letting global heating rise above 1.5℃ – in which university academics played a major role. But according to the report, aiming for net zero by 2050 still gives us a 50% chance of temperatures rising above this dangerous level. And even this risky percentage is based on the whole world going zero carbon by this date. To address the murky economic injustice of climate breakdown, countries that have long benefited from exploiting the fossil fuel resources of poorer countries need to decarbonise much sooner than 2050. As privileged institutions facing pressure to confront colonial biases, universities in these countries should champion a zero carbon target of 2035. Such a target would both respect the severity of their own scientific findings, and allow those who have suffered from oily geopolitics to decarbonise at a slower pace. In fact, some already have set targets of 2035 or earlier – but that doesn’t mean that their job is done. Universities, like governments, are guilty of creative carbon accounting that diminishes the true value of even seemingly impressive targets. In reporting only emissions from fuels burnt on site, and electricity and heat utility bills, most paint an incomplete picture of their full emissions burden. Universities must create a culture of honest accounting by including the hefty carbon costs of areas such as travel and transport (often accounting for more than a quarter of universities’ emissions) and food, and then set about reducing them. This means spending money directly on reducing emissions, and avoiding the use of popular carbon offsets, which palm off emissions reductions to poorer, low-emitting countries. Some universities have already claimed to be “carbon neutral” or close to it, but their substantial use of offsets in reality reveals a prioritisation of green branding over concrete action. Evidence from academics indicates that offsets almost never actually reduce emissions, and may in some cases be worse than doing nothing. Universities must therefore focus efforts on achieving real zero, not net zero. Unlike industries such as steel, cement and aviation, which are difficult to decarbonise, the vast majority of university emissions are relatively easy to cut.  Switching to genuinely renewable energy as well as systematically implementing energy-saving measures such as heat pumps and insulation can slash energy use. Frequent air travel for conferences and field trips is clearly inconsistent with decarbonisation, and there is no excuse for universities not to replace travel with remote participation wherever possible, and support slower, less polluting options where necessary. Taking beef and lamb off the university menu is also an important and urgent step. As hubs of scientific innovation, universities must also redouble efforts to find new ways of decarbonising – and, importantly, integrate these efforts with the local communities they are often so intimately linked to. Creating new economies and ways of living will be essential in the journey to zero emissions, and projects such as the Place-based Action Network have already begun to show how local cooperation can build an inclusive and coordinated path away from fossil fuels. To ensure broad buy in to what will inevitably be tough changes ahead, universities must actively engage with and listen to these communities, as well as staff and students at all levels. Universities are not just innovators but educators too, and have a vital role in ensuring that when students and staff leave university they’re less likely to exacerbate the climate crisis, not more – no matter what they study or teach. Finally, universities must fully and unconditionally divest from all fossil fuels. Despite widespread support for divestment among staff, UK and US universities alone have billions of pounds still invested in the industry. Continued support for fossil fuel companies is not compatible with the climate emergency that academic research has illuminated – and universities would do well to question whether maintaining research ties or student placements with such companies is either.  I am proud to be a part of a network of institutions with a long history of using research to create a better world. But as the world faces its gravest existential threat, these institutions urgently need to marry words with action. Anything less undermines the integrity of their work. Without the work of universities, we would not have been awakened to the climate emergency. If even they then ignore the teachings of their research, how on Earth can we expect anyone else to act?

Ah, summer in our cities, where the climate is woebegone and the temperature is almost always above normal.



Cities tend to get warmer, whether or not there is global or regional warming. Bricks, buildings and pavement absorb more heat during the day than a “natural” vegetated state, and urban structures impede the flow of ventilating winds. The result is that, as cities grow, temperatures rise. In Washington, there is additional warming caused by the waste heat from all the money changing hands.



The official (and silly) definition of “normal” temperature is the average for the past 30 years. In a growing urban environment (which includes suburban sprawl) that number is likely to be lower than what it is now.



As a result, cities are inadvertently testing a dear hypothesis of my greener friends: that global warming will result in increasing heat‐​related mortality.



Those who have read _Freakonomics_ can see this hanging curveball. Global warming should _reduce_ urban mortality as heat waves become more frequent.



I’ve done a bit of work in this area. Robert Davis, a former colleague at the University of Virginia, and I examined three decades of heat‐​related mortality data from the Centers for Disease Control for the 28 largest U.S. cities. We then teamed up with a UVa medical statistician, Wendy Novicoff, who made sure we adjusted for different demographics between cities; we did this because the elderly and infants are most susceptible to heat‐​related mortality, and we wanted to compare disproportionately old cities (like Phoenix) with disproportionally young ones (like Seattle). After all was said and done, we found that heat‐​related mortality is dropping like a stone in almost every major urban area in the nation.



Before you go to the “comments” and blast me with the European heat wave of 2003 or the Chicago disaster in 1995, read on.



The 2003 heat wave in Europe was devastating. In France alone, and very dependent on the way you count things, it appears there were about 35,000 excess deaths. That heat wave was a lulu, with European temperatures about three standard deviations above the average, something that has a 1‐​in‐​333 chance of occurring averaged over your state or province. Given that there are a lot of places of similar size on the planet, such an anomaly can usually be found somewhere. In 2003, that somewhere just happened to be at the epicenter of global warming angst.



Then there was the great French heat wave of 2006.



Whoops. Don’t know about that one? Climatically, it was pretty comparable, but far fewer French fried.



A. Fouillet and his team of researchers wrote this up in a 2008 paper in the _International Journal of Epidemiology_. They started off with a simple (i.e. logical and testable) model relating temperature to mortality and found that something in addition to the heat killed a lot of people in 2003. While their model predicted about 17 deaths per 100,000, the observed rate was 21 per 100,000, or about nearly 7,000 bodies.



(There’s plenty of speculation on the cause, with fingers pointed at France’s August recess, when everyone — including health care workers — takes to the beach or the hills and leaves the old folks at the non‐​airconditioned home)



In 2006, their model showed nearly 4,500 _fewer_ deaths than expected.



What the French did was (begrudgingly) emulate urban Americans. They _adapted_. The government bought air conditioning (formerly a crass Yankee invention) for retirement homes. They implemented a National Heat Wave Plan that keeps tabs on the elderly, who were left to swelter in 2003. They set up cooling shelters for those without A/C.



And, of course, adaptation is what’s happening in our cities. Perhaps the most politically incorrect thing an urban administration can do is to be caught flatfooted by the weather. Chicago’s Daley dynasty was (temporarily) swept away by a 1979 snowstorm when it selectively canceled rail service in southside black neighborhoods. And who can forget Washington’s colorful mayor Marion Barry, cavorting at the 1987 Super Bowl during back‐​to‐​back storms. White stuff set him up.



Want proof of our adaptation to heat? Two extremely hot cities, Tampa and Phoenix, have virtually no heat‐​related mortality, despite sporting the oldest populations in our study. In only one city is mortality increasing. That would be young and vibrant Seattle, where summer heat is still very rare.



I am sure many consider it immoral to export heat‐​related mortality to the North, but that won’t last for long. Seattle’s latitude is about 48 degrees north. The vast majority of our hemisphere’s cities are south of there, and by the time you get to 60 degrees, not very far away, you tend to run out of cities. At that point, global warming will have squeezed urban heat‐​related mortality off of the map.

"Be under no illusion, the world is losing the fight against climate change. The amount of CO₂ in the atmosphere continues to increase, meaning humanity is forcing the Earth closer to cataclysmic alterations that will reshape the entire biosphere. But the UK could capitalise on the momentum gained through its recent net zero emissions pledge to take the lead and herald a shift towards serious global climate action. How? By copying a strategy followed by – of all people – the George W Bush-era neoconservatives.  Hear me out. Those who disagree with my opening statement will of course point to the Paris Agreement: a global alliance that boasts 185 signatories fighting back against climate change. Yet Paris is a reflection of international law, which means it represents only the lowest common denominator that those negotiating parties could agree. For this reason the agreement is premised on state discretion, taking the form of “nationally determined contributions” where countries decide for themselves how much they will cut their emissions. The agreement does have positive attributes, and there is scope to argue that it is useful. But it is not able to compel states to hit the ambitious targets necessary to stave off the threat of more warming. Climate Tracker illustrates this by finding that five states are “critically insufficient” in their efforts to prevent more than a 1.5°C increase, and a further 19 states are at least “insufficient”.  Countries could instead deal with contentious international threats by stepping away from the usual processes of international law, and introducing frameworks that aim to uncompromisingly challenge the root of the menace. And there is some precedent. One example is the 2003 Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) – a set of principles designed predominantly by the US to curb the international transfer of materials related to nuclear weapons. Crucially the PSI was not negotiated. Instead states were invited to endorse a framework of principles that had already been created. The argument was that a typical treaty would be too slow, too cumbersome, and reflect the usual challenges of international law, ruling out any serious responses.  The PSI was able to attract 11 countries at its inception, and currently 107 countries have endorsed its principles. Its success is measured by the fact it is still in operation today and is considered to have increased cooperation and indeed reduced the transfer of nuclear weapon material. The context was of course 9/11, which drove the US and its allies to pursue aggressive international policy absent any meaningful reflection on what those policies would mean for the multilateral landscape. Among the neocons who partly ran Bush’s foreign policy, the prevailing mood was that extreme times call for extreme measures against a threat they could not easily grasp. Sound familiar?  There is a certain irony in linking the PSI to climate change, as the same Bush administration was actively against a robust climate policy. Yet though it lacks in international diplomacy, the same strategy offers clear practical advantages. The PSI was only possible because the US was determined that the threat of nuclear weapons was so severe that it had to lead on a response. This is precisely the type of leadership that is lacking on climate change. There have been some positives in 2018, and the UK has emerged as a potential climate leader. Following the paralysis of London by activist group Extinction Rebellion, the UK parliament took the unprecedented step of declaring a climate emergency, though what this means precisely remains unclear. Then there was the announcement of legislation to target net zero emissions by 2050 by the outgoing prime minister, Theresa May. So how to capitalise on that momentum, and spread it worldwide? My suggestion is that the UK follow the precedent of the PSI and create a Climate Security Initiative (CSI). A CSI could encompass a set of bold principles to reduce emissions and champion green technology, going well beyond the Paris Agreement and propelling the UK into a leadership position that other like-minded states would be able to support. There already exist a number of states that could form an initial CSI group, all willing to commit to radical steps to fight climate change. Ireland, for instance, has also declared a climate emergency. New Zealand, too, has begun the legislative process to become carbon neutral by 2050, while Finland has targeted 2035.  Of course the proliferation threat does differ from climate change. The latter is intrinsically linked to the global economy and the behaviour of billions of people. Decarbonising humanity will mean radical change on an unprecedented scale, spanning from the state to the individual. Yet we can choose to control this change through net zero aspirations, or we can have it forced on us through a radially altered climate not necessarily conducive to human existence.  The benefit of a CSI approach is that not only can it be designed to meet the threat head on, something the Paris Agreement has failed to do, but also if led by the UK it will help to counteract the narrative that the developed world simply isn’t doing enough to combat its historic role in emissions creation. A CSI offers the UK a way to transfer its recent political declarations into tangible action, without being stifled by international law. If the UK really wants to “lead the world to a cleaner, greener form of growth” it has to look beyond the Paris Agreement, and beyond its own borders – something a Climate Security Initiative could achieve.

 **Burn, Hollywood, Burn**  
A regular review by John Black



Over 1 million people sign up to ‘storm’ Area 51, the U.S military base thought by tin-foil hatters to contain extra-terrestrial beings. Vaccination rates fall across the western world after anti-vaxxers cause ‘vaccination hesitancy’ among parents. Twisted white guys obsessed by ‘the Great Replacement theory’ gun down innocent women and children in Christchurch and the US.



In the age of the internet, conspiracy theories all too easily migrate from fabulists’ fever dream to real-world consequence. 



In 1976 a man named Bill Kaysing self-published a pamphlet entitled ‘We Never Went to the Moon: America’s Thirty Billion Dollar Swindle’. Since then the idea that mankind’s greatest technological achievement is a big fat lie has become crank gospel. Kept on a low simmer by cheap TV documentaries and badly printed books you find in the same shops that sell crystals and ceramic bongs, the idea has roared into life with the oxygen of the Internet. According to a recent poll conducted in the US, 18% of millennials believe it was all a hoax. 



The absurdity of these claims should be obvious even without any consideration of the scientific evidence. A recent Oxford University paper found that 411,000 people would have had to have been ‘in on’ the conspiracy without there being one whistleblower. And all this orchestrated by the Nixon administration, an administration which couldn’t manage to cover up a simple burglary properly?



Yeah, right.



So what’s the antidote for this idiocy?



Films like ‘Apollo 11’.



A brilliant new documentary on the moon mission, it blends original colour footage (50% of it never seen before) with radio exchanges between Houston and the astronauts to create an immediacy that belies its fifty-year vintage. Using only Walter Cronkite’s contemporaneous narration the film opens close to launch time with shots of excited spectators camping out for the big event. The genius of the film is in creating tension when we all know the ending (SPOILERS: They land on the moon. Yes, you vaping, weirdly-bearded millennial, THEY LANDED ON THE BLOODY MOON). Director/editor Todd Douglas Miller achieves this by on-screen countdowns for each stage of the mission and split-screen sequences showing the NASA Control Centre and the spacecraft simultaneously. He is aided by a pulse-pounding electrophonic score by Matt Morton, which matches perfectly the relentless drive for technological achievement played out on the screen.



Middle-aged men in short-sleeved shirts staring into computer monitors has never been so gripping. 



While there is plenty of technical talk, info-graphics and shots of the balletic manoeuvrings of the spacecraft there are also reminders that this was a human endeavour. Buzz Aldrin referring to moon craters as ‘big mothers’ and his deadpan assurance to an over-anxious Houston controller, ‘If I stop breathing, I’ll be sure to let you know.’ Neil Armstrong’s awe at the ‘stark beauty’ of the moon’s surface. The constant monitoring of the astronaut’s heart rates which vary according to how crucial the stage of the mission is (Aldrin’s seems to be the coolest customer with the lowest heart rate, ironic given the way he loses it on this idiot – but who can blame him).



The emotion that lasts after viewing is one of awe. Awe at the bravery of Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins and the ingenuity of the NASA folk behind them. Awe at the majesty of human scientific achievement. At a time when human technology is being blamed for one of the most hyped up evils of the age – climate change – this should be a valuable corrective. I recommend it for all those who like myself exalt in scientific achievement and are curious as to how exactly the moon mission succeeded. But I also recommend it for those millennial moon hoaxers. Die-hards won’t be convinced (‘It’s all CGI NASA propaganda!’ I hear them cry) but those wavering might well end up as I did, silently saluting the men responsible for our first baby steps to the stars.

"**A ""restrictive"" regime imposed at a prison due to coronavirus has resulted in a rise in violence and mental health issues, inspectors have said.**
HM Inspectorate of Prisons said strict rules at HMP Lindholme, near Doncaster, meant prisoners spending long hours in their cells ""without reprieve"".
An inspection in October found the restrictions were not proportionate when compared to other prisons.
Progress to relax the regime had also been too slow, inspectors concluded.
Charlie Taylor, HM chief inspector of prisons, said the regime introduced in March was in line with guidelines designed to protect staff and inmates from Covid-19.
However, Mr Taylor said most of the 900 inmates were allowed out of their cells for less than an hour a day and it was not uncommon for them to spend 28 hours in their cells at weekends.
""There was mounting frustration among prisoners who reported the excessive time spent locked up was having a negative impact on their well-being, including weight gain, difficulty in sleeping and a deterioration in their mental health,"" he said.
Plans by the governor to ease restrictions had stalled as negotiations with the local staff association had failed to come to an agreement, Mr Taylor said.
""While we were aware of the need to ease restrictions in a safe and measured way, progress had been far too slow,"" he added.
""The failure to improve the regime during the summer meant prisoners were now subject to a second-wave tightening of restrictions without having had much reprieve.""
Mr Taylor did praise the prison's education team, noting that more prisoners were engaging with education than before the pandemic and he said there had been improvements in prison safety since it was inspected in 2017.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLeading IPCC critic and co-author of CO2 skeptic book The Neglected Sun Professor Fritz Vahrenholt was interviewed yesterday on MDR German radio.
We have to at least give credit to MDR for even inviting a real skeptic – indeed a rare event in German public media.
The MDR moderator begins by claiming that the new IPCC report warns of galloping climate change and accelerating sea level rise. Christiana Figueres says that it’s a wake up call for the world.
What follows is an excerpt of the interview.
Moderator: Is it a wake-up call for you?
FV: I see big progress in the new climate report towards more realism and more openness. First of all the IPCC recognizes that the Medieval Warm Period was just as warm as it is today. That had always been disputed. That means that without CO2 we had situations in the past, in history, that were similarly warm. There has to be a reason for that. There are natural factors for warming, which the IPCC had always played down. Secondly, the IPCC for the first time has taken into account that it hasn’t gotten warmer in 15 years. It recognizes that, and acknowledges that the climate models are not correct. That is a very important success by the critics…
Moderator: Huh.
FV: …and it is far more important that the science here stood its ground when the German government, the employees of [Environment Minister] Herr Altmaier tried in Stockholm to have the 15-years of no warming deleted from the report because they feared the people would see that it hasn’t gotten warm in the last 15 years, and so then you can’t…
Moderator: Huh.

google_ad_height = 200;

FV: …push through such a massive energy transformation. I think it’s wonderful that the scientists resisted that.
Moderator: I have the impression that we’re discussing different papers here. Just let me summarize what I just told you: Climate change is progressing more rapidly and with more strength than expected, and, you can read it in the report, man bears the main responsibility for the warming through GHG emissions. What you’re saying sounds completely different.
FV: Well you see, when you really look into the report, you’ll find that it states that man is responsible for more than 50%.
Moderator: I agree.
FV: But I’m saying that it’s going to be maximum 50%. But the real question is: what’s behind the other 50%? The other 50% is nature itself. It’s the sun. It’s the large-scale ocean currents. We have to admit that there has not been any warming in 15 years. There’s no explanation for this. The IPCC can’t explain it. I can explain it. Many critics can explain it: it’s because on one hand the sun has weakened since 2000; because the major ocean cycles have tipped to their cold phases. We are going to experience it. In The next 10-15 years we are going to see a further modest cooling; we aren’t going to see any warming and…
Moderator: Huh.
FV: …here at least the IPCC has signaled that it at least sees this. But it cannot interpret this. On the outside it is saying everything is going to get worse.
The moderator then asks Vahrenholt if we no longer need to care CO2 emissions at all. Vahrenholt replies that of course that we should, but that it isn’t necessary to rush madly into it and economically shoot ourselves in the foot. Nature gives us the time to work on a sensible CO2 policy. “Every additional year of no warming shows that the models are wrong. The models that cannot reproduce the last 15 years of no warming, how are they supposed to correctly give us the temperature for the next 100 years?”

On the battle between Arrhenius and Ångström.
Story submitted by John Kehr, The Inconvenient Skeptic
Any serious discussion about the Theory of Global Warming will eventually include the absorption band argument that started more than 100 years ago between Arrhenius and Ångström.  One of the arguments presented by Ångström was that the main CO2 absorption band is between 14-16 micron and that band is also absorbed by water vapor (which is correct).  The counter to this by Arrhenius was that it didn’t matter in the upper atmosphere where there was no water vapor.  Of course none of this matters because radiative heat transfer is only 20% of the energy transferred to the atmosphere, but that is generally ignored by both sides of the argument.
At the time there was no way to measure the temperature in the upper atmosphere so there was no way to determine what was going on there, but of course now there are many ways to measure the temperature there.  When I started looking at the annual temperature behavior of the stratosphere and the top of the troposphere I found something very interesting that is as usual, bad for the warmists.
Here is the average daily temperature of the troposphere (at ~4.2 km) and the stratosphere (41 km).


What makes this so interesting is that they are completely out of phase with each other.

The tropospheric temperature is matched to the natural global temperature cycle.  This is highly dependent on the geography of the Earth’s surface.  The stratospheric temperature is not in phase at all with the surface temperature.  It is however in phase with the Earth’s orbit around the Sun.  The distance the Earth is from the Sun determines how much energy the Earth gets from the Sun.  Here is the stratospheric temperature and the solar constant over the course of the year.

While I would not say that the upper atmospheric temperature is completely independent, it is mostly independent of the of the lower atmosphere.  The cooling in the stratosphere each spring is exactly what would be expected based on the changing solar constant.  The warming that takes place in July is likely caused by the peak atmospheric temperatures in the NH that take place during the summer months.  That warming stops in October, but by that point the increasing solar iconstant warms the stratosphere.
What determines the stratospheric temperature is absolutely critical to understanding why it has been cooling over the past 60 years (which is about how long it’s temperature has been measured).  If the stratosphere’s temperature is primarily dictated by the incoming solar energy then the argument made by Arrhenius is meaningless.  That is because the increase in CO2 would never have an impact on the temperature there, simply because so little of the energy needed to warm the stratosphere comes from the Earth’s surface.
Based on the scientific data, the stratosphere is mostly influenced by the solar constant (basically the distance from the Sun for this discussion).  There appears to be some influence from the lower atmosphere, but it is clearly marginal.  This is not really a surprise since the energy transfer mechanisms are very limited above 12km.  The low atmospheric density results in low vertical mixing rates which only leaves radiative transfer which is a poor method for heat transfer when low absolute temperatures are involved.
When the temperature of the stratosphere and the troposphere are compared for the period from 2003-2011 it is also interesting to note that the peak stratospheric temperature was lowest of the whole period in early 2009.  This also matches the period of minimal solar activity over the entire period of time.  All of these pieces together clearly demonstrate the importance of the solar constant on the stratospheric temperature.  This also means that any impact by atmospheric CO2 levels on the stratospheric temperatures is very limited.

For the seventh time now, I am spending a week in July at a Chinese university with several other Americans to speak about economics to Chinese students. And every visit, I learn more about the growing communist giant across the Pacific.



However, these experiences have gotten more difficult as Washington and Beijing clash over issues large and small. More important, though, has been the internal crackdown in the People’s Republic of China. My first trip to the PRC was in 1992: it was a vastly different country, one finally exiting the Maoist era’s intermittent lunacy. In the succeeding years, there was increasing liberalization — most obviously in economic policy, but also in terms of personal autonomy.



The Tiananmen Square massacre likely closed off any prospect of serious regime reform, but political controls remained loose at the edges. Academic exchanges flourished, freedom‐​minded NGOs operated, and the Great Firewall was penetrated. Independent‐​minded Chinese journalists, though unable to challenge the Communist Party’s monopoly of power, had space to expose government misdeeds. These all fueled hopes that economic reform and market transformation would encourage a freer Chinese society.



Alas, President Xi Jinping seems to have killed that possibility, at least for the present.



Academic exchanges have become more difficult; NGOs have been shut down, churches destroyed. Human rights lawyers have been arrested, internet controls tightened, and a totalitarian “social credit” system developed. Foreign policy, too, has become more aggressive: pressure on both Taiwan and Hong Kong has increased, and, perhaps most notably, Uighurs have been incarcerated _en masse_.



These and other related changes have significantly accelerated a decline in Sino‐​American governmental relations.



This increasingly restrictive political climate has also created greater uncertainty in nonpolitical relationships. A couple months ago, I arrived in China for a conference scheduled for the next day only to be told that I (and other foreign invitees) could not participate. The local party had decreed that they required Beijing’s approval if we were to attend. I had spoken at the same event two years before and wouldn’t have said anything particularly controversial. But no matter: this was an old requirement, I was told, which until recently hadn’t been enforced.



Americans involved in politically sensitive research — regarding Tibet or Xinjiang, for instance — have long risked being denied entry into the PRC. But recently the U.S. and China have engaged in a new variant of “visa wars,” with Washington the aggressor, revoking permission for Chinese university professors and others to visit America. Beijing has retaliated against those with connections to the Trump administration.



Even more informal personal contact is subject to greater scrutiny. Though I had done so in the past, a company that prepares Chinese students for overseas study was hesitant to have me speak (about education, not politics) at their events this year. University students admitted that they believed some subjects, such as Donald Trump, to be too sensitive to ask about. This in contrast to a few years ago, when I was questioned about Tiananmen Square and internet censorship in Chinese economics classes (which I tried to answer with appropriate political sensitivity).



Washington is uncertain as to how it should respond to the increasing challenges posed by Beijing. China is not an enemy and should not be treated as such, but the Trump administration’s trade war and other economic restrictions continue to weaken what was traditionally the foundation for our bilateral relationship: economic partnership. With the usual corporate defenders of bilateral ties essentially silent, the China-U.S. relationship has become much more uncertain.



Moreover, the U.S. still fails to distinguish between vital and peripheral interests. When Washington officials talk national security, they’re really interested in influence. Underlying American policy is a determination to remain dominant in the region, which China views as its geopolitical sphere. U.S. interests there are real, too, but comparatively modest, while those of the PRC are fundamental, even existential. Washington’s current aggressive policy, if unchanged, may well make conflict inevitable.



Both governments should do much better at facilitating contact between private citizens. It’s especially important when inter‐​government relations are tense and unproductive.



Despite the sometimes disconcerting stares that still greet Westerners, most Chinese are friendly. Many have relatives in the U.S. and have traveled to America — or hope to do so. A taxi driver struck up a conversation with one of our number who knew Chinese. The cabbie had two children in Georgia. After discovering that one my colleagues was from the same state, he didn’t want to charge us for the ride.





Although the dealings between the American and Chinese governments sometimes leave me pessimistic, the attitudes of younger Chinese give me a glimmer of hope.



Chinese academics and officials with whom I speak readily separate the actions of Americans’ government and Americans themselves. Students exhibit an even greater fascination with the U.S. They like its culture and sports. They favor English‐​language T‐​shirts. They don’t like government restrictions on their personal autonomy. But they tend to be strong patriots and nationalists. Most important, they are Chinese, not American wannabes, no matter how much they like U.S. values and practices.



Yet both governments have been interfering with private contacts. For instance, the U.S. is concerned that Chinese scholars are working with their government’s intelligence services. Such suspicion seems inevitable for anyone who calls the mainland home, family members being vulnerable to government retaliation. Not many are willing to tell a dictatorship no. While thoughtful controls over foreigners’ access to security‐​related information is necessary, American policymakers should not isolate the U.S. from those who know and like this country. Rather, Washington should to use them in its own “intelligence work,” learning as much from them as possible.



Indeed, private trips can act as informal, quasi‐​track II events. That is, governments can effectively exchange policy and political ideas through private actors. The lack of official accountability allows for greater creativity and experimentation. Ideas can be mooted and discussed without being officially offered. Given the growing bitterness of the public debate in both nations, keeping private diplomatic channels open supplements American foreign policy. The result, hopefully, will be to maximize the number of considered ideas while prodding governments to think more creatively.



Returning again and again to the same university to teach economics seminars has created enduring friendships. Obviously, these relationships are unlikely to transform political ties between the two capitals. But nevertheless, on both sides, at least a few more can count as friends those from other nations. The more this phenomenon spreads, the more difficult it becomes for governments to demonize others to justify hostility, conflict, and war.



Such contacts, multiplied nationwide, can also help create an easier familiarity with the other side. That can mean understanding better how the other parties think and behave, a greater willingness to talk with foreign counterparts, and increased trust in the intentions and proposals advanced. Obviously, my spending a week annually with one university has little chance of transforming the bilateral relationship, but the aggregate impact of a multitude of individual relationships could make a real impact.



Reaching students may be even more important in the long‐​term. As collegians enter the workforce, they will begin to change their nation. It would be best if they appreciated the values of liberty and understand how designing policies that protect them can be practical solutions. Indeed, most already object to internet censorship and other restrictions, though few can be expected to challenge their government. The best outcome in the PRC is likely the gradual transformation of the regime through an internal process led by just such young people. Reinforcing their natural inclinations would be a positive investment for the future, even if the impact would be uncertain and indirect.



But the contacts do not go only one way. Particularly noteworthy is the fact that foreign students now attend this and other Chinese universities. The enrollment of the school that hosted the economics seminar is not huge, and there are no Americans, at least none who attended the classes. However, a number of countries are represented: Japan, Taiwan, Russia, Poland, Belarus, and the Czech Republic. These students will affect their domestic counterparts, who will be China’s leaders in the future.



Although the dealings between the American and Chinese governments sometimes leave me pessimistic, the attitudes of younger Chinese give me a glimmer of hope. The students are interested and want to learn. They value freedom in their own lives. They are fascinated by the outside world. They desire to make their nation a better place. And they are willing, even eager, to engage Americans.



China will be one of America’s biggest foreign policy challenges for years to come. But Washington can do much by encouraging private, personal contacts. The U.S. will need every advantage that it can get to deal with the PRC in coming years.

It had to happen. She may have a nice smile and seem like a decent enough person, but Jacinda is simply not prime minister material, and it is finally beginning to show. Her inability to answer questions because she simply does not know the answers is becoming legendary. Her absences from the house have seen her labelled as the _#partimepm_. Her tendency to dash off overseas at every opportunity and leaving the mess behind her, is an obvious ploy. Dare I say, her other trick, of wheeling out the baby every time she is in trouble, is becoming extremely obvious too. 



Her popularity would have waned sooner, had it not been for the Christchurch massacre. Whilst no one would have wanted it to happen, the mosque shootings were a godsend for Jacinda. The whole world praised her for her empathy and compassion. She handled the situation well but her knee jerk reaction to ban semi-automatic weapons has shown her up for the amateur she really is. In a supposed attempt to make everyone feel safer, she has given us all reason to feel much less safe than we did before, as law-abiding citizens give up their guns; but the gangs, of course, do not. 



Matthew Hooton believes her popularity has fallen by 16 points, to 35%. Sure, it is still a long way ahead of Simon Bridges’, but it is a very big drop in popularity in a very short time. It seems that people are finally starting to see through her. 



Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern says losing some of her popularity is the result of taking on serious challenges in Government. 



“When it comes to the personal ratings what I equally accept is that when you are in Government and taking on big challenges and difficult conversations and hard debates there are going to be people who disagree with you,” Ardern said.  
“We are not going to make progress on some of these big difficult issues unless we are willing to confront hard conversations.  
“If you simply govern just to maintain popularity it probably means you are not taking some of those big issues on.” 



But she is not taking on any of the big issues. Kiwibuild is a big failure. Mental health has a lot of money allocated to it, but with little or no progress so far. Child poverty and homelessness get worse and worse and, this week, we found out that suicide rates are the highest ever. Ever.



Did she mean that telling Fletchers to stop working at Ihumateo, putting a commercial agreement and property rights at risk and then boarding a plane to go to the islands and leaving everyone else to sort out the mess is her idea of dealing with the ‘big issues’?



Ardern’s government has moved on the controversial issues like abortion and climate change and has ploughed money into mental health, which she describes as one of the long-term challenges facing New Zealand. 



Wasting billions of dollars on “climate change” when we contribute less than 1% of global emissions is madness; and most people know it. Many people, while agreeing that abortion should be removed from the Crimes Act, do not want to see late-term abortions, and they are horrified at the prospect. As for the money being ‘ploughed’ into mental health, the latest suicide statistics would suggest that this is just another case of allocating money but having no idea how to spend it – which is something that this government is famous for.



So Jacinda is dreaming if she thinks her popularity is in freefall because she is tackling the ‘hard issues’, because she isn’t tackling any of the hard issues at all. She wouldn’t know where to start. It is much more likely that people are seeing her for what she really is – a decent enough person, but someone who is way out of her depth, who does not understand some of the basic concepts of government, and should never have been put where she is in the first place. 



That is the truth about our prime minister. We all know it, and she probably does too.

Riffing on the name of a popular science website, it has been remarked that “Everyone f-ing loves science – until it contradicts their personal bullshit”. Never a truer word could be said about, not just activists, but so-called ‘science journalists’ who don’t seem to grasp even the fundamentals of science. Instead, these legacy media hacks simply regurgitate whichever press releases suit their ‘narrative’.



Such ignorant fraudulence was in abundant supply at last week’s Pacific Islands Forum and its attendant media coverage.



The ABC’s reporting of the ­Pacific Islands Forum meeting in Tuvalu from August 13 to 16 was a spectacular case in point. In a bid to wedge Scott Morrison on the public broadcaster’s favourite subject, climate, Pacific leaders received a free kick. But here’s the thing: most of the islands are not sinking. That is what the peer-reviewed science shows.



In a famous paper from the University of Auckland released last year and based on sophisticated physical models, scientists showed many of the atolls on Tuvalu, Kiribati and Tokelau are actually rising. The finding confirms observations from satellite photos showing the islands are increasing in area, Tuvalu by 73ha between 1971 and 2014.



It gets worse. The ABC’s own fact check unit confirmed this in a ruling last year […][so] where was Paul Barry’s _Media Watch_ , normally the ABC’s ­climate science policeman?



You’ll sooner meet a genuine “climate refugee”, though, than drag an acknowledgement, let alone a correction, out of our taxpayer-funded broadcaster.



But even the ABC’s prostitution and distortion of actual science pales into that of grasping Pacific leaders who’ve spotted the perfect leverage for another generation of handouts.



Patricia Karvelas did not ­appear to know the science when she interviewed Tuvalu Prime Minister Enele Sopoaga on RN Breakfast on August 14.



“What impact is the changing climate having on your country right now?” Karvelas asked.



Sopoaga replied: “People are about to be […] swallowed into the sea because of erosion …”



Sapoaga was allowed to peddle not just this nonsense without challenge, but the utterly fraudulent claims of “climate refugees”.



Remember all the scare stories in the 1990s and early noughties quoting the UN predicting “50 million climate refugees by 2010”?



But if journalists are ignorant about actual climate science, as opposed to scary press releases from e-NGOs, their knowledge of the geopolitics of the Pacific is even worse.



Journalists covering the Pacific should know much more about the history of Australia’s ­relations with its island neighbours. Since the forum was launched by New Zealand in 1971 this has largely been the work of Coalition governments as Labor after the Keating era looked increasingly to Indonesia and China for its foreign policy impetus. The Morrison pivot to the Pacific is back to the future.



This is something Peters understood even if his Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, and many journalists, did not…



  
Some Pacific leaders might be well advised to ask the leaders of states to the north, across the South China Sea, whether they think China is the kindly benefactor some at the PIF seem to think it is.



Pacific mendicants seem to be running the razor’s edge of playing the big geopolitical powers – China, the US, and middle-power Australia, which is a pivotal power in Pacific terms – against each other, and scrabbling for the pennies as they fall out. The legacy media are too ignorantly eager to join in and seize the opportunity to damage a newly-elected conservative prime minister, with no thought for the long-term cost.



Pacific Islands will almost certainly feel the very real consequences of toadying to an aggressively expansionist China long before any dodgy climate alarmism projections come true.

EPA regional administrator Al Armendariz tours the Mobile Classroom (Photo credit: americaspower)

Junkscience.com reports that:
EPA official Al Armendariz who rocketed to infamy last week because of 2010 comments about “crucifying” industry, has resigned from the agency.
Click for his resignation letter. (PDF)
Here’s the source of the uproar, this video:


Inhofe wasted no time going after this public servant turned crucifier.
In a speech on the Senate floor, Senator James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.), Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, announces that he has launched an investigation into the Obama-EPA’s apparent “crucify them” strategy targeted at American energy producers. This investigation will look into EPA’s actions towards domestic energy production specifically in light of the agency’s recent efforts relating to hydraulic fracturing.
Inhofe’s announcement today follows several questionable statements from top EPA officials, including comments released in a little-watched video from 2010, which reveals EPA Region VI Administrator Al Armendariz admitting that EPA’s “general philosophy” is to “crucify” and “make examples” of oil and gas companies.

Unfortunately, there are dozens, perhaps hundreds more just like him at the EPA, an organization that seems to be at war with the industry of the United States of America, and the people too. See:

Outside the media and political circles that follow her every move, few probably noticed or cared when Alexandra Ocasio‐​Cortez pronounced capitalism “irredeemable.” But what are we to make of the refusal of former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper — supposedly the moderate in the Democratic field — to admit that he was a capitalist? Speaking on MSNBC’s _Morning Joe_ last week, Hickenlooper turned aside several direct questions about whether he was a capitalist before allowing that “some aspects” of capitalism, like small business, “probably work.” And what about the fact that 77‐​year‐​old avowed socialist Bernie Sanders is in a statistical tie for the Democratic nomination?



Perhaps that’s because Democratic primary voters have a surprisingly favorable view of socialism. According to the latest Harvard CAPS/​Harris Poll, Democrats prefer capitalism to socialism by the slimmest 51–49 percent margin. That’s a long way from President Obama, who just four years ago pointed out that “the free market is the greatest generator of wealth in history — it has lifted millions out of poverty.”



Of course there is ample reason to be suspicious of the combination of cronyism and government intervention that has replaced free‐​market capitalism in recent years. But this new affection for socialism represents a profound misreading of economics, history, and the human condition.





As long as the party keeps lurching left, Trump’s reelection prospects will improve.



For most of recorded history, humankind was horribly, desperately poor. Then, about 300 years ago, human wealth suddenly began to increase exponentially. The reason for this sudden and wonderful change was the advent of modern free‐​market capitalism. And while those at the top of the income ladder undoubtedly saw major gains, those who benefited the most from this increase in wealth were those at the bottom.



In her groundbreaking book _Bourgeois Equality_ , Deirdre McCloskey points out that in the era before modern free‐​market capitalism, great civilizations, such as Periclean Greece or Song Dynasty China, sometimes saw a temporary doubling of national income per capita. Such gains were considered extraordinary. But compare that to the fact that since 1800, developed countries like Sweden or Japan have seen a 3,200 percent growth in per capita income. And with that growth came all sorts of associated benefits, including longer life expectancies, a better‐​educated citizenry, expanded civil and political rights, and reduced poverty. Studies measuring inequality over time against indexes of economic freedom (adjusted to exclude exogenous factors such as educational levels, climate, agricultural share of employment, and so forth) show a small but statistically significant _reduction_ in inequality in countries with high economic‐​freedom scores.



What has been true worldwide has been true for the United States as well. Consider that by most measures nearly all Americans were poor at the start of the last century. Indeed, if we use a definition corresponding to today’s poverty measures, 60 to 80 percent of the U.S. population was poor at the start of the 20th century. Today, while some people undoubtedly continue to struggle, deep material poverty has been nearly eradicated.



It is free‐​market capitalism that is at the heart of this prosperity.



Nor is the debate about capitalism vs. socialism merely a question of economics. Strip away all the bells and whistles and there are only two ways to organize society: markets or command and control. Markets are fundamentally about choice and voluntary exchange. Command and control is about, well, _command_ and _control_ &Mdash; that is, force. Advocates of socialism presume that this power will be exercised by wise philosopher‐​economist‐​kings who can magically determine precisely what wages should be, how much a product should sell for, and what consumers want (or should want). History shows that, instead, those powers are exercised by fallible human beings who not only get economic decisions wrong but cannot resist spreading their new power into non‐​economic areas of our lives.



Donald Trump, with his continuing calls for government intervention in the economy, is hardly the best person to make the case against Democrats and socialism. He is, in fact, emblematic of the cronyism that has come to taint capitalism in the minds of many. But his message may still find a receptive audience.



The same Harvard/​Harris poll cited above showed voters overall preferring capitalism by a 65–35 percent margin. Voters outside the Democratic‐​primary base are far less enamored of socialism. Even many of those choosing socialism probably don’t really mean it, seeing “socialism” as simply shorthand for a more generous welfare state.



In particular, an anti‐​capitalist, pro‐​socialist message will be a very hard sell in the crucial suburbs that have begun swinging Democratic in the last few elections. Voters in those areas are repelled by Trump’s rhetoric and Republican social conservatism but remain capitalists.



There’s no doubt that Trump remains vulnerable, but so long as Democrats continue their lurch to the left, his reelection prospects will look up.

Share this...FacebookTwitterToday the German and international media, politicians and activists are all in a celebratory mood – the climate catastrophe is back after all. It’s real and approaching faster than ever. The UN just certified it! Climate activists are in a state of euphoria again – they’re out dancing in the streets – there hasn’t been such a feeling since 2007. It’s climate Oktoberfest for the alarmists.

It’s been six long years of relentless torment inflicted by Neanderthal skeptics. Worse, the public was even starting to become hopeful about the future once again, and were becoming less afraid of climate. For the climate catastrophe everything had been looking so bleak as the pesky real observations glaringly contradicted the modeled catastrophes 15 years long.
But happy days are back again – the catastrophe is coming, the UN reassures the world. The 15 years of model failure are not significant after all. In fact the UN now says the models are better than ever and the climate scientists are now 95% confident the climate catastrophe is coming and that our living standards are responsible for it. Never before have scientists been more confident.
Even more encouraging: sea levels will rise faster than expected. Rest assured, the climate catastrophe is coming and things are more urgent than ever. Don’t let any skeptic tell you otherwise, as they only want to spread some damn optimism about the future.
Today alarmists in Germany (and globally) are more giddy than we’ve seen in a very long time. Many alarmists will be going to bed tonight feeling more content than ever, believing they’ll be waking up to a tomorrow of imminent catastrophe.
Here are some quotes from the German news:
“It’s here: the new IPCC report is here! … Congratulations to all colleagues who participated. … Many developments are assessed as being more urgent than in the IPCC AR4 of 2007,” so cheers Stefan Rahmstorf at Scilogs.
“Climate change is real, and its happening at an alarming rate,” proclaim NGO organizations like WWF, Greenpeace, Oxfam, Friends of the Earth, Actionaid and Christian Aid with uncontrollable glee.

“We have indeed even less time than we thought,” gloats a giddy Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam-Institute for Climate Impact Research.
“The climate deniers still owe us a convincing answer: if 95% certainty is not enough reason to act, what is it then?” demands Connie Hedeguaard at Twitter.
“Except for the temperature, everything else has accelerated,” beams Stephan Singer of the WWF.
“A very clear signal to the world,” admonishes Mojib Latif of the Geomar Helmholtz Center.
“There’s no problem with the science, rather there’s a problem with taking action,” lectures the kooky side of Spiegel Online.
“As the IPCC and its new report state, sea level could rise much faster by the end of the century than previously believed,” reassures online FOCUS.
Let the alarmists have their day. In the end we all know it isn’t going to last long at all. You can dig up a corpse, clean it up, dress it, and parade it through town claiming it’s alive. But in reality it’s a lifeless, rotting and ghoulish cadaver, and it’s not ever going to be coming back to life.
AR5 is the IPCC’s Order of AGW Exhumation. The alarmists are now parading the corpse, pretending it’s alive and in ruddy health.
But AGW science is dead, and has been so 15 years. It’s not taking a nap, it’s not passed out, it’s not even breathing. It’s long deceased. The UN IPCC and climate activists refuse to come to terms with that.

"Academics travel a lot. Whether for fieldwork or conferences, we’re often encouraged to do it. Often internationally, invariably by aeroplane. But while globetrotting might make us feel important, a recent study suggests there’s no connection between academic air-miles and career advancement. With the obvious realities of the climate crisis, and with air travel being the single quickest way an average person can contribute to climate change, some academics are trying to stay on the ground whenever possible. Within a broader campaign to encourage people to go “flight-free”, there’s a community of academics challenging the reliance on flying that’s typically sat uneasily at the heart of their careers. I’m a member of that community. I pledged not to fly in 2019 and 2020, and then won a fellowship to study Chinese attitudes to sustainability which required me to go to China for fieldwork. Suddenly, the consequences of my pledge became very real. When I told my managers that I intended to get to China by train, I was met with a mixture of responses. Some thought I was mad, some admired my principles, some thought I was an awkward bugger. Maybe they were all right. In any case, what I was doing had certainly created more work for myself. I began trying to convince senior staff to release funds from my research budget to arrange visas, and thinking through the nitty-gritty of a trip across Europe, Russia and a big chunk of China itself. The cost of the trains was over £2,000, dwarfing the £700 I could pay for a London to Beijing return flight. Time-wise, the train trip took just under two weeks each way. But in terms of carbon emissions my trip was a steal, contributing just 10% of the emissions of the equivalent flights. The cost, complexity and discomfort of such a long solo trip did occasionally make me wonder if it wouldn’t just be easier to fly (answer: it would). But I was determined to honour my pledge and show other academics – by my own extreme example – that it is possible to do international work without flights. Considering it involved 21 train connections, my journey went surprisingly smoothly. I took a series of “short” trips from Southampton, changing in London, Brussels, Cologne, Berlin and then onto my first sleeper train from Warsaw to Kiev (avoiding Belarus which would have required another visa).  My first experience on the Kiev-bound, Soviet-style sleeper train was something of a shock. Unsure of the etiquette when sharing a tiny cabin with two or three others with limited English, I soon learned that body language, Google translate and sharing food breaks the ice. Luckily, my no-flying trip was a recurring source of conversation, fascination and bafflement for many of my fellow travellers. After one night in Kiev, I took another overnight train to Moscow. Russia was something of a test – on my return journey I travelled 2,600 miles between Irkutsk and Moscow, spending 90 hours on a single train. Had this not been a work trip, I would have gladly stopped more often. Making friends with fellow passengers – mainly Russians on work trips or family visits, or European and Chinese tourists doing the bucket list Trans-Siberian route – certainly helped pass the time. The Siberian scenery – millions of trees on a seemingly endless loop – became somewhat repetitive, but the monotony afforded me time to read, write, plan and contemplate. The most spectacular journey was the Trans-Mongolian section, passing the edge of Lake Baikal, the world’s largest lake rimmed with snow-capped mountains, over the green steppes of northern Mongolia, across the Gobi desert, and finally through the mountainous valleys encircling Beijing. It’s hard not to be awed and inspired that these train lines exist in such remote parts of our planet. China now has more high-speed railways than the rest of the world combined, and they do it in style. Beijing to Shanghai, a trip covering 1,300km, takes less than four and a half hours, with a solid internet connection throughout and the most legroom I enjoyed on any of my trips. The downer is that China’s electrified trains will, like most of their electricity, be powered by coal. But on the upside, these trains are likely to take passengers off domestic flights – a lesson for Europe and the US.  I enjoyed using them to visit my other field sites in Hangzhou and Ningbo before finally retracing my steps back, over 6,000 miles to the UK, clutching a load of new data, a heap of memories, and a sore back. The focus group data I collected in China, with members of their urban middle classes, has enforced my view that both ‘bottom-up’ social and cultural pressure, as well as “top-down” infrastructure and fiscal policy will be required in any country facing up the complex challenges of climate change. I admit that my story is somewhat privileged – not everyone can take the train to China for work, and I doubt I’ll make a habit of it. Much depends on geography too. The UK is relatively well connected by surface transport options like rail, but many still fly - the UK has the third largest air passenger market, behind only the US and China.  The bigger policy goal is to make train tickets less expensive relative to flights. In the meantime, academics can play a leadership role, both individually and institutionally. Universities could consider publishing records of staff flights, building low-carbon travel modes into grant proposals by default, and making videoconferencing facilities fantastic.  Recent research has shown, unsurprisingly, that climate researchers are taken more seriously if they practise what they preach. If we can lead by example in reducing our own flying carbon footprints while still conducting great research, then others – students, policymakers and other professionals – are far more likely to take notice.

"The evidence of the climate crisis is now undeniable. But state responses to climate change often have social and political motivations, rather than addressing the realities of this threat. Since the 1980s, preventative action has been internationally stifled by the industrial agenda of a conservative political agenda which has maintained intensive subsidies to the fossil fuel industry. There has been a backlash against this lack of impetus in recent times by groups such as Extinction Rebellion, which highlights the need for significant action by wealthy Global North states. These wealthy, industrialised nations – and about 100 corporations largely headquartered within them – have been the largest drivers of climate change via fossil fuel emissions, while baulking at global agreements to provide meaningful climate aid to developing countries. The idea of drowning or sinking islands has long existed as a way to describe future risks that small island states must confront. But the reality is that these threats affect life in such places today. Many small islands states have chosen to reintroduce previously unpopular resettlement and migration policies in the face of climate change.  This is the story of Kiritimati (pronounced Ki-ri-si-mas) in the Pacific – the largest coral atoll in the world. A closer look at the story of this particular island sheds light on the issues facing those living on such islands all around the world, and the inadequacy of current international policy. Kiritimati has a dark past of British colonialism and nuclear weapons testing. It gained independence from the UK on July 12 1979, when the Republic of Kiribati was established. Now a complex threat is appearing over the horizon.

      The atomic history of Kiritimati – a tiny island where humanity realised its most lethal potential


 Raised no more than two metres above sea level at its highest point, Kiritimati is one of the most climate vulnerable inhabited islands on the planet. Inadequate action is being taken to protect the people who live there. It is at the centre of the world, yet most people could not pinpoint it on a map, and know little about the rich culture and traditions of its people.  This culture may be set to disappear. One in seven of all movements in Kiribati – whether between islands or internationally – are attributed to environmental change (14%). And a 2016 UN report has shown that half of households have already been affected by sea level rise in Kiritimati. Rising sea levels also pose challenges to the storage of nuclear waste on small island states – a hangover from the island’s colonial past. Those who have moved become climate change refugees: people who has been forced to leave their home due to the effects of severe climate events and to rebuild their lives in other places, having lost their culture, community, and decision-making power. This problem will only intensify. Since 2008, intensifying storms and weather-related events have displaced more than 24m people around the world annually, and the World Bank estimates that another 143m people will be displaced by 2050 in just three regions: sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Latin America. In Kiritimati, a few mechanisms have been created to help islanders. For example, the Kiribati government has implemented a programme, “Migration with Dignity”, with the aim of creating a skilled workforce able to find good employment abroad. The government has also purchased 6,000 acres on Fiji in 2014 to try and ensure food security as the environment changes. New Zealand has also created an annual opportunity lottery called the Pacific Access Ballot. This lottery is presented as a way for 75 Kiribati citizens per year to resettle in New Zealand. But quotas are not being filled. Understandably, people do not want to leave their homes, families and lives.  The World Bank and the UN, meanwhile, have argued that Australia and New Zealand should improve mobility for seasonal workers and allow open migration for citizens of Kiritimati, in light of climate change affects. But seasonal work is often menial and offers few prospects for a better life.  While well-intentioned international policy is predominantly focused simply on relocation, rather than providing adaptive capacity and long-term support, these options still do not offer true self-determination for the people of Kiritimati. They tend to commodify people, reducing their relocation to reemployment plans.  It also means that beneficial local projects, such as the new airport, a permanent housing programme and a new marine tourism strategy could soon become redundant. Realistic and affordable strategies to reclaim and maintain the island’s land are needed to prevent migration from becoming a necessity.  Encouraging the population to migrate is of course the option with the lowest costs. But we should not fall into the trap of thinking it is the only option. We don’t need to allow this island to drown.  This is not just a human issue – abandoning this island to the sea would also eventually condemn a bird species found nowhere else on earth, the bokikokiko, to global extinction. Other small island states whose existence is threatened by rising sea levels are also home to species at risk of extinction. The Marshall Islands, for example, are home to the coconut crab, which can only be hunted and eaten by the local inhabitants. International aid could resolve many future problems and preserve this astonishing and beautiful place for humans, nonhuman animals and plants, but the lack of support from wealthy nations makes options like this difficult for residents of small island states to consider. Artificial islands have been created in Dubai – why not here? Many other hard engineering options exist, such as coastal fortification and land reclamation technologies. Such options could protect the homeland of the Kiritimati people while also enhancing the resilience of these places – if international aid were more readily and consistently available from the nations that have driven this climate crisis.  At the time of writing, there is neither an internationally recognised definition of the climate refugee, nor are they covered by the UN 1951 Refugee Convention. This maintains a protection gap, as environmental degradation is not defined as “persecution”. This is despite climate change arising due to the complacency of industrialised nations, as well as their negligence in combating its stark consequences. The UN Climate Action Summit on September 23 2019 may begin to address some of these challenges. But for the millions of people who live in places that are threatened by climate change, the question is about environmental and climate justice. This question should be not just about whether climate change hazards are being addressed – but why those who want to continue to live on small island states often do not have the resources or autonomy to address climate change and other global challenges themselves."

It was a tough decision. So many are terrible.



 **  
RATINGS GUIDE:**



 **$** to **$$$$$** with **$** being a leftist trougher and **$$$$$** being small government dynamo



For some, however, a clown is more appropriate. More than one may be awarded.





 **Upper Harbour Local Board**



There are 14 candidates for this 6 seat Local Board. You have up to 6 votes



 **Anna Atkinson –** Living Upper Harbour **$$$$**



This two-member ticket has been very helpful in ensuring we don’t confuse them with any dead Upper Harbour candidates.



Anna’s profile is pretty bland and featureless. Google tells me virtually nothing.



She has been a chartered accountant for 20 years so will enjoy the boredom of Local Board meetings and she appears to understand what Local Boards can actually do.



 **Uzra Casuri Balouch $**  




Uzra is an incumbent board member with decades of business experience. As an incumbent board member, she is well aware of the limits of what a local board can achieve. To say that she will build infrastructure such as a library and a multi-storey car park at Albany Park and Ride is sneaky. Local Boards don’t have capital budgets on that scale and Albany Park n Ride is AT property. She can advocate for capital projects to the council, budgeted out of the ten-year plan as the other 20 local boards do but that’s it. Uzra should know this.



Assisting youth into work is complete horse-feathers. Local Boards don’t do that and councils shouldn’t either. Also wants consultation with _“diverse communities in development decisions. Preserve the heritage, character and natural environment of our communities like Bomb Point (sic)”_



Duplicitous, with NIMBY painted all over her.



 **Mary-Anne Benson-Cooper**  




Mary-Anne is like a problem gambler buying 100 tickets for the Powerball Jackpot. Upper Harbour is one of three Local Boards she is standing for. It is only possible to be elected to one, so if she is elected to more than one, she decides which one to turn down.



She promises lots of advocacy and aid to community groups and volunteers. She opposes any park sales.



 **Callum Blair –** Independent **$$$**



Blair was a councillor on the North Shore City Council 2007-2010 and elected to the Upper Harbour Local Board following the amalgamation. He has previously been an advocate for the construction of municipal pools. I know it is counted as recreation and therefore a core function but surely is better left to the private sector?



He is concerned at the decline in funding allocations for Upper Harbour and indicates they deserve more.



He has also been a candidate for the Conservative Party.



 **Jaggar Bootten –** Independent **$**  




Bootten looks like a teenager and I don’t want to look like I’m bullying young people. However, I first ran for parliament at 19 and got treated like any other candidate. He will suck it up.



His [campaign video](https://www.facebook.com/JaggarBootten/?eid=ARAJzPc4imxNMyPW2GrMt3to8Je19uo-NpRZt2FOAHYaZMpT-lN8oOAeu81ja8FMAPaE3t0XrZOtfAoq) is right out of the Jacinda Ardern playbook. Leaning forward, raised eyebrows, rehearsed empathy. If there were an election for kindy teacher, I’d rate him $$$$$ (despite the salary being $). He trots out the line about 42% of people in the area being under 30 with nobody on Local Board being under that age.  
  
Of course, it is identitarian nonsense. Nobody working for the Ministry for Children is an actual child but we don’t claim that is a bad thing.



He supports sustainable rate changes, more affordable housing and will ensure accountability for council spending. I hope if he stands again in 2022, he works out what Local Boards actually do.



 **John Glover $$**



His [candidate profile](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=b78d098a-3d85-41e8-829e-0ac02d4675fb&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Upper%20Harbour%20Local%20Board) is fluff and womble. He would “invest in people rather than footpaths to nowhere.” Then he complains about an absence of footpaths.  
  
I think he likes footpaths. He wants a diverse mix of people around the local board table but he’s a white male so I don’t know if he’s telling people not to vote for him, is taking the piss or a bleeding heart liberal.



With a building and construction background, I’m going to take a stab in the dark and hope he’s taking the piss.



 **John Loau –** Independent **$$**



So far, the line-up looks pretty bleak. John wants to keep Bomb Point Park a park and smarter and efficient solutions around public transport and planning. Those are buzz words I like though anyone can use them.



 **Nicholas Mayne –** Living Upper Harbour **$$**



I’ve met Nicholas on several occasions. We both ran in Upper Harbour in 2014 and East Coast Bays 2017 general elections. He’s a fundamentalist Christian, union delegate and a Green party member. I’m neither but my interactions with him point to him being a decent bloke. 



Nicholas is an incumbent and says his achievements include a review of Upper Harbour’s Play Spaces and Path Network, plans for a new playground in Greenhithe, increased community participation in ecological restoration projects and progress on a Pest-Free Strategy. That looks like a lot of looking but very little doing.



He hopes to achieve more in his next term by making “Smart Equitable Decisions.”



Equitable. Hmm.



 **Jonathan McDonald**  




Thinks I’m going to tick some boxes. Taking Action to Combat Climate Change (hence why he won’t put up corflute signage or deliver leaflets). He’s wrong.  
  
I suspect he simply has no money and fear he will minimise waste by abolishing voting papers.  




 **John McLean $$$**



He has previously been Chairman of the Albany Community Board and is currently on Upper Harbour Local Board. I’m split because his candidate profile looks awesome but most of it isn’t related to Local Board functions. He will be fully aware of this.



  
“Long history of Community service, Local Government representation, NZ Scouting, Chairman Albany CoCo, former Trustee Albany Senior High School, FFS Charity, Hearing Commissioner for Auckland Council.



Cut out waste. Seek greater efficiency. Rates should be indexed to CPI and a regime focusing on results. Transaction costs should be reduced, innovation is needed and new projects critically tested against ‘needs vs wants.’



John offers strong advocacy tempered by affordability and common sense. Lack of infrastructure is causing traffic congestion and gridlock. Lack of infrastructure is at the heart of Auckland’s growth and Housing affordability is essential to regional growth. Albany anticipates 4600 new homes so continued intensification requires strong mitigation.



The RMA needs overhaul. The Auckland Plan must remain affordable, responsive to a City with burgeoning growth, safe for its families and citizens and new arrivals alike.”



 **Margaret Miles –** Independent **$$$**



Margaret is an accredited Resource Management Act Commissioner. That would make her competent on Local Board but I’m not sure how.



Has a QSM for community service and is concerned that Upper Harbour rates are disproportionality being spent outside of the area.



 **Brian Neeson –** Independent ****



Some of you may recall that Neeson got the boot from the National Party to make room for John Key. Neeson has listed nothing that the Board has achieved and a loooooong list of the things he says still need to be done. That includes supporting local business opportunities (not his job).



Think it is time Neeson found something else to do. It’s been time for 17 years.



 **Glen Stanton –** Independent **$**



I covered him in the Hibiscus and Bays Local Board. 



**Lisa Whyte $$$$$**



Lisa Whyte has been in local body politics for fifteen years and as far as I can see, is very effective. Multiple community facilities have been refurbished, a new septic system for Whenuapai Village Hall was funded (while the land owner, Auckland Council, continued to pay for monthly pumping of this dying utility). Smart free-wifi solutions for parks sponsored by private companies (though some were quashed by bloody Auckland Council) are amongst those achievements. It’s a pity she hasn’t put her name forward for council again, after being beaten on the Auckland Future ticket in 2016.  
  
Worth her weight in gold.



 **MY RECOMMENDATIONS:** I’ve had to put a lot of thought into this one. You have up to 6 votes in this FPP contest.

English: Forest on the Fichtelberg in Saxony, Germany. Deutsch: Wald auf dem Fichtelberg. (Photo credit: Wikipedia)
From Duke University and the Department of Obvious Science  comes this study partially funded by NASA:
Standing trees better than burning ones for carbon neutrality
DURHAM, N.C. — The search for alternatives to fossil fuels has prompted growing interest in the use of wood, harvested directly from forests, as a carbon-neutral energy source.
But a new study by researchers at Duke and Oregon State universities finds that leaving forests intact so they can continue to store carbon dioxide and keep it from re-entering the atmosphere will do more to curb climate change over the next century than cutting and burning their wood as fuel.

“Substituting woody bioenergy for fossil fuels isn’t an effective method for climate change mitigation,” said Stephen R. Mitchell, a research scientist at Duke’s Nicholas School of the Environment. Wood stores only about half the amount of carbon-created energy as an equivalent amount of fossil fuels, he explained, so you have to burn more of it to produce as much energy.
“In most cases, it would take more than 100 years for the amount of energy substituted to equal the amount of carbon storage achieved if we just let the forests grow and not harvest them at all,” he said.
Mitchell is lead author of the study published in the peer-reviewed journal Global Change Biology Bioenergy. Mark E. Harmon and Kari E. O’Connell of Oregon State University co-authored the study.
Using an ecosystem simulation model developed at Oregon State, the team calculated how long it would take to repay the carbon debt – the net reduction in carbon storage – incurred by harvesting forests for wood energy under a variety of different scenarios.
Their model accounted for a broad range of harvesting practices, ecosystem characteristics and land-use histories. It also took into account varying bioenergy conversion efficiencies, which measure the amount of energy that woody biomass gives off using different energy-generating technologies.
“Few of our combinations achieved carbon sequestration parity in less than 100 years, even when we set the bioenergy conversion factor at near-maximal levels,” Harmon said. Because wood stores less carbon-created energy than fossil fuels, you have to harvest, transport and burn more of it to produce as much energy. This extra activity produces additional carbon emissions.
“These emissions must be offset if forest bioenergy is to be used without adding to atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations in the near-term,” he said.
Performing partial harvests at a medium to low frequency – every 50 to 100 years or so – could be an effective strategy, O’Connell noted, but would generate less bioenergy.
“It’s a Catch-22,” she said. “Less intensive methods of harvesting release fewer emissions but yield less energy. The most intensive methods, such as clear-cutting, produce more energy but also release more carbon back into the atmosphere, prolonging the time required to achieve carbon sequestration parity.”
Given current economic realities and the increasing worldwide demand for forest products and land for agriculture, it’s unlikely that many forests will be managed in coming years solely for carbon storage, Mitchell said, but that makes it all the more critical that scientists, resource managers and policymakers work together to maximize the carbon storage potential of the remaining stands.
“The take-home message of our study is that managing forests for maximal carbon storage can yield appreciable, and highly predictable, carbon mitigation benefits within the coming century,” Mitchell said. “Harvesting forests for bioenergy production would require such a long time scale to yield net benefits that it is unlikely to be an effective avenue for climate-change mitigation.”
###
The research was funded by a NASA New Investigator Program grant to Kari O’Connell, by the H.J. Andrews Long-term Ecological Research Program, and by the Kay and Ward Richardson Endowment.

In 2016 naive millennials lapped up the Greens’ environmental policy, and they continue to congratulate themselves for saving the environment. 



“We love Aotearoa and we want to protect it. Our kids have a birth right to swim in clean rivers, fish in the sea, and walk in pristine forests.



“ **Our Environment Policy protects New Zealand’s natural heritage from exploitation of finite resources for short term profit, such as industrial dairying & open-cast mining. **



“ **Real prosperity means clean rivers and air, rich biodiversity, and protected marine areas.”**



  
The Greens have a warped view of prosperity. In their zeal for the environment, they did not spare a thought for us who would wear the knock-on effects of their flawed policies. 



Protecting the environment is necessary – but not at the price the Greens have forced us to pay, which is beyond reasonable.



They have infiltrated the education system to ensure that the next generation of voters is brainwashed about man-made climate change to support their foolhardy goals.



The Greens gave us the Emissions Trading Scheme and the Zero Carbon Bill, which are crippling our farming industry. In their urge to get cars off the road and us onto bicycles and public transport, they scrapped highways planned by the previous government. Congestion is now a way of life and contributes to increased transport costs that push up prices.



The Greens support the flawed RMA process with red tape that ties up development and skyrockets building costs. Business confidence has plummeted.



We must challenge them because their price tag to save the planet is unacceptable. The cost is increased unemployment and hungry, sick and homeless people. 



They simply can’t help themselves colouring everything with climate change as demonstrated in their policy **“Love New Zealand Fiscal Plan”.**



The goals of our plan are:  
 **To make New Zealand a world leader in the global fight against climate change.**



 **To restore and replenish our forests, our birds and our rivers.**  
To end poverty and create an inclusive Aotearoa. 



  
The Greens put the environment ahead of people and have forced New Zealand into a downward slide of financial failure.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf you still don’t believe climate models cannot be trusted to predict the future, then watch the following video of a presentation made with humor added by leading expert modeler Prof. Christopher Essex earlier this year. Absolutely worth viewing!

Hat-tip: DirkH
On scientific consensus
Essex quotes a cartoon: “Then we are agreed nine to one that we will say our previous vote was unanimous“.
On Mann’s phony hockey stick
The hockey stick thing was wrong on so many levels, problematic on so many levels…”
Search for “smoking gun” began already in early 1980s
In the early 1980s Prof. Essex got a post doc at the Canadian Climate Center with the general circulation model group who had a desire “to do some definitive things“. Essex recalls:
Some big wheels there sat me down in this room and said we want you to come up with the smoking gun that will prove global warming.”
So clearly, from the very beginning, this was all about putting mankind on the dock.
“Welcome to wonderland”

//-->




But Essex told them it wasn’t possible. Indeed it is not only Essex who believes models cannot describe the complex climate system. At the 7:35 mark he quotes the “ultimate skeptic position” – from the IPCC!
In climate research and modeling, we should recognize that we are dealing with a coupled non-linear chaotic system, and therefore that long-term prediction of future climate states is not possible.”
Even the IPCC admitted in 2001 that models were nothing but “wonderland”. Over the course of the presentation, Essex explains why this is so.
At the end of the presentation his comments in the Q&A session are most interesting.
“It’s running out of gas”…”just craziness”
On how long policymakers can continue this “Welcome to Wonderland” climate modeling, Essex thinks “it’s running out of gas” and called some of the things going on in climate science and reactions to legitimate academic inquiry “just craziness”. He thinks that  a lot of people have their lives and careers invested in it but that it will eventually run its course.
I think the overall momentum is gone and they aren’t going to be able to gin it up again quite the way they had.”
What’s going to replace the climate modeling madness?
Some new madness. Yeah. We’re dealing with humans here, you know, I mean, haha, okay.”
Essex is right. But will it be possible to top the madness we’ve seen with the global warming scare? Let’s hope not.

Every time I think I’ve seen the craziest thing yet about global warming mania…along comes something else. From the ANU College of Asia & the Pacific blog, comes this bizarre story from Thailand that shows what lengths a government will go to to slap a global warming fine on farmers.
Since being charged with global warming, villagers have begun working on farms farther from the reserve, harvesting cassava. The man in red was one of the thirteen villagers who was charged along with Ms. Kwanla.
Humans cutting down forest land to farm is nothing new. However, charging rural farmers for causing global warming is. A controversial formula is quantifying the damage villagers have to pay for their small scale farming. Now, the villagers are taking a stand against what they know is wrong.
PHETCHABUN – Early one Thursday morning, a gun was pointed at Ms. Kwanla Saikhumtung, a 34-year-old mother, because she was farming.
The man who pointed the gun was one of ten armed officers from Phu Pha Daeng, the local wildlife sanctuary in Lomsak district. After observing the villagers for three days, the officers finally informed Ms. Kwanla and twelve fellow villagers from Huay Kontha that they were trespassing on wildlife sanctuary land. They demanded that the villagers come to the police station to talk with them.

They refused. The villager that hired them paid taxes on the plot, leading the villagers to believe they had a right to work the land, and they worried about finishing their work.
The officers quickly became annoyed. One threatened to shoot any villager that resisted the officers’ orders.
“Are you really going to shoot? I’m here to harvest the corn, and you want to shoot us?” Ms. Kwanla shouted.  She then bravely grabbed the barrel of the gun, pressed it to her chest, and said, “If you’re going to shoot, shoot.”
The officer lowered his gun. That night, the officers marched the reluctant villagers through the community and drove them to the police station.
This incident was the beginning of a seven-year-long legal battle, pitting Ms. Kwanla against the Thai government. She and the other twelve villagers — the youngest only sixteen at the time — were first charged with trespassing.
The real shock, however, came when they were slapped with a 470,000 baht fine for contributing to global warming under the charge of causing environmental damage.
As the landowner was paying taxes on the plot of land in question, he had the right to grow crops on it. Since Ms. Kwanla and the other villagers had been hired to harvest his corn, it had seemed that they were not breaking the law by being there. However, unknown to the landholder, his plot overlapped with the wildlife sanctuary land.
The Royal Forestry Department (RFD) fined the villagers for cutting down trees and farming, drawing from the 1992 National Environmental Quality Act which forbids “destruction, loss, or damage to natural resources owned by the State.” Their fine was determined according to a formula used to calculate environmental damage. The formula measures the increase in temperature caused by cutting down trees. Any increase in the land temperature shows ‘global warming’. In essence, cutting down trees to farm corn leads to global warming.
The Huay Kontha villagers have a running joke, “Because we pick the corn, the world gets hotter.”
The charges that Ms. Kwanla and the other villagers face shed light on an emerging trend in Thailand. Land dispute issues are becoming increasingly common. According to Pramote Pholpinyo, coordinator of the Northeast Land Reform Network (LRN), there are currently 35-40 “global warming” cases against villagers in Thailand, with charges amounting to almost 33 million baht.

The public school system in the nation’s capital is failing. Teacher incompetence, bureaucratic corruption, crumbling infrastructure, violence, lax academic standards, and wasteful spending are among the litany of problems plaguing the District of Columbia Public Schools. By almost any educational achievement measure, the children attending public schools within the shadow of the U.S. Capitol are not receiving a quality education.



While critics of DCPS tend to focus on the failures of particular superintendents or administrators bedeviled by scandal or incompetence, the failure of the government‐​run school system in the District of Columbia is not new. This failure preceded white flight from the District in the mid‐​1950s and has continued despite inflation‐​adjusted increases in spending, reduced class size, and attempts to reform the system from within. In short, the good old days of public education in the nation’s capital never were.



Contrary to the claims of defenders of the public school system, DCPS does not lack money. Despite having per‐​pupil spending that ranks among the highest in the nation–10,550 for 1999–2000–public school students in the District rank near the bottom on standardized tests and in achievement levels. Although spending has almost tripled since the 1980–81 school year and increased 39 percent since Mayor Anthony Williams took office in 1998, the system lacks qualified teachers, safe facilities, and even basic supplies such as pencils and text‐​books. The system’s leaders demand more money in exchange for more promises of improvement.



To improve education in the nation’s capital, we must consider options beyond spending more money in a system that even supporters acknowledge is troubled. Change must not be limited to propping up the current system. Public schools that are little more than holding pens must not be sheltered from private competition. The city must find a way to create competition within the system, with the goals of giving parents power over the education of their children, fostering an environment that will create a climate for education entrepreneurs to flourish, and taking education out of the hands of feuding politicians.

"Gardeners have been loading up with compost and plants as garden centres have reopened in the UK, except for Scotland. But compost made with peat is still being used by both gardeners and commercial growers, even though it is dug up from peatlands, devastating wild bogplants, wildlife, and sabotaging the fight against the climate crisis. Peat is made up of dead plants saturated and preserved in water, locking away vast amounts of carbon in the plant remains. Peatlands account for about 3% of the Earth’s land area but hold more than one-third of all the carbon in soil, and more than twice as much as the world’s forests. But when peatlands are damaged they release their carbon, some 2bn tonnes of CO2 worldwide annually, more than 5% of all manmade greenhouse gas emissions.  Scotland has much of the UK’s peatland, including the largest single expanse of blanket bog in the world, the Flow Country in the far north of Scotland. Much of that peat was devastated by conifer plantations decades ago, but tax breaks that encouraged the tree planting on bogs were abolished in 1988 and in recent years a large area of the bog has been restored by getting rid of the conifer trees and drainage channels, raising the water level and encouraging bog plants to grow back and wildlife to return.

"**The UK must push other countries to ensure that ship crew stranded because of Covid restrictions get home leave this Christmas, a union has said.**
It is estimated that 400,000 seafarers, up to 2,000 of them from the UK, are currently stuck on vessels.
The Nautilus International union wants crew to be classified as key workers in all countries, making it easier to fly them home for time with loved ones.
The government promised to keep making the case for this internationally.
Many of the world's 1.6 million seafarers are working past the end of their contracts, unable to be relieved because of quarantine and travel rules, and a lack of flights.
Some have been on duty for 17 months without a prolonged break.
The International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) estimates 400,000 seafarers are stuck on board cruise ships, transporters, tankers and other vessels, and the UK Chamber of Shipping says up to 2,000 of them are from the UK.
The UK government designated seafarers as key workers when the first coronavirus lockdown began in March. Forty-three other maritime countries have done the same - but 130 have not.
""This is an international crisis which requires an international response,"" said Nautilus International general secretary Mark Dickinson. ""All governments need to designate seafarers as key workers and allow them to transit borders and relieve crew.
""Our members work hard to supply food, medicines - and presents - to UK households,"" added Mr Dickinson. ""They often do so without much acknowledgement or public recognition.
""This year, the coronavirus pandemic has given rise to unprecedented levels of stress, fatigue and safety concerns due to countries closing their borders and preventing them from seeing loved ones.""
Bob Sanguinetti, chief executive of the UK Chamber of Shipping, said the UK government had ""led the way"" but been ""let down by other governments across the world"".
In July, the UK hosted the International Maritime Summit on Crew Changes, after which it and 12 other countries called for seafarers of all nationalities to be classed as key workers.
They also recommended greater co-operation between governments on health, immigration and other issues to facilitate crew changes.
ICS secretary-general Guy Platten said the UK could ""not afford to rest on its laurels"", adding: ""The 44 countries who have given seafarers the recognition they deserve have a duty to lobby fellow member states to do the same.""
Mr Platten also urged international cooperation to ensure crew have early access to coronavirus vaccines, so that shipping ""continues to function in 2021 and beyond"".
Maritime Minister Robert Courts said: ""The government has already worked to repatriate over 20,000 crew members from around the world and will continue to work with domestic and international partners to help bring more seafarers home to their loved ones."""

It’s enviro vs. enviro in Washington’s most “progressive” suburb, Takoma Park. Indeed, the _Washington Post_ reports, “a potentially bough‐​breaking debate between sun‐​worshipers and tree‐​huggers.” That is, which is more environmentally desirable, solar power or tree cover? 



The modest gray house in Takoma Park was nearly perfect, from Patrick Earle’s staunchly environmentalist point of view. It was small enough for wood‐​stove heating, faced the right way for good solar exposure and, most important, was in a liberal suburb that embraces all things ecological.   
  
  
Or almost all. When Earle and his wife, Shannon, recently sought to add solar panels to the house, which they have been turning into a sustainability showplace, the couple discovered that Takoma Park values something even more than new energy technologies: big, old trees.   
  
  
When they applied to cut down a partially rotten 50‐​foot silver maple that overshadowed their roof, the Earles ran into one of the nation’s strictest tree‐​protection ordinances. Under the law, the town arborist would approve removing the maple only if the couple agreed to pay $4,000 into a city tree‐​replacement fund or plant 23 saplings on their own.



So now the rival environmentalists are squaring off in front of the city council: 



Takoma Park City Council members, who are considering revising the 1983 tree‐​protection law, listened Monday night as otherwise like‐​minded activists vied to claim the green high ground.   
  
  
Tree partisans hailed the benefits of the leafy canopy that shades 59 percent of the town: Trees absorb carbon, take up stormwater, control erosion and provide natural cooling.…   
  
  
Solar advocates at the hearing said that they are tree lovers, too, but that scientific studies support the idea of poking select holes in the tree cover to let a little sun power through.



Being an environmentalist homeowner can become a full‐​time job: 



But even some veteran solar users don’t like the idea of trading trees for panels. Mike Tidwell, founder of the Chesapeake Climate Action Network, installed solar panels on his Takoma Park house 10 years ago. As the trees have grown, the panels’ effectiveness has diminished, and Tidwell now buys wind power credits to supplement them.   
  
  
Still, he said, “I don’t believe you should cut down trees for solar.” Rather, he thinks neighbors should work together to place shared panels on the sunniest roofs.



The city’s “official arborist” turned down Earle’s application to tear down one rotting tree to accommodate his solar panels. Now the council is debating the issue. 



The Earles’ council member, Josh Wright, said he was sympathetic to their plight. He said it should remain hard to cut down a tree, but he’d like to see a break for people installing solar power. Wright also wants all homeowners to get credit for trees they may have planted in the years before they remove a tree.



It all sounds very complicated. And who knows what the right answer is? Or if there is a right answer? Or if the right answer might change next year?   
  
  
And that’s where property rights come in. They allocate both jurisdiction and liability over scarce resources, like roofs, trees, and access to sunlight. A little “law and economics” can help to understand the Takoma Park Tree Tussle. Nobel Laureate in Economics Ronald Coase, who just turned 100, brought law and economics together to study the way that people externalize costs (make others pay for them) or internalize them (take them into account when making decisions). When property rights are well defined and legally secure, and rights can be exchanged at low cost, resources will be directed to their most highly valued use. In fact, the initial allocation of property rights doesn’t affect the allocation of resources, _if_ the transfers are freely and easily negotiable.   
  
  
That, unfortunately, is no longer the case in Takoma Park, where instead of a fairly straightforward transaction (facilitated by a purchase), there is a tussle over ill‐​defined rights and obligations that have little or no legal security, in a very expensive and costly process of negotiation that will almost certainly consume more wood pulp for memos than is contained in the tree in question. Well‐​defined and legally secure property rights save us the rather substantial trouble of sitting down like the Takoma Park City Council and trying to judge the advisability of every proposed purchase, all the while consuming large amounts of paper and exuding large amount of hot air.

"Imagine walking through a lush tropical forest. You hear a rustle overhead, and a half-eaten fruit plops onto the trail. You lock eyes with a howler monkey, before he gives a soft grunt and moves higher into the trees. These magical, fleeting connections with a wild animal can be the highlight of a holiday.  Wildlife tourism like this is booming, raising much-needed funds for and awareness of conservation efforts. However, there is a dark side to this business, and many tourists unknowingly put animals at risk by supporting activities that encourage the capture of wild animals or cause them pain or distress. But that’s not to say you should avoid wildlife tourism altogether – we just need to be more aware of the impact we can have on the lives of wild animals. Here are five ways to ensure that your wildlife holiday encounter contributes to the animals’ conservation and welfare. Animals used for tourist photos are rarely kept in humane conditions, and all have been removed from their normal ecological and social situations. Brown sloths, for example, are common photo props in Central and South America. They are often handled by many people in a single session, and become distressed by having their limbs or head manipulated for a better photo.   Similarly, the slow loris is a frequent prop in Southeast Asia. Bright sunlight is painful for these tiny nocturnal primates, and many have their teeth removed for tourist safety. Meanwhile, in Southern Africa, lion cubs are taken from their mothers and hand-reared so you can snuggle them. Once they are too big for selfies, however, they often enter the canned hunting industry, where hunters pay to kill animals in an enclosed area. This doesn’t mean you can’t take an amazing wildlife photo, however – just keep your hands to yourself and follow advice like the World Animal Protection’s wildlife selfie code, which tells us only to take photos if the animal is in its natural home, at a safe distance, and free to move away. Feeding wildlife leads to a number of serious problems. Sharing food, and even just getting too close, increases the risk of disease transmission between people and animals. Gorillas, chimpanzees and orangutans, for example, are susceptible to a number of human infections, including colds and flu, measles, tuberculosis and pneumonia.  A high proportion of human food in primate diets is also linked to poor coat condition and obesity. And when animals learn to expect food from humans, they can become quite bold, which increases the risk of human-animal conflict. Some long-tailed macaques in Bali have even learned which items to steal from tourists in order to “barter” for food.

 Lack of understanding of an animal’s normal behaviour allows tourists to overlook abuse and contributes to human-animal conflict. With their human-like faces and behaviours, primates already teeter on the edge of uncanny valley, so it’s all too easy to misinterpret their expressions and postures. One study found that tourists viewing Barbary macaques struggled to recognise aggressive or distressed facial expressions. However, misinterpretation of monkey faces and postures is one of the surest ways to get yourself bitten. When an animal gives a clear warning and a person does not respond appropriately, it is understandable when bites and scratches occur.  Understanding a bit about animal behaviour can also help you recognise abuse. To keep them docile and safe for tourists, some elephants in Southeast Asia undergo a cruel training process during which they are immobilised and beaten, starved and deprived of water. Working elephants are prohibited from exhibiting their natural behaviours, such as maintaining complex social relationships and ranging many kilometres each day. While you may not know the signs of distress for a species, we can all recognise that wild animals who cannot perform their normal behaviours are not being treated properly.   We can only protect wildlife if we protect their communities, and those communities include people. Responsible wildlife tourism should provide funds for both the people and the animals who live in those environments. So do not give all of your money to international corporations. Stay in locally-owned hotels, try local foods, and embrace the culture of the place you are visiting. The economic impact of tourism can be huge, and making sure your money supports the local area ensures that people have the means to protect their natural treasures in the future. Wildlife tourism success stories from Tanzania, where villages protect wild spaces in exchange for tourist revenues, to Costa Rica, where wildlife tourism creates sustainable, well-paid jobs for local people, show us that economic development can occur alongside wildlife conservation. Tourist income has a lot of power, so choose where to spend your money wisely. If something feels off to you, don’t participate. If you are not sure, consider the situation. Are the animals captive, or are they performing unnatural behaviours? Know that “sanctuaries” or “reserves” may still engage in unethical practices, so research your activities before you go with a reliable organisation like the RPSCA or the Humane Society.  Share your experiences online and let people know which companies are engaging in questionable practices. When we stop buying unethical animal experiences, people will stop selling them as well."
"Tropical cyclones have become more intense around the globe in the past four decades, with more destructive storms forming more often, according to a study that further confirms the theory that warming oceans would drive more dangerous cyclones. Analysis of satellite records from 1979 to 2017 found a clear rise in the most destructive cyclones – also known as hurricanes or typhoons – that deliver sustained winds in excess of about 185km/h.  Australia sits across two ocean basins where cyclones form – the southern Indian Ocean and southern Pacific Ocean – where the study also identified rising trends of the more destructive storms. Experts told Guardian Australia the finding was in line with climate model predictions and the knowledge that increasing ocean temperatures gave tropical storms more energy. Dr Hamish Ramsay, a senior research scientist at CSIRO who studies cyclones, said: “This study confirms what the climate models have been predicting for some time – that the proportion of the most intense storms will increase as the climate warms.” While climate scientists have long-predicted that global heating would deliver stronger cyclones, a trend that was statistically significant has been challenging to identify in part due to the natural swings in the world’s climate masking changes. Published in the leading journal the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the study was carried out by scientists at the US government’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The scientists did not try to find a cause for the increase in more dangerous cyclones, but said the trends were consistent with understanding of physics and modelling, and the finding “increases confidence that [tropical cyclones] have become substantially stronger, and that there is a likely human fingerprint on this increase”. The probability of a cyclone reaching wind speeds greater than 185km/h had risen by about 15% over the 39 years studied. A previous study of the same data had only spanned a shorter period from 1982 to 2009 and, while positive trends had been found, they were statistically not at significant levels, the study said. As well as looking at the number of cyclones forming globally, the study also looked at changes in cyclone intensity by region. The southern Indian Ocean and the southern pacific Ocean both showed an increase in the number of the more intense storms, although the trends in each individual region were not as robust due to the smaller number of cyclones. “[The study] suggests that the climate change signal in the data is potentially already emerging and this is something that climate scientists have been saying for some time,” Ramsay said. “We maybe at a point now where we are starting to evidence from observational data that supports what the models have been telling us.” Ramsay said as well as increasing the wind speeds in cyclones, warming oceans would also likely see cyclones delivering more rainfall. There was still uncertainty as to whether the numbers of all categories of cyclones would rise or fall under climate change. Australia’s 2018 State of the Climate Report said since 1982 there had been a downward trend in the number of all tropical cyclones in the Australian region but it was not possible to see any trend in the intensity of cyclones. Previous research has found that when cyclones form, they are tending to move more slowly, while delivering more rain. Dr Greg Holland, a senior scientist emeritus at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Colorado, has studied cyclones for about 40 years. The Melbourne-based scientist said while there were legitimate arguments over the finer details of trends and intensity in relation to tropical cyclones: “The work all points in the same direction – the proportion of the most intense cyclones is going up.” He said: “There is nobody saying the trend will go the other way. The physics has been well set out for 30 or 40 years. If you get a warmer ocean then the intensities of cyclones goes up. That’s a 5% or 10% increase in maximum winds for every 1C of warming in the ocean. The world is warming and its because we have put more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. “For the Australian region – which is the eastern Indian and southern west Pacific – it means we now have the potential for there to be more intense tropical cyclones coming ashore and doing more damage. “The chances of us getting an intense cyclone have gone up already and they will go up in the future.” Holland said there was also evidence that the ocean region of Australia where intense cyclones could strike was also expanding. The observed movement was only about 150km, he said, but this would soon put Brisbane “in the cyclone zone”. Prof Steven Sherwood, of the UNSW Climate Change Research Centre, said the study was important “because it shows that the upward trends first reported about a decade ago in cyclone activity have been sustained, and have now gone on long enough that it is no longer possible for them to be a random natural variation.” He said the study found that averaged globally, 30% of cyclones in the 1980s were “major” compared with 40% of cyclones now. “There is of course nothing surprising about this — we’ve just reached the point of ‘non-deniability’,” he said. “The implication for Australia is that our risk exposure to strong cyclones will almost certainly continue to increase as long as global temperatures increase. “It also appears that storms are encroaching farther away from the equator, although this is harder to confirm observationally. If this is true, it means that the Queensland southern coast in particular may be at growing risk.”"

By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated, edited by P Gosselin)
In mid October 2013 a temperature reconstruction of the last 250 years based on tree rings from northeast China appeared in the journal of Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology. Recorded were the values for the time period of May-June, i.e. late spring and early summer.
Northeast China cooler than 100 years ago
A Chinese team of scientists led by Yu Liu discovered that the temperatures in the pre-industrial time from 1745-1900 was rather stable. But since the beginning of the 20th century, the temperatures in the region of study began to cool. As a result today the region is about 1°C colder than it was 100 years ago.

Figure 1: Development of the May-June temperatures in Northeast China since 1745. A cooling trend began in 1900. Source: Liu et al. 2013.
Alaska has cooled over the last decade
Now let’s take a look at Alaska. How have temperatures there developed over the last years and decades? The Arctic is supposedly warming up faster and faster and we are all supposed to be in a state of alarm over this. But a look at the temperature curve of the last 60 years delivers a surprise (Figure 2). Already at the end of the 1970s temperatures were surging upwards and stayed at a high level until 2005. But since then the curve has fallen dramatically. Alaska has been only cooling for the last 8 years. The temperature development there is closely coupled to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO).

USA is not warming
Moreover some scientists are now wondering why many rivers on the US west coast have been cooling significantly over the last few years. What could the cause of this be, especially at a time when things are supposed to be getting warmer? Also the temperature development for the USA for the last 110 years is showing a puzzling trend: Somehow over the long-term it just hasn’t gotten warmer? Already back in the 1930s and 40s it was just as warm as it is today (Figure 3).

Figure 3: Temperature development of the der USA based on USHCN data.
Canadian British Columbia was warmer in the 1940s
Also some interesting findings about the temperature history in Canadian British Columbia have become known. Based on tree-rings, scientists have reconstructed the temperature development for the last 800 years for the summer months of June/July (Figure 4). Here it can be observed that the 1940s were warmer than today. Also in the earlier centuries there were phases when it was warmer than today.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOn October 27, I wrote an article about the EU’s plan to ban “energy guzzling” vacuum cleaners, read here. This is all part of a plan by EU bureaucrats dubbed the European Ecodesign Directive, which aims to regulate consumers into radical energy efficiency and low carbon emission lives.
Because many of these eco-intrusion schemes originate in Europe, they DO serve as an indicator of what awaits the rest of the world should these EU control-freak bureaucrats get out of control. Anyone who thinks this is only for Europe is being terribly naïve.
America be warned. The great socialization and ecolization of the USA by Europe and UN is well underway. Many of the USA’s leading policymakers (most of them Democrats) are collaborating with the EU socialists on this.
Long list of products are targeted
Today the T-Online website here tells us much more about what the EU has in store to get its own wasteful citizens TO live more responsibly.
And already there’s been harsh reaction to the above EU Directive. For example, T-Online writes that some EU Parliamntarians are warning that the European Ecodesign Directive is “central planning“.

The T-Online article starts by describing the regulation for vacuum cleaners, but then explains what else is in store for consumers. The list is long. T-Online writes:
Currently EU bureaucrats and manufacturers are discussing requirements for energy-gobbling laptops, stove exhausts, and even wine cooling cabinets. Other products were also in discussion but after criticism they were not taken up.”
Senseless, very expensive for the consumers
Water taps were among those that the EU (at least for now) has decided not to regulate. T-Online writes:
Especially the Verband kommunaler Unternehmen – Association of Municipal Companies (VKU) – were against Brussels’ plans to approve only energy-saving shower heads and water taps. Already today German appliances are consuming 20% less water and energy than in 1990. Soon municipalities will have to additionally flush their water lines and sewage canals in order to prevent them from caking up. The EU is ‘not only senseless, but also very expensive for the consumers,’ said VKU director Hans-Joachim Reck.”

"Animal populations have declined on average by 60% since 1970, and it’s predicted that around a million species are at risk of extinction. As more of the Earth’s biodiversity disappears and the human population grows, protected landscapes that are set aside to conserve biodiversity are increasingly important. Sadly, many are underfunded – some of Africa’s most treasured wildlife reserves operate in funding deficits of hundreds of millions of dollars. In unfenced wilderness, scientists rarely have an inventory on the exact numbers of species in an area at a particular time. Instead they make inferences using one of many different survey approaches, including camera traps, track surveys, and drones. These methods can estimate how much and what kind of wildlife is present, but often require large amounts of effort, time and money. Camera traps are placed in remote locations and activated by movement. They can collect vast quantities of data by taking photographs and videos of passing animals. But this can cost tens of thousands of dollars to run and once in the wild, cameras are at the mercy of curious wildlife.  Track surveys rely on specialist trackers, who aren’t always available and drones, while promising, have restricted access to many tourism areas in Africa. All of this makes wildlife monitoring difficult to carry out and repeat over large areas. Without knowing what’s out there, making conservation decisions based on evidence becomes almost impossible.   Tourism is one of the fastest growing industries in the world – 42m people visited sub-Saharan Africa in 2018 alone. Many come for the unique wildlife and unknowingly collect valuable conservation data with their phones and cameras. Photographs on social media are already being used to help track the illegal wildlife trade and how often areas of wilderness are visited by tourists. Despite this, tourists and their guides are still an overlooked source of information. Could your holidays snaps help monitor endangered wildlife? In a recent study, we tested exactly this.  Partnering with a tour operator in Botswana, we approached all guests passing through a safari lodge over three months in the Okavango Delta and asked them if they were interested in contributing their photographs to help with conservation. We provided those interested with a small GPS logger – the type commonly used for tracking pet cats – so that we could see where the images were being taken.  We then collected, processed, and passed the images through computer models to estimate the densities of five large African carnivore species – lions, spotted hyaenas, leopards, African wild dogs and cheetahs. We compared these densities to those from three of the most popular carnivore survey approaches in Africa – camera trapping, track surveys, and call-in stations, which play sounds through a loudspeaker to attract wildlife so they can be counted. The tourist photographs provided similar estimates to the other approaches and were, in total, cheaper to collect and process. Relying on tourists to help survey wildlife saved up to US$840 per survey season. Even better, it was the only method to detect cheetahs in the area – though so few were sighted that their total density couldn’t be confirmed. Thousands of wildlife photographs are taken every day, and the study showed that we can use statistical models to cut through the noise and get valuable data for conservation. Still, relying on researchers to visit tourist groups and coordinate their photograph collection would be difficult to replicate across many areas. Luckily, that’s where wildlife tour operators could come in. Tour operators could help collect tourist images to share with researchers. If the efforts of tourists were paired with AI that could process millions of images quickly, conservationists could have a simple and low-cost method for monitoring wildlife. Tourist photographs are best suited for monitoring large species that live in areas often visited by tourists – species that tend to have high economic and ecological value. While this method perhaps isn’t as well suited to smaller species, it can still indirectly support their conservation by helping protect the landscapes they live in.   The line between true wilderness and landscapes modified by humans is becoming increasingly blurred, and more people are visiting wildlife in their natural habitats.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn Germany climate science used to be considered completely settled.
Global temperatures had been pretty much steady for a thousand years before skyrocketing upwards as soon as man really started industrializing about 150 years ago, Germans were told again and again.
But today Germany’s major media are beginning to realize that this view is perhaps quite naïve after all. Though most major media outlets here do think man is responsible for global warming, many seem to be having second thoughts and coming out to say: Gee, looks like natural factors may be important after all.

Germany’s version of the BBC is ARD television and at the ARD website we find an unusually semi-sober report on the history of the earth’s climate.
First off the ARD presents its version of the above chart, thus acknowledging that climate has been changing naturally throughout the Holocene and that there have been warmer periods than today.
Old towns bear names related to wine-making

The ARD piece even goes on to say that the Medieval Warm Period from the years 800 to 1300 was similarly as warm as the “last climate normal period of 1961 to 1990, whose mean temperature is used as the reference value.” The ARD writes further:
 Using alternative reconstructions that period was even about 0.5°C warmer than today.”
As evidence that this was probably the case, the ARD writes that many towns and villages that were founded during the Medieval Warm Period actually bear names related to wine-making: “places that are too cool for this today“.
The ARD then describes the ensuing Little Ice Age as a time of harsh winters, crop failures, starvation and witch hunts. All this, the ARD claims, was caused by “fluctuations in solar radiation and a series of especially powerful volcanic eruptions,” citing Tambora in 1815 as an example.
Of course anyone with a half knowledge of climate science knows that solar radiation is not the real culprit for climate change over the last 1000 years, but some other solar mechanism involving solar magnetic fields, cosmic radiation and cloud seeding. We’re just going to remain patient and wait for the ARD to get up to speed on this. In the meantime we can take heart that progress is being made.
Finally, I find that little tail they’ve added to the Modern Warm Period on their chart to be very amusing (see figure below, circle). That’s the warming all the panic and hysteria has been about?

 Circle around little tail indicates recent warming that has caused worldwide panic and mass hysteria.

There is a fantastic post over at [Wattsupwiththat](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2019/09/07/propagation-of-error-and-the-reliability-of-global-air-temperature-projections-mark-ii/) that is well worth the read. It is quite long but utterly destroys the whole AGW, climate emergency, IPCC etc scam.



A few highlights:



The unavoidable conclusion is that whatever impact CO2 emissions may have on the climate **cannot have been detected in the past and cannot be detected now.**



Every single model air temperature projection since 1988 (and before) is physically meaningless. Every single detection-and-attribution study since then is physically meaningless. **When it comes to CO2 emissions and climate, no one knows what they’ve been talking about** : not the IPCC, not Al Gore (we knew that), not even the most prominent of climate modelers, and certainly no political poser.



 **There is no valid physical theory of climate able to predict what CO2 emissions will do to the climate, if anything. That theory does not yet exist.**



The Stefan-Boltzmann equation is not a valid theory of climate, although people who should know better evidently think otherwise including the NAS and every US scientific society. Their behavior in this is the most amazing abandonment of critical thinking in the history of science.



Absent any physically valid causal deduction, and noting that the climate has multiple rapid response channels to changes in energy flux, and noting further that the climate is exhibiting nothing untoward, one is left with no bearing at all on how much warming, if any, additional CO2 has produced or will produce.



From the perspective of physical science, it is very reasonable to conclude that **any effect of CO 2 emissions is beyond present resolution, and even reasonable to suppose that any possible effect may be so small as to be undetectable within natural variation.** Nothing among the present climate observables is in any way unusual.



The analysis upsets the entire IPCC applecart. It eviscerates the EPA’s endangerment finding, and removes climate alarm from the US 2020 election. **There is no evidence whatever that CO 2 emissions have increased, are increasing, will increase, or even can increase, global average surface air temperature.**



The analysis is straight-forward. It could have been done, and should have been done, 30 years ago. But was not.



There is a [link](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2019.00223/full) to the full peer-reviewed paper along with a catalogue of the problems encountered in the author’s attempts to get the paper published.



In spite of the hours of research that has gone into this work, there is one major puzzle left for him:



Who’s going to tell the so cynically abused Greta? My imagination shies away from that picture.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s online Bild daily here reports on how a Chinese ice breaker trying to reach the sea ice-trapped Akademik Shokalskiy research vessel was stopped by thick sea ice:  “Also The Ice Breaker Gets Stuck!”
The 74 passengers who have now been trapped 4 days in unexpected Antarctic sea ice are made up of scientists, tourists, and crew members. One passenger onboard is a journalist from the UK’s global warming alarmist daily, The Guardian. Some have criticized the expedition as a global-warming publicity junket.
Bild reports that the vessel was on a 5-week expedition to repeat the route of Antarctic scientist Douglas Mawson of 100 years earlier. Ironically, rather than finding warming and open seas, the current expedition has wound up getting trapped by thick sea ice and blizzards that have yet to be penetrated even by modern ice breakers.
Bild writes that the Akademik Shokalskiy got trapped in ice on Christmas Eve and was forced to send out distress signals. Bild adds:
A Chinese ice breaker on its way to the MV Akademik Schokalskiy” had to bail out, it was unable to continue because of the pack ice!” 
According to Bild, the Akademik Shokalskiy research vessel had been only a couple of kilometers away from open water before it got stuck. Now even ice breakers cannot get within 6 miles of the vessel.
The Chinese ice breaker came as close as six and half nautical miles of the research vessel, but because of the thick ice it was unable to travel further.”

According to reports, Australian ice breaker Aurora Australis has the best chances of freeing the trapped research vessel, but that the ice breaker “will not arrive the sea ice until before Sunday.” That means the trapped passengers will have to sit tight for at least another day or two.
Frustration taking over
Originally it looked as if the Chinese ice breaker was about to reach the trapped boatpeople. Passenger and spokesman Chris Turney said that the ice breaker would arrive in “2 or 3 hours…if everything goes well”. But that turned out to be wishful thinking. The Chinese ice breaker was stopped by thick sea ice. Disappointment. Bild quotes Turney:
“The bad news is that the ice around our ship now extends out over 20 kilometers.”
Also the once festive atmosphere on the boat appears to be waning with frustration starting to creep in. Bild adds:
Even with Turney insisting that all is fine with the passengers and crew, a bit of frustration can be detected between his lines.”
The trapped boatpeople better start hoping for a little luck. Conditions down there are unpredictable and can get nasty really quickly. One bad storm could spell serious delays and lots of trouble. Moreover, expect the costs of the rescue efforts to run up into the millions.

In groupthink, organizations value consensus more than free thought. The emphasis on consensus leads to group polarization, in which a group’s positions become more extreme than any individual would come up with. Alarmist climate science is a textbook example of groupthink in action.
Guest post by Paul MacRae
A while ago, I received an email from a friend who asked:
How can many, many respected, competitive, independent science folks be so wrong about [global warming] (if your [skeptical] premise is correct). I don’t think it could be a conspiracy, or incompetence. …  Has there ever been another case when so many ‘leading’ scientific minds got it so wrong?
The answer to the second part of my friend’s question—“Has there ever been another case where so many ‘leading’ scientific minds got it so wrong?”—is easy. Yes, there are many such cases, both within and outside climate science. In fact, the graveyard of science is littered with the bones of theories that were once thought “certain” (e.g., that the continents can’t “drift,” that Newton’s laws were immutable, and hundreds if not thousands of others).
Science progresses by the overturning of theories once thought “certain.”
And so, Carl Sagan has written:
“Even a succession of professional scientists—including famous astronomers who had made other discoveries that are confirmed and now justly celebrated—can make serious, even profound errors in pattern recognition.”[1]
There is no reason to believe that climate scientists (alarmist or skeptic) are exempt from this possibility.

That leaves the first question, which is how so many “respected, competitive, independent science folks [could] be so wrong” about the causes and dangers of global warming, assuming they are wrong. And here, I confess that after five years of research into climate fears, this question still baffles me.
Climate certainty is baffling
It is not baffling that so many scientists believe humanity might be to blame for global warming. If carbon dioxide causes warming, additional CO2 should produce additional warming. But it’s baffling that alarmist climate scientists are so certain that additional carbon dioxide will produce a climate disaster, even though there is little empirical evidence to support this view, and much evidence against it, including a decade of non-warming. This dogmatism makes it clear, at least to those outside the alarmist climate paradigm, that something is very wrong with the state of “consensus” climate science.
There are many possible reasons for this scientific blindness, including sheer financial and career self-interest: scientists who don’t accept the alarmist paradigm will lose research grants and career doors will be closed to them. But one psychological diagnosis fits alarmist climate science like a glove: groupthink. With groupthink, we get the best explanation of “how can many, many respected, competitive, independent science folks be so wrong.”
Groupthink was extensively studied by Yale psychologist Irving L. Janis and described in his 1982 book Groupthink: Psychological Studies of Policy Decisions and Fiascoes.
Janis was curious about how teams of highly intelligent and motivated people—the “best and the brightest” as David Halberstam called them in his 1972 book of the same name—could have come up with political policy disasters like the Vietnam War, Watergate, Pearl Harbor and the Bay of Pigs. Similarly, in 2008 and 2009, we saw the best and brightest in the world’s financial sphere crash thanks to some incredibly stupid decisions, such as allowing sub-prime mortgages to people on the verge of bankruptcy.
In other words, Janis studied why and how groups of highly intelligent professional bureaucrats and, yes, even scientists, screw up, sometimes disastrously and almost always unnecessarily. The reason, Janis believed, was “groupthink.” He quotes Nietzsche’s observation that “madness is the exception in individuals but the rule in groups,” and notes that groupthink occurs when “subtle constraints … prevent a [group] member from fully exercising his critical powers and from openly expressing doubts when most others in the group appear to have reached a consensus.”[2]
Janis found that even if the group leader expresses an openness to new ideas, group members value consensus more than critical thinking; groups are thus led astray by excessive “concurrence-seeking behavior.”[3] Therefore, Janis wrote, groupthink is “a model of thinking that people engage in when they are deeply involved in a cohesive in-group, when the members’ strivings for unanimity override their motivation to realistically appraise alternative courses of action.”[4]
The groupthink syndrome
The result is what Janis calls “the groupthink syndrome.” This consists of three main categories of symptoms:
1. Overestimate of the group’s power and morality, including “an unquestioned belief in the group’s inherent morality, inclining the members to ignore the ethical or moral consequences of their actions.” [emphasis added]
2. Closed-mindedness, including a refusal to consider alternative explanations and stereotyped negative views of those who aren’t part of the group’s consensus. The group takes on a “win-lose fighting stance” toward alternative views.[5]
3. Pressure toward uniformity, including “a shared illusion of unanimity concerning judgments conforming to the majority view”; “direct pressure on any member who expresses strong arguments against any of the group’s stereotypes”; and “the emergence of self-appointed mind-guards … who protect the group from adverse information that might shatter their shared complacency about the effectiveness and morality of their decisions.”[6]
It’s obvious that alarmist climate science—as explicitly and extensively revealed in the Climatic Research Unit’s “Climategate” emails—shares all of these defects of groupthink, including a huge emphasis on maintaining consensus, a sense that because they are saving the world, alarmist climate scientists are beyond the normal moral constraints of scientific honesty (“overestimation of the group’s power and morality”), and vilification of those (“deniers”) who don’t share the consensus.
For example, regarding Symptom 1, overestimation of the group’s power and morality: leading consensus climate spokespeople like Al Gore, James Hansen, and Stephen Schneider have stated outright that they feel it’s acceptable and even moral to exaggerate global-warming claims to gain public support, even if they have to violate the broader scientific principle of adherence to truth at all costs (http://www.paulmacrae.com/?p=51 has examples.) Consensus climate science also overestimates the power of humanity to override climate change, whether human-caused or natural, just as government planners overestimated the U.S.’s ability to win the Vietnam War.
Regarding Symptom 2, closed-mindedness, there are many cases of the alarmist climate paradigm ignoring or suppressing evidence that challenges the AGW hypothesis. The Climategate emails, for example, discuss refusing publication to known skeptics and even firing an editor favorable to skeptics.
Regarding Symptom 3, pressure toward uniformity: within alarmist climate science there is a “shared illusion of unanimity” (i.e., a belief in total consensus) about the majority view when this total or near-total consensus has no basis in reality. For example, the Oregon Petition against the anthropogenic warming theory has 31,000 signatories, over 9,000 of them with PhDs.
Climate scientists who dare to deviate from the consensus are censured as “deniers”—a choice of terminology that can only be described as odious. And the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change explicitly aims for “consensus” in its reports—it does not publish minority reports, and yet it is impossible that its alleged more than “2,000 scientists” could completely agree on a subject as complicated as climate.
Group polarization
Janis notes one other form of dysfunctional group dynamic that arises out of groupthink and that, in turn, helps create even more groupthink:
The tendency for the collective judgments arising out of group discussions to become polarized, sometimes shifting toward extreme conservatism and sometimes toward riskier forms of action than the individual members would otherwise be prepared to take.[7]
This dynamic is commonly referred to as “group polarization.”
As a process, “when like-minded people find themselves speaking only with one another, they get into a cycle of ideological reinforcement where they end up endorsing positions far more extreme than the ones they started with.”[8] [emphasis added]
And because these positions are so extreme, they are held with extreme ferocity against all criticisms.
Examples of alarmist climate groupthink
Groupthink is common in academic disciplines. For example, philosopher Walter Kaufmann, a world-renowned editor of Nietzsche’s works, identifies groupthink in his discipline as follows:
There is a deep reluctance to stick out one’s neck: there is safety in numbers, in belonging to a group, in employing a common method, and in not developing a position of one’s own that would bring one into open conflict with more people than would be likely to be pleased.[9]
Similarly, in the 2009 Climategate emails, CRU director Phil Jones shows this “deep reluctance to stick out one’s neck” in writing (July 5, 2005):
“The scientific community would come down on me in no uncertain terms if I said the world had cooled from 1998.”
Keith Briffa laments (Sept. 22, 1999):
“I know there is pressure to present a nice tidy story as regards ‘apparent unprecedented warming in a thousand years or more in the temperature proxy data’ but in reality the situation is not quite so simple. … I believe that the recent warmth was probably matched about 1,000 years ago.”
Elsewhere, Briffa notes (April 29, 2007):
“I tried hard to balance the needs of the science and the IPCC, which were not always the same. I worried that you might think I gave the impression of not supporting you well enough while trying to report on the issues and uncertainties.”
All of the above (there are many more examples in the Climategate emails) reveal scientific groupthink, which puts the needs and desires of a peer group—the desire for “consensus”—ahead of the scientific facts. We would, undoubtedly, find other examples of alarmist groupthink if we could examine the emails of other promoters of climate alarmism, like James Hansen’s Goddard Institute.
This groupthink isn’t at all surprising. After all, alarmist climate scientists attend several conferences a year with like-minded people (the views of outright “deniers” are not welcome, as the CRU emails clearly reveal). In the absence of real debate or dissent they easily persuade themselves that human beings are the main reason the planet is warming and it’s going to be a catastrophe. Why? Because everyone else seems to think so and, in groupthink, consensus is highly valued. The same principles operates strongly, of course, in religion.
The ‘hockey stick’ and groupthink
Climate alarmists will, of course, angrily dispute that climate science groupthink is as strong as claimed here. However, groupthink is clearly identified in the 2006 Wegman report into the Michael Mann hockey stick controversy.
As most WUWT readers will know, the Wegman report was commissioned by the U.S. House Science Committee after Mann refused to release all the data leading to the hockey stick conclusions, conclusions that eliminated the Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age in order to show today’s warming as unprecedented. In fact, as mathematician Steve McIntyre discovered after years of FOI requests, the calculations in Mann’s paper had not been checked by the paper’s peer reviewers and were, in fact, wrong.
The National Academy of Sciences committee, led by Dr. Edward Wegman, an expert on statistics, identified one of the reasons why Mann’s paper was so sloppily peer-reviewed as follows:
There is a tightly knit group of individuals who passionately believe in their thesis. However, our perception is that this group has a self-reinforcing feedback mechanism and, moreover, the work has been sufficiently politicized that they can hardly reassess their public positions without losing credibility.[10] [emphasis added]
Wegman noted that the Mann paper became prominent because it “fit some policy agendas.”[11]
The Wegman Report also observed:
As statisticians, we were struck by the isolation of communities such as the paleoclimate community that rely heavily on statistical methods, yet do not seem to be interacting with the mainstream statistical community. The public policy implications of this debate are financially staggering and yet apparently no independent statistical expertise was sought or used.[12] [emphasis added]
In other words, alarmist climate scientists are part of an exclusive group that talks mainly with itself and avoids groups that don’t share the anthropogenic global warming hypothesis and alarmist political agenda. Overall, Wegman is describing with great precision a science community whose conclusions have been distorted and polarized by groupthink.
Recognizing groupthink
After the Climategate emails, some consensus climate scientists began to recognize the dangers of groupthink within their discipline. So, Georgia Tech climatologist Judith Curry wrote in 2009:
In my opinion, there are two broader issues raised by these emails that are impeding the public credibility of climate research: lack of transparency in climate data, and “tribalism” in some segments of the climate research community that is impeding peer review and the assessment process.[13]
Similarly, IPCC contributor Mike Hulme wrote:
It is possible that climate science has become too partisan, too centralized. The tribalism that some of the leaked emails display is something more usually associated with social organization within primitive cultures; it is not attractive when we find it at work inside science.[14] [emphasis added]
In short, it is clear that groupthink—a later, more scientific word for “tribalism”—is strongly at work within alarmist climate science, however much the affected scientists refuse to recognize it. As a result of tribalism (groupthink), alarmist climate science makes assertions that are often extreme (polarized), including the explicit or implicit endorsement of claims that global warming will lead to “oblivion,” “thermageddon,” mass extinctions, and the like. Indeed, one of the ironies of climate science is that extremist AGW believers like Gore, Hansen and Schneider have succeeded in persuading the media and public that those who don’t make grandiose claims, the skeptics, are the extremists.
Group polarization offers a rational explanation for extreme alarmist claims, given that the empirical scientific evidence is simply not strong enough to merit such confidence. It is likely that even intelligent, highly educated scientists have been caught in what has been called the “madness of crowds.” Indeed, writing in the Times Higher Education magazine, British philosopher Martin Cohen makes this connection explicit:
Is belief in global-warming science another example of the “madness of crowds”? That strange but powerful social phenomenon, first described by Charles Mackay in 1841, turns a widely shared prejudice into an irresistible “authority”. Could it [belief in human-caused, catastrophic global warming] indeed represent the final triumph of irrationality?[16]
There is strong psychological evidence that alarmist fears of climate change are far more the result of groupthink and the group polarization process than scientific evidence and, yes, this alarmist groupthink has indeed led to the triumph of irrationality over reason.

"**Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday morning. We'll have another update for you at 18:00 GMT.**
MPs are expected to give the go-ahead later to a stricter three-tier system of restrictions in England. Boris Johnson insists it's needed to keep infections under control, but a sizeable chunk of his own backbenchers are broadly against tighter controls. Labour won't endorse the new system, but won't reject it either. Sir Keir Starmer says he has ""serious misgivings"" and wants his MPs to abstain, but it isn't ""in the national interest"" to block it. The SNP will also abstain because the plans only apply to England. The upshot of all that is more than 55 million people are therefore set to enter the two toughest tiers from 00:01 GMT on Wednesday - a reminder of what that means.
England's chief inspector of schools says the ""invisibility of vulnerable children"" during the pandemic should be a ""matter of national concern"". In her annual report, Amanda Spielman warns long absences from school mean signs of abuse may have been missed and it should now be a priority to find overlooked cases. She also raises concerns about the pressures on families of children with special educational needs. It's the latest in a long line of warnings about the impact of coronavirus on already disadvantaged groups. BBC's special correspondent Ed Thomas witnesses the struggles first hand in one town.
More areas of Scotland are expected to move into a stricter tier of virus restrictions later. Public health officials recommended the move for Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire following an increase in cases. Wales, too, will face fresh curbs from Friday. Welsh pubs, restaurants and cafes will be banned from serving alcohol and will be unable to open to customers beyond 18:00 GMT. We answer your questions on the latest Welsh picture here. And see the rules around eating or drinking out and about wherever you are in the UK.
Covid-19 could be causing lung abnormalities still detectable more than three months after people catch the disease. The damage emerged in scans of 10 patients at Oxford University and researchers now plan a larger study to find out more. The risk of severe illness and death from Covid-19 increases markedly for the over 60s, but if the trial discovers that lung damage occurs across a wider age group - even in those not requiring hospital treatment - ""it would move the goalposts"", says Prof Fergus Gleeson, who is leading the work.
Christmas tree growers across the UK say they're having a bumper year \- potentially selling two million more specimens than normal. Pete Hyde, owner of Trinity Street Christmas Trees in Dorset. told the BBC his sales were up by nearly a third. It could be that some sales are coming earlier as people look to scratch a shopping itch while other stores are closed. Or it could be households are desperately looking for some festive cheer and an ""authentic"" Christmas experience after so much hardship this year.

Japan’s gigantic 9.0 magnitude earthquake and the associated tsunami are abject tragedies, responsible for the sudden death of probably 20,000 individuals. So why are we perseverating instead on the release of tiny amounts of radiation from the Fukushima Dai‐​Ichi nuclear power plant?



This is the familiar story of misplaced concern about tiny risks while blithely ignoring other major ones. People who have irrational fears of small amounts of ionizing radiation have no problem crossing a busy street in the city. 



Others are terrified by flying and drive instead, even though there were nearly 34,000 automotive fatalities in 2009 in the U.S., compared with 50 on scheduled planes. 



People stay up at night worrying about the 5% increase in sunburn‐​causing radiation as a result of stratospheric ozone depletion, and the next morning go to the beach and expose 95% of their skin to the same rays.





A]s a society, we are increasingly illiterate in matters of science and technology.



Here’s some perspective on Fukushima, and what it is being compared to, the 1979 partial meltdown at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, which ended nuclear power plant construction in the U.S.



Radiation is measured in “sieverts.” One sievert, if experienced all at once, is likely to make you pretty nauseated, and 3.5 sieverts is the level that kills 50% of exposed people. A thousandth of a sievert, which has no detectable effect on health, is called a millisievert. A millionth, or a microsievert, is what you get from eating 10 natural bananas.



The average _total_ excess radiation dose for a person living within 10 miles of the partially melted down Three Mile Island reactor core in 1979 was approximately 80 microsieverts, or less than one ten‐​thousandth of a potentially fatal dose.



You probably know some people who eat 800 bananas a year. They may be bloated, but they are not dead. 



For comparative purposes, the average person receives a dose of about 3650 microsieverts per year–about 85% of that is from natural sources, and most of the rest is from medical scans. 



Measurement from 46 sites within 19 miles of the damaged reactors in Fukushima are generally at or near background levels. There are three sites showing doses of approximately 3.6 millisieverts per day between 12 and 19 miles northwest of the site, but it is unclear whether this is from the power plant or a large strip mine close to the monitors. 



Evan Douple, an expert in the effects of radioactivity and health, notes that “At these levels so far, I don’t think a study would be able to measure that there would be any health effects.” This is from a person who has dedicated his life to the study of the effects of the Hiroshima bomb.



One old environmental adage is “the solution to pollution is dilution.” Generally ( _very_ generally, I might add), the concentration of a pollutant, whether it is coming from an exploded oil well _a la_ Macando Canyon in the Gulf of Mexico or from a damaged Fukushima nuclear reactor, falls off at some exponential function of the distance from the source. This relationship has to be modified by prevailing weather conditions, which makes it much more complicated. Some, such as strong winds, may result in higher concentrations downstream than expected from simply exponential decay, while others, like precipitation, effectively cleanse the atmosphere.



But, like so many of our economist friends, let’s assume the simpler (and somewhat more unrealistic) “model.” At a 2 mile radius, there’s only one‐​fourth of the concentration there is at one mile. At 10 miles, a hundredth; at a thousand, a millionth–all of which simply proves that there will never be a health effect from Fukushima found in California.



So why are we so concerned? One reason may be that, as a society, we are increasingly illiterate in matters of science and technology. How many people have it in their fund of knowledge that the more radioactive a substance is, the less radioactive it gets over time? How many people realize that there is such a rapid fall‐​off of the concentration of a water or airborne pollutant the farther one gets from the source? How many know that exposing 95% of their skin to the sun at the beach is far more dangerous than slight changes in damaging solar radiation caused by the loss of stratospheric ozone?



This type of irrationality bleeds over into weather and climate. A category two hurricane still commands the full and complete attention of all the media if it threatens the U.S., even as the number of deaths from land‐​falling storms plummets (2005 Hurricane Katrina being a notable exception).



In fact, it’s quite clear that despite the fashionable fear of all things related to climate, an economically vibrant society actually adapts to weather threats and consequently prospers.



The hurricane is a particularly instructive example. In 1955 an extremely destructive (category 5) Hurricane Janet struck near Chetumal, Mexico, on the Yucatan Peninsula, killing over 600 as it came ashore. In 2007, another fiver, Hurricane Dean, made landfall in nearly the same spot and killed _not one person_.



The differences between 1955 and 2007 in this part of Mexico are in economic development, infrastructure (roads and electricity), communication of hurricane forecasts and technology. 



We have seen a similar decline in mortality from tornadoes, where the death rate, that is the number of deaths per million, has declined a remarkable 90% in the last 100 years. Score another victory for economic development and technology. 



Which brings us to the subject of global warming. The atmosphere’s response to all the carbon dioxide we have loaded it with has been remarkably lukewarm, consistently hanging below the average of the United Nations’ “midrange” climate models. So has the change in sea level. We adapt to these slow changes without even noticing them. Though it is unclear whether or not global warming has anything to do with this, tropical cyclone (hurricanes, typhoons and their ilk) activity has spun down to the lowest level ever measured.



Nonetheless, if you want to cause a hellacious fight, just write these words: Global warming is not going to kill you. Nor is radiation from Fukushima. Have a banana.

For more than two weeks Hurricane Hermine (including, its pre-hurricane and post-hurricane life) was prominent in the daily news cycle. It threatened, at one time or another, destruction along U.S. coastlines from the southern tip of Florida westward to New Orleans and northward to Cape Cod. Hurricane/global warming stories, relegated to the hell of the formerly attractive by the record-long absence of a major hurricane strike on U.S. shores, were being spiffed up and readied for publication just as soon as disaster would strike. But, alas, Hermine didn’t cooperate, arguably generating more bluster in the press than on the ground, although some very exposed stretches of North Florida did incur some damage.   
  
Like Jessie, Woody and Stinky Pete in _Toy Story 2_ , the hurricane/global warming stories have been put back in their boxes (if only they could be sent to a museum!).    
  
But, they didn’t have to be. There was much that could have been written speculating on the role of global warming in the Hermine’s evolution—but it’s just not politically correct.   
  
With a bit of thought-provocation provided by newly-minted Cato Adjunct Scholar Dr. Ryan Maue—one of the best and brightest minds in the world on issues of tropical cyclone/climate interactions (and other extreme weather types)—we’ll review Hermine’s life history and consider what factors “consistent with” human-caused climate change may have shaped its outcome.



We look forward to having Ryan’s more formal input into our future climate change discussions, but didn’t want to pass up an opportunity to work some of his thoughts into our Hermine recap—for who knows, we may have to wait another 10 years for a Florida hurricane landfall!   
  
Hermine was probably the most hyped category 1 hurricane in history—thanks to a large media constituency hungry for weather disaster stories to link with climate change peril.   
  
Widespread access to weather forecast models and a thirst to be first with the story of impending global-warming fueled doom led to wild speculation in the media (both new and traditional) about “worst case scenarios” of a “major hurricane” landfall nearly a full week prior to the nascent swirl in the tropical atmosphere becoming an officially designated tropical cyclone by the National Hurricane Center. As “Invest 99L” (as it was originally designated) trudged westward through the tropical Atlantic environs during the week of August 22nd, it was struggling to maintain its life, much less its worst case aspirations. Pretty much every day you could find reports of a potentially dire impact from the Florida East Coast all the way through waterlogged Louisiana.   
  
To hear it told, the combination of unusually warm water, the lack of recent hurricane landfalls and rising sea levels set the stage for a disaster.   
  
Invest 99L ultimately did survive an unfavorable stretch of environmental conditions in the Florida Straits and eventually, in the Gulf of Mexico, grew into Hurricane Hermine and became the first in over 10 years to make landfall in Florida when it came ashore near St. Marks in the early morning hours of Friday, September 2nd. It was a category 1 hurricane at landfall and caused some coastal flooding along Florida’s Gulf Coast and knocked out power to more than 100,000 homes and businesses in the Tallahassee area. In reality, no hurricane-force sustained winds were measured onshore.   
  
As it traversed the Southeastern U.S. from Florida’s Big Bend region to North Carolina’s Outer Banks, the Labor Day forecast for Jersey Shore became ominous, as Hermine’s post-tropical personality was expected to lash the Mid-Atlantic coast with near-hurricane force winds for several days, flooding low-lying areas and severely eroding beaches with each tidal cycle. Many Labor Day holiday plans were cancelled.   
  
As it turned out, Hermine’s post-tropical remnants travelled further offshore than originally anticipated and never quite attainted projected strength—a combination which resulted in much less onshore impact than was being advertised, with much grumbling from those who felt had cancelled their vacation plans for nothing.   
  
In the end, Hermine’s hype was much worse than its bite. But all the while, if folks _really_ wanted to write stories about how storm behavior is “consistent with” factors related to global warming, they most certainly could.   
  
For example, regarding Hermine, Ryan sent out this string of post-event tweets:   
  
  




As is well known, we have gone much further than we ever have without a Category 3 (major) or higher hurricane strike. The last was nearly 11 years ago, when Wilma struck south Florida on October 24, 2005. With regard to this and the reduced frequency of U.S. strikes in general, hurricane researcher Chunzai Wang from NOAA’s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory gave an informative presentation about a year ago, titled “Impacts of the Atlantic Warm Pool on Atlantic Hurricanes.” It included this bullet point:   




● A large (small) [Atlantic Warm Pool—a condition enhanced by global warming] is unfavorable (favorable) for hurricanes to make landfall in the southeast United States. _This is consistent with that no hurricanes made landfall in the southeast U.S. during the past 10 years_ , or hurricanes moved northward such as Hurricane Sandy in 2012. [emphasis added]



In an article we wrote a few years back titled “Global Savings: Billion-Dollar Weather Events Averted by Global Warming,” we listed several other examples of elements “consistent with” climate change that may inhibit Atlantic tropical cyclone development and avert, or mitigate, disaster—these include increased vertical wind shear, changes in atmospheric steering currents, and Saharan dust injections.   
  
But, you have probably never read any stories elsewhere that human-caused climate changes may be acting to lessen the menace of Atlantic hurricane strikes on the U.S. Instead you’ve no doubt read that “dumb luck” is the reason why hurricanes have been eluding our shores and why, according to the _Washington Post_ , our decade-plus major hurricane drought is “terrifying” (in part, because of climate change).   
  
We have little wonder why.

Amidst the many headline‐​grabbing moments of the Republican and Democratic national conventions, both parties released their platforms for the 2016 election. While both platforms mentioned the U.S.-China relationship, there was very little room for agreement on how the United States should deal with China in the years to come. The Republicans and Democrats both displayed some “dragon slayer” tendencies — after all nobody wants to look weak in international politics. But the platforms showed substantive differences on how Washington should deal with Beijing.



The Democrats: Continuing the Pivot



The core of the Democratic platform is the Obama administration’s “pivot” or “rebalance” to Asia, which was spearheaded by Hillary Clinton when she was Secretary of State. The platform considers East Asian allies such as Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines to be essential for achieving U.S. interests in the region. According to the platform, “We will also work with our allies and partners to fortify regional institutions and norms as well as protect freedom of the seas in the South China Sea.” Importantly, allies are not explicitly called on to balance against China or try to contain its rise.





No matter who wins in November, U.S.-China relations are heading toward a period where competition will trump cooperation.



The primary source of hawkish language on China in the Democratic platform is found on page 49. The platform states, “We will stand up to Beijing on unfair trade practices, currency manipulation, censorship of the internet, piracy, and cyberattacks.” However, and in stark contrast to the Republican platform, the very next sentence mentions “areas of cooperation” with Beijing that the Democrats will pursue. Seeking cooperation with China on issues like climate change and nuclear proliferation and standing up to Beijing when important interests are threatened is a continuation of the Obama administration’s policies.



If Hillary Clinton wins in November and follows through on this platform, then expect the United States to stay the course in the pivot to Asia. Whether or not this policy will achieve its intended goals is questionable given China’s intransigence in response to the Obama administration’s policies, but Beijing likely prefers a continuation of the pivot to the harsh stance spelled out in the GOP platform.



The Republicans: China is the Enemy, and We Will Defeat It



The Republican platform is adamant about the threat China poses to the United States and cooperation is practically impossible. According to the Republicans, the United States has tried playing nice with China, but has gotten nothing in return besides unfair trade policies, regional instability, grave human rights violations, and the revival of “the cult of Mao.” Chinese activities in the South China Sea are one example of how the Obama administration’s weakness has “invited aggression.” China is presented as an enemy, and the United States does not cooperate with its enemies.



The Republican platform is also more hawkish on Taiwan. Taiwan’s democratic system of government, human rights record, and open economy are “saluted” in the GOP platform, but not in the Democratic platform. This makes American support for, and if need be defense of, Taiwan essential for normative, not just practical reasons. Additionally, the Republicans affirm the Six Assurances to Taiwan made by President Reagan in 1982, which the Democratic platform does not mention.



Implementing the GOP platform would put the United States into an outright adversarial relationship with China characterized by greater U.S. criticism of China’s human rights record and activities in cyberspace, and a stronger U.S. military stance to prevent weakness from inviting aggression. However, it is unclear how much of the platform would be implemented by Donald Trump if he is elected president. His tough talk on economic issues suggests adherence to those aspects of the platform, but weakening U.S. alliance relationships could undermine the platform’s language on Taiwan and the treaty allies.



Both the Republican and Democratic platforms reflect a willingness to get tougher with China, albeit in different ways and to a different degree. The Democrats want to continue the pivot to Asia and strengthen the alliance system that Chinese leaders see as a vehicle for containment. The Republicans want to reclaim a moral high ground and confront China on its human rights record, territorial ambitions, and cyber activities. No matter who wins in November, U.S.-China relations are heading toward a period where competition will trump cooperation.

First, a disclaimer. I don’t listen to NPR. “State radio” bugs me. But I have friends who do, and I was bowled over when one sent me a seemingly innocuous story about the search for a pharmaceutical treatment for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis [ALS], the horrific ailment also known as Lou Gehrig’s Disease.   
  
  
I knew something big was about to happen when correspondent Richard Harris led off with this zinger:   




There’s a funding crunch for biomedical research in the United States—and it’s not just causing pain for scientists and universities. It’s also creating incentives for researchers to cut corners—and that’s affecting people who are seriously ill.



Predictably, NPR, itself a federally (and privately) funded creature, said the problem was a lack of funding, even titling the piece, “Patients Vulnerable When Cash‐​Strapped Scientists Cut Corners.”   
  
  
Allow NPR its sins, because what’s in the article is one key to a very disturbing trend, not just in biomedical science, but in “most disciplines and countries.” It seems that negative results are systematically disappearing from science. Those words appear in the title of a blockbuster 2012 article by University of Montreal’s Daniele Fanelli, more completely, “Negative Results are Disappearing from Most Disciplines and Countries.”   
  
  
Memo to NPR: Scientists are always “cash‐​strapped.” Just ask one. The reason is very simple, and can be illustrated by my area, climate science.   
  
  
There are actually very few people formally trained at the doctoral level in this field (yours truly being one of them). One reason was that, prior to the specter of anthropogenerated climate change, there wasn’t very much money from the federal government. It was about a $50 million a year operation, if that much. We didn’t have enough research dough.   
  
  
Now the federal outlay is $2.3 billion. Guess what: we’re _all_ climate scientists now. So ecologists, plant biologists, and even psychologists hitched their wagons to this gravy train. Today’s shocker: we don’t have enough research dough.   
  
  
What Harris found out about ALS really does apply in a Fanelli‐​like fashion. It seems that drugs that work fine on mice and rats flop miserably when tested on humans. It turns out that the animal studies were all pretty shoddy.   
  
  
Story Landis, director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, explained why. According to NPR, “There is no single answer, she says, but part of the explanation relates to a growing issue in biomedical science: the mad scramble for scarce research dollars.” She went on: “The field has become hypercompetitive,” and NPR added, “Many excellent grant proposals get turned down, simply because there’s not enough money to go around. So Landis says scientists are tempted to oversell weak results.”   




“Getting a grant requires that you have an exciting story to tell, that you have preliminary data and you have published”, she says. “In the rush, to be perfectly honest, to get a wonderful story out on the street in a journal, and preferably with some publicity to match, scientists can cut corners.”



According to a research paper published earlier this year, corner‐​cutting turned out to be the rule, rather than the exception, in animal studies of ALS.   
  
  
Stefano Bertuzzi, the executive director of the American Society for Cell Biology, says that’s because there is little incentive for scientists to take the time to go back and verify results from other labs;   




“You want to be the first one to show something”, he says—not the one to verify or dispute a finding, “because you won’t get a big prize for that.”



Landis noted that “ALS is not the only example of this type of _wishful science_ [emphasis added].” She found similar problems with other drugs for other diseases.   
  
  
It’s too bad that NPR didn’t then go to Montreal’s Fanelli, because they would have found that similar problems are infecting science everywhere, which is why Cato now has a Center for the Study of Science.   
  
  
_Coming up_ : I’ll be posting soon on what this does to science itself. Teaser: if there’s little incentive to publish negative results, whatever reigning paradigm is operating in a given field will be very resistant to change. As the Center for the Study of Science’s Richard Lindzen has observed, there has been a remarkable lack of paradigm substitution in overall science as research budgets ballooned. Ironically, the more we spend on science, the more science can be harmed.

From the University of Cape Town comes some bad news for global warming alarmists, Malaria deaths may soon be a thing of the past and their attempts to link such deaths to global warming will evaporate if this cure holds up in clinical trials. Of course it never did anyway: Another alarming climate myth bites the dust – mosquito borne malaria does NOT increase with temperature 
So if this is a real cure, no more cushy grants for Michael Mann to study Malaria and AGW then, see Mann’s 1.8 million Malaria grant – ‘where do we ask for a refund’? The most amazing part is the research is only 18 months old….so I expect it will be given an even more rigorous clinical review.  (h/t to WUWT reader Jason) – Anthony
African research identifies strong candidate for possible single-dose malaria cure
28 August 2012
A compound discovered by a UCT drug discovery programme has been selected by MMV for its potent activity against multiple points in parasite’s lifecycle







Big news: Prof Kelly Chibale (centre), here with Minister Naledi Pandor, speaks about the compound MMV390048 that he and international collaborators hope will lead to the development of a single-dose treatment for malaria.
Panel report: Dr Tim Wells, Prof Kelly Chibale, Minister Naledi Pandor, Dr Max Price and Dr Richard Gordon of the Technology Innovation Agency address the media at a press conference where they announced the development of the new compound.



A recently discovered compound – named MMV390048 – from the aminopyridine class not only has the potential to become part of a single-dose cure for all strains of malaria, but might also be able to block transmission of the parasite from person to person, according to a research collaboration involving the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV), based in Switzerland, and the Drug Discovery and Development Centre (H3-D) at UCT.
This was announced at UCT today.  
On the basis of initial results it was selected by MMV for further development – making it the first compound researched on African soil to enter preclinical development in partnership with MMV.
An African solution to save lives
Naledi Pandor, the Minister of Science & Technology, said: “This is a significant victory in the battle to alleviate the burden of disease in the subcontinent. Clearly the war on this disease is not yet won, but I am excited by the role that our excellent scientists have played in this milestone in finding a potential cure for malaria and possibly preventing its transmission. Congratulations to Professor Kelly Chibale and all involved. This is evidence of the world-class science being done in South Africa and the continent, and of the power of continental and international scientific collaboration in the multidisciplinary approaches that are essential in addressing the societal challenges of our time.”
Dr Max Price, the vice-chancellor of UCT, said: “H3-D was founded at UCT in 2010 for this very purpose: to develop African expertise towards solving the health problems that beset the developing world. We trust this clinical candidate is the first of many contributions Professor Chibale and his team will be making to the advancement of international medicine.”
H3-D identified a molecule, code named MMV390048, which was selected in July 2012 by MMV’s Expert Scientific Advisory Committee for further development. The promising new compound shows potent activity against multiple points in the malaria parasite’s lifecycle. This means it not only has the potential to become part of a single-dose cure for malaria but might also be able to block transmission of the parasite from person to person.
The aminopyridine series was initially identified by Griffith University scientists in Australia as part of MMV’s extensive malaria screening campaign of around 6 million compounds. A team of scientists from H3-D, led by UCT Professor Kelly Chibale, further scrutinised and explored the antimalarial potential of the series. With parasitological, pharmacological and contract chemistry support from the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute (Switzerland), the Centre for Drug Candidate Optimization at Monash University (Australia) and Syngene (India) respectively, the H3-D team selected the most promising compounds from the series to be optimised and retested.
In just 18 months the team had identified and developed a candidate suitable for preclinical development.
Equipping the next generation of African scientists
“We are very excited that this promising compound, researched by African scientists, has been selected by MMV for further development,” said Chibale, the founder and director of H3-D. “This is truly a proud day for African science and African scientists. Our team is hopeful that the compound will emerge from rigorous testing as an extremely effective medicine for malaria – a disease that accounts for 24% of total child deaths in sub-Saharan Africa. What is more, H3-D and MMV achieved MMV390048 as a clinical candidate in record time. In the process we have developed a unique model for successful technology platforms, and generic modern pharmaceutical industry expertise and skills, to discover drugs in potentially any disease area in Africa.”
Dr Tim Wells, MMV’s Chief Scientific Officer, said: “This is a great achievement and an excellent example of the quality of research that can be fostered in Africa. We look forward to seeing more exciting compounds emerge from Kelly’s team and are proud to be collaborating with H3-D; not only is it conducting excellent science today, but it is also providing world-class training for the next generation of African scientists.”
What is so unique and exciting about MMV390048

It is very potent: it displayed a complete cure of animals infected with malaria parasites in a single dose given orally, and thus has the potential to cure millions of people.
It is active against a wide panel of resistant strains of the malaria parasite.
Developing the drug has made possible the training of more than 10 local scientists and cemented a strong relationship with an international partner.
The clinical candidate is in line to enter clinical trials in late 2013.

As I wrote in [part one of this story](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/08/the-amazon-is-burning-pt-1-a-flaming-heap-of-bullshit/), every time some new environmental or climate change moral panic suddenly sweeps the legacy media and its whip-cracker, social media, it pays to immediately check to see which summit is scheduled to begin soon, or which left-wing politician is trying to distract attention. Part one covered the basic facts, which show that the ‘Amazon burning’ scare is just so much bullshit.



In part two, let’s look at how the whole lying, ignorant hysteria over the supposedly burning-to-the-ground Amazon is **all** about politics.



Firstly, there is the G7 summit: I’m sure you’ll be shocked, **shocked** , to learn that the “Amazon is burning” frenzy was triggered by the politically-troubled French leader, Emmanuel Macron. As it so happens, Macron is right in the midst of trade negotiations with Brazil’s Jair Bolsanaro. Bolsanaro is, of course, an evil right-winger, the “South American Trump”. The left really, **really** don’t like Bolsanaro: he was stabbed almost to death, even before he was elected.



The smoke should be clearing already.



[Bolsanaro’s] Funding cuts have created plenty of enemies.



Many people have a reason to want Bolsonaro to look bad: In May Bolsonaro withdrew an offer to host a United Nations Latin America and Caribbean climate week. In the same week, the president fired self-confessed “militant environmentalist” Alfredo Sirkis, then-leader of The Brazil Forum for Climate Change. He also declared a 30 percent funding cut to maintenance costs of Brazil’s state-owned universities. Three weeks ago, Brazil’s INPE Space director was sacked. The INPE have been the source of the dire data used in some media stories. But Bolsonaro said the data was “not consistent with reality”, accused the head of the INPE of “lies” and working for an NGO.



On the 13th August Germany announced plans to withdraw some €35 million due to the country’s lack of commitment to curbing deforestation . On August 15, Norway suspended donations too […] Spot the coincidence.



The twitter firestorm is amplified just when the UN and big-government fans could use a negotiation weapon […] International leaders are transparently exploiting the hype:



“France and Ireland say they will not ratify a huge trade deal with South American nations unless Brazil does more to fight fires in the Amazon. French leader Emmanuel Macron said President Jair Bolsonaro had lied to him about his stance on climate change.” [BBC News]



The lyin’ legacy media are about as honest and truthful as the politicians.



Some journalists appear to be running off the twitter feed. But others seem to be carefully crafting their stories to highlight irrelevant, cherry-picked half truths.



  
The legacy media aren’t even **trying** to hide their bias. In fact, the _Columbia Journalism Review_ , “intellectual leader…the most respected voice on press criticism, [which] shapes the ideas that make media leaders and journalists smarter about their work”, is openly touting the legacy media narrative.



 **CJR is emailing journalists around the world, ordering them to fall in line.**



Our ask of you is simple: commit to a week of focused climate coverage this September. We are organizing news outlets across the US and abroad—online and print, TV and audio, large and small—to run seven days of climate stories from September 16 through the climate summit UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres hosts in New York September 23.



Could they be **any** more obvious?



In his bestselling _State of Fear_ , Michael Crichton writes that “Politicians need fear to control the population […] the media need scare stories to capture an audience […] this is the way modern society works – by the constant creation of fear”.



In Crichton’s novel, a shadowy cabal of e-NGOs and environmental terrorists conspire to engineer a series of devastating ‘natural’ disasters in order to grab attention for their climate scare campaign. But, with the “Amazon is burning” bonfire of bullshit, the left-media elite aren’t even **bothering** to hide what they’re up to any more.

"The opening of the Oscar-winning film The Big Short, a comedy-drama on the global financial crisis of 2007-2008, begins with a famous quote: “It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you into trouble. It’s what you know for sure that just ain’t so.” This phrase captures one of the main reasons why the US housing bubble popped in 2008, triggering the worst economic recession since the 1930s. The movie portrays an eccentric hedge fund manager discussing the idea of betting against subprime mortgage bonds. The investment bankers, at first, reply politely: “Those bonds only fail if millions of Americans don’t pay mortgages. That’s never happened in history.” But it happened. And as a consequence, many people worldwide have suffered severely, and the enduring effects still haunt us, politically and economically, even a decade later. In a new paper published in Climate Policy, we argue that a similar tragic “debt crisis” could unfold for climate change. The “debt” would be measured in excess carbon emissions, which will keep accumulating until we reach net-zero. In this scenario, the bankers are those who assume that the debt will be paid back by removing carbon from the atmosphere.  But such a bet will be necessary if we recklessly embark on the strategy of reducing emissions slowly and removing carbon later, while in the meantime using speculative technology to block out heat from the sun. Among climate scientists and policy analysts, this is the so-called temperature “overshoot and peak-shaving” scenario. In December 2015, the world adopted the Paris Agreement and pledged to limit global temperature rise well below 2℃ – if not 1.5℃ – above pre-industrial levels. Despite that, global CO₂ emissions continue to rise. The slow and uneven pace of global emissions reductions is increasing the likelihood of “overshoot” scenarios, in which warming will temporarily exceed 1.5 or 2°C, but will later fall to the target temperature through the large-scale deployment of negative emissions technologies. These remove CO₂ from the atmosphere by, for example, planting trees or scrubbing it through chemical filters and burying it deep underground. But the world would still need to adapt to the impacts of increased warming during the overshooting period. Because of this concern, the idea of so-called “peak-shaving” has also emerged among some scientists who want to avoid such an overshoot by temporarily using solar geoengineering. Solar geoengineering means dimming sunlight itself. In theory, the Earth could be cooled very quickly by, for example, spraying sulphate aerosols in the upper atmosphere. The concept of an “overshoot and peak-shaving” scenario is therefore based on the temporary use of solar geoengineering, combined with large-scale deployment of negative emissions technologies. In this scenario, the two technologies are in a mutually dependent relationship – solar geoengineering is used to keep the temperature down for the time being, while negative emissions technologies are used to reduce atmospheric CO₂ to the point where solar geoengineering is no longer needed.  But this assumed reciprocity may not work as intended. Here, the notion of debt is useful. As the sociologist Lisa Adkins suggests, the logic of debt rests on a promise to pay (back) in the future. In this sense, both overshooting and peak-shaving can be seen as acts of “borrowing” or “creating debt”. Overshooting avoids reducing carbon emissions today by effectively borrowing emissions from the future (creating “emissions debt”), with a promise to pay back that debt later through negative emissions technologies. Peak-shaving is borrowing global temperature (creating “temperature debt”) through the temporary use of solar geoengineering to cancel excess warming until the point when no further borrowing, of either sort, is needed. In such an outcome the world will take on a double debt: “emissions debt” and “temperature debt”. The fact of being indebted may not sound so bad. (Almost everyone has a debt of some kind in their everyday life, right?) But the key question is: can we duly pay off this “climate debt”? How credible is the promise? Here, the analogy with housing loans is most useful for properly rating the riskiness of such debt repayment. Given that overshoot allows slow rates of emissions reductions by “promising” that delays can be compensated later through carbon removal, this looks a bit like borrowing an adjustable-rate subprime mortgage loan. Peak-shaving, on the other hand, is more like borrowing additional loans for “home improvement”, which maintains house values – (keeps global temperature constant during the overshooting period).  Since most negative emissions technologies are still speculative or under development, overshoot should be rated like a subprime loan with a high risk of default. Just as American homeowners weren’t able to keep paying their mortgages after all, so negative emissions technologies may never be an effective enough way to take carbon out of the atmosphere. This doesn’t sound like a secure, feasible investment. The failure to keep the overshoot promise of later repayment would lead to endless peak-shaving. Solar geoengineering would become an ongoing necessity – an unpayable massive “climate debt” accumulating year-by-year. Concerns over crossing so-called “tipping points” – paving the way toward a “hothouse Earth” – may push some people towards accepting overshooting and peak-shaving. But because this is a speculative scenario, it matters how we frame it.  Some scientists say that solar geoengineering is like a drug to lower high-blood pressure – an overdose is harmful, but a “well-chosen” and limited dose can lower your risks, helping you have a healthier life. They suggest that solar geoengineering is not a substitute for cutting emissions but a supplement for containing global temperature increases. But this works only if negative emissions technologies are rolled out very swiftly on a massive scale.

      Blocking out the sun won't fix climate change – but it could buy us time


 The housing loans analogy sheds light on an important assumption that is implicitly built into such a scenario, namely that overshooting is simply like borrowing money (for example, a mortgage) and that people pay back mortgages. This was also the unquestioned assumption in the run up to the US housing market crisis and it created the systemic failure to notice the growing risk of the bubble bursting. We shouldn’t fool ourselves into believing that a similar “debt crisis” will not happen for managing the risk of climate change. Beware the dubious promises of “overshoot and peak-shaving” technologies – they may well turn out to be risky subprime loans. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter.

"**The mass testing of university students for Covid-19, so they can go home for the Christmas break, has started in Canterbury.**
Those testing negative will be able to use the ""travel window"" between 3 and 9 December.
Two tests must be taken 72 hours apart.
""We're trying to ensure the safety of students returning to their families and not presenting a risk to them"" said Simon Gwynne of Canterbury Christchurch University.
The testing centre set up at the university will be open from 10:00 to 18:00 GMT every day until 8 December, with 900 students booked in on the first day.
Anyone who tests positive for Covid-19 must isolate for 10 days, with a community buddy system making sure they are looked after.
But Becky Thomson, president of the Canterbury Christchurch Students' Union, says some might not take advantage of the testing.
""A lot of students would have stayed until 20, 21 December to get the maximum out of study. A lot are thinking of leaving later outside the window because of study restrictions, so they don't know whether or not to get it""."
"After years of depressing images of huge fields strewn with abandoned tents and rubbish in the aftermath of music festivals, it was heartening to hear Glastonbury Festival organisers claim that 99% of festival-goers’ tents were picked up after the festival. For a festival of 200,000 people this is a huge achievement. But really it should be normal. Hopefully this bodes well for future years, because the Association of Independent Festivals estimates that a quarter of a million so called “single-use” tents are abandoned at music festivals across the UK each year. There is a popular belief that most tents left behind after festivals are collected and sold by charities or sent to good causes. But this is wishful thinking: most of it end up in landfill. The practical and cost overheads for festival organisers and charities of collecting thousands of tents are just too much. All the elements of the tents – pegs, poles, sheets and bags – need to be present, undamaged, and the tent sufficiently clean and functional to be reused.  After a festival, security typically flatten those tents still standing to insure no one has been left behind, or even – as this year – to discover whether anyone has died during the event. This makes it harder to easily identify the tents that are potentially reusable in a field full of them. It’s also likely they’ll be damaged in the process. It’s been reported that tents make up 17% of waste from UK festivals that ends up in landfill. Cheap tents are often made out of polyester or nylon with a coating of silicone or acrylic polyurethane, with poles made of carbon fibre and pegs made of aluminium. Synthetic fibres such as nylon and polyester are polymers derived from fossil fuels and generally do not biodegrade. Polymers have exceptionally high stability and durability, which is precisely why such materials are so popular and so suitable for making tents. The concentration of plastic waste in landfills results in the release of contaminants into the environment. While well-regulated landfills minimise the impact on the surrounding environment, there are still long-term contamination risks to the soil and groundwater. As it is, the UK is fast running out of landfill capacity – a recent report estimated that England has less than seven years capacity for non-hazardous landfill. Even before accounting for disposal, tents take a fair amount of energy to make. Based on estimations by consultancy Julie’s Bicycle, the manufacture of typical 3.5kg tent emits the equivalent of as much as 25kg of carbon dioxide, and contains the equivalent of around 8,750 straws or 250 pint cups of plastic. This is about the same amount of CO2 emitted by a car driving 100 miles – without even taking into account the additional energy it takes transport the tent to shops, or to transport it to landfill. Today, tents and pegs made out of biodegradable materials such as cardboard and biodegradable plastics are available. But these products are sometimes less portable, less resilient to the deluges so common at British festivals, and may sometimes take years to actually biodegrade – especially in tightly packed landfill sites with limited oxygen supply. At the time of writing, Argos, Aldi, Tesco and Halfords all sell tents for £20 or less – hardly a major investment – especially when seen against the price of festival tickets in the UK that are often around £200. Outdoor equipment – and tents in particular – are often produced in sweatshop conditions. Standing in a sunny field it is easy to forget the inhumane working and living conditions of the workers half a world away that have toiled to make these tents. Regardless of what it’s made of, using a tent repeatedly is more environmentally friendly than one discarded after a single use. By dumping their tents, festival-goers help normalise this type of wasteful behaviour. People are social animals that tend to copy their flock, so festival-goers observing others leaving tents behind are much more likely to leave their own. On the other hand, a clean field of the sort captured by Emily Eavis’s drone in the image above should help nudge even tired festival-goers to take home the equipment they brought with them. The images of abandoned tents are more than just a comment on the environmental and ethical impacts of the festival itself. They are a visually dramatic symbol of our throwaway culture – just as images of clean fields at Glastonbury are a refreshing vision of hope for what could be."

Share this...FacebookTwitterToday Germany’s flagship political daily, the renowned Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ), which has long been a disciple of global warming religion (woeful deficits in climate sciences have long been a problem of the German mainstream media) raised a few eyebrows in daring to feature the global warming-blasphemous chart that no German was ever supposed to see.

FAZ features John Christy’s headline making chart. Chart source: Prof. John Christy, Daily Mail.
This leads us to believe that perhaps even the FAZ is tiring just a bit of the UN climate circuses that come to town every year. The chart slide show presented today by the FAZ is titled: Curvy Climate Change – The Charts of the Apocalypse. The slide show features 7 charts which often get used in the climate debate to communicate the messages of climate change to the public. Charts 2 – 6 are alarmist, but the final one douses ice water on the whole global warming meme.
The online FAZ describes chart 7, John Christy’s comparison of models vs observations featured by the online Daily Mail in March as the chart that “makes the hearts of skeptics beat faster” and that “the Daily Mail article resulted in a furor” and that “no article was distributed so much in the Internet as this one was“.


<!--
google_ad_client = ""ca-pub-3545577860068042"";
/* neu test */
google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";
google_ad_width = 200;
google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




To be fair, the FAZ says that the Mail’s headline claims that global warming was exaggerated were “in the end untenable“. I guess no one has told the FAZ that there hasn’t been any warming in 15 years.
In Chart 2, which shows world fossil fuel consumption, The FAZ writes that this “hardly made an impression on host country Poland“.
Chart 3 shows the CO2 emissions scenarios for the future and that global emissions are even currently tracking over the upper expectations. Chart 4 shows Hansen’s danger zone chart, where 250 ppm is (arbitrarily) selected as the start of danger. One gets the impression that CO2 levels below 350 will yield only nice and tame weather, which we know is lots of BS because storms were just as bad if not worse in the 1950s and earlier.
Chart 5 features the “Song of a warming world“, which also can be viewed as a mere gimmick to promote fear over a fictional climate disaster. Higher temperatures could also be regarded as positive and so the music could made to be more pleasant as temps rise.
Finally, Chart 6 featured by the FAZ is about Arctic sea ice. Much to their credit the FAZ used one that included the year 2013 and commented: “What can’t be seen on the chart, because what is happening independently in the south pole is: in 2013 there was more sea ice than ever was recorded in 30 years at the Antarctic.”

Saudi Production Profile
Guest post by David Archibald
World conventional oil production peaked in 2005 and has been on a plateau at about that level ever since. This graph suggests that the market changed from inherent over-supply to inherent tightness in June 2004:

Figure 1: World Oil Production and Oil Price 1994 – 2011
World conventional oil production will at some stage tip over into decline. That may be this year or it may be as late as 2015. The decline in US production began over four decades ago in 1970, as predicted by King Hubbert in 1956.
The next big one to tip over into decline will be Saudi Arabia. In determining what that will look like and its consequences, the first thing to do is a logistic decline plot of Saudi production history. Figure 2 shows the result:


Figure 2: Saudi Arabia Logistic Decline Plot
Figure 2 shows that the Saudis have produced about half of their ultimate recoverable reserves. When half of a nation’s oil has been depleted, production rate decline is inexorable. From this plot, total ultimate recoverable reserves for Saudi Arabia are estimated to be 275 billion barrels. From this plot, Saudi Arabia is on the cusp of decline. So what will that decline look like?

Figure 3: Saudi Arabia Conceptual Crude, Condensate and Natural Gas Liquids Forecast
This figure was produced by Euan Mearns in 2008. The red volume on the bottom right is the Ghawar Field and the green is the rest of the heritage super giants. The steep fall in projected Ghawar production from about 2012 would be due to an expectation that the field is watering out on its crest as shown in this figure:

Figure 4: Two cross sections of a reservoir simulation of the northern part of the ‘Ain Dar region of the Ghawar Field
Figure 4 shows the progressive displacement of oil by water over the sixty years from 1940 to 2004. SW is water saturation. The reds are high oil saturation and the green shows where oil saturation is now down to about 50%. To recover further oil from the green areas requires enhanced oil recovery (EOR) tehniques such as carbon dioxide injection.

Figure 5: Regional cross section through the Ghawar Field
This figure is from the American Association of Petroleum Geologists. The Ghawar Field is developed from a north-south trending horst block. It is 174 miles long by 16 miles wide. The producing horizon is the Arab D reservoir at about 7,000 feet.

Figure 6: Saudi Arabia Production Profile 1938 – 2040
From the foregoing, Figure 6 shows the production profile generated for Saudi Arabia. The production decline is 3% per annum which amounts to about 300,000 bopd per annum from the current level. The world can cope with that, but will the Saudis?

Figure 7: Saudi Arabia Population 1960 – 2040
Back in 1960, there were only about 4 million Saudis, now there are 27 million with population growth at 2.4% per annum compound. So, if the current trend continues, there will be 50 million of them by 2040. With population rising at 2.4% per annum and production falling at 3% per annum, we are starting with a net 5.4% per annum contraction in per capital oil production. The effect of that is captured by Figure 8 following.

Figure 8: Saudi Arabia cash available per capita
The forecast in Figure 8 is based on the oil price running up to $200 per barrel by 2018 and then plateauing at that level. The Saudi Govt increased social welfare payments in response to the Arab Spring. As a consequence, their budget is just about break even at the current oil price. If social outlays aren’t increased further, they pontentially have a lot of cash to play with for the next eight years or so, though they are also propping up Yemen with whom they share a land border. The crunch point is reached about 2026 when income falls below constant per capita outlays. As a society and as individuals, Saudis will then find their standard of living falling by 7% per annum compound. None shall weep for them.

When my better half watched a documentary on solar flare, which is a sudden unpredictable flash of increased brightness on the sun, we talked about the possible correlation between the sun’s variability and global warming. It just makes sense.



We are curious people but not scientists, and Wikipedia says even the most powerful solar flares are barely detectable in the total solar irradiance. So could the sun’s variability actually affect global warming?



This month, two independent Irish scientists, Ronan and Michael Connelly, along with Willie Soon from Harvard, submitted their research “Re-evaluating the role of solar variability on Northern Hemisphere temperature trends since the 19th century” to Earth Science Reviews. [Christopher Monckton](https://www.google.com/search?q=christopher+monkton&oq=christopher+monkton&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.3191j0j8&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) introduces their findings in this video. 



Obviously global warming scientists have examined solar variability before. This new research uses the same dataset but re-examines the solar variability factor. 



“Although our new composite implies different trends from previous estimates, we note that it is compatible with Northern Hemisphere temperature trends derived from (a) sea surface temperatures; (b) glacier length records; (c) tree ring widths. 



**However, the recent multi model means of the CMIP5 Global Climate Model hindcasts failed to adequately reproduce the temperature trends implied by our composite, even when they included both “anthropogenic and natural forcings”.**



  
_See note below for a definition of “forcings”._ The CMIP5 is the global climate database and model the IPCC uses for its global warming projections. It underpins the Paris Accord that costs NZ taxpayers $1.4B a year and is the basis of subsequent global warming studies.



Science Direct calls CMIP5 a “heterogenous dataset” because “[virtually all climate modelling teams in the world contributed to this work](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/cmip).” 



“The CMIP5 database allows access to the variables output from each individual model. The outputs are generally available as time series, with various time steps, including daily, monthly, and yearly time steps; from 2006 to 2100 ( ** _some models even propose outputs projections up to 2300).”_**



  
It’s a very, very big deal for Connelly and Soon to diss the CMIP5 model, and they arrived at their conclusion only after reviewing years of data and after comparing previous studies to their own findings.



“[…] we first review t ** _he debate over solar variability._** We summarize the points of general agreement between most groups and the aspects which still remain controversial. 



We discuss possible future research which may help resolve the controversy of these aspects. Then, in order to account for the problem of urbanization bias, we compile a new estimate of Northern Hemisphere surface air temperature trends since 1881, using records from predominantly rural stations in the monthly Global Historical Climatology Network dataset.



Like previous weather station-based estimates, our new estimate suggests that surface air temperatures warmed during the 1880s-1940s and 1980s-2000s.



 ** _However, this new estimate suggests these two warming periods were separated by a pronounced cooling period during the 1950s-1970s and that the relative warmth of the mid-20th century warm period was comparable to the recent warm period.”_**



Their weather station-based temperature trend estimate was consistent with independent estimates of Northern Hemisphere Sea Surface Temperature (SST) trends, as were temperature proxy-based estimates derived from glacier length records and from tree ring widths. 



“ ** _However, the multi-model means of the recent Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate model hindcasts were unable to adequately reproduce the new estimate_** – although the modelling of certain volcanic eruptions did seem to be reasonably well reproduced.”



Their conclusion is the knife to the heart of the IPCC man-made global warming argument. 



“We have constructed a new estimate of Northern Hemisphere surface air temperature trends derived from mostly rural stations – thereby minimizing the problems introduced to previous estimates by urbanization bias. 



Similar to previous estimates, our composite implies warming trends during the periods 1880s-1940s and 1980s-2000s.



However, this new estimate implies a more pronounced cooling trend during the 1950s-1970s. 



As a result, the relative warmth of the mid-20th century warm period is comparable to the recent warm period ** _– a different conclusion to previous estimates._**



One reason why the hindcasts might have failed to accurately reproduce the temperature trends is that **_the solar forcings they used all implied relatively little solar variability._**



 ** _However, in this paper, we carried out a detailed review of the debate over solar variability, and revealed that considerable uncertainty remains over exactly how the Total Solar Irradiance has varied since the 19th century._**



**_When we compared our new composite to one of the high solar variability reconstructions of Total Solar Irradiance which was not considered by the CMIP5 hindcasts (i.e., the Hoyt & Schatten reconstruction), we found a remarkably close fit._**



If the Hoyt & Schatten reconstruction and our new Northern Hemisphere temperature trend estimates are accurate, then it seems that **_most of the temperature trends since at least 1881 can be explained in terms of solar variability, with atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations providing at most a minor contribution._**



 ** _This contradicts the claim by the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports that most of the temperature trends since the 1950s are due to changes in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations (Bindoff et al., 2013).”_**



If substantiated, this research blows the man-made global warming theory (anthropogenic forcing) right out of the water. **This is huge.** The effect for us is huge. We can abandon the politically and financially motivated Paris Accord and put the man-made climate change myth where it belongs – in the fairy tale section of school libraries. Solar variability is the knife through the heart of man-made global warming.



 _[Note:](https://www.climate.gov/maps-data/primer/climate-forcing) “Forcings” are climate change drivers, natural and man-made energy reflected from the earth back into the atmosphere. “Natural climate drivers include changes in the sun’s energy output, regular changes in Earth’s orbital cycle, and large volcanic eruptions that put light-reflecting particles into the upper atmosphere. Human-caused, or anthropogenic climate drivers include emissions of heat-trapping gases (also known as greenhouse gases) and changes in land use that make land reflect more or less sunlight energy.“_

"Angus Taylor says it is not Australia’s policy to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, despite signing up to the Paris agreement, because the Morrison government will not adopt a mid-century target in advance of a plan to achieve it. The energy minister said on Tuesday that signatories to the Paris agreement, including Australia, had agreed to hit net zero “in the second half of the century”. But scientists say in order to meet the central Paris goal of keeping a global temperature rise this century well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5C – a commitment Australia adopted in 2015 – signatories need to hit net zero by 2050. A new review of the government’s climate policies headed by former Business Council of Australia president Grant King notes that “like other signatories to the Paris agreement, Australia has agreed to adopt progressively more ambitious targets beyond 2030 and has endorsed the agreement’s overarching long-term goals, namely to limit the global temperature rise to well below 2C – and if possible below 1.5C – by achieving net zero emissions as soon as possible in the second half of the century”. Major business groups, including the Business Council of Australia and the Ai Group, say Australia should adopt the net zero by 2050 target. Earlier this month the Ai Group called for the two biggest economic challenges in memory – recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic and cutting greenhouse gas emissions – to be addressed together, saying it would boost growth and put the country on a firm long-term footing. Every Australian state has signed up to net zero emissions by 2050, and these commitments are expressed either as targets or aspirational goals. But asked on Tuesday whether net zero by 2050 was the federal government’s policy, Taylor said: “No.” “Our approach is not to have a target without a plan,” Taylor told the ABC. He said technology improvements would drive significant reductions in emissions “and we’d love to be able to achieve net zero by 2050, but ultimately that will depend on the pathways of technology to deliver that without damaging the economy”. The King review has recommended new approaches to reducing pollution including paying big emitters to keep their emissions below an agreed limit, and allowing businesses to bid for funding from the government’s climate policy – the $2.55bn emissions reduction fund – for projects that capture emissions and either use them or store them underground. The King review proposal to pay emitters to remain below their baseline looks like a voluntary carbon trading mechanism. The review says the idea “could be achieved by crediting emissions reductions below baselines and providing for the sale and purchase of … safeguard mechanism credits by the federal, state or territory governments or through voluntary transactions in carbon markets”. Despite that clear description in the review, Taylor contended initially on Tuesday the proposal was not a form of voluntary carbon trading. He said the review proposed a “carrot” to give companies an incentive to overachieve on their pollution reduction commitments. The Coalition has spent a decade opposing carbon pricing, and it abolished the emissions trading scheme legislated during the Gillard government. Rightwingers in the Liberal party also moved against Malcolm Turnbull’s leadership in part because he pursued a policy to reduce emissions in the electricity sector. But after first saying the King proposal was not a form of carbon trading, the energy minister then argued that principle was “nothing new”. “You can trade Australian carbon credit units now. There is nothing new with that, that’s a pre-existing system we have through the emissions reduction fund.” It is unclear whether some of the proposals in the review would garner majority parliamentary support, but Taylor said some of the proposals might be able to be achieved without changing legislation."

On Sallenger et al (2012) – Hotspot of Accelerated Sea Level Rise on the Atlantic Coast of North America
Guest post by Bob Tisdale
John Droz Jr. asked me to comment on the Sallenger et al (2012) paper Hotspot of Accelerated Sea Level Rise on the Atlantic Coast of North America. As you’ll recall, John Droz Jr. has reported on pending North Carolina legislation about rising sea level. Refer to the WattsUpWithThat posts here and here. Apparently, North Carolina lawmakers are concerned about the use of the word “accelerated” in Sallenger et al (2012). So I took an initial look at the sea level data for the Atlantic Coast “Hotspot”.
The shift in trends around 1990 noted in Sallenger et al (2012) appears to be a function of the natural variability of the North Atlantic.
In fact, Sallenger et al (2012) in their closing comments state that this is a possibility, but it was impossible for them to tell due to the limited availability of data (my boldface):

In regard to the role of cycles, the single ~ 60-yr pattern in Fig. 4a does not seem associated with 10–30 yr sea-level variations discussed in ref. 27. With our limited series length, the presence of cycles, for example associated with natural ocean variability and/or AMO, is indeterminate. In the Holocene geologic record of an NEH marsh, the authors of ref. 28found evidence of several rapid SLR increases separated by 900 yr or more that they associated with gyre changes. Regardless, our correlations suggest that should temperatures rise in the twenty-first century as projected, the NEH SLRD will continue to increase. If future sea-level variability is forced by aerosols and/or is part of a cycle, SLR in the NEH may also alternately fall below and rise above projections of IPCC scenarios alone.
Our analyses support a recent acceleration of SLR on ~ 1,000 km of the east coast of North America north of Cape Hatteras. This hotspot is consistent with SLR associated with a slowdown of AMOC.
In other words, Sallenger et al (2012) note there is an accelerated rate at which sea level is rising for a portion of the Atlantic coast of the United States, starting around 1990, but they don’t know the cause. In the opening sentence of the above quote, they comment about the observed 60-year cycles in the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and how they do not agree with the results of their reference 27, which is Frankcombe and Dijkstra (2009) Coherent multidecadal variability in North Atlantic sea level.
The abstract of Frankcombe and Dijkstra (2009) reads:
Tide gauge records from around the North Atlantic are examined and found to show variability on 20–30 year time scales. Sea surface height variability along the western boundary of the North Atlantic shows a particularly strong and coherent signal. Similar variability is also found in an ensemble of runs using a state-of-the-art climate model (GFDL CM2.1). This sea surface height variability is linked to variability of temperatures in the upper layers of the ocean and thence to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. The variability is consistent with the excited internal ocean mode mechanism of multidecadal variability derived from idealised models and the timescale is consistent with that derived from observations of sub-surface temperature variability.
The last sentence Frankcombe and Dijkstra (2009) reads:
The long tide gauge records analysed here certainly point to the importance of the 20–30 year period over the 50–70 year period more commonly associated with the AMO.
Immediately, one wants to examine a time-series graph of the “Hotspot” sea level data in the Sallenger et al (2012) paper to get an idea of what the multidecadal variability in the data looks like. If there’s a 20-30 cycle in the data, and if the last cycle started in 1990, then odds are the cycle has already peaked and has started back down again. Also, picking the last break point in a dataset with known multidecadal variability, adding before and after trends to the data, and then stating the data during the last period has accelerated has a familiar ring to it. It sounds very similar to the nonsensical tactic the IPCC tried in FAQ 3.1 Figure 1 from their 4thAssessment Report to show that global surface temperatures were warming at an accelerated rate.
Curiously, there were no time-series graphs of the “hotspot” sea level anomalies in Sallenger et al (2012). That raises the question: what didn’t they want to show?
To determine the multidecadal signal in the East Coast “Hotspot” sea level data, I downloaded Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) tidal gage-based sea level data, same dataset used in Sallenger et al (2012), from the KNMI Climate Explorer. It can be found there on their Monthly station datawebpage. As you many of you are aware, the tidal gage-based sea level data is sparse, rarely continuous, and few have more than a few decades of data. In other words, it’s troublesome to work with, which is one of the reasons I rarely look at sea level data. So I selected the stations with the longest data, 70 years or more, along the Atlantic coast that were included in the “hot-spot” group of Sallenger et al (2012), from North Carolina to Massachusetts, that were also relatively continuous; that is, they did not have a lot of missing data. They included New York (Battery), Philadelphia (Pier9N), Atlantic City, Boston, Newport, Hampton Roads, and Sandy Hook. Since John Droz was interested in North Carolina, I added Wilmington, NC to the mix. We’ll call the combination of those datasets “Hotspot+1”. The Wilmington data had the shortest term, so it set the start year of 1935. Not too surprisingly, it had the lowest trend from 1935 to 2008. Refer to Figure 1. However, since we’re going to detrend the data, its lower trend would have little influence on this preliminary look at the East Coast sea level data. Note: The PSMSL data at the KNMI climate Explorer ends in 2008. Sallenger et al (2012) ended their analyses in 2009, so we’ve only lost a year.

Figure 1
Figure 2 presents the average sea level anomalies of those “Hotspot+1” stations along with the linear trend. Assuming the average sea level anomalies of the 8 stations used in this presentation provide a curve that’s similar to the stations Sallenger et al (2012) used for their “Hotspot”, this may illustrate the reason why Sallenger et al (2012) excluded a time series graph for their average “Hotspot” sea level data. It appears sea level anomalies for the “Hotspot+1” stations have been relatively flat since about 1996.

Figure 2
Since one of the points being discussed is decadal to multidecadal variability, we’ll detrend the “Hotspot+1” average, to help show if it exists. Figure 3 presents the detrended average of the “Hotspot+1” sea level anomalies.

Figure 3
First things first: Is there a break point around 1990 when the trends shift? There is definitely a shift in trends before and after 1989/90 in the detrended “Hotspot+1” sea level data, Figure 4. There are also comparable shifts in trend around 1976/77 and about 1981/82, Figure 5 and 6. But Sallenger et al (2012) went through a detailed analysis and elected to discuss the shift around 1990.

Figure 4
HHHHHHH

Figure 5
HHHHHHH

Figure 6
I’ve filtered the detrended “Hotspot+1” average sea level anomalies with a 13-month running-average filter (centered on the 7thmonth) in Figure 7 to reduce the month-to-month variability. The spikes in 1972/73 and 1997/98 may lead one to believe that El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events have a major influence on it.

Figure 7
Whatever is causing the sea level anomalies to vary, there is a multidecadal signal visible in the detrended “Hotspot+1” sea level anomalies. See Figure 8. In it, I’ve smoothed the data with a 121-month running-average filter, which is commonly used when illustrating decadal and multidecadal variability like the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. Now we can understand why Sallenger et al (2012) were discussing a multidecadal signal. One very plainly exists.

Figure 8
Looking at the trailing decadal (120-month) trends, Figure 9, we can see very clearly that the trend of the most recent decade (through December 2008) is not as high as it has been in the past. Also note that the peaks in the decadal trends occurred about the time of the three largest El Niño events that weren’t counteracted by volcanic aerosols. They were the El Niño events of 1972/73, 1986/87/88 and 1997/98. The eruption of El Chichon occurred at the same time as the 1982/83 El Niño and likely offset the effects of that El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event on the sea level anomaly trends. Oddly, ENSO isn’t mentioned in Sallenger et al (2012). Volcanic aerosols are mentioned in the closing of Sallenger et al (2012), however. Are the volcanic eruptions of El Chichon in 1982 and of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 the reasons for the low, actually negative, decadal sea level trends around the same time? If so, why did sea level trends drop in the early 2000s?

Figure 9
What about the Wilmington, NC sea level anomalies?
The sea level anomalies of Wilmington have a relatively low linear trend compared to the long-term stations used by Sallenger et al (2012). Refer back to Figure 1. Looking at the detrended Wilmington sea level data when smoothed with a 121-month filter, they have a different multidecadal signal than the “Hotspot” average. See Figure 10. The latest upswing started about 1976, then peaked near 1996, and the downswing was still in progress though the end of 2008.

Figure 10
The running decadal trends for Wilmington, Figure 11, reveal they have been negative since 2002. That is, on a decadal basis, sea level anomalies in Wilmington have been falling, not rising, since 2002. Have they risen since 2008?  It makes one wonder why Sallenger et al (2012) chose to exclude the last few years of data from their analyses!

Figure 11

The source of the data presented in this post is the KNMI Climate Explorer, specifically their Monthly station data.
CLOSING
North Carolina is considering new legislation about the rise is sea level. It would be a shame if the incomplete analysis and data presentation by Sallenger et al (2012) and their use of the word “accelerated” influenced it.

My book If the IPCC was Selling Manmade Global Warming as a Product, Would the FTC Stop their deceptive Ads? is available in pdf and Kindle editions. An overview of my book is provided in the above-linked post. Amazon also provides a Kindle preview that runs from the introduction through a good portion of Section 2. That’s about the first 15% of it. Refer also to the introduction, table of contents, and closing in pdf form here.
I continue to make progress on my upcoming book about El Niño-Southern Oscillation and hope to publish pdf and Kindle editions by late July, early August 2012.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe metaphor just couldn’t be more fitting: desperate true believers of global warming/accelerating polar ice melt now find themselves trapped by thousands of square kilometers of summertime sea ice that wasn’t supposed to be there.
No picture could better symbolize and communicate the intellectual bankruptcy and disillusionment of a faithful group who refuse to believe they have been led astray. This has to be deeply embarrassing, if not outright humiliating.
It’s reported here that many of the climate science boatpeople are actually from renowned media outlets, like The Guardian, who we can safely assume were onboard hoping to capture dramatic images of vast areas of open sea water, or of calving ice sheets with hundreds of tons of ice breaking off and plunging into the sea hourly. And with a little luck, maybe even some photos of a couple of drowned penguins.
Nowadays true believers find themselves journeying to the extreme corners of the globe in a desperate search for signs of the coming climate catastrophe. Signs are getting tougher to come by.
Indeed in Antarctica what they found was a reality that was precisely the exact opposite of what they had expected or had hoped for: no open sea seas – just thousands and thousands of square kilometers of sea ice, which ironically turned on them.
“Post-hoc rationalizations of model failures”
To save face they are changing their story and concocting new rationalizations. Perhaps all the unexpected ice is in fact a sign of warming after all!  This, for example, is what senior science writer for Comedy Climate Central Andrew Freedman is now claiming at Twitter, much to the rich entertainment of skeptics:


<!--
google_ad_client = ""ca-pub-3545577860068042"";
/* neu test */
google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";
google_ad_width = 200;
google_ad_height = 200;
//-->





You see, Freedman explains, it’s all in connection with “ozone depletion” and it all comes “with human fingerprints“.
And when pressed on why warming is causing less ice in the Arctic but more in the Antarctic, climate science boat-person Freedman tweets: “…key to remember is the geographical circumstances are totally different.”
Freedmann gets so deep into it that Bishop Hill eventually calls his claims “handwaving post-hoc rationalisations of model failures.” Another reader writes he thinks Freedman “is making it up as he goes along“. Anthony Watts tweets near the end: “Andrew Freedman is falling for the same ‘anything consistent with AGW’ silly logic fail that Laden did.”
Obviously the climate boatpeople are desperate and have nothing else left to lose.

"**Guernsey Sports teams have expressed concern the island's main sports hall used as a Covid-19 vaccination centre for at least five months.**
The Sir John Loveridge Hall at Beau Sejour Leisure centre will be converted into a central hub for vaccinating islanders until May, the States have announced.
The hall will be converted into a clinical space from December 21.
It will be used to vaccinate the vast majority of people during the roll out.
One of the sports which could be cancelled is Guernsey's eight-a-side football league.
Colin Le Prevost acknowledged the need for the vaccination programme, but argued the decision would cost the centre a lot of income from sports teams and potentially harm the health and wellbeing of islanders.
Mr Le Prevost said: ""It's not only a case of getting fit, it's also keeping fit.""
He also expressed concern over ""health and safety"" for teams with a move to an alternative venue like a school gym.
""You've got all the apparatus around the area, you don't want to be hitting that because you will be having injuries,"" Mr Le Prevost added.
The vaccine programme is separated into tiers, with care home residents, care workers and older islanders given first priority.
Highest priority groups and most at risk islanders will be vaccinated in a primary care setting, including care home residents, all care staff and people at high risk of severe coronavirus symptoms.
The States of Guernsey said the hall had been selected because it met key requirements for operating the vaccine programme, all other options had been considered before selection and it was exploring all options to support displaced sports clubs.
Director of Public Health Dr Nicola Brink said: ""The decision to use the Sir John Loveridge Hall was not taken lightly.
""I am acutely aware of the benefit sporting activities have on people's health and wellbeing and the hall will be used for the minimum possible time."""
"Scientists have created the first large-scale map of microscopic algae on the Antarctic peninsula as they bloom across the surface of the melting snow, tinting the surface green and potentially creating a source of nutrition for other species. The British team behind the research believe these blooms will expand their range in the future because global heating is creating more of the slushy conditions they need to thrive. In some areas, the single-cell life-forms are so dense they turn the snow bright green and can be seen from space, according to the study, published on Wednesday in the journal Nature Communications. Biologists from the University of Cambridge and the British Antarctic Survey spent six years detecting and measuring the green snow algae using a combination of satellite data and ground observation. The result is the first large-scale algae map of the peninsular, which will be used as a baseline to assess the speed at which the white continent is turning green due to the climate crisis and potentially offering sustenance to other species. They have already found the algae have formed close bonds with tiny fungal spores and bacteria. “It’s a community. This could potentially form new habitats. In some place, it would be the beginning of a new ecosystem,” said Matt Davey of Cambridge University, one of the scientists who led the study. He described the algae map as a missing piece of the carbon cycle jigsaw in the Antarctic. It identifies 1,679 separate blooms of green snow algae, which together covered an area of 1.9 sq km, equating to a carbon sink of about 479 tonnes a year. This is equivalent to the emissions of about 875,000 car journeys in the UK, though in global terms it is too small to make much of a difference to the planet’s carbon budget. Almost two-thirds of the green algal blooms were found on small, low-lying islands around the peninsula, which has experienced some of the most intense heating in the world, with new temperature records being set this summer. The snow algae were less conspicuous in colder, southern regions. Scientists have previously observed a change in green lichen and moss, but these grow extremely slowly compared with algae. In future, they will also measure red and orange algae and calculate how the presence of such colourful forms might be affecting the heat-reflecting albedo quality of the snow. “I think we will get more large blooms in the future. Before we know whether this has a significant impact on carbon budgets or bio albedo, we need to run the numbers,” said Andrew Gray, the lead author of the paper."
"The idea that spending recreational time in natural settings is good for our health and wellbeing is hardly new. Parents have been telling their kids to “go play outside, it’s good for you” for generations. Now, colleagues and I have published a study in the journal Scientific Reports which suggests that a dose of nature of just two hours a week is associated with better health and psychological wellbeing, a figure that applies to every demographic we could think of (at least in England).  So why do we need research into this? Although our parents’ common sense observation is true in the general sense, the devil – as always – is in the detail. For instance, it’s less intuitively obvious exactly how much time in nature we need before we experience the benefits, whether we can have “too much of a good thing”, whether it’s better to have lots of smaller encounters or one big one, whether parks, beaches and mountains offer similar benefits, or whether nature exposure is more important for some people than others.  We wanted to answer these questions so we could start developing recommended guidelines about how much time people should spend in nature. Similar guidelines have been developed to advise 150 minutes of physical activity per week, or that five portions of fruit and veg a day benefits health. Our findings do not yet offer a final recommendation, but we think they are an important starting point. Our research used responses from a large, representative sample of 20,000 adults in England, collected as part of an annual government advisory survey on Engagement with the Natural Environment. The survey takes place in people’s homes and interviewers ask respondents to go through each of the previous seven days and describe any time they spent “out of doors” in natural settings such as urban parks, woods, or beaches on each day.  Once this nature “diary” has been reconstructed, interviewers randomly select a previous visit in the past week, and ask more extensive details such as how long the visit was, who they went with, how they got there, and what they got up to. This “random” selection aspect is really important scientifically because it means we get to learn about people’s visits in general, not merely the “highlight” events that most stick in the memory. Using these responses, we were able to build a profile of how much time each of our 20,000 respondents spent in nature per week. To figure out how this was linked to health and well-being, we looked at the responses given by the same people to two further questions on general health and overall “life satisfaction”. We found that people who spent at least two hours a week in nature were more likely to report “good” health or “high” levels of well-being than people who spent no time in nature. People who spent some time in nature, but less than two hours, were no more likely to report good health and well-being than those who had zero weekly exposure, suggesting that one can have too little. Further, after about five hours a week, there was some evidence of no additional benefits. Perhaps most importantly, this pattern of a “two-hour threshold” was present for nearly all groups we looked at: older and younger adults, men and women, people in cities and in rural areas, people in deprived and wealthy communities, and even among people with and without a long-term illness or disability.  This suggests our results are not merely due to “reverse causality” – the possibility that people who visit nature are already a self-selected sample of healthier people. Even those with long-term illnesses were more likely to report better health and well-being if they spent 120 minutes a week in nature.  Although encouraging, we must be careful about overplaying these results. The fact remains that the data was self-reported and “cross-sectional”. Despite our best efforts, we can’t rule out the possibility that people didn’t accurately remember the time they spent in nature last week, or are nervous about talking about their health and well-being to interviewers. We don’t think this was too much of an issue here because the questions were simple, taken from internationally recognised surveys, including the census, and have been shown to be highly reliable.  Furthermore, there is a large body of experimental work, including work using stress biomarkers, which essentially shows that time spent in nature is good for physiological and psychological health – our main advance here is taking a step towards understanding a weekly dose.  There is increasing pressure on our parks and other green spaces to be used for urgently needed housing and other infrastructure. Colleagues and I fully appreciate that these alternative land uses are important, but we feel these spaces themselves are often undervalued. By improving our understanding of how spending time in nature is related to health and well-being we hope to better inform these decisions on what to do with green space.  Access to most parks and green spaces is free, so even the poorest, and often the least healthy, members of communities have equal access for their health and well-being. We hope that evidence such as ours will help keep them that way."

It is a ‘climate emergency’! Poor St. Greta had to sail the Atlantic to show us how dire it had all become. Local authorities up and down the country have told us so. People are gluing themselves to roads, that is how bad the situation is, and the only thing that can possibly save us is replacing ‘dirty’ so-called fossil fuels with even dirtier ‘clean’ energy.



Once we have this ‘new’ energy, we will be able to expand the economy forever without consequence.



Yes, sunshine and wind are obviously clean but the turning either of those into electricity is anything but a clean, harmless process. The Greens, here, stomp on any suggestion of mineral extraction, but their brave new world requires massive increases in mining of metals and rare-earth minerals. This comes with ecological and social consequences. 



Based upon a 2017 World Bank report, to get to the zero-carbon nirvana would require building enough solar and wind plants to generate 14 TW of electricity by 2050. 



This requires a supply of 34 million metric tons of copper, 40 million tons of lead, 50 million tons of zinc, 162 million tons of aluminium, and 4.8 billion tons of iron.



Having dealt with the electricity for living as we now do, we then need to power all the electric vehicles. This year, a group of leading British scientists submitted a [letter](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/press-office/press-releases/leading-scientists-set-out-resource-challenge-of-meeting-net-zer.html) to the UK Committee on Climate Change outlining their concerns about the ecological impact of electric cars. 



Replacing the world’s projected fleet of 2 billion vehicles will result in even more demand for mining. (Are you listening, Sage, Genter et al?)



This mining has to continue every year until 2050. And it is not going to be battery-powered excavators doing the digging!



Take silver, for instance. Mexico is home to the Peñasquito mine, one of the biggest silver mines in the world. Covering nearly 40 square miles, the operation is staggering in its scale: a sprawling open-pit complex ripped into the mountains, flanked by two waste dumps each a mile long, and a tailings dam full of toxic sludge held back by a wall that’s 7 miles around and as high as a 50-story skyscraper. This mine will produce 11,000 tons of silver in 10 years before its reserves, the biggest in the world, are gone.



To transition the global economy to renewables, **we need to commission up to 130 more mines on the scale of Peñasquito. Just for silver.**



Lithium is another ecological disaster. **It takes 500,000 gallons of water to produce a single ton of lithium.** Even at present levels of extraction this is causing problems. In the Andes, where most of the world’s lithium is located, mining companies are burning through the water tables and leaving farmers with nothing to irrigate their crops. Many have had no choice but to abandon their land altogether. Meanwhile, chemical leaks from lithium mines have poisoned rivers from Chile to Argentina, Nevada to Tibet, killing off whole freshwater ecosystems. The lithium boom has barely even started, and it’s already a crisis.



It would seem that the real ‘clean’ energy that the Greens want us all to embrace is NO energy at all.



Petroleum-based energy looks darn attractive to me.

 **Albert-Eden Local Board (Maungawhau Subdivision)**



 **RATINGS GUIDE:**



 **$** to **$$$$$** with **$** being a leftist trougher and **$$$$$** being small government dynamo



For some however a clown is more appropriate. More than one may be awarded.



 **Maungawhau Subdivision**



There are 8 candidates for this 4 seat subdivision of the Albert-Eden Local Board. You may cast up to 4 votes in this FPP contest



 **Linda Cassells –** City Vision **$$**



Linda likes to get things done. That’s great, depending on the things.



She has served on the Council of the Publishers Association of New Zealand. 



The book publishing sector experienced a “severe digital disruption to distribution channels in 2013-14” but has since rebounded. 



“PANZ enjoins the government to work closely with us and our partners (such as Booksellers NZ, the NZ Book Council, Copyright Licensing NZ, the NZ Society of Authors and WeCreate) to support the creative sector contribution to New Zealand’s cultural and economic wellbeing.” 



Cassells has also worked as a literary advisor to Creative New Zealand.



Her candidate profile states: “My top priorities are restoring our environment, even better parks, and building a stronger, more vibrant community through libraries, cultural and arts projects, and thriving local businesses.



I am a lifelong lover of books and reading…”



Guess we can see where she will be sending Albert-Eden Local Board’s share of funding. Guess it is up to you to decide whether that is a worthwhile project. Personally I think cultural and arts projects should stand on their own two feet (through market demand or private philanthropy) or not at all.



 **Lee Corrick – C &R – **Communities and Residents **$$$**



Corrick is an incumbent who has contributed to the Local Board’s unhealthy obsession with historical preservation. When I say unhealthy, I don’t mean historical preservation is bad, I mean Local Boards sticking their beaks into private property owners’ business is.



As an incumbent, Corrick must take some responsibility for the shambles of an upgrade in Mt Albert village which I covered during the rating of [Albert-Eden-Puketapapa’s ward race.](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/09/494908/) When the Chair of AT says, at the opening, it was a “job not well done”, that is disastrous. 



Her priorities over the next three years focus on high standards in “community facilities and parks, improved pedestrian safety…and to strengthen community networks. I enjoy working alongside the community to navigate the often-confusing council processes.”



Everything I could want from a local board member.



 **Yeshe Dawa –** City Vision **$**



Dawa, like me, is part of Generation Rent. A Local Board member’s salary isn’t going to change that.



She wants to see more affordable housing options (which she can do nothing about aside from advocacy). Speaking of things Local Board members can do nothing about, she also wants to take action against climate change.



 **Peter Haynes –** City Vision ****



After several failed attempts to be elected to council as Cathy Casey’s running mate, she has ditched the prehistoric moaning minnie for someone who wants to increase rates but doesn’t know why.



Why is Hayne’s prehistoric? His obsession with preserving volcanic rock walls regardless of whether they’re on public or private property is dangerous.



Moaning Minnie? When a busy local supermarket refurbished and expanded, the Herald asked him for comment:



 _Peter Haynes, Albert Eden Local Board chairman, complained about the store growing so much._



 _“I know that I’m not the only person in my neighbourhood – Mt Eden/Balmoral – who preferred the supermarket as it was and who now finds that there’s a lot more walking required to do the same shop,” Haynes said._



 _But he is happy with the Valley Rd basalt rock wall which was a local victory._



 _“I doubt very much whether they would have thought of the rock wall,” he said referring to Countdown “but they were very happy to incorporate that into their plans._



 _“As it is, I think that the rock wall shows very tangibly a concern for the local, and will be perceived that way by the local people.”_



 _Demolition of two residences on the site was also initially opposed by some locals due to heritage value and the encroachment of commercial into a residential area, Haynes said, and questions were raised about a big car park expansion._



 _Auckland Council found the building had little heritage value, Haynes said._  




As the chairman of the Local Board, Haynes must take full responsibility for their investigations of private property for historic value, without the owner’s consent or knowledge.



The Albert Eden Local Board 2017 plan states:  




 _“Our iconic villas and rock walls date back to the 19th century and give our suburbs their unique character. You have told us you are concerned that heritage features such as these are not being preserved appropriately. We will work with private owners to encourage restoration and maintenance. We will continue to advocate for protection (sic) of relevant sites through heritage provisions in town planning and development activity._



 _“Challenges • Many of our heritage buildings and natural features are on privately-owned land.”_



If you are a property owner, Peter Haynes presents a clear and present danger to your property rights. Despite being elected Chairman of the Local Board, he only just scraped in during the 2016 election by 96 votes. You have an excellent chance to be rid of him in 2019.



 **Rachel Langton – C &R – **Communities & Residents **$$$$$**



Langton has served on the local board for 6 years and was the highest polling candidate in 2016. She has ten years of experience as a lawyer, in employment and local government law. That’s got to be darn useful.



She claims her successes include championing the Potters Park redevelopment (I agree, it looks great) and the sporting facility upgrades at Windmill and Nicholson Parks.  
  
Whether she had nothing to do with the Mt Albert village upgrade or is simply too embarrassed to mention it, I’m unsure. 



**Benjamin Lee – C &R – **Communities and Residents **$$$$**



Incumbent member. With an engineering degree, he should be capable of making meaningful contributions to transport and infrastructure solutions.



Lee is at least honest about the limitations of being a local board member. He will **advocate** for putting Eden Park on a financially sustainable path (I hope that means sending Helen Clark into exile on Little Barrier Island) and setting up residents parking schemes in the suburbs.



That’s a good idea.



 **Bernadette Power –** City Vision **$$**



Power backs practical, safe ways for families to travel between home and work, having seen how “community-led initiatives like the Walking School Bus create strong neighbourhood networks, while getting kids to school safely.” She must also know that these Walking School Buses are administered by Auckland Transport, not the Local Board. Guess she just ran out of room to write that in her profile (149/150 words – fair enough).



She has plenty of experience working on large scale transport projects in Sydney and Auckland which would give her a solid knowledge of best practice transport infrastructure.



That knowledge will be largely wasted on Local Board, restricted to haranguing Auckland Transport rather than, say working for them.



 **Kendyl Smith – C &R – **Communities and Residents **$$$**



Kendyl is a nooby to local politics. What she has done prior includes pioneering the ‘Attitude’ programme for The Parenting Place, which teaches life skills.



Her goals for Local Board are appropriate:



 _“I want to see good use of public space, strong and safe communities, sensible solutions for traffic congestion and thriving businesses. Our community is a great place to live but could be even better.”_



Sensible.  




 **MY RECOMMENDATIONS:** You have up to 4 votes in this FPP contest

"There are serious challenges to global food supply everywhere we look. Intensive use of fertilisers in the US Midwest is causing nutrients to run off into rivers and streams, degrading the water quality and causing a Connecticut-size dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico. Chocolate production will soon be challenged in West Africa – home to over half of global production. A variety of nutritional impacts are predicted due to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide – including decreased protein content in food, which has a potential to exacerbate malnutrition. And this is just a very small sample of the risks to the food supply chain that are foreseen. The future of food then, may sound rather bleak. But this does not have to be the case. The food system could become part of the solution for environmental challenges, if we make some changes to it. It could also be an instrument of human health, well-being, dignity, and livelihood – rather than the opposite. But this won’t happen without a radical rethink of our food systems and consumption patterns across the globe – particularly within the context of our cities. Upwards of 75% of the global north’s population is urbanised and the global south is rapidly moving in this direction. Strategies for how these city regions can be fed using more local resources are crucial. Those living in the urban global north are very comfortable with having any foods desired available at any point across the calendar year. This comes at a high cost. Foods transported by air cause nearly four times the CO₂ released compared to truck and 38 times that of a comparable amount transported by rail. Biodiversity and ecosystem loss threatens food production – and meanwhile, agriculture is a key driver of this loss. Furthermore, excessive water use for export agriculture in water-stressed areas can negatively impact local food and livelihoods – for example to secure large quantities of avocados for global north markets. 


      Read more:
      How urban farmers are learning to grow food without soil or natural light


 If we are to avoid some of these crises, we need to re-imagine where our food comes from and move, at least in part, towards more seasonal diets with a lower use of land and a serious reduction in global trade – especially for fruits, vegetables, and protein. We can do all of this by addressing eight factors that have exacerbated and reinforced environmental disasters in our food systems. It is especially important that meat consumption and excess calories in countries with high levels of meat consumption and obesity are reduced. Consuming far less meat provides the greatest ability to feed more people with less land  within the US, for example, where meat consumption is particularly high. Every global study of diet and greenhouse gases indicates that reduced meat consumption is the biggest driver of reducing greenhouse gas release via dietary change. Approximately 1.1m hectares of excess corn production are needed to produce the excess calories consumed by just Americans annually. Greater organic and agroecological strategies should be prioritised over highly industrialised farming practices. These forms of farming use much less fertiliser – which is not only bad for biodiversity but also produces high emissions. In 2011, agriculture in my home state of Michigan collectively purchased about 200,000 metric tons of nitrogen fertiliser at a CO₂ cost of 1.34 million metric tons (the equivalent of that produced by 291,000 US cars in a year). Meanwhile, organic bread wheat production in the UK appears to use less energy per ton than conventional production, with very little of it accrued from nitrogen fertiliser production and use. Large quantities of food are needed for any city region – an American city region of a million people will require about 900m kg of food annually. Although “food miles” are problematic as a discriminator for greenhouse gas release, shorter supply chains are probably more amenable to electric vehicle transportation than long-distance transport – and hence ultimately to renewable energy use. As such, cities should aim to source their food from the surrounding region rather than globally. Within city regions it should also be possible to use waste recycling more robustly, creating carbon cycles as well as biogeochemical cycles for plant nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen. Since phosphorus is essential and non-renewable while production of nitrogen fertilisers requires a great input of energy this is very useful. Although food is lost throughout the supply chain, it’s estimated the greatest losses occur at the consumer level in the global north. In addition, a large amount of produce is wasted for not meeting retail cosmetic standards. All of the energy towards production, transportation, and processing of this food is also wasted. This modern culture of waste must be addressed. Some crops are grown in an intensely concentrated manner, which leaves them vulnerable to climate changes and pests. For example, over half of US fresh produce and nuts are grown in California, and a number of these crops will be negatively impacted this century. While there is research to develop more drought and heat tolerant varieties across a range of crops, it also seems prescient to distribute production more broadly. Variations in weather patterns can make this a challenge. But structures such as poly tunnels can markedly expand the season – to 12 months for lettuce and an additional two-to-three months for tomatoes. And a number of crops, for example apples, can be stored fresh for several months with controlled atmosphere storage. Making negative effects (or costs) of production (such as soil loss) transparent so that all costs are accounted for and then rewarding farmers for things such as soil carbon sequestration, minimised external inputs, and low energy use instead of just total production would greatly help reduce these impacts. The idea of farming insects and jellyfish are just some examples of the innovative suggestions that have been made for diversifying protein sources beyond meat and, say, soya. This would allow for reduced levels of animal protein in the global north and increased levels in much of the global south.

      Bug burgers, anyone? Why we’re opening the UK’s first insect restaurant


 Very little of the global north’s enormous farm policy budgets tend to be spent on policies such as conservation, agroecological research, and organic production. Policies that stimulate new farmer development, regional market and supply chain development (such as food hubs), prioritise appropriate technology development at smaller scales and price points (including robotics), sustainable energy production and research to minimise external inputs while maintaining high productivity are needed in order to help propel their development. All in all, much more attention needs to be paid on the sustainability of the planet’s urban food systems. If the situation continues unchanged, our food supply chains will soon be in deep trouble."

Guest Post by Willis Eschenbach
After I published my previous post, “An Observational Estimate of Climate Sensitivity“, a number of people objected that I was just looking at the average annual cycle. On a time scale of decades, they said, things are very different, and the climate sensitivity is much larger. So I decided to repeat my analysis without using the annual averages that I used in my last post. Figure 1 shows that result for the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and the Southern Hemisphere (SH):
Figure 1. Temperatures calculated using solely the variations in solar input (net solar energy after albedo reflections). The observations are so well matched by the calculations that you cannot see the lines showing the observations, because they are hidden by the lines showing the calculations. The two hemispheres have different time constants (tau) and climate sensitivities (lambda). For the NH, the time constant is 1.9 months, and the climate sensitivity is 0.30°C for a doubling of CO2. The corresponding figures for the SH are 2.4 months and 0.14°C for a doubling of CO2.
I did this using the same lagged model as in my previous post, but applied to the actual data rather than the averages. Please see that post and the associated spreadsheet for the calculation details. Now, there are a number of interesting things about this graph.

First, despite the nay-sayers, the climate sensitivities I used in my previous post do an excellent job of calculating the temperature changes over a decade and a half. Over the period of record the NH temperature rose by 0.4°C, and the model calculated that quite exactly. In the SH, there was almost no rise at all, and the model calculated that very accurately as well.
Second, the sun plus the albedo were all that were necessary to make these calculations. I did not use aerosols, volcanic forcing, methane, CO2, black carbon, aerosol indirect effect, land use, snow and ice albedo, or any of the other things that the modelers claim to rule the temperature. Sunlight and albedo seem to be necessary and sufficient variables to explain the temperature changes over that time period.
Third, the greenhouse gases are generally considered to be “well-mixed”, so a variety of explanations have been put forward to explain the differences in hemispherical temperature trends … when in fact, the albedo and the sun explain the different trends very well.
Fourth, there is no statistically significant trend in the residuals (calculated minus observations) for either the NH or the SH.
Fifth, I have been saying for many years now that the climate responds to disturbances and changes in the forcing by counteracting them. For example, I have held that the effect of volcanoes on the climate is wildly overestimated in the climate models, because the albedo changes to balance things back out.
We are fortunate in that this dataset encompasses one of the largest volcanic eruptions in modern times, that of Pinatubo … can you pick it out in the record shown in Figure 1? I can’t, and I say that the reason is that the clouds respond immediately to such a disturbance in a thermostatic fashion.
Sixth, if there were actually a longer time constant (tau), or a larger climate sensitivity (lambda) over decade-long periods, then it would show up in the NH residuals but not the SH residuals. This is because there is a trend in the NH and basically no trend in the SH. But the calculations using the given time constants and sensitivities were able to capture both hemispheres very accurately. The RMS error of the residuals is only a couple tenths of a degree.
OK, folks, there it is, tear it apart … but please remember that this is science, and that the game is to attack the science, not the person doing the science.
Also, note that it is meaningless to say my results are a “joke” or are “nonsense”. The results fit the observations extremely well. If you don’t like that, well, you need to find, identify, and point out the errors in my data, my logic, or my mathematics.
All the best,
w.
PS—I’ve been told many times, as though it settled the argument, that nobody has ever produced a model that explains the temperature rise without including anthropogenic contributions from CO2 and the like … well, the model above explains a 0.5°C/decade rise in the ’80s and ’90s, the very rise people are worried about, without any anthropogenic contribution at all.
[UPDATE: My thanks to Stephen Rasey who alertly noted below that my calculation of the trend was being thrown off slightly by end-point effects. I have corrected the graphic and related references to the trend. It makes no difference to the calculations or my conclusions. -w.]
[UPDATE: My thanks to Paul_K, who pointed out that my formula was slightly wrong.  I was using
∆T(k) = λ ∆F(k)/τ + ∆T(k-1) * exp(-1 / τ)
when I should have been using
∆T(k) = λ ∆F(k)(1 – exp(-1/ τ)) + ∆T(k-1) * exp(-1 / τ)
The result of the error is that I have underestimated the sensitivity slightly, while everything else remains the same. Instead of the sensitivities for the SH and the NH being 0.04°C per W/m2 and 0.08°C per W/m2 respectively, the correct sensitivities should have been 0.05°C per W/m2 and 0.10°C per W/m2.

"It will be very difficult to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by enough to halt global heating at 1.5°C – the threshold at which catastrophic climate change becomes more likely – according to a new paper published in Nature.  If the Earth warms by more than 1.5°C, millions of people could be displaced by sea level rise and global crop yields could decline. Fortunately, political will to prevent this seems more widespread than ever. The UK recently became the first major economy to pass a commitment to net zero emissions by 2050 into law. Sounds positive, so what’s the problem? Well, the new study has shown that if the world continues to use its existing power plants, it’s likely that the target of 1.5°C will be exceeded. If all the fossil fuel plants and other carbon-emitting infrastructure that’s currently planned are built, this target will certainly be exceeded. There is a significant number of fossil fuel plants currently operating worldwide. Their continued use would mean enough greenhouse gas emitted to overrun the carbon budget for keeping world temperature rise below 1.5°C.  Excluding all other sources of emissions, the infrastructure that’s currently operational and planned to go into use within the next decade would consume two thirds of the world’s carbon budget for limiting warming to 2°C. People have known about the dangers of climate change since at least the 1980s, but even so, the age of many fossil fuel energy plants currently operating worldwide is striking. Almost half of these power stations – running on coal, oil and gas – were commissioned after 2004. The Kyoto Protocol to limit greenhouse gas emissions came into force in 2005. The world is now committed to emissions from these plants unless they’re closed early. Even stopping the construction of new fossil fuel power stations won’t be enough to meet the target of 1.5°C. Capturing and storing the carbon dioxide (CO₂) these plants produce would also help, but this technology is needed on an industrial scale in almost every power plant to make a substantial impact. At the moment, there are only 21 in operation or in construction in the whole world. There are plans for more, and in the UK there are plans to capture carbon from a chemical plant in Cheshire and from Drax, the UK’s biggest power plant. But previous plans for carbon capture and storage at Drax were scrapped in 2015.

      Glue could be the magic ingredient for cheap and efficient CO₂ capture


 Drax currently runs 50% on biomass – organic material, such as wood or other crop plants. It’s considered a renewable fuel as the timescale to produce it is relatively short. The carbon emitted from biomass is absorbed when the plants are growing and released when they’re burnt for energy. In this way, the technology is said to be a “net-zero” carbon emitter. This could be part of the solution for reducing emissions, but the life cycle impacts of any energy solution need to be fully understood. If they aren’t, there’s a risk that more environmental problems could emerge. Closing fossil fuelled power plants might be possible in some countries, but the difference in the average age of these plants across the globe is stark. Coal-fired power stations in China and India are on average just over ten years old. In the US and the European Union, the average age is over 30 years. The paper shows that the world’s newer plants are in countries where electricity demand is growing – it’s less likely they’ll be able to close them soon. Existing electricity and industry infrastructure accounts for just under 80% of committed emissions – that is, those emissions that will come from the infrastructure that’s already in use. It might seem that the easy solution would be to just stop using it. But even as we commit to net zero emissions by 2050 in the UK, we’re supporting fossil fuel projects overseas and cutting funding for renewable technologies. The new study shows that if the UK is serious about meeting our commitments, we cannot continue like this. The study’s authors believe that the world has a reasonable chance of avoiding 1.5°C of warming if governments do two things. First, prohibit all new infrastructure that emits CO₂, including those which are proposed but haven’t been built. Second, retire existing infrastructure in industry and energy as soon as possible. Without these changes, the authors say, the goals adopted in the Paris Agreement are already in jeopardy. Fossil fuel-powered plants that can’t be closed need to be coupled with carbon capture and storage technology.  As climate emergencies are declared, this paper outlines the level of commitment that’s needed by everyone to deliver radical emission reductions. Without fundamental change to the current situation, our global climate will warm beyond 1.5°C. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter. Climate change is inevitable.

"About a month ago, many people I know on the political left were brimming with the belief that the Covid-19 crisis opened the way for a watershed conversation about deep social change. Now, as the full horror of the UK’s coronavirus experience becomes clearer and we begin to understand an all-enveloping crisis whose effects will be felt for years, that mood seems to have been supplanted by a pained mixture of anxiety and fatalism. On a bad day, our national nightmare now appears so deep and complex as to feel not just depressing, but insurmountable. But from a somewhat unlikely source, there was recently a note of hope. Around the time of the recent VE Day celebrations, the journalist and historian Max Hastings – something of a freethinker, but also someone with a classic establishment background – wrote a piece for the Times. His jumping-off point was the social revolution that began in 1945, but he quickly moved his focus to 2020. “The present crisis seems destined again to change the face of Britain, unleashing demands for social, political and economic reform unprecedented in our memories,” said this one-time editor of the Daily Telegraph. To him, the immediate future was clear: “The polo season, figuratively speaking, is over.”  But is it? Last week brought the awful symbolism of golf and tennis clubs reopening for business and the employers of nannies being given the green light to bring them back into their homes, just as many of the people told to return to work were grimly crowding on to public transport. On Wednesday, the Telegraph published details of internal Treasury documents proposing a two-year public sector pay freeze; the next day, the Guardian highlighted the huge shortfalls now facing English councils. Boris Johnson may have recently held out the prospect of a post-crisis Britain that would be “more generous and sharing”, but these auguries are hardly promising. And so, as always, attention turns to the Labour party. Judged by the criteria of the weekly political cycle and the ritual of prime minister’s questions, Keir Starmer is so far doing very well indeed. For what such things are worth, his recent net approval rating exceeded Boris Johnson’s, which has seemingly encouraged the age-old Labour belief that the first prerequisite of serious politics is the appearance of measured statesmanship. That is true, as far as it goes. But Labour’s history suggests that a fixation on respectability often blurs into a reluctance to embrace any thinking deemed too adventurous. This instinct may have returned in the wake of a historic election defeat centred on a campaign that presented political ambition as an incoherent splurge, and the kind of radicalism that blurred into the obnoxious fringes of the ultra-left. It is still too early to tell, but the result may yet be a leadership clinging to safety, when the moment will sooner or later demand something much more thoroughgoing. The basics hardly involve a huge leap of imagination: to some extent, they mix what might be salvaged from recent Labour politics with ideas that have long been in circulation way beyond the traditional left. The lives of people at the bottom of most socio-economic hierarchies will soon need to be lastingly improved, perhaps via an initial minimum income guarantee of the kind embraced by the coalition government in Spain. Given that we are unlikely to be able to revive a featherweight labour market based around retail and services, the time ought to be ripe for the economy to be pushed at last towards a green new deal, and the revival of manufacturing. The dysfunctional centralisation of power in England, a blind spot for both the left and right, needs to be reversed; austerity needs to be conclusively nailed as the dogma of self-harm it always is; and we need to deal, at last, with the deep structural racism towards the people most severely affected by the virus. As crucial as all those issues focused on hospitals and care homes remain, the fundamentals of public health are always about much more: the way that institutions often reflect deep-seated prejudice, and basic matters of what some people call political economy. There is rising noise about many of these things. In the last week or so, I have read promising thinking about the politics of the crisis from Medact, which gives a voice to health professionals focused on deep social and economic questions; and from Every Doctor, a campaign focused on the needs of the NHS. The Institute for Public Policy Research thinktank is doing strong work about how bailouts for companies should necessitate action on their social responsibilities, and thereby trying to open a conversation about a more moral economy. Green New Deal UK is now pouring its energy into a campaign titled Build Back Better, aimed at a new political settlement that “prioritises people, invests in our NHS and creates a robust, shockproof economy that is capable of tackling the climate crisis”. From 25 May, players including the left pressure group Compass and the New Economics Foundation will launch a new initiative aimed at maintaining the pluralism and spontaneity of all this activity, but somehow channelling its energy into a clear policy platform. Of course, there is still a yawning gap between these efforts and the places where this crisis is most vividly playing out. But in an age in which new political developments can ignite at speed, they ought to give us at least qualified hope. The ideal, perhaps, would be for a new agenda to acquire such momentum that it has to be taken seriously, even by the most cautious politicians, as a question that hangs over us finally demands an answer: if any return to the “normal” that has so horrifically failed us is unthinkable, where does the future begin? • John Harris is a Guardian columnist"

Today, in a 62-36 vote, the U.S. Senate passed a bill to approve the Keystone XL pipeline. The House passed a similar measure a few weeks ago. These actions come more than 6 years after TransCanada Corp originally submitted its application to the State Department to build a pipeline linking the Alberta oil sands to refineries along the U.S. Gulf Coast.   
  
Did I say State Department?   
  
Yep, in matters involving the crossing of an international border (in this case the one with Canada) the State Department must make a determination as to whether or not the project is in the “national interest.” Two-thousand, three hundred and twenty-three days later, the ultimate head of the State Department still hasn’t made up his mind.   
  
So Congress has attempted to make the decision for him.   
  
But it probably won’t work.   
  
President Obama has already advertised that he plans on vetoing the measure, because, well, because the State Department already has a procedure in place to handle cross border pipeline projects like this one.   
  
In fact, this procedure has worked flawlessly up until the Keystone XL pipeline. The previous cross-border pipeline that was proposed—the Alberta Clipper in 2007—was approved in just over two years. At the time, the State Department wrote in glowing terms about the project praising it for advancing “strategic interests,” being a “positive economic signal” and adding that “reduction of greenhouse gas emissions are best addressed through each country’s robust domestic policies.”   




In the intervening years, Obama has come to view climate change as a matter of utmost urgency and as a defining issue of his legacy as president. And leading environmentalists have planted it in his head that the Keystone XL pipeline is make or break when it comes to climate change.   
  
It is not.   
  
Keystone XL will have virtually no impact on the global climate now or in the future.   
  
But that doesn’t matter any longer. Instead, the pipeline has become a symbol of climate action, a line in the sand that can’t be crossed if you are truly concerned about climate change and the fate of humanity.   
  
I have repeatedly pointed out that it is in President Obama’s best interest to keep the pipeline in limbo. This way, climate change stays front page news. And with a left-leaning press, this means more coverage playing up the pipeline protests and playing down needless government meddling in private economics.   
  
President Obama has asked interested federal agencies to comment on the Keystone XL pipeline proposal. These comments are due February 2nd. The State Department will then sift through them and consider them and ponder what to do next.   
  
This is what the President will say when he vetos the bill.   
  
The stalling will continue.   
  
And so will the conversation.

"The UK Labour Party recently announced it has created a new shadow minister for climate justice. Danielle Rowley has been appointed to the role and her job, according to press reports, will involve liaising with activist movements. As someone who has studied these groups for 30 years, this raises several intriguing questions for me about the relationship between the government and grassroots environmental movements. The unfolding climate emergency – so dramatically brought to the public’s attention by activist group Extinction Rebellion and the school climate strikes – provides the immediate context for such an announcement. However, UK society is also suffering from austerity policies that have resulted in more homelessness, child poverty, environmental degradation and so on – all of which are exacerbated by climate change. Any meaningful response to these problems will have to address the climate crisis while also being mindful of social justice. The appointment of a shadow minister for climate justice should be understood in this light. The idea of “climate justice” emerged from grassroots struggles for land and the environment in the developing world. Its advocates combine principles of democratic accountability and participation, ecological sustainability and social justice. In particular, climate justice rejects many current capitalist approaches to climate change such as carbon markets, and argues for keeping remaining fossil fuels in the ground. It poses creative solutions such as renewable energies, localised organic food production and “green” jobs. Any government that wishes to meaningfully address the challenges posed by climate change will need to take seriously a climate justice agenda and be committed to it. The appointment of a shadow minister for climate justice is a belated beginning. However, as fossil fuel extraction continues and the climate crisis deepens, so environmental protests have increased. Some, such as Extinction Rebellion and the school strikes, demand more urgent climate action. Others, such as the anti-fracking campaigns in Lancashire and Yorkshire, highlight the problems that arise when trying to balance ecological and community concerns, business interests and government policy. So what would a climate justice agenda look like? In the UK, it would mean a rapid transition to low or zero-carbon economies and lifestyles. Government policy and investment would focus on renewable energy, more sustainable transport, industry and land-use, as well as an ambitious “green new deal” on employment. It is likely that all this would bring government policy into confrontation with corporate interests and the leverage applied by corporate lobbying, trade unions and political party donations.  It is here that the relationship between the government and environmental movements will be critical. Environmental protest is never only oppositional. The key is always to attempt to transform society, not least by influencing government policy – for example through the promotion of workable alternatives.  Any relationship between grassroots mobilisations and the government – friendly or hostile – will create new arenas of social action. Sometimes that works to promote climate justice alternatives “on the ground”. A good example of this comes from Germany, where grassroots anti-nuclear activism in the 1970s and 1980s contributed to the emergence of a renewable energy sector largely controlled by local cooperatives. Sometimes it works to constrain climate justice alternatives – although anti-roads activism in the UK during the 1990s slowed down road building for a while, green transport remains in its infancy. Environmental movements that do collaborate with the state always run the risk that their demands may get appropriated by the existing system in a way that neutralises their transformative potential. Therefore an engagement with the state only makes sense in a situation where a progressive social transformation might actually take place. Otherwise it is pointless. Even if the Labour Party does come to power in the near future, and there is suddenly a serious chance of that progressive social transformation, environmental movements will remain crucial. Pledges made in opposition do not always turn into government policies, and ongoing mobilisations would be required to make sure a Labour government sticks to its promises. In any case, climate justice cannot and should not wait upon the government to act. Grassroots struggles from below will remain a critical force that both create alternatives and, through protest, encourage the state to engage and negotiate. Such a relationship – in essence keeping the government honest – has the potential to enable a serious agenda of climate justice. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter.

"Some dogs have two different coloured eyes. Do other animals (besides people) and, if so, why? – George, aged ten, Hethersett, UK. Some dogs are born with one brown eye and one blue eye, which can look very strange, since we’re used to seeing dogs with two brown eyes. This is sometimes called “wall eye”, and it’s caused by certain genes that are passed down from parents to offspring.  If you look closely, you’ll also see that dogs with two different coloured eyes have unusually coloured coats, too. Their coats might be dappled or streaked with white. This is because the genes for eye colour and coat colour are closely connected.  The parents themselves may not show any sign of these unusual coat or eye colours. But usually there’s at least one dog on both sides of the family tree that has the unusual colouring. That’s how the mother and father can both pass on the genes that give some of their puppies the unusual colouring.  Curious Kids is a series by The Conversation, which gives children the chance to have their questions about the world answered by experts. All questions are welcome: serious, strange or funny – send them in, along with your name, age and town or city, to curiouskids@theconversation.com. We won’t be able to answer every question, but we’ll do our very best. By now, you might be wondering – what are genes? Let me explain: every living thing is made up of cells. Each cell contains all the information needed to tell the body what to look like and how to work. Every little bit of information is called a “gene”, and there are lots and lots of genes which decide nearly every aspect of how we are.  For example, there are around 25,000 genes in human cells, which can decide everything from our height, to our hair colour or how likely we are to get certain diseases. The genes are made up of DNA, and held together on stringy structures called “chromosomes” in the centre of the cell.  Because every mammal comes from two parents, it has two copies of every gene – one from the mother and one from the father. Each copy may be telling the body to do something different. For example, the mother’s gene might be saying “dark hair” while the father’s says “fair hair”.  In that case, the mother’s gene will win and their baby will have dark hair, because the dark hair gene is dominant over the fair hair gene. The baby will only have fair hair if both parents pass on the gene for fair hair. The genes for wall eye and streaky coat are similar to the fair haired gene, in this way. An animal will only have those features if that specific gene is passed down from both parents. When the mother and father carry the gene, but don’t have wall eye themselves, then some of their offspring will have it, though not all of them.  Wall eye is also sometimes seen in rabbits, cats, cattle, sheep and horses. Horses that have one blue eye usually have black and white patches on their coat – they are called “piebald” or “pinto” or “paint”. Some of these horses even have two blue eyes (one of mine does!), which makes them look even more unusual. Humans can also have one blue eye and another of a different colour, like brown or green. This often goes with a white streak in the front of their hair.  Sometimes, having wall eye can cause problems. For dogs, the eye that is blue often has problems that can affect its sight. For this reason, breeders don’t let two dogs with wall eye and streaky coat have puppies together. If they do, then the puppies will often be blind and sometimes deaf as well.  In horses, wall eye does not seem to cause problems with vision, though having two blue eyes can be associated with deafness. Some cats and humans who have it can also have trouble hearing, and humans whose parents both have wall eye may be unable to speak or hear. Children can have their own questions answered by experts – just send them in to Curious Kids, along with the child’s first name, age and town or city.

"It is never pleasant to see wild animals caged and abused. A new report by the NGO World Animal Protection suggests that captive-breeding operations for lions and tigers have expanded to meet an increasing demand for big cat products used in traditional Asian medicine. While this is clearly bad news for the captive cats themselves, confined in often horrible conditions, we are not convinced by the report’s findings on what this means for wild populations. Animal welfare organisations often suggest that farming wild species will lead to an increased loss of animals from their natural habitats. Either this is because animals are taken from the wild to stock the farms, or because the sale of farmed products increases demand for the wild version, leading to more illegal killing (also known as “poaching”).  For instance, the new report found anecdotal evidence that wild lionesses were sometimes killed in order to capture their cubs and smuggle them into captive facilities to diversify the gene pool and reduce inbreeding problems. World Animal Protection suggests that by “sustaining demand for [big cat] products” these farming operations are “exacerbating the decline” of big cats in the wild. However, we argue there is insufficient data to prove that overall poaching of lions or tigers has increased specifically because of these farming operations. Even if poaching has increased since farming operations have expanded, there’s not yet been a cause-effect mechanism found to prove that farming has contributed to an increase in poaching. To understand this conundrum, we would need to look at the counterfactual: with all other things being equal, what happens to overall poaching numbers when there is or is not farming? One study that looked at the impact of South Africa’s lion farms found that the trade had negligible effects on wild lion populations. Another report found that seizures of illegal tiger parts were increasing, but attributed it to expanding tiger farm operations (so more supply flowing in the illegal trade) rather than increased poaching of wild tigers. It is also not clear if an increase in enforcement effort could partly explain this increase in seizures reported. Again, to really understand a cause-effect relationship, we need more (and better) data. In some instances, farming of wild animals has helped to reduce poaching. Crocodiles for instance were once regularly hunted for their hide and meat. The UN Food and Agricultural Organisation then provided assistance to set up crocodile farming operations, which took the pressure off wild populations. There is, however, one large difference between the crocodile trade and the big cat trade: many consumers of big cat parts say they prefer wild-caught individuals, whereas purchasers of crocodile leather products prefer farmed, as you generally get better quality hides. But people who say that they prefer wild animal products may not always then go on to buy them in real life, especially if it’s easier, cheaper or more legal to buy from farms. To suggest that farming big cats increases poaching potentially is misleading without providing firm evidence that poaching of wild animals will decline without the farms. Though some may argue for the precautionary principle (that is, ban everything then work out what the best approach is), until we know more, closing these farming operations may have the unintended consequence of actually increasing the poaching of wild animals. In examples like the lion and tiger trade where farming already exists, we must first understand and tackle demand for these products before bans are put in place, to ensure we do not accidentally increase pressure on wild animals. It is tempting to act swiftly due to the widespread and alarming decline of biodiversity. However, we caution against rushed actions that, while well meaning, may not be based on firm evidence and could end up creating worse problems. What we really need first is better data on how captive-bred farming affects wild animal populations. The conditions for individual animals on many of these farms may be abhorrent, but if the main goal is to conserve wild species, we must act on science rather than emotion."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online Spiegel here has a new clip on the ongoing rescue attempts of the “Akademik Shokalskiy” research vessel. Both a French and Chinese icebreaker have given up trying to reach the trapped 74 persons on board the vessel.
Spiegel writes “The polar ice is too thick.”
Currently Antarctic sea ice is defying all the claims of global warming and is way over 1 million square kilometers above average. (Lots of sea ice charts here)

Sea ice around Antarctica ignores global warming claims. Chart: NSIDC
“No guarantee it will get through the thick ice”
Meanwhile Swiss news site TribunedeGeneve reports that an Australian icebreaker Aurora Australis is on its way and is expected to arrive Sunday evening.
Tribune de Genève adds: “The Australian icebreaker that will attempt the rescue comes with no guarantee it will get through the thick ice” and that it “can break through ice that is 1.6 meters thick but the Akademik Shokalskiy is imprisoned in ice that is 3 meters thick.”

Rescue by helicopter
Should the ice breaker fail to reach the vessel, then they “will try to use the helicopter that is on board the Chinese icebreaker Snow Dragon.”
Ironically the purpose of the expedition was to replicate the route of Antarctic scientist Douglas Mawson of 100 years earlier and to record the changes occurring in the Antarctica due to global warming.
Normally ships are able travel there
Mawson’s base set up 100 years ago is located in a zone were able to travel at this time of the year, Tribune Genève writes.
While Mawson’s crude ship managed to navigate to the continent, Turney’s modern ship has become trapped inside dense sea ice and now threatens to be crushed.
Big cracks are appearing
But there is hope. Australian ABC news reports that “the pack ice seems to be opening up a little bit” and that there “are big cracks appearing way towards the horizon“.

"**Coronavirus is continuing its spread across the world with more than 60 million confirmed cases in 190 countries and about 1.5 million deaths.**
The virus is surging in many regions and countries that had apparent success in suppressing initial outbreaks are also seeing infections rise again.
In the table below, countries can be reordered by deaths, death rate and total cases. In the coloured bars on the right-hand side, countries in which cases have risen to more than 5,000 per day are those with black bars on the relevant date.
_Note: The map, table and animated bar chart in this page use a different source for figures for France and the UK from that used by Johns Hopkins University, which results in a slightly lower overall total. US figures do not include Puerto Rico, Guam or the US Virgin Islands._
Coronavirus cases have surged over the past few months in several regions of the world and large numbers of new infections are being reported daily.
The most recent figures show more than 500,000 new cases reported in 24 hours.
World Health Organization Director General Tedrosâ¯ Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said positive news from vaccine trials means the ""light at the end of this long, dark tunnel is growing brighter"".
But he warned against allowing the poorest and most vulnerable to be ""trampled in the stampede"" to get inoculated.
As populations await vaccine roll-out, cases remain high across a number of regions of the world.
The US has recorded more than 13.5 million cases and nearly 270,000 deaths from coronavirus, the highest figures in the world.
Daily cases have been at record levels since early November and there are now more than 90,000 people in hospital, more than in either of the two previous peaks of the pandemic.
One US disease expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, has said the country could face another surge of cases as Americans return home after the Thanksgiving holiday.
The outbreak has had a devastating impact on the US economy, although there are now some signs it is recovering.
Nearly eight million Americans, many of them children and minorities, have fallen into poverty since May, according to researchers.
Daily cases have risen in many European countries since July.
France has recorded more than two million cases; Spain, Italy, Germany and the UK have all recorded more than one million cases. but all their numbers have either stabilised or started to fall in recent days.
Lockdowns and other restrictions were reintroduced in some of the worst-affected regions to help bring numbers down.
Japan is on ""maximum alert"" after seeing a record number of daily cases in a third wave of infections. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga urged people to do all they could to prevent new infections.
The number of new deaths in Japan, however, has remained relatively low. Other countries that have seen a resurgence of the virus include Turkey, Canada and Russia.
Several countries around the world are currently seeing cases spike.
In the Middle East, both Iran and Jordan have seen the number of daily infections rise sharply in recent weeks. Numbers have also been rising Ukraine.
In Latin America, Brazil has more than six million confirmed cases and the world's second highest death toll. There are concerns the country is now facing a second wave of infections.
Argentina, Colombia and Mexico have also recorded more than one million cases. Peru is also approaching that milestone, although daily cases are falling.
India has driven the increase in numbers in Asia, with over nine million confirmed infections, the second-highest official total in the world after the US.
Africa has recorded more than two million cases, although the true extent of the pandemic there is not known as testing rates are low.
South Africa, with about 800,000 cases and more than 21,000 deaths, is still the worst affected country on the continent. Morocco, Egypt and Ethiopia are the only other African countries to officially record more than 100,000 cases.
The virus, which causes the respiratory infection Covid-19, was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019.
The outbreak spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020 and declared a global pandemic by the WHO on 11 March.
A pandemic is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time.
Governments across the world have been forced to limit public movement and close businesses and venues in a bid to slow the spread of the virus. This has had a devastating impact on the global economy.
Damage to the world's major economies is four times worse than the 2009 global financial crisis, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
Meanwhile, the United Nations has said that up to 265 million people could face starvation by the end of the year because of the impact of Covid-19.
The pandemic could also wipe out 25 years of increasing gender equality, data from UN Women suggests.
The data used on this page comes from a variety of sources. It includes figures collated by Johns Hopkins University, data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, national governments and health agencies, as well as UN data on populations.
When comparing figures from different countries it is important to bear in mind that not all governments are recording coronavirus cases and deaths in the same way. This makes like for like comparisons between countries difficult.
Other factors to consider include: different population sizes, the size of a country's elderly population or whether a particular country has a large amount of its people living in densely-populated areas. In addition, countries may be in different stages of the pandemic."

The full text of the Trans Pacific Partnership agreement was released last Thursday. At over 6,000 pages (by most estimates — I haven’t counted them myself!), it’s quite a challenge to digest. It’s easy to pick out obscure technical issues and discuss them with trade experts; it’s harder to talk about the big picture significance for a mass audience.   
  
  
Economist Jeffrey Sachs tried to do this in an op‐​ed in the _Boston Globe_ , and I think he offered a good starting point:   




The agreement, with its 30 chapters, is really four complex deals in one. The first is a free‐​trade deal among the signatories. That part could be signed today. Tariff rates would come down to zero; quotas would drop; trade would expand; and protectionism would be held at bay.   
  
  
The second is a set of regulatory standards for trade. Most of these are useful, requiring that regulations that limit trade should be based on evidence, not on political whims or hidden protectionism.   
  
  
The third is a set of regulations governing investor rights, intellectual property, and regulations in key service sectors, including financial services, telecommunications, e‐​commerce, and pharmaceuticals. These chapters are a mix of the good, the bad, and the ugly. Their common denominator is that they enshrine the power of corporate capital above all other parts of society, including labor and even governments.   
  
  
The fourth is a set of standards on labor and environment that purport to advance the cause of social fairness and environmental sustainability. But the agreements are thin, unenforceable, and generally unimaginative. For example, climate change is not even mentioned, much less addressed boldly and creatively.



I would say he gets this about half right. Some clarifications are in order.   
  
  
He’s right about the free trade part. We should do the tariff/​quota reduction part today (or better yet, years ago!).   
  
  
He’s also right about his third category of regulations, on investor rights, intellectual property, and services. As with most regulations, some are good, some are useless, and some are downright harmful. The TPP regulations are no different.   
  
  
As for the second category, however, when you talk about international rules that require evidence‐​based regulation, or prohibit hidden protectionism, that’s already taken care of at the WTO. The WTO has a great track record of handling these cases. It’s not clear how the TPP would add much here.   
  
  
Finally, he wants stronger labor and environmental rules in the TPP, but it’s not clear to me why those subjects are suited for trade agreements. Whatever you think about climate change, for example, if you are going to address that in a treaty, it seems appropriate to do so in a climate change treaty, not a trade treaty. Regardless, these regulations are really just part of the general category of regulations, along with investor rights, intellectual property, and services.   
  
  
Summing this up, and narrowing his four categories to two, the TPP has two major aspects to think about: the trade liberalizing part, which is good; and the regulatory part, which is pretty mixed. The best way to evaluate the TPP over the next year — which many people are saying is how long we have until a Congressional vote — is to figure out how much liberalization is in there, and just how good/​bad/​ugly the regulatory aspects are, and weigh and balance the two.

"Forest elephant extinction would exacerbate climate change. That’s according to a new study in Nature Geoscience which links feeding by elephants with an increase in the amount of carbon that forests are able to store. The bad news is that African forest elephants – smaller and more vulnerable relatives of the better known African bush elephant – are fast going extinct. If we allow their ongoing extermination to continue, we will be also worsening climate change. The good news is that if we protect and conserve these elephants, we will simultaneously fight climate change. Elephants are fascinating animals, and I have studied them for more than 15 years. They are intelligent, sentient, and highly social. But their single most remarkable feature is their size. Evolutionarily, elephants gambled on becoming massive enough to deter predators like lions and tigers.  In exchange, they became slaves to their appetite. Elephants need huge amounts of food everyday, something like 5-10% of their body mass. A typical three-tonne female could eat 200 kg of plant material in one day. Her family may need to consume more than a tonne of food per day.  It is not easy to find so much food, especially in tropical rain forests, where plants have high concentrations of chemical defences (toxins) to avoid being eaten. Elephants spend most of their life eating and looking for food. We can think of them as “eating machines”. African forest elephants are particularly fond of saplings, young trees, and the plants that first grow into newly opened gaps in the forest. These “early succession” plants are specialised in growing fast following a disturbance and they invest less in chemical defences. Early succession trees also have lower wood density than slow-growing late-succession tree species. Elephant eating manners are also remarkable. They feed by breaking stems and branches, pulling down lianas, uprooting whole plants, stripping leaves off twigs, and so on. It is easy to notice their presence because of the mess they leave behind.  The key novelty of the new study, by the ecologist Fabio Berzaghi and colleagues, is they include, for the first time, the effect of elephant feeding disturbances in a computer model that simulates  demographic processes in forest ecosystems. They found that “elephant disturbance” – all that messy eating – results in forests having fewer, larger trees. Elephants filter out small early-succession (i.e. low wood density) trees, promoting the dominance of late-succession (high wood density) trees, which ultimately leads to long-term increases in the total biomass. Berzaghi and colleagues were able to validate their model predictions with data from real forest plots in the Congo Basin. By promoting these larger, woodier trees, elephant feeding disturbances therefore mean the forest stores more carbon. These results have important and far reaching implications for elephant conservation and carbon policy. The authors estimate that the disappearance of African forest elephants would result in a loss of as much as 7% of the carbon stocks in Central African forests, which they valued at around US$43 billion, based on a conservative carbon stock price. In short, forest elephants are our allies in the fight against climate change and their existence saves us tens of billions of dollars in climate responses. The situation of African forest elephants is particularly dramatic. Once numbered in the millions, their population is now less than 10% of its potential size and, in the decade from 2002 to 2011, as many as 62% of forest elephants might have been killed. This decline is mostly due to poaching to feed Asian demand for ivory as well as increasing human encroaching of their habitats. What a sad reason for a massacre and an ecological disaster.  Scientists largely recognise African bush (Loxodonta africana) and forest (L. cyclotis) elephants as different species. However because of practical challenges (such as dealing with abundant hybrid populations), the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which officially tracks endangered species, has kept the two together. The problem is that the more populous bush elephants have masked a drastic reduction in their forest cousins.  Berzaghi and colleagues emphasise the need for forest elephants to be finally acknowledged as their own species. This would give them a separate IUCN Red List status – probably marked as “endangered” – and trigger important policies and actions. Berzaghi and colleagues show that forest elephants produce ecosystem services in the form of climate stability from which we all benefit, including people like you and me who might never visit the forests of Central Africa. If we are all beneficiaries of elephant conservation, we should be also responsible for it. It is very important that more affluent societies assume a bigger share of the responsibility to conserve the elephants and other tropical biodiversity from which we benefit. In the past decade we have learned a lot about how important elephants and other large animals are for functioning ecosystems. It is time to apply this knowledge. Berzaghi and colleagues produced evidence linking the behaviour of a single species – feeding disturbances by African forest elephants – to global-scale climatic impacts. As mentioned earlier, the bad news is that we humans are killing elephants and ruining our planet. The good news is that we could synergise efforts and fight climate change by effectively protecting and restoring forest elephant populations and their habitats. The choice seems obvious to me."
"**The UK economy will be among the hardest hit by the pandemic, a leading international agency has suggested.**
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) predicts that by the end of 2021 it will be more than 6% smaller than before the Covid health crisis.
Among the world's major economies only Argentina is predicted to do worse.
By contrast, the OECD predicts the global economy overall will be back to pre-pandemic levels by then.
There is some cautious optimism for next year and beyond in this report, but that is struggling against the immediate fact that there have been new virus outbreaks and containment measures.
That is likely to lead to further declines in economic activity in the short term in some countries, especially in Europe.
Nonetheless, the report says that for the first time since the pandemic began there is now hope for a brighter future.
Recent vaccine developments are the reason.
""Progress with vaccines and treatment have lifted expectations and uncertainty has receded.""
But the uncertainty hasn't gone away, and even if the vaccine hopes are fulfilled, there will be further economic strains, the report says, during the wait for them to be widely distributed.
For Britain, the OECD predicts the economy will shrink in 2020 by 11.2%, followed by growth of 4.2% and 4.1% in the next two years.
Unemployment will rise to an average of 7.4% in 2021, though as it is an average the peak would likely be somewhat higher. Before the crisis, the figure was below 4% so that's a large increase, though many other countries are likely to see higher levels.
The report says it's important for the UK to conclude a trade deal with the European Union by the end of the year. Failure to do so would, it says, ""entail serious additional economic disturbances in the short term and have a strongly negative effect on trade, productivity and jobs in the longer term"".
The OECD says the government and the Bank of England should maintain policies to support the economy until a recovery is well underway.
For the world economy, the recovery predicted next year is uneven. A third of the global growth is down to China, which by the end of next year is forecast to be almost 10% ahead of where it was at the end of 2019.
The rich countries will rebound in 2021 but it will be only a partial recovery from this year's recession.
Among the major developed economies, only the US is forecast to be ahead of pre-pandemic levels by the final quarter of next year and even that is by a small margin.
Most, including the UK will be significantly behind. So too will several important developing economies in addition to Argentina, including India and South Africa."

Share this...FacebookTwitterCFACT has a video of a speech made by physicist/astronaut Walter Cunningham while at COP 19 in Warsaw.

He starts by saying that climate used to be a very respected science, but that it began to deteriorate about 20 years ago and has long become politicized and is being misused for more government control. He believes that it has morphed into something that no longer resembles science and that skeptics are now being asked to disprove hypotheses.
Just after the 6-minute mark, Cunningham calls the hockey stick chart “phony” and that he hesitates calling those behind man-made global warming “scientists” because they have abandoned the principles of science.
He reminds the audience that new hypotheses must be supported by data, and that the global warming hypothesis fails the test.
At the 12-minute mark he comes right out and says “Their climate models have never successfully predicted anything” and that they are “based on assumptions, which are opinions.”
“Models are not data.”
At the 13:25 mark he adds, after searching for 15 years:

//-->




I have not found one piece of empirical evidence that man-made CO2 has a significant impact on global climate.”
Cunningham thinks that skeptics are winning the debate on the scientific front, but that the alarmists have the clear upper hand on the media front. “AGW is a matter of faith.”
He pleads with the audience to look at the data themselves and to make up their own minds. He says, “The IPCC is not a good place to look for objective data.”
He finishes with 4 conclusions:
1. There’s no reason to be concerned about today’s temperature or temperature trend.
2. Human produced CO2 is a miniscule factor in global temperature levels.
3. There’s no justification for believing CO2 and temperature are the ideal ones.
4. Humans cannot have any significant influence on the Earth’s temperature. Believing they can is a fantasy.

"Since the end of World War II, 97% of the UK’s wildflower meadows have been dug up or destroyed. Many won’t remember a time when the countryside was filled with grassland that rippled with rainbows of flowers, but they are likely to recognise the intense yellow glare of pesticide-soaked oilseed rape fields that dominate rural landscapes today.  The joy of being immersed in a meadow – surrounded by the fluttering of butterflies, the chirping of crickets and the buzz of bees – is increasingly rare. Without urgent action to tackle dwindling biodiversity, these memories will disappear. Just like the flowers that they feed on, insect pollinators are in trouble, with one third of the UK’s wild bee and hoverfly species showing declines in their numbers since the 1980s. Clearing grassland for farms and using harmful chemicals such as pesticides on crops has driven many pollinator species to this state, but these insects are essential for growing many of our favourite crops.  By transferring pollen between flowers, they ensure that crop plants are successfully fertilised and can go on to develop the fruits and seeds that we like to eat. Without them, future generations may no longer be able to enjoy summer strawberries or autumn’s apples and pears.  How we grow food will need to change to ensure wildlife has room to live and isn’t exposed to toxic chemicals. In the meantime, there are solutions sitting right on our doorsteps. Simple changes to how our gardens, parks and public spaces are managed could give pollinators a brighter future. One way to protect our pollinators is to change the way that our roadsides are managed. Some country lanes are bursting with blooms, but the majority of road verges in the UK are cut to within an inch of their lives. Regular mowing is needed to ensure drivers can see clearly on sharp bends and junctions, but neat and tidy roadsides leave nothing for pollinators to eat.

      Four steps to make your lawn a wildlife haven – from green desert to miniature rainforest


 Sowing wildflower seed mixes and reducing how often verges are mowed can transform barren stretches of motorway into colourful meadows filled with the pollen and nectar that bees and butterflies currently struggle to find. Bees don’t seem to be put off by the traffic noise and their numbers have been shown to increase dramatically on verges that are cut no more than twice a year. Plantlife, a British conservation charity, has called on councils to turn their road verges into wildflower meadows by cutting just once in late summer, between mid-July and September. Pictorial Meadows is another campaign group that has researched how meadows can be encouraged in urban environments. It recommends cutting late to give flowers time to be pollinated, produce fruit and then set their seeds in the soil, so that the meadow can grow back year after year. Cutting earlier prevents flowers from fruiting and setting seed. Over 65,000 people have now signed a petition encouraging councils across the UK to allow wildflower meadows to grow on roadside verges. Councils seem to be listening. Rotherham Borough Council has established eight miles of meadows alongside a motorway, saving £23,000 per year on mowing costs. The UK road network spans over 246,000 miles – and reducing mowing on the grass verges that surround them to just once a year could save money and create thriving habitats for pollinating insects that return on their own each spring. Next time you are out in your local area, have a look at the roadsides and public spaces from the perspective of a hungry bee. Can you find any flowers? Is there enough variety for you to maintain a balanced diet? Will there still be flowers for you to feed on next week? If the answer to any of these questions is no, then you might be inspired to take action. If you have a garden, consider creating miniature meadows in underused patches of lawn, or focus on filling the flower beds with bee-friendly flowers. Small changes do add up. By signing the petition and engaging with your local council in the campaign, we could see rapid and widespread transformation of road networks and a blossoming future for butterflies and bees."

Sure, global warming policy seems off of the political radar, but it is still in the air, homing fast and true on your pocketbook via the stealth technology of the courts and the EPA. It will never be shot down.



Many would like to believe that cap‐​and‐​trade, carbon dioxide taxes, or simple command‐​and‐​control regulation went into a coma when the Senate failed to pass any companion legislation to the House’s American Clean Energy and Security (ACES) Act, which squeaked through 219–215 on June 26, 2009. And then, the myth goes, it died in the House blowout last November.



The reasoning in support of this is pretty straightforward. Almost every close House race in 2010 was won by a Republican. In the Senate, the dogfights all went Democrat. The difference between the two? The House passed ACES while the Senate twiddled down the clock.



This would all be correct if we were true to our Constitution, which established a federal government of profoundly limited power, granted great authority to the states, and, perhaps most important, limited the executive branch to mainly to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed” (Article II). But, as my Cato Institute colleague Roger Pilon so eloquently points out, we live in a modern “Executive State” where a massive amount of power has been delegated from Congress to myriad agencies (such as EPA) where unelected, lifelong careerists, with the approval and support of the Executive Branch regulate our lives where legislators fear to tread, or, more accurately, are too chicken‐​bleep to tread.



And, thanks to the judicial tradition of deference to the expertise of these agencies, the courts have actually encouraged the growth of this constitutional miscarriage.



And so it goes with global warming. When ACES was under consideration, two inconvenient truths became apparent: it was the most draconian, intrusive piece of non‐​wartime legislation ever passed, and, even if dozens of nations that had commitments under the U.N.‘s Kyoto Protocol on global warming adopted and fulfilled it, the amount of global warming that would be prevented would be, within any reasonable time horizon, too small to even measure.



Draconian? How about, a mere 38 years from today, ACES would grant the average american the per capita carbon dioxide emissions of 1867? Futile? How about reducing global warming by about 0.07°C per 50 years, even with the participation of all those Kyoto nations?



And so, as carbon dioxide regulation died in the Senate, it was reborn via the Supreme Court and the EPA.



In its 2007 decision, _Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency_ the Court reversed its policy of deference to agencies and instead inserted itself smack in the middle of the political debate on global warming. The majority (5–4) opinion, authored by Justice Stevens, did so in its first words: “A well‐​documented rise in global temperatures has coincided with a significant increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Respected scientists believe the two trends are related.” 



From that statement, which is devoid of any policy implications, the Court went on to command the EPA to move forward. The court could have also stated that there are plenty of “respected scientists” who believe that the future warming trend, while likely, has been grossly overestimated in magnitude and impact.



Specifically it directed the EPA to determine whether or not carbon dioxide was a “pollutant,” endangering human health and welfare, and, if it found that to be the case, then it must regulate it under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. Forget that the authors of that law, such as Michigan’s John Dingell, have stated that the Act was never intended to regulate greenhouse gases.



And so, not surprisingly, on Dec. 7, 2009, the EPA found indeed that carbon dioxide is a pollutant, endangering our health and welfare, and soon after began to propose regulations, beginning with fuel economy standards, but certainly not ending until it is no longer “endangering.” They based this largely on two reports on climate change, one from the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the other by the U.S. Climate Change Science Program. Both claim to be authoritative and comprehensive.



Ah, but can’t Congress simply tell the EPA that it cannot regulate greenhouse gases? Sure, but the Senate fell 10 votes short on this last week. And even if it did pass, the president would surely veto it. It will be a hot day at the South Pole when there are 67 votes to override.



Of course, we could change presidents, right? In that eventuality, the EPA will have to somehow undermine the authority of our own Climate Change Science Program in order to reverse its endangerment finding.



Fat chance of that not winding up in court — the same courts that got us into this mess in the first place. Regulations will stand until scientists stand up, which will be never, as long as there is such funding gold in them thar hills of global warming.



Do not kid yourself. Draconian regulation of energy — which touches almost every aspect of our daily lives — is not dead. It is, in fact, immortal.

It was a very exciting and ""moving moment"", he added.
The Wrexham plant has the capability to produce around 300 million doses of vaccine a year and preparations to produce 150,000 vials a day of the vaccine have been under way for weeks.
As the drugs were being developed, preparations for transferring large vats of the vaccine into single-dose vials have been ramped up.
Ravi Limaye, managing director, said the company expected to start delivering the first doses of the vaccine soon.
""We are immensely proud to have been selected to partner with the UK government on this project,"" he said.
""We have a sophisticated sterile manufacturing facility and a highly skilled workforce.""
Unite union official Dave Griffiths said the Wrexham site had taken on 40 staff to deal with the demand and planned to produce 150,000 vials a day, five days a week."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGISS surface temperature data is overall in very close agreement with the RSS satellite data. But for some reason, the GISS winter temperature trend for the Arctic profoundly diverges from RSS satellite data.
===================================
GISS Ground Based Versus Satellite Temperatures
By Ed Caryl
In my article Cowtan and Way – Which bias was it again?, Figure 1 showed that the GISS temperature measurement for the Arctic north of 60° latitude was trending upward much faster than the satellite (RSS) data:

Figure 1: Annual temperature anomaly plots for land and ocean north of 60°.
The anomaly maps from GISS always show large warming areas in the Arctic areas warming faster than the global average. In my article titled A Light In Siberia, several surface stations seemed to be affected by Urban Heat Island warming phenomenon, even if they are small research outposts. This article will focus on winter warming of the northern latitudes.
First, GISS and RSS nearly agree on the warming of the entire globe in all seasons:

Figure 2: GISS and RSS annual global temperatures for the period 1980 to the present. Data from Woodfortrees.
The global trend for both plots is much less than in the trend depicted in Figure 1. Moreover, the GISS and RSS global trends are almost identical in slope. The offset simply reflects the baseline year difference used by the two data bases.
Next, Figure 3 shows the winter temperature trends for over 60° latitude in the northern hemisphere.

Figure 3: GISS and RSS northern hemisphere land and ocean winter temperatures. 
Here, the winter trend for the satellite data is less than the annual trend for RSS data in Figure 1, but the GISS trend is much greater than in Figure 1.
If heat-island problems are increasing the GISS trend, this shouldn’t show up in the summer when the outside temperature is much closer to the inside temperature at the measuring stations.

Figure 4: Summer trends in the Arctic.
In the summer, the GISS data and the RSS satellite data are nearly identical. In fact the satellite data shows an insignificant slightly higher trend.
Notice that the summer temperature trend is not continual, but took place in a step at 1997, the year of the super El Niño.  That step accounted for most of the 33-year rise. In that year the summer temperature trend changed, going from one flat level to a higher flat level, the present “pause”.
What happens when we exclude the ocean data in the winter? If heat-island is the problem, then it will appear as a marked increase in the GISS trend. And indeed it does:

Figure 5: GISS and RSS land data only for the Arctic. Note the major deviation that appears.
Here, at more than six tenths of a degree per decade, the GISS trend is highest of all. The RSS trend is only slightly more than the global annual trend. Arctic amplification is supposed to take place in a warming world. The poles are assumed to warm faster than the rest of the globe. This certainly isn’t taking place in the Antarctic. In the Arctic, only the summer is warming faster than the global average. This is seen in both data sets in Figure 4. In Figure 5, the RSS satellite data show no amplification, no warming greater than the global average. The GISS land station data warming trend increase must be all from winter heat-island effects.
What do we see in the southern hemisphere? Does it look anything like the Arctic?

Figure 6: GISS and RSS data (for as far south as the RSS data goes) for the southern hemisphere summer (January through February).
Above we see why the Antarctic ice is increasing. There has been summer cooling for over 30 years! Next let’s look at the Antarctic winter:

Figure 7 is a plot of GISS and RSS Antarctic winter temperature anomalies.
Both data sets largely agree on trends for summer and winter in the southern hemisphere. The winter temperatures show no long term trend, but a cooling since 1995 is apparent in the GISS data.
I have compared all the latitude bands available for both GISS and RSS data (not shown here). Only in the Arctic does the temperature trend between GISS and RSS differ by a large amount. For those that were impressed by the large red and orange Arctic areas due to map projection in the previous post, I offer the polar map plots for the same 1995 to the present temperature trend:

Figure 8 from GISS. A trend map from 1995 to the present of winter temperatures.
The above projection enlarges the polar regions slightly relative to the temperate regions, but it does show how much of the Arctic and Antarctic are missed. Dark red to yellow is warming, purple to light green is cooling. Now drop the color coding by 1.5 degrees for latitudes above 60° north to account for the extra heat-island warming. The satellite data says the average winter Arctic warming is only 0.5°C, not 1 to 7°C as the map above, or 2 to 2.5°C as the GISS data in Figure 5 suggests. 
For those that think the south pole is warming, I offer this web cam photo of the Amundson-Scott Station taken yesterday.

Figure 9 is the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station. Webcam here.
Note the water vapor plume from the power plant and the size and color of the living and lab quarters. This infrastructure has been built and expanded since 1995. The previous building was buried in the ice. Now think about the heat island influence on local temperature at an average year-around temperature of minus 49° C.
Yes, there is man-made global warming! But it is largely by one heating system and power plant at a time. The warming is not at all due to CO2, it is due strictly to the Btu’s produced by burning fossil fuels for warmth and light in the winter. In the Arctic and Antarctic, these are primarily diesel and JP-8 jet fuel. The alternative is freezing to death in the dark.

"**A further 51 people in Wales have died with coronavirus, taking the total to 2,614.**
Public Health Wales data also showed 1,480 more people had tested positive for Covid-19, taking the total to 82,489 since the beginning of the pandemic.
Of the newly reported deaths, there were 12 each in the Swansea Bay and Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board areas.
A total of 11,047 new tests were carried out on Tuesday.
Betsi Cadwaladr health board area had 11 new deaths, Aneurin Bevan reported eight, whilst Cardiff and Vale had four and Hywel Dda had three.
Dr Giri Shankar, incident director at Public Health Wales, said: ""It is now clear from the data that the Coronavirus cases are rising in most parts of Wales, reversing the downward trend we had observed as a result of the fire break.""
Blaenau Gwent currently has the highest rate of cases with 453.8 per 100,000 people.
Seven of Wales' 22 counties - Blaenau Gwent, Torfaen, Neath Port Talbot, Merthyr Tydfil, Swansea, Newport and Rhondda Cynon Taf - currently have a case rate of more than 300.
Five counties have a case rate below 100, with Conwy and Gwynedd the lowest.
Neath Port Talbot has the highest positivity rate, with 20.1% of tests returning a positive result.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended the positivity proportion of tests should be no more than 5% before areas come out of restrictions.
More than 1.5 million tests have been taken in Wales since the start of the pandemic.
Acute patients from Powys are usually treated across the border at hospitals in England, so deaths of Powys residents usually only appear in registrations reported later by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Those ONS figures - which are higher - also count both confirmed and suspected cases of Covid, as well as deaths in all settings, including care homes, hospices and people's own homes. The most recent weekly figures are the highest since May.
PHW reports new deaths daily, but these are usually from previous days.

"**Holiday firm Lastminute.com has agreed to repay more than Â£7m owed to customers whose package holidays were cancelled due to the Covid-19 crisis.**
More than 9,000 customers are waiting for refunds, and the move follows pressure from the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).
The watchdog is currently chasing more than 100 package holiday firms to get refund commitments.
The travel sector has been deeply affected by the coronavirus crisis.
Lastminute.com was told to repay customers after hundreds of complaints that it was dragging its heels over refunds.
The firm has agreed to repay at least half of customers by 16 December and the rest by no later than 31 January 2021.
Anyone entitled to a refund for cancellations on or after Thursday 3 December will be paid within 14 days, the CMA added.
""Online travel agents have a legal responsibility to provide prompt refunds to customers whose holidays have been cancelled due to coronavirus - irrespective of whether the agent received refunds from airlines and accommodation providers,"" said Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA.
""Our action today means that customers whose holidays were cancelled by Lastminute.com will receive their money back without undue delay.""
Lastminute.com has been approached for comment.
In October, the CMA received a commitment from Virgin Holidays to refund all customers ""without undue delay"" after hundreds of complaints were made over delayed payments.
The watchdog also wrote to more than 100 package holiday firms in July to remind them of their refund obligations, and got commitments from Tui, Sykes Cottages and Vacation Rentals to repay customers.
Package holiday customers are legally entitled to refunds within 14 days for cancelled trips.
But many people have been left waiting months for a pay-out during the pandemic as travel firms face a cashflow crisis.
The travel and aviation industries have been hit by the coronavirus crisis in most parts of the world, with the International Air Transport Association warning in September that hundreds of thousands of jobs were at risk without more state aid.
The industry body said in November that London, which was previously the world's most connected city, had seen a 67% fall in connectivity in air travel.
London was overtaken by Shanghai, with the world's four most connected cities now all in China, where the coronavirus was first detected.
Air travel within China has broadly recovered and during its Golden Week holiday season 425 million people travelled around the country, according to the Chinese tourism ministry."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt his Saturday Summary (12/28 here) veteran meteorologist Joe Bastardi comments on how humiliated global warming alarmist scientists are trying to save face by claiming that all the new polar sea ice proves global warming.
Antarctic sea ice has been approaching record highs and embarrassed alarmist scientists are scrambling to explain why.
After presenting his weather information, at the 7:10 mark Joe gets to the nitty-gritty on climate.

Global sea ice 1 million square kilometers above normal. Cropped from Saturday Summary.
Now, I’ve got to do this because the global warming agenda is just really despicable in trying to claim the increase in Antarctic sea ice, opposite of what they said several years ago, and now they are trying to deny they said that, is a sign of global warming.”
Makes you wonder if climate scientists put water in the oven at home to try to make ice cubes.

Arctic sea ice has leveled off
Joe also shows Arctic sea ice has actually leveled off over the last few years, attributing the earlier reduction to oceanic cycles.
Later at the 8:15 mark Joe again sharply criticizes the shenanigans of climate alarmists, accusing scientists of lying with respect to Antarctic sea ice increase:
I’ll tell you what, now I cannot say how despicable it is to see the lying that is going on as you watch the Antarctic ice shelf continue to increase […] It’s just amazing listening to all this going on.”
Joe later says that what’s going on in Antaractica is just a classic example of cyclical climate.
One thing is clear: climate science shows that scruples are in short supply within the field.

"One day in the summer of 2017, I was sitting at a cafe table in the atrium of Portcullis House, across the road from the Palace of Westminster. With indoor trees and a good coffee bar, it’s a pleasant place for politicians and their staff to meet, outside their cramped offices. I was there to interview an MP for a research project, hoping to learn more about how MPs understood climate change, and how that shaped their work in parliament. The MP arrived. She was young and, at least on the surface, full of confidence. I explained that my interviews would be anonymised, so that she and others could talk freely about how they came to their public positions on climate. She told me she regularly speaks for her party on climate change, telling people about the need for action to tackle emissions. And yet, she said, there was a catch: lots of people in the constituency she represents have jobs in an industry responsible for huge amounts of carbon pollution. She had two, conflicting, demands: she wanted urgent action on climate; and she also wanted government support to allow her local industry to continue polluting. She was simultaneously backing and opposing climate action. She was worried that someone – maybe a constituent or the local paper – would point out this glaring contradiction. But so far, no one had. “I thought I might get a bit of pushback,” she told me. “I’ve had absolutely zero.” This contradiction sums up the state of climate politics in the UK today. There is strong cross-party support for far-reaching carbon targets. In June last year, the government passed a law to strengthen these targets, committing the UK to end virtually all emissions of carbon and other greenhouse gases within the next 30 years. There was next to no opposition – in fact, Labour and the Liberal Democrats argued for an earlier phase-out date. And yet politicians are oddly reluctant to talk about how we might actually meet these targets. There is very little honest debate about the major changes to our economy and society that will be needed if we are to meet this challenge. Like my interviewee, we’re all in favour of climate action, but we haven’t yet had an honest conversation about the power and the vested interests involved, or the choices that will have to be made if we are to achieve significant reductions in emissions. I have come to think of this as the dual reality of climate politics. We know that things need to change, and yet we’re embedded in our current lives and our current politics. We exist in both realities at once. Politicians make grand statements about the threat of climate change, then flip straight back into politics-as-usual. They find it hard to imagine, and to get others to imagine, how we might talk about and bring into being a politics with climate at its heart. It’s easier to look away. In recent months, though, politics has changed almost beyond recognition. The coronavirus pandemic is a global crisis that alters fundamentally the way we see risks, politics, and the relationship between people and society. Like everyone else, I am not sure what the world will look like on the other side. The only certainty is that everything will be different. If, as I’ve described, politicians have until now been finding it hard to contemplate radical changes to the status quo, has this barrier now fallen away? Covid-19 is, understandably, taking up all the political and media attention there is, for now. But the need for fast, radical carbon cuts – and a political strategy that will allow this to happen – has not gone away. Will green investment be prioritised in the economic stimulus packages that are undoubtedly needed? Will people think differently about travel or food security? Will we emerge with a politics that focuses more on a collective approach to global challenges such as climate? Or will we fall back into desperate attempts to rekindle the old economy and the old ways? For now, there are only questions. But my research offers some clues about how the recovery could be climate-proofed. I’ve worked with politicians for many years. In the early days of Tony Blair’s administration, I got a job with the thinktank Green Alliance. I started to look into the backgrounds of new Labour MPs, trying to find ways of connecting with them on environmental issues. We worked with the Conservatives in opposition, too, so that they could hold the government to account. Gradually, climate issues grabbed a political foothold. In 2006, the Tories went into a local election campaign with the slogan “vote blue, go green”, and the parties began to compete for environmentally minded voters. Then in 2009, came the Climate Change Act, a comprehensive piece of legislation setting legally binding carbon targets into UK law. Even then, the dual reality was evident. Despite the obvious implications for economy and society, there was precious little media coverage or political debate about these new laws. I asked a senior Labour figure what discussions there had been about the act as it went through parliament. “I don’t remember it being one of the big issues,” she told me. All the talk had been of counter-terrorism and banning smoking in public places. For climate, in contrast, “I remember it going on in the background, but it wasn’t something that had high temperature”. Politicians quietly passed a radical act of parliament committing the UK to serious change – and then carried on as normal. That same year the act was passed, I had an idea that came to dominate my working life for a decade. Frustrated by the mismatch between the scale of the climate challenge and the response from politicians, I wanted to make sure that the next generation of MPs were equipped with all the evidence and skills they needed to make informed decisions on climate. New MPs are lobbied from all sides, but they are offered very little training or support for their new and often daunting roles. Climate science, and climate policy, is complex. How could we expect them to lead us if they didn’t understand what it was all about? With the backing of Green Alliance and some philanthropic funders, I set up a training programme. We offered parliamentary candidates and new MPs the chance to learn about the science, policy and politics of climate in a series of tailor-made workshops. We worked with small groups of around 10 politicians, all from the same party, to allow them to question and debate freely. We asked leading climate scientists to join us to answer the MPs’ questions. Businesspeople came to talk through how they were thinking about the likely impact of climate change on their companies, and climate activists explained why they campaigned on the issue. At the end of each workshop, the new MPs got together with more senior politicians – ministers or frontbenchers – to debate what climate change meant for the outlook, values and strategy of their party. Running these workshops was a fascinating experience. In each, there was a definite point which I came to think of as a “penny-drop moment”, when the participants came to realise the significance of the climate crisis and the way it would shape our collective future. In one workshop, for example, a very eminent scientist explained to MPs how crop yields are likely to be severely affected by extreme weather, a likely scenario if global average temperatures rise by 2C or more – and that this could lead to food shortages. The response was striking. There was a silence, a collective intake of breath, a recognition of the significance of the changes that could be upon us if we don’t act. And then, at the end of our workshop, they walked out of the door and back to their normal lives. We kept talking to them. We organised more briefings, and we worked with them in their constituencies to bring climate issues home. In Sheffield, we talked about how communities could set up and own renewable energy projects. In Nottingham, we talked about resilience to floods. They were polite conversations, but all the time, that sense of dual reality was with me. If they understood the seriousness of climate change, I thought constantly, why aren’t they doing more? I became a little bit obsessed with this question. I wanted to see whether they worried about climate, or whether they had somehow convinced themselves that it would all be OK. I decided I would ask them directly. And so, in 2015, with Lancaster University, I set up my research project in order to learn more about how MPs understood climate change, and its implications for political life. I chose to work with a small number of MPs – 23 in all – to get a detailed, qualitative understanding of their views. I spoke to politicians from all parties and all levels of seniority. The only group I left alone were the small, but nonetheless influential, number of known “climate sceptic” MPs, who publicly state that they do not accept the scientific consensus on climate change. I offered my interviewees anonymity. Many displayed a disarming frankness about their professional and personal struggles, often at odds with their appearance of breezy confidence. All the politicians I spoke to accepted the science of climate change. And yet they downplayed the consequences. They showed a reluctance to discuss how climate change would reshape human society. A newly elected MP, talking to me in the House of Commons, told me that climate “terrified” him. “Where we’re sat right now might well be underwater, right next to the Thames. I wouldn’t fancy our chances.” I asked why, if it’s so significant, it wasn’t discussed much in parliament. But he didn’t answer. He couldn’t, or didn’t want to, linger on this point: he steered the discussion on to electoral cycles, the health service, the economy. He was back in the manageable normality he knew, rejecting the reality of a climate-changed future that had, just a few moments before, terrified him. Over the course of the interviews, carried out between 2016 and 2018, I saw a pattern emerge. The way politicians responded to climate didn’t just depend on what they thought about the science. Instead, it became clear to me that there were two main reasons why MPs struggled with the issue: first, because it didn’t fit easily into the culture of political life and their own identity as a parliamentarian; and second, because they worried that public support for climate action was limited, and that, as representatives, they needed to be led by their electorate. It’s obvious that the House of Commons is an institution with a strong internal culture. Yet I was surprised by the extent to which the MPs I spoke to felt constrained by the social norms of their workplace. In one conversation, my interviewee was deliciously unguarded in her opinions of her colleagues. She said that just a few of her 600 or so fellow parliamentarians took climate seriously as an issue: “You might not get into double figures.” She told me she saw everything through a climate lens, and was, in private, very critical of measures such as tax breaks for oil and gas exploration. And yet she felt that she had to tread carefully: she has to fit in. I asked her what would happen if she tried to intervene in a budget debate, to make the case that fossil fuels should stay in the ground. She replied: “I think they’d just think you were a bit ‘niche’, is the way I’d put it – I say ‘niche’ in quotes, like a bit of a lunatic fringe.” One former MP, who had been an active climate campaigner in parliament, said: “I was known as being a freak.” Another told me about how he tried to avoid being seen as a “zealot”. These remarks were common in my conversations with politicians. Some said they avoided any mention of climate for fear that it would put an unhelpful label on them. One confident, outspoken MP who worked on energy policy told me that he did what he could to promote policies that would reduce carbon, but justified his proposals on other grounds, such as reducing fuel bills. “I don’t use climate change as the word because I think it’s just toxic,” he told me. “As is the way in these issues which are contentious, you won’t take people with you politically.” This shouldn’t come as a surprise. We know the way people think and act is conditioned by their social world. This plays far more of a role in our responses to climate change than we might imagine – and politicians are no exception. Back in 2001, the anthropologist Kari Norgaard spent a year living in a rural Norwegian village. That winter, the weather was unusually warm. The lake didn’t freeze over, and the local ski resort had not received any snow by mid-December, having to resort to artificial snow – something that had not happened before. Income from the ski industry was reduced, and the tradition of ice fishing was interrupted. When talking about this and other weather patterns, villagers mentioned climate change, and seemed to have a good level of understanding. And yet climate was not something that people factored into their daily lives. Norgaard uncovered a paradox: people were aware of, and concerned by, climate change, but chose to ignore it. It was an unspoken collective turning away. She asked: “How could the possibility of climate change be deeply disturbing and almost completely invisible – simultaneously unimaginable and common knowledge?” She labelled this phenomenon “socially organised denial”. Norgaard pointed to a range of strategies people used that allowed them to continue as if climate change wasn’t happening. Some said that Norway was a relatively small country, with insignificant emissions compared to the US. There was also a widespread sense that, as a rural community, they lived simply and “with nature”. By telling each other these and other stories, they created the fiction that all could continue unchanged. Socially organised denial is alive and well in the Commons. It is exacerbated by very deliberate strategies from those who have a stake in high-carbon activities: countries, and companies, that depend on fossil fuels. As a result, it is surprisingly difficult for politicians to talk openly about the need to transition away from fossil fuels. Witness Nicola Sturgeon, leader of a progressive Scottish government that champions strong climate commitments, while also supporting continued oil and gas extraction in the North Sea. When challenged, her reply is always the same: the industry “cannot be shut down overnight”. She’s right. But her dismissive response shies away from the science, which tells us very clearly that fossil fuels need to stay in the ground, and that we need a plan to move away from them, and create opportunities and jobs elsewhere – not overnight, but urgently. The toxic combination of socially organised denial and deliberate lobbying has created a problem that I’ve come to think of as the “feelgood fallacy”. So far, climate action has focused overwhelmingly on low-carbon solutions such as developing renewable energy or offering grants for electric vehicles. These are very valuable schemes, but all this positive activity masks a deeper problem. Little has been done to curb carbon-intensive activity. New coal mines are opened and new airports built with little discussion of climate impacts. If we are constantly finding new ways to dig up and burn carbon, it won’t be enough just to ramp up renewable energy. Study after study shows that meeting climate goals means phasing out the extraction and use of oil, coal and gas – yet no mainstream political party has a coherent plan to do this. If pressed, politicians like Sturgeon could hide behind a quirk in the rules of carbon accounting. According to conventions set by the United Nations, we count the carbon where it’s burned, not where it’s taken out of the ground. This creates a strange incentive to dig more up, ship it out and let other countries take the hit on their carbon target. But what might make accounting sense for one country works directly against the global goal of reducing emissions. Politicians, then, are constrained by the culture of political life. They also feel constrained by the electorate. There was a striking consistency in my interviews: no MP felt that their voters were putting them under particular pressure to act. As one said to me, “I’ve knocked hundreds, literally thousands of doors, and had tens of thousands of conversations with voters … and I just don’t have conversations about climate change.” Many of these conversations took place before the school climate strikes and Extinction Rebellion protests began in 2018 – these were remarkable events, after which the polls showed heightened levels of concern. Yet speaking to politicians during and after the 2019 election, I heard a lot of uncertainty about how this generalised concern might translate into support for particular climate strategies. And this matters, particularly in the UK’s constituency-based system, where MPs feel a particularly strong attachment to the local patch, described by one as “almost like being a parent. It’s got the sort of joys and terror associated with that type of emotional connection.” Exactly how a politician “represents” the people is not at all straightforward. When an MP campaigns against a hospital closure, they are, in effect, saying”: “I am campaigning for local health services and this makes me a worthy representative of this area.” This is a relatively straightforward claim. With climate – a complex, global issue with no clear beginning or end – it’s more complicated. Politicians have to work quite hard to make a claim for why acting on climate is in the best interests of their electorate. They might do this through pointing out that a global problem such as climate change requires everyone to do their bit. But this claim is often ignored, because people are understandably caught up with their daily lives and struggles, or feel powerless, cynical or overwhelmed by the scale of the challenge. Some politicians point out the economic or social benefits of climate action, such as jobs in renewable energy. As one told me: “I’m happy to use an economic argument if that means more people will come on side.” Another told me about proposals for a new road in his constituency, which he opposed. If he had used a climate argument, he said, “there would have been a rolling of eyes and saying: ‘Oh, here he goes again.’” Instead, he made the case on economic grounds, saying that investment in public transport was a better option. There’s a danger in dampening down the message in this way. If politicians don’t speak out, people don’t feel a sense of urgency. They are less likely to support climate action if they don’t see their politicians leading the way, or offering up a strategy that is as serious as the problem it is designed to address. Climate politics becomes a silent standoff, with neither citizens nor representatives willing to make the first move. But this standoff contains the seeds of a solution. If politicians have the confidence to lead, to see climate action as a social contract between citizens and politicians, this is likely to lead to greater support. What could a confident climate politics look like? In this new world of the coronavirus pandemic, this question is all the more urgent. Some have cheered the unintentional environmental benefits of lockdown. It’s certainly true that the air is cleaner, the streets quieter. We can hear the birdsong. Carbon emissions have taken a dive, too. But this is in no way a model for climate strategy. Experience from China has shown that emissions bounce back pretty quickly once lockdown restrictions are eased. But most importantly, lockdown has imposed untold misery and sacrifice. This is emphatically not what is needed for climate action. Instead, politicians need to talk about a purposeful transition: not the juddering halt of lockdown, but the managed transformation of our economy, so wellbeing increases as carbon falls. What the pandemic does provide, though, is the possibility of change. The government has done things in the last few weeks that no one thought possible: paying the wages of millions of private-sector workers; shoring up company finances; involving itself in the lives of individuals in ways that would previously have caused the hackles of even the most radical of politicians to rise. Fundamentally, we are rethinking the relationship between state and citizen. As citizens, we have realised that we need the state to keep us safe from crises, be they immediate, like Covid-19, or longer term, like climate change. Politicians, for their part, have realised that people can rise to the challenge, if they understand what they need to do and why. Once the trauma of lockdown eases, the rebuilding begins. This is perhaps the point at which the risks and opportunities for climate are at their most stark. The government could choose to align its recovery strategy with its climate strategy, or, in the rush to prop up an ailing economy, it could do the opposite – handing money out in such a way as to safeguard the high-carbon economy. If we are to make the right choice here, as a society, the essential first step is a simple one: speaking out. Politicians, and others, need to speak openly and with unflinching honesty about the significance of climate change. As my conversations with MPs have shown, this is a surprisingly difficult thing to do. The left has made a start, with its idea of a Green New Deal. In the US, politicians led by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ed Markey put forward a plan aiming for net-zero emissions and 100% renewable energy, including job creation in manufacturing, economic justice and even universal healthcare. Following Covid-19, what the Green New Deal now offers is, essentially, a green route to recovery. The plan has many critics, but compared to the low-key approach favoured by UK politicians, it has the advantage of being idealistic, bold and honest. It tells a story about climate action that aims to connect with voters. Elements of this approach could be seen in Labour’s 2019 election offer. On the political right, though, despite support for ambitious targets, there is a distinct lack of a clear story on climate. A second step is to open up a more meaningful dialogue between citizens and politicians. One practical way is through processes like citizens’ assemblies. Early this year, Climate Assembly UK got underway. This gathering of 110 representative UK citizens, commissioned by six select committees, has heard evidence from experts on climate science and responses, has discussed and deliberated on possible solutions, and will shortly report its findings back to parliament. Third, improving conversations on climate change almost certainly requires more of an appeal to the heart as well as the head. The language of cost-benefit analysis and gross domestic product has its uses, but its appeal is limited, and it accentuates the divide between experts and public, rather than breaking it down. Yet this is the language that politicians have used until now. There are parallels here with the Brexit debate. Remain politicians thought they could win by putting forward a clear-headed case for economic stability, but they left the emotion out of it. In truth, we need both. People care about family, fairness and decency, and an enabling state, looking out for the interests of its citizens. This is exactly how climate action could be framed. Following the coronavirus shutdown, there’s an opportunity to involve people in shaping the way we rebuild our societies and economies, to increase resilience against future threats – not least, those arising from climate change. Every politician is reassured if they know there is support for their proposals. They can’t govern in a vacuum. We can’t afford to be silent now, when politicians are debating our future. Street protests are out of the question at the moment, but there are many ways to make your voice heard. Talk to MPs and local councillors about your views on climate. Get in touch by phone or email. Ask them what they think; make it a dialogue. From a politician’s point of view, showing your strength of feeling as a citizen, as someone who doesn’t normally kick up a fuss, is immensely powerful. Given a meaningful opportunity to have their say, most people would support action in the face of the climate breakdown that is unfolding in front of us. But our democracies, in their current form, are just not offering people that choice. Politicians and citizens, if they take each other seriously, can turn this around. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."

I’m sure many WUWT readers on both sides of the AGW debate watched Mitt Romney’s acceptance speech last night. The most memorable line that got a standing ovation was a poke back at Obama’s famous line – “I am absolutely certain that generations from now, we will be able to look back and tell our children … this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal.” given at his acceptance speech in 2008.
Marc Morano of Climate Depot has the story about how some folks are upset about that. Mike Mann, since he doesn’t have anything else to do since being put on “sabbatical” is of course given the opportunity to refute. He’s the ‘go to guy’ now that Gore has imploded.

Below are selected excerpts of the Politico article. To read full article go to here. (subscription required)
Politico: Romney’s climate change remark makes waves
By Alex Guillen
8/30/12 11:29 PM EDT
Mitt Romney took a shot at President Barack Obama’s climate change position during his acceptance speech Thursday.
“President Obama promised to slow the rise of the oceans and to heal the planet,” Romney said after accepting the GOP’s presidential nomination in Tampa, drawing laughter from the crowd. “My promise is to help you and your family.”
The line received a standing ovation.
Romney was referring to now-famous remarks Obama made in 2008 after securing the Democratic nomination. “I am absolutely certain that generations from now, we will be able to look back and tell our children … this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal.”
A needless slam on science? That’s how it appeared to Penn State climate researcher Michael Mann.
“How sad it is to witness such fallacious logic from a major party candidate for president,” Mann, one of the nation’s best-known climate researchers, told POLITICO. “If we do not take the necessary actions to combat climate change now, we will of course be leaving our children and grandchildren the legacy of a degraded planet.”
[…]
Marc Morano, publisher of the climate skeptic blog Climate Depot, predicted that Romney’s line from Thursday’s speech will be memorable.
“Kudos to Romney for an accurate framing of the global warming debate,” he said. “Romney’s quip will serve to remind voters just how lofty Obama’s rhetoric once was. Romney’s reminder of Obama’s promise to command the oceans will be one of the most memorable lines of the speech.”
Romney’s speech also included a reiteration of his promise to achieve North American energy independence by 2020 “by taking full advantage of our oil and coal and gas and nuclear and renewables.”

I agree with Dr. Michael Mann, candidate Obama’s statement about healing the planet was indeed “fallacious logic”, especially in lieu of his track record on climate now. – Anthony

UPDATE: Forecast humor on steroids, here
You can’t make up FAIL like this. First this story in the BBC Today:

Now let’s have a look at the official Met Office forecast for April, issued on March 23rd, 2012: 
Met Office 3-month Outlook
Period: April – June 2012 Issue date: 23.03.12
SUMMARY – PRECIPITATION:
The forecast for average UK rainfall slightly favours drier than average conditions for April-May-June as a whole, and also slightly favours April being the driest of the 3 months. With this forecast, the water resources situation in southern, eastern and central England is likely to deteriorate further during the April-May-June period. The probability that UK precipitation for April-May-June will fall into the driest of our five categories is 20-25% whilst the probability that it will fall into the wettest of our five categories is 10-15% (the 197-2000 climatological probability for each of these categories is 20%).
CONTEXT:
As a legacy of dry weather over many months water resources in much
of southern, eastern and central England remain at very low levels.
Winter rainfall in these areas has typically been about 70% of average,
whilst observations and current forecasts suggest that the final totals for
March will be below average here too. The Environment Agency advises
that, given the current state of soils and groundwater levels in these
areas, drought impacts in the coming months are virtually inevitable.

Obviously, the power sucking supercomputer they recently put online needs to be bigger.
It is capable of 1,000 billion calculations every second to feed data to 400 scientists and uses 1.2 megawatts of energy to run – enough to power more than 1,000 homes.

GIGO me thinks. This isn’t the first time this has happened:
Red Faces At The Met Office
Met Office admits they botched snow warning
And then there’s the BBQ summer fiasco, which prompted replacement of the seasonal forecasts with the shorter term one you see above:
Met Office ends season forecasts – no more “BBQ summers”
Maybe they should stick to DART (Digital Advanced Reckoning Technology) which  can do the job of making forecasts equally well, using less power, less space, and less money:

"Global greenhouse gas emissions are expected to slump this year after countries and industries shut down due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but Australia’s electricity grid appears immune. An analysis found the reduced economic activity over a five-week period was likely to have cut emissions from the country’s coal-dominated power generation by only about 1% compared with previous years. Total electricity consumption between 16 March and 21 April was 2.4% lower than last year, but more than half of that drop was likely attributable to it being warmer in 2019 in that period, leading to people running power-hungry air-conditioners more often. The report by Hugh Saddler, an energy analyst who writes a monthly national emissions audit for thinktank The Australia Institute, also underscores the pace at which renewable energy generation has increased. It provided more than 50% of power for nearly two hours in the middle of the day on Easter Saturday, the first time this happened for more than a few minutes. From December to March, distributed rooftop solar power provided 16.3% of electricity in South Australia and 7.7% in Queensland, up from 10.1% and 5.3% respectively two years ago. Within the grid, renewable energy was 24.9% of generation. Saddler, an honorary associate professor at the Australian National University’s Crawford School of Public Policy, said while Australia expected to see a significant fall in emissions from both road transport and aviation due to the virus shutdown when data became available, electricity and gas use had held up. “Given the disruptive nature of the pandemic and its effects on sectors like transport, it might surprise some that the fall in carbon emissions from electricity, the most polluting sector in Australia, has been so small,” he said. Saddler said Australia differed from some of the worst affected countries in that major energy users in Australia, such as mining, mineral processing and manufacturing operations, had mostly stayed open. Air-conditioning and lighting had continued to run in many shopping centres, offices, hotels and education centres though fewer people were using them, and household electricity use rose as people stayed home. While total national emissions had remained mostly flat under the Coalition prior to the pandemic, electricity emissions have been reducing as a wave of clean energy has come online, driven by the rapidly falling cost of wind and solar technology and the 2020 renewable energy target. Investment in large-scale clean generation slowed last year after the target was filled and not replaced, and delays in building transmission infrastructure. Richie Merzian, the Australia Institute’s climate and energy program director, said the pandemic risked slowing the power grid’s move towards a higher proportion of clean power if governments heeded a call from the Australian Energy Council, representing generators, retailers and networks, to use it to delay electricity market reforms. “Electricity emissions have been slightly dented but there has been no real change, and things could get worse if the federal government upgrades and extends coal clunkers as part of the pandemic recovery package,” he said. The report also examined the emissions contained in Australia’s east-coast liquefied natural gas (LNG) export industry. It found the embodied emissions being shipped from Gladstone to Asia as LNG had a much larger carbon footprint than the emissions from gas-fired power plants in the national grid."

The government of China finally confirmed that it has detained the artist Ai Weiwei. Meanwhile, Evan Osnos writes from Beijing for the _New Yorker_ about China's ""Big Chill"": 



Step by step—so quietly, in fact, that the full facts of it can be startling—China has embarked on the most intense crackdown on free expression in years. Overshadowed by news elsewhere in recent weeks, China has been rounding up writers, lawyers, and activists since mid-February, when calls began to circulate for protests inspired by those in the Middle East and North Africa. By now the contours are clear: according to a count by Chinese Human Rights Defenders, an advocacy group, the government has “criminally detained 26 individuals, disappeared more than 30, and put more than 200 under soft detention.”



Indeed, everywhere I turn today, there's news about Chinese censorship and fear of dissent, of ideas, of art, of words like ""luxury."" The _Washington Post_ has a major article on Bob Dylan's concert Wednesday night in Beijing. Dylan, the troubadour of the peace movement and the Sixties and civil rights, in the capital of the world's largest Communist party-state. How'd that go? Ask Keith Richburg, whose _Post_ article is titled ""The times they are a-censored"": 



Rock music icon Bob Dylan avoided controversy Wednesday in his first-ever appearance in Communist-led China, eschewing the 1960s protest anthems that defined a generation and sticking to a song list that government censors say they preapproved, before a crowd of about 5,000 people in a Soviet-era stadium.   
  
Keeping with his custom, Dylan never spoke to the crowd other than to introduce his five-member band in his raspy voice. And his set list – which mixed some of his newer songs alongside classics made unrecognizable by altered tempos — was devoid of any numbers that might carry even the whiff of anti-government overtones.   
  
In Taiwan on Sunday, opening this spring Asian tour, Dylan played “Desolation Row” as the eighth song in his set and ended with an encore performance of “Blowin’ in the Wind,” whose lyrics became synonymous with the antiwar and civil rights protest movements.   
  
But in China, where the censors from the government’s Culture Ministry carefully vet every line of a song before determining whether a foreign act can play here, those two songs disappeared from the repertoire. In Beijing, Dylan sang “Love Sick” in the place of “Desolation Row,” and he ended his nearly two-hour set with the innocent-sounding “Forever Young.”   
  
There was no “Times They Are a-Changin’ ” in China. And definitely no “Chimes of Freedom.”



Meanwhile, NPR reports that Beijing has banned words such as ""luxury,"" ""supreme,"" ""regal,"" and ""high-class"" on billboards: 



The city's new rules state that ads must not glorify ""hedonism, feudal emperors, heavenly imperial nobility"" or anything vulgar, according to the _Global Times_ newspaper. They also should not violate ""spiritual construction"" standards or worship foreign products — leading some to believe the campaign could be targeting foreign luxury goods.   
  
""The truth is that the party has very clearly started what is very clearly a campaign against ostentation in China,"" says David Wolf of Wolf Group Asia, a communications advisory agency. ""There is a pushback against things Western. And there is the desire to see those Western things take a lesser role in the development of Chinese culture.""...   
  
_China Daily_ reports that the campaign is aimed at protecting social harmony, quoting a sociologist who says advertisements that promote the belief that ""wealth is dignity"" could upset low-income residents.



Now there's some good old-fashioned communist thinking! Of course, communists with the courage of their convictions would ban the products, not just the ad copy. But it's nice to see the old values survive.   
  
In some ways the government's confirmation that it has detained Ai Weiwei is the most chilling indication of the new climate. It came in an editorial in _Global Times_ , a vigorous presenter of the government line. Just listen to the combative language: 



Ai Weiwei likes to do something ""others dare not do."" He has been close to the red line of Chinese law....   
  
The West ignored the complexity of China's running judicial environment and the characteristics of Ai Weiwei's individual behavior. They simply described it as China's ""human rights suppression.""   
  
""Human rights"" have really become the paint of Western politicians and the media, with which they are wiping off the fact in this world.   
  
""Human rights"" are seen as incompatible things with China's great economic and social progress by the West. It is really a big joke. Chinese livelihood is developing, the public opinion no longer follows the same pattern all the time and ""social justice"" has been widely discussed. Can these be denied? The experience of Ai Weiwei and other mavericks cannot be placed on the same scale as China's human rights development and progress.



As I've written before, China faces a dilemma. They have opened up their economy and reaped huge benefits, perhaps the largest advance in human well-being in the history of the world -- as the editors of _Global Times_ defiantly argue. But if China wants to become known as a center of innovation and progress, not just a military superpower or a manufacturer, it will need to open further. Investors want to put money into a country with the rule of law. Creative people want to live in a country that allows them to read, write, think, and act freely.   
  
Way back in 1979, David Ramsay Steele, author of _From Marx to Mises: Post-Capitalist Society and the Challenge of Economic Calculation,_ wrote about the changes beginning in China. He quoted authors in the official _Beijing Review_ who were explaining that China would adopt the good aspects of the West--technology, innovation, entrepreneurship--without adopting its liberal values. ""We should do better than the Japanese,"" the authors wrote. ""They have learnt from the United States not only computer science but also strip-tease. For us it is a matter of acquiring the best of the developed capitalist countries while rejecting their philosophy."" But, Steele replied, countries like China have a choice. ""You play the game of catallaxy, or you do not play it. If you do not play it, you remain wretched. But if you play it, _you must play it_. You want computer science? Then you have to put up with strip-tease.""   
  
How much freedom can China's rulers tolerate? How much repression will its citizens tolerate? How many ambitious, creative Chinese will leave the world's largest market to find more creative freedom elsewhere? These may be the most important questions in the world over the next generation.

"The sudden sharp fall in greenhouse gas emissions recorded in the early part of this year may seem like an environmental blessing, a breathing space as the world fights climate breakdown. Skies clear of aeroplanes and streets free of cars have encouraged the return of nature and brought visions of a cleaner world. Carbon dioxide emissions had fallen by 17% on average by early April, according to a definitive study published in Nature Climate Change on Tuesday, as a result of the lockdown measures put in place around the world to tackle the coronavirus pandemic.  In fact, the unprecedented decline is “nothing to celebrate”, according to leading experts. It will be temporary and will make little difference to the world’s ability to meet the goals of the Paris agreement and stave off catastrophic levels of global heating. The causes of the steep fall, the economic convulsions and the possibility of lasting economic damage also mean urgent work must be done to repair the economy. “This decline in emissions, the biggest in history, is the result of economic trauma,” said Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency, whose own analysis backs up the Nature paper in showing this is the biggest drop in carbon in history. “It is nothing to celebrate. It is not the result of policy. This decline will be easily erased if the right policy measures are not put in place.” Dave Reay, a professor of carbon management at Edinburgh University, called the paper “sobering stuff” as it revealed the massive changes made to cope with the pandemic would have only a minor effect on emissions, and the climate. “All those billions of lockdown sacrifices and privations have made just a small and likely transient dent in global greenhouse gas emissions. Covid-19 is no help on climate change – it is a devastating scourge.” “None of this is good news for anyone,” added Joeri Rogelj, a lecturer in climate change at the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London. “It is the symptom of a massive economic disruption caused by the pandemic and the measures to contain it. For the climate, this month-long wake in otherwise record-high emissions is entirely insignificant.” What is to come might be worse still, he warned, if governments around the world seek to kickstart the global economy out of its pandemic recession by pouring public money into projects that prop up existing industries and increase our dependence on fossil fuels. For instance, sectors including aviation, car manufacturing and fossil fuel production have been hard hit by the lockdowns, and many companies are hoping for bailouts using public money. “Massive economic stimulus measures are now being announced and there is a high risk that short-sightedness will lead governments to lose track of the bigger picture by putting their money towards highly polluting sectors that have no place in a zero-pollution and zero-carbon society,” said Rogelj. Campaigners said the world must make the right choices on how to rebuild after the pandemic. They have called, along with leading economists, for a green recovery that would concentrate any stimulus cash on projects that cut greenhouse gas emissions and other forms of pollution, as well as generating jobs and increasing prosperity. “When we move forward from this terrible situation, we have to make sure we hold on to the gains we’ve made in better air quality, lower carbon emissions and simple things like hearing birdsong,” said Jenny Bates, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth. “Councils should start by permanently changing how road space is used, allocating more to encourage walking and cycling, and making public transport work for everyone. Now is the time to scrap plans to expand airports and introduce a levy on the most frequent flyers.” Governments facing such choices have a clear blueprint on how to ensure the recovery is green and sustainable, said Paul Morozzo, a senior climate campaigner at Greenpeace UK. “We know how to do it. We have to rebuild our cities around walking, cycling and public transport. We’ve got to create hundreds of thousands of jobs upscaling renewable energy and insulating people’s homes. Let’s learn from this tragedy, build back better and not make the mistake of ignoring the next crisis [of climate breakdown] heading our way.”"
"**A tier one hotel which could reopen when lockdown ends will stay closed due to the loss of potential guests from higher tier areas.**
The owners of Best Western Hotel Bristol in Newquay, Cornwall said a combination of cancellations and a lack of new bookings made opening unviable.
They said it was best to close the hotel to ""reduce costs and protect the jobs of our loyal staff"".
England's regions will be placed in one of three tiers from 2 December.
Cornwall has been placed in tier one which has the most relaxed restrictions.
But those living in a tier two area must continue to follow tier two rules when travelling to a tier one area and those living in tier three should avoid travelling outside of their area altogether.
The hotel's owners said these restrictions ""prevent us from hosting our usual Christmas parties and winter functions that keep this business viable"".
They added: ""We do not consider that we will be able to attract sufficient overnight guests at an adequate average room rate to make opening worthwhile.
""At this time, we propose to remain closed until at least the end of January 2021.""
Cornwall, the Isles of Scilly and the Isle of Wight are the only areas of England in the lowest level of curbs - tier one.
The tier system will be regularly reviewed, with the first scheduled for 16 December, so an area's tier level may change before Christmas, Downing Street said."
"**India's first female comic superhero Priya, a gang-rape survivor who earlier campaigned against rape, acid attack and sex trafficking, is back to fight disinformation around the Covid-19 pandemic.**
In Priya's Mask, due to be launched on 2 December, the comic crusader joins hands with Jiya, the ""Burka Avenger"", a popular character from a Pakistani cartoon show, as the two go about trying to tackle the pandemic - and also the ""infodemic"", a major proliferation in fake news surrounding the coronavirus.
With more than 9.4 million infections and 137,000 deaths, India has the second highest caseload globally. A strict nationwide lockdown that was imposed on 21 March delayed the spread for a while, but infections grew rapidly - and continue to do so - since restrictions were relaxed.
A major challenge in India's fight against Covid-19 has been the false and misleading information around the pandemic, which is often shared at lightning speed.
Since the first infections were reported earlier this year, millions of people with smartphones have received hundreds of messages each about supposed cures, lockdown rumours and conspiracy theories on Covid's origins. Claims that frequently sipping warm water, shunning meat and poultry, or taking homoeopathic medicine could prevent infection have regularly landed in people's inboxes.
Fear and carelessness have seen people flouting orders to wear masks in public places or maintain social distancing. In some places, frontline workers, including doctors and nurses were attacked, even barred from their own homes by neighbours fearful of catching the virus.
""Through this campaign, we wanted to challenge misinformation, dispel fear, and support the health workers and others at the forefront of the fight against the virus,"" Ram Devineni, the Indian-American creator of the Priya comic series, told the BBC.
He launched the ""modern-day feminist superhero"" in December 2014, two years after the brutal gang rape of a young woman on a bus in Delhi, to focus attention on the problem of gender and sexual violence in India. The series has subsequently been named a ""gender equality champion"" by UN Women.
In Priya's Mask, she arrives riding the flying tigress Sahas (Hindi for courage), to battle ""an invisible monster - a deadly virus unlike any we've seen before"".
As she flies into the city, she sees masses fleeing on foot - a reminder of the early days of the lockdown in India when tens of thousands of poor migrant workers walked for days to return home while factories, offices and transport shut down.
""There's a quiet sense of fear. Everyone is hiding in their homes. It seems as though time has stopped,"" she observes.
Delhi-based writer and theatre actress Shubhra Prakash, who wrote the script of Priya's Mask, says she incorporated her personal experiences into the story.
""During the early weeks of the lockdown, we were not allowed to leave home at all. So I spent a lot of time in my balcony. My access to the world was quite restricted. We were all isolated and it was difficult for everyone. So when you see Meena, a little girl who's one of the main characters in the story, standing alone in her balcony, daydreaming, that was also me.
""And when the lockdown began to ease and we could step out, a 'new normal' emerged. We had to wear masks and maintain social distancing,"" she says.
In Priya's mask, Meena is invited to hop on to Sahas' back for a tour of the becalmed city.
They see deserted roads; Meena spots her favourite ice-cream parlour where no one is queuing up any more; she sees her friend who's as isolated as she is; and hears voices - at times irrational and fearful. At the hospital, she watches her mother, a nurse, heroically tending to Covid-19 patients.
""We wanted people to understand that these are extraordinary times. And we wanted to highlight the role of Covid heroes since we felt they were not being talked about much,"" Ms Prakash says.
""There was a lot of stigma surrounding the illness and we were trying to say that people need to be open-minded. What is keeping the world moving during the pandemic? The sacrifices made by the frontline workers, who go to work to keep us safe.""
In the comic, Priya also partners with Jiya, the Burka Avenger, who's fighting to protect her city Chutneyville against a villainous assault by Baba Kaboom, who plans to take it over by not wearing a mask and spreading the virus.
But, in the process, he himself catches Covid and needs help from Priya and Jiya.
""The most important message it conveys is we have to look at the world with compassion and not give up on humanity. We can only conquer the virus if we work together,"" Ms Prakash says.
Indrani Ray, co-producer of a two-minute animation film based on Priya's Mask (seen at the top of this story), says the pandemic has impacted everyone's life and although ""our lockdowns are different, our experiences are the same"".
Ms Ray, who lives in Mumbai, says her parents live in Kolkata and she has not been able to see them the entire year. ""I'm afraid to visit, just in case I carry the infection and pass it on to them.""
Her colleague Tanvi Gandhi says her involvement in the project was in part due to personal loss.
""I lost someone in my family to the virus, and it all happened so quickly. In a matter of four weeks, it was all over.
""That's when you realise it's not just a statistic, not a social media forward, it's something very tangible that is impacting all of us. It is as real as it can get.""
The animation is voiced by feminist icons in Bollywood and Hollywood, including Rosanna Arquette, Vidya Balan and Mrunal Thakur and 12-year-old Sairah Kabir.
The comic, which targets young people and has augmented reality features, can be downloaded for free anywhere in the world.
Mr Devineni, who lives in the US, says Priya's Mask would have relevance not just in India, but globally since the pandemic has impacted people across the world.
""New York, where I live, looked post-apocalyptic. And if you see images from European cities, many of them did too. Every time I stepped out, I could only see homeless people, it was surreal, the eeriest site I've ever seen.""
His father, a paediatrician who has practiced in South Jersey since 1975, had to stop working for the first time since he was in the vulnerable group for Covid-19.
""He's 80 and has health complications and we knew if he got it, he would have just died. In fact, two of his very close doctor friends - I had grown up calling them uncles - died from Covid. We watched their funerals on Zoom.""
Mr Devineni says when the US embassy in Delhi got in touch with him in April, asking if he'd be interested in creating a new Priya comic to launch in December for the United Nation's 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-based Violence, ""I wondered if we would be outdated by then"".
""I knew the virus would still be there and the campaign would have some resonance. Also, 10 years from now, this artwork, created during the pandemic would be a historical document, a documentation of how people dealt with it at the emotional and visceral level,"" he says, adding, ""but I think it's going to be much more than that.""
For, almost a year since the pandemic began spreading, large parts of the world are still in the grip of the virus. In Delhi, and the US, numbers continue to explode as the global infections cross 62 million, with 1.5 million dead.
And the World Health Organisation and governments in many parts of the words are still finding it a challenge to get people to wear masks or maintain social distancing. Last month, Delhi government raised the fine for not wearing masks in public from 500 rupees ($7.50; Â£5.00) to 2,000 rupees after repeated warnings fell on deaf ears.
And that, Mr Devineni says, means that Priya's Mask has more relevance than ever.

"Restoring the world’s forests on an unprecedented scale is “the best climate change solution available”, according to a new study. The researchers claim that covering 900m hectares of land – roughly the size of the continental US – with trees could store up to 205 billion tonnes of carbon, about two thirds of the carbon that humans have already put into the atmosphere. While the best solution to climate change remains leaving fossil fuels in the ground, we will still need to suck carbon dioxide (CO₂) out of the atmosphere this century if we are to keep global warming below 1.5˚C. So the idea of reforesting much of the world isn’t as far-fetched as it sounds.  Since the dawn of agriculture, humans have cut down three trillion trees – about half the trees on Earth. Already 43 countries have pledged to restore 292m hectares of degraded land to forest worldwide. That’s an area ten times the size of the UK. But what the new study advocates is reforesting something like ten times that amount. Rewilding habitats and reforesting may be easier in the future as the world is already becoming a wilder place in many areas. This may seem a strange prediction, given that the global population will grow from 7.7 billion to 10 billion by 2050, but by then nearly 70% of us will live in cities and have abandoned rural areas, making them ripe for restoration. In Europe already, 2.2m hectares of forest regrew per year between 2000-2015, and forest cover in Spain has increased from 8% of the country’s territory in 1900 to 25% today.

      Rewilding: as farmland and villages are abandoned, forests, wolves and bears are returning to Europe


 Massive reforestation isn’t a pipe dream and it can have real benefits for people. In the late 1990s, environmental deterioration in China became critical, with vast areas resembling the Dust Bowl of the American Midwest in the 1930s. Six bold programmes were introduced, targeting over 100m hectares of land for reforestation.  Grain for Green is the largest and best known of these. It reduced soil erosion and stabilised local rainfall patterns. The ongoing programme has also helped to alleviate poverty by making payments directly to farmers who set aside their land for reforestation. Better yet, the new study suggests that bringing back 900m hectares of forest wouldn’t impact on our capacity to reserve land for growing food. This is certainly possible, and in line with other estimates. Reforestation may even result in production from farmland increasing, as was found in China when more stable rainfall and fertile soil followed the return of forests. There should be more scepticism about how much CO₂ 900m hectares of new forest could store though. The paper insists on 205 billion tonnes of carbon, but this seems too high when compared to previous studies or climate models. The authors have forgotten the carbon that’s already stored in the vegetation and soil of degraded land that their new forests would replace. The amount of carbon that reforestation could lock up is the difference between the two. Mature forests can store a lot of carbon, but this capacity is only reached after hundreds of years, not a couple of decades of new forest growth as assumed in this study. The most recent estimate from the IPCC suggests that new forests could store on average an extra 57 billion tonnes of carbon by the end of the century. This is still a huge number and could absorb about one sixth of the carbon that’s already in the atmosphere, but reforestation should be thought of as one solution to climate change among many. Even if warming is stabilised at 1.5˚C, the study indicates that one fifth of the land proposed for reforestation could be rendered too hot for growing new forests by 2050. But this concern ignores the role of carbon dioxide fertilisation – when there are higher levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, photosynthesis is more efficient, meaning plants need less water and can still be productive at higher temperatures. Today, the most immediate threat to tropical forests is deforestation by people and the fires they light which get out of control, not the more subtle impacts of higher temperatures. Reforesting an area the size of the US will have massive benefits on local environments and will store a huge amount of man-made carbon emissions. It is not, however, a substitute for reducing those carbon emissions.  Even if the world reduces its carbon emissions to zero by 2050, there will still need to be negative global carbon emissions for the rest of the century – drawing CO₂ out of the atmosphere to stabilise global warming at 1.5˚C. Reforestation is essential for creating negative emissions – not reducing the amount of carbon that humans are still emitting. There is another sting in the tail. Massive reforestation only works if the world’s current forest cover is maintained and increasing. Deforestation of the Amazon rainforest – the world’s largest – has increased since Brazil’s new far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, came to power. Current estimates suggest areas of rainforest the size of a football pitch are being cleared every single minute. It won’t be easy, but society needs to protect the forests we’ve got, and protect new forests in perpetuity to permanently keep carbon sequestered in trees and out of the atmosphere."

"**There have been more than 1.4m confirmed cases of Coronavirus in England and more than 51,000 people have died, government figures show.**
As of 2 December London will go into tier-two restriction, after a month long England wide lockdown.
Londoners will be allowed to meet outdoors in groups of six, but households mixing indoors is still banned.
Shops, hairdressers and other forms of ""personal care"" will again open, while pubs can open if they serve substantial meals.
Below is a table of local authority areas in London showing how many people have tested positive for Coronavirus in the week leading up to 26 November and whether the number is on the rise.
The chart below shows the changing rate of confirmed Coronavirus cases across London since the start of March.
A technical glitch meant 15,841 cases between 25 September and 2 October were originally left out of the UK daily case figures.
Over that same week the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in London jumped by 1,461 confirmed cases to more than 4,800.
The week before cases had increased by 1,488 confirmed cases.
Deaths of patients with Coronavirus in London have dropped drastically from a peak in early April.

 **  
RATINGS GUIDE:**



 **$** to **$$$$$** with **$** being a leftist trougher and **$$$$$** being small government dynamo



For some, however, a clown is more appropriate. More than one may be awarded.



 **Hibiscus and Bays Local Board**



 **East Coast Bays Subdivision**



There are 11 candidates standing for four positions. You may cast up to four votes in this FPP election.



 **Edward Benson-Cooper –** Independent **$**



A chiropractor currently serving on the Waitemata District Health Board. It ran a deficit of nearly $15 million in 2018. 



Moving along…



 **Christina Bettany –** Backing the Bays **$$**



Has served one term. From her profile:



“I am passionate about our environment so have taken a special interest in sedimentation, recycling and waste management. I have been an active supporter of our local environmental groups in their planting and pest-free programmes as well as stream restoration initiatives.”



Sounds fine.



“I take climate change issues seriously.”



You bloody had to add that, didn’t you?



Don’t get me wrong. I’m not a climate change denier. I’m a climate change is a role for Auckland Council denier.  




 **James (Jim) Brown –** Independent **$$$$$**



Doesn’t look like he shortened his name out of frustration at people [asking if he was related to the singer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qI1NfFExOSo)



“His concerns for the area include Transport and deterioration of Infrastructure. ‘Our community has outgrown its facilities and we’ve overreached our support network’. He can’t promise to fix these problems, but what he can offer is a focus on practical solutions using logic, a common-sense attitude, a willing ear and an open mind.”



That sounds just sensible enough for me to pretend I didn’t see common-sense mentioned.



 **David Cooper –** Independent **$$$$**



A current local board member. I’m curious as to why the 2016 People over Politics ticket is no more. Maybe it is the hollow ring of ‘People Before Profit’ which always results in no profit for the people.



He has a background in infrastructure engineering and strongly supports openness and transparency, having voted for the unsuccessful motion to open up local board workshops to public view.  




 **Elizabeth Hall**



Hall is concerned that everyday items are not always available locally and believes that with new apartment buildings and rest homes, the town centres need diverse well-stocked shops.  
  
Doesn’t go on to advocate Hibiscus Coast and Bays Supermarkets but she doesn’t really need to.



 **Gary Holmes –** Backing the Bays **$$**



Currently serving on the local board, Holmes has been accused of a conflict of interest for managing four Business Improvement Districts; the Glen Innes, Uptown, Dominion Road and North West business associations – through his company Campaigns Ltd.



In 2013, when six-storey apartments were proposed for Browns Bay, [Gary Holmes accused planners and councillors of using Browns Bay](http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/north-shore-times/8362530/High-rise-plans-are-flawed-says-councillor) “like a token in their game of Monopoly where they are trying to see how many people they can squeeze into the small seaside suburb”.



However, Holmes has been only too happy to advocate for high-rises in the [BIDS that his company manages.](https://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/106665885/auckland-council-agencys-posh-apartment-plan-knocked-back)



 **Julia Parfitt –** Backing the Bays **$$$$**



Should Julia be unsuccessful in her candidacy for Albany ward, she will romp home for the local board.



 **Susana Perez –** Independent **$$$**



Perez moved to New Zealand in 1996 and has been involved in multiple charity groups including the East Coast Bays Lions. She is interested in improving road safety and the provision of adequate lighting on roads. Her interest in improving recycling is outside the proviso of the local board but appears to be standing for the first time, so I think that can be overlooked.



 **Alexis Poppelbaum –** Backing the Bays **$$$$$**



Having worked as a senior staffer to Murray McCully, Poppelbaum may well be very effective if current East Coast Bays MP Erica Stanford is a measure of the talent McCully’s former office contains. A Policy Analyst at PHARMAC and Communications Manager at the Brain Health Research Centre and experience in planning and preparing multi-million dollar budgets.  
  
Take my vote!



 **Glen Stanton –** Independent **$**



Glen is also standing for the Upper Harbour Local Board. He wants the beaches cleaned up and coastal walkways upgraded. His dream project is a World Class walkway from Browns Bay to Takapuna.  
  
Could that be a legacy project with a third-world class price tag?



 **MY RECOMMENDATION:** You get four votes

 **Beth Houlbrooke**  
ACT Deputy Leader / Vice President 



Sure enough, the do-gooders are going to start lecturing on what free school lunches should contain. I think lunches in schools programmes should involve the kids, have them prepare simple, low-cost food such as peanut butter or egg sandwiches, bake some muffins, add a piece of fruit and a glass of milk – something from all the main food groups – and thereby ensure it’s something they’ll want to eat. They can then take those ideas and skills home and into adulthood. 



But wait; I spoke too soon. Almost as soon as I typed that I came across [this news piece ](https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/parent-baffled-after-child-stopped-eating-muffin-during-healthy-snack-time-christchurch-school)deeming muffins to be unhealthy.



 **… AND PATIENT RECOVERIES**



Good to see [Canterbury District Health Board pushing back ](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/115458623/meat-and-milk-canterbury-hospitals-have-no-plans-to-cut-back)on the idea of removing meat and dairy from hospital meals. Protein and energy-rich food sources are not only what hungry children need, but also what those recovering in hospital, especially aged and frail,need.



 **MEATY CONTENT**



I’m sick of farmers of meat and dairy being painted as bad guys. We already have very sustainable agricultural practices in New Zealand and attitudes to stock effluent getting into waterways have completely turned around in the last few decades. We grow grass like topsy, we don’t use feedlots or intensive methods that are detrimental to the environment. 



I’m involved in programmes that support farmers and landowners to fence and plant their riparian margins and by far the majority of farmers I have come across, are passionate conservationists.



More on this topic to come. I’m watching farmers’ concerns mount especially over productive land being turned into forestry. A website to follow is 50 Shades of Green.



 **RASH SOLUTION?**



I’ve said before we hear a lot of emotive terms about such as “ _Climate Change Emergency_ ”, “ _Nuclear Free Moment”_ and others from the left, but here we are faced with a real and present danger: a measles outbreak, and the anti-vaxxers are very quiet. It’s not just anti-vaxxers, but a casual attitude towards vaccination from a generation who have never witnessed the high infant mortality rates as a result of now-preventable diseases, as well as from those who believe in pseudoscience; and I’m guessing the majority of the latter come from the left as well.



What’s not helping is red tape around some of the commonsense solutions for preventing the spread of the disease, increasing the rate of vaccination and speeding up this programme to restore herd immunity to our communities. First it’s the[ bureaucrats telling principals](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/09/bureaucrats-prevent-schools-from-protecting-kids-from-measles/) they can’t tell students to stay home even if they know they have measles; second, it’s pharmacists being unable to get reimbursement for vaccinations carried out their pharmacies.



 _There are 864 pharmacists around the country who are allowed to provide vaccinations for the flu, shingles, whooping cough and meningitis, but current rules mean they don’t get funded to provide the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine._



And then, there’s the lack of incentives for parents to get their children vaccinated. Surely your right to free choice over vaccinations does not give you the right to put other people in harm’s way. With that right comes responsibility; and that’s to keep your children away from school. And it doesn’t give you the right to receive government benefits including Working for Families without obligation. “ _No jab, no pay_ ”, may be controversial, but a very strong message needs to be sent to those who are dragging their feet over vaccinations or who just need a wake-up call. When David said this, the media barely covered it, but it turned out he was in very good company when Dr Lance O’Sullivan said almost exactly the same thing a day later.



 **NO JOKES PLEASE WE’RE IRISH**



Are you kidding? I’m one-quarter Irish, my mother half Irish, and we like nothing more than a good Irish joke and a knees up. We had a barney a few years back for a family reunion, shared plenty of Irish jokes and everyone dressed up as leprechauns, Irish dancers and the like. Wait…was that cultural appropriation?



Our new Race Relations Commissioner says it’s [not okay to tell Irish jokes anymore.](https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/on-air/simon-barnett-and-phil-gifford-afternoons/audio/meng-foon-it-s-not-okay-to-tell-irish-or-maori-jokes-anymore)



The biggest jokes are all these commissioners. **That’s why ACT proposes to abolish them.**
