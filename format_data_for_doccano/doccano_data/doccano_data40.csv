"With 40 million fewer birds today than in 1966 (Report, 29 April), the UK is one of the most nature-deprived countries in the world. Nature is falling silent, and the impact on our environment, culture, health and happiness should not be underestimated. Nature’s influence runs through the fabric of our culture, its creations woven into myth and legend. Birds in particular have been revered in every age. From the Bard to the Beatles and Elgar to Emin, birds have inspired works of music, art, the written and spoken word, while naturalists from Darwin to Attenborough have shared the lives of these remarkable creatures with us, ensuring their status as national treasures for eternity.  Nature is written into our DNA; we are part of it. All of us benefit from taking time to pause and reconnect with the natural world. As creatives, nature is our muse, fuelling our imagination and guiding our paintbrush, pen and camera lens. But nature is in crisis. It hasn’t been prioritised in political decision-making, and now we are paying the price. The next two years will be critical: in 2020, world leaders will meet in Beijing at a global summit to save nature. We call on the UK government to play a world-leading role in nature’s recovery. We have a once-in-a-lifetime chance to do so. This Sunday marks International Dawn Chorus Day, the perfect time to enjoy the feathered orchestra outside your window. You might be lucky enough to hear the vocal acrobatics of the nightingale, the soaring song of the skylark or the blackbird’s beautiful solo. Nature’s extraordinary wake-up call should set alarm bells ringing for all of us. If we don’t want to lose it, we need to act now – before it’s too late, and let nature sing.

"We live in a time of loss. Wild places dwindle, the animals and plants that live in them disappear. Climate change is now a certainty, and it will without a doubt lead to the loss of land, species, and ways of life. In the abstract this is disconcerting. Up close it is devastating. I worked on the BBC’s Climate Change: The Facts, presented by David Attenborough, and have felt this pain first-hand.  Last year, I was living a charmed life. I graduated from university and jetted off (painfully ironic, I know) to lead an expedition on a remote South Pacific island, where I studied one of the world’s rarest parrots and the role of culture in conservation. Within a few days of my return I somehow stepped into a job at the BBC on a documentary about climate change, initially called Two Degrees (the name changed when the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s report released last October informed us that 1.5C would be more appropriate, and that isn’t really very catchy). I was to be the show’s researcher, tasked with finding stories that would best educate and entertain the British public. What followed were four months of desperately tracking down and interviewing the people who live on the frontline of climate change. I spoke to scientists who described the so-loud-it-gives-you-whiplash crack of a glacier calving off the Greenland ice shelf. Another told me of the horror he felt when his calculations revealed that the current logging and burning of tropical forests releases more carbon dioxide than our remaining forests could possibly absorb. I read detailed and disturbing death threats sent to climate activists to make them go quiet. I listened to people who have lost their homes and heritage to rising sea levels. I watched countless videos of wildfires ripping through suburbia, and cannot forget the little girl’s voice in the background of one shaky mobile phone recording asking her daddy if she was going to catch fire. Still, the most upsetting videos I saw were of politicians and pundits spreading harmful lies, promoting their own interests at the cost of protecting children from climate change. It was a privilege to hear these stories, but I struggled to cope with what I learned. Climate anxiety, as I think of it, crept into my mind and body, and settled as an incoherent anger. My nights became ones of sleeplessness with a tight racing heart. I have been hit by a panic attack in the snack aisle of a supermarket, overwhelmed by the countless choices and their consequences. Hot sunny days in April scare me. I cannot stop thinking about climate change. I have always been a happy-go-lucky kind of gal, and it has been frightening to be feeling physically sick with nervousness for the first time in my life. I am far from the first person to have felt this way, and there is a rapidly growing body of literature on the psychological impact of climate change. In 2009, an article in the public health journal the Lancet stated that “climate change is the biggest global health threat of the 21st century”, and then last year a report listed the ways in which climate change affects mental health: the rise of extreme temperatures exacerbates anxiety and depression, the spread of vector-borne diseases will cause a cascade of cognitive and neurological issues, and freakish weather events will trigger post-traumatic stress disorder.  Communities that depend on the land struggle to contend with shifting landscapes caused by unpredictable weather patterns, rising sea levels and erosion. Indigenous groups and farmers feel dismay that they no longer “know” their landscape and seasons, something their predecessors relied on to survive. When traditional ecological knowledge becomes useless, it is forgotten. With this loss of culture comes the loss of identity, and traditionally marginalised people may once more suffer a loss of way of life. As a city dweller in the UK, I am fortunate not to have been physically touched by climate change, and yet it has consumed my thoughts. While this has been unpleasant, it is actually a positive discovery. For years the dogma has been that climate change is too abstract a concept for people to truly care about it, yet my experience, and that of so many others, demonstrates that when people hear the human stories we can build that tenuous and critical emotional connection with such an amorphous subject. Aldo Leopold, the great American ecologist, wrote that “one of the penalties of an ecological education is that one lives alone in a world of wounds”; and as beautiful as that may be, I hope that if we open these wounds to others we may be able to transform our pain into strength. • Liv Grant is a conservationist and documentary film-maker.

"George Monbiot (Time to declare the system dead – before it takes us down with it, 25 April) says he has slowly and reluctantly rejected capitalism because the endless impulse for growth and wealth creation ineluctably drives climate change. Asad Rehman, executive director of War on Want, in his global justice seminar at the Extinction Rebellion protests, focused more on neoliberalism – the even more rapacious, ever-expanding incarnation of capitalist exploitation of people and planet over the last four decades – as the driver of global climate inequality and impending calamity. But left-of-centre ideologies also focus on growth in the bid to tackle inequality, with social and economic priorities overshadowing ecological imperatives. This paper has had occasional discussions of the degrowth movement. In one such, Christiane Kliemann (Let’s face it: we have to choose between our economy and our future, 23 January 2015) posited that once we have accepted there are only radical options left, we have a choice between our economy and our future if we are to meet everybody’s needs more sustainably and equitably, using fewer resources. More focus on degrowth on the political left, and more analysis in these pages of its underpinnings and its potential, could contribute to movements for creating a global economy that can truly be described as “ours”, and a future not only for those of us in the global north, but also a present for those in the global south already experiencing the ravages of growth-driven climate change. Sarah CemlynBristol  • For once I disagree with George Monbiot. He overlooks one idea favoured by environmentalists and thinking capitalists: the circular economy. This idea doesn’t attack capitalism per se, rather the traditional take–make–use–waste structure of its linear economy, a structure also found in communism, and a pernicious habit of human life. In a circular economy, resources remain in use for as long as possible, giving their maximum value. Products and materials (both natural and technological) enjoy as many “service lives” as possible. Products and packaging are designed for maximum reuse, repair and refurbishment, thus relegating recycling and energy extraction to the last resort. Reverse logistics provide return networks, with local reuse prioritised. In my view, circular economy is just as necessary as rewilding, emissions reduction and carbon sequestration if we are to slam the carbon brakes on within a decade. Perhaps it is more necessary because, unlike them, it gives objectives and structure to the good transformation of our way of life. I suggest a look at the Ellen MacArthur Foundation for much deeper thinking on circular economy. I have only one quibble with them, which is that so far they say little on how people and communities can contribute – which we can. They seem focused on changing capitalism.Malcolm FowlesReading, Berkshire • George Monbiot calls for replacing capitalism, and the G2 article on the library of things (25 April) hints at a solution. Surely the fourth industrial revolution will involve cooperatives providing many of the services we have come to depend on? As an example, in Zurich – one of the world’s wealthiest and happiest cities – 25% of homes are owned by cooperatives and the city government is raising the proportion to a third. As a consequence, a much wider range of people live on low rents, and have fuller and less wasteful lives.Dr Nicholas FalkExecutive director, The URBED Trust • George Monbiot powerfully argues that constant economic growth on a finite planet results in environmental meltdown. He suggests we need a range of thinkers to frame a coherent alternative to capitalism. A genuinely democratic socialism with a solid workplace and local basis has already a number of blueprints. They include that glorious failure, the alternative Lucas Aerospace corporate plan in 1976, drawn up by shop stewards, advocating socially useful products, and the actions and policies of Preston city council, as described in several Guardian articles by Aditya Chakrabortty.Michael SomertonHull, East Yorkshire • Gaby Hinsliff (Pay heed to the climate rebels. They ask the right question, 20 April) makes a very good point about protests, where arguments may be at best half formed but very strong feelings that something is wrong are articulated. She puts her finger right on the alarm bell when she quotes Gail Bradbrook of Extinction Rebellion saying: “Now is not the time to be realistic.” With global warming, how can the plan to leave the EU, travelling the world looking for new markets, make sense when we should be cutting down on aviation and shipping emissions as fast as we can? The struggle to say goodbye to petrol cars, gas boilers and cookers will be so much harder if we have turned our backs on our nearest markets, relying on far-flung sources for food and needs, and on top of that have to struggle with our failure to really start addressing and reducing the consequences of heating our planet up. This is the big question that overshadows all political squabbling and despite listening to all the arguments has failed to work itself to the surface. Extinction Rebellion may not be ready to be realistic yet but their strong vision and determination and canary they put in the system has put the spotlight on the most important realistic question we should be asking ourselves now.Barbara Mullarney WrightActon, London • I admire Greta Thunberg’s actions on climate change, but I can’t wholly agree with her that “MPs have lied” (Report, 24 April). MPs are held to account by their electorates and, as is clear even in the advertisements that appear in the Guardian, even the best informed voters like cruises to ever more exotic places, they like ever bigger cars, they aspire to lifestyles that come with higher carbon emissions. In other words, we are all deceiving ourselves, and elected politicians who challenge our cognitive dissonance will fear paying a high price for it. While Extinction Rebellion represents one train of thought, the gilets jaunes in France seem to be motivated not by climate change (Macron’s supposed justification for higher fuel prices) but by personal economics. A courageous government would swiftly introduce carbon rationing, with diminishing, tradable rations for each of us. The price of carbon would be determined by a formula based on the contraction and convergence framework, to ensure globally equitable burden sharing. Will it happen? Not until London is inundated I suspect.Colin ChallenLabour MP Morley & Rothwell 2001-2010 and founding chair, All party parliamentary climate change group, 2005-2010 • Arriving home from the Extinction Rebellion protests on Wednesday morning I was really heartened to read your lead editorial (24 April) putting into words most of my feelings: “Doing nothing is not an option.” At the same time I would love to see the Guardian challenge itself to lead the conversation even more: what does the climate emergency mean for you? What role should you play? We all have to do more, faster. It’s an existential crisis. In the same edition you had adverts for British Airways and Guardian holidays. We will all have to start changing our lifestyles and that means less long-distance flying unfortunately. I understand that newspapers’ business model relies on advertising and us paying subscribers. It would be very exciting for the newspaper to embrace the demands of Extinction Rebellion – especially with regard to exploring citizens’ assemblies. This is a process to put people at the centre of power. It is new, and a little bit confusing, but ultimately hugely empowering and powerful for people all at the same time.Henry TrewBuckland Brewer, Devon • I find the Guardian’s ostensible promotion of environmental justice completely at odds with the continuing policy of reviewing tech devices without rating their environmental impact. On the very same day as Peter Beaumont’s article (Rotten eggs: e-waste from Europe poisons Ghana’s food chain, theguardian.com, 24 April), the Guardian published yet another tech review awarding five stars to a product with no mention of a post-use device recycling plan (Huawei P30 Pro: Game changing camera, stellar battery life). As a reader and tech user I want to know which products are least environmentally damaging. I am less concerned about the cosmetic aspects such as “stunning colour options, including the pearlescent oil slick-like ‘breathing crystal’ and the eye-popping amber sunrise”, which the Guardian prioritises over device recycling information. Please act to combat the horrific e-waste industry by insisting that all your tech reviews include clear information for readers about the devices’ in-purchase recycling package. If a tech producer can’t provide a recycling plan for its products, don’t give them five stars.Jonathan ShaveBolzano, Italy • You report that senior politicians “towered over” Greta Thunberg. From what I saw and heard, quite the opposite was the case.Rev John JamesWatchfield, Somerset  • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

Share this...FacebookTwitterSince the gore-filled 10:10 No Pressure clip exploded onto the public scene last week, the reaction from critics, primarily the blogosphere, has been harsh and swift – so overwhelming in fact that 1010 pulled it from the Internet within just a few hours. Major backers like Sony and Kyocera have since disappeared. It was a huge embarrassment. But all of this no thanks to the mainstream media. Nowhere has the silence on this issue of using violence to shut down human dissent been more deafening than in Germany.
Other than a few blogs and discussion forums, a Google search in Germany of “1010 No Pressure” yields no critical reports by German media outlets relating to the controversy. No reports at all. Most of the search results lead to English speaking sites outside of Germany’s borders.  Except for a short uncritical blurb by Focus magazine, no German media has touched this story. They’ve buried it. Why is this so?
It’s because the German media and political classes are so very deeply involved in the green movement, and thus are now incredibly embarrassed by it.  They simply cannot afford having this spread to the German public. Awareness of the 1010 PR film would lead the public to ask serious, inconvenient questions.
New religion
Germany has become an environmenmtaly radical country, with climate protection having become its new religion,  it’s de facto raison d’etre.  Striving to be green is a very noble virtue. The established political classes and media are all deeply entrenched in the ideology, and actively purvey it daily. A green collectiveness has taken over. Former Minister of the Environment and Socialist party leader Sigmar Gabriel once distributed 6000 copies of Al Gore’s AIT to Germany’s upper secondary schools in order to indoctrinate university-bound students. Pupils are shown the movie, uncritically, yearly. Groups like the environmentalist Germanwatch regularly present world doom and gloom scenarios at schools to round out the indoctrination. Dissent, once a positive attribute in the land of poets and thinkers, is now scorned upon.
Being green means being virtuous, and so the result is a competition of who can be the greenest among political parties, and among European countries. Any consideration of the adverse economic and technical impacts this race could have has been thrown overboard. The race to be the greenest is the race to moral supremacy, i.e. the right to lecture the rest of the world on how to behave.
Dissent is not tolerated

Germany has its sceptics, but they have been vilified and severely marginalised by the well-funded scientific, political and media-establishment. Politicians and leaders who dare lift a single finger of scepticism quickly find it bitten off, and are immediately gang-mobbed. The case of Marie-Luise Dött is one example. The tactics of Hans Joachim Schellnhuber and Stefan Rahmstorf of the generously government-funded Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) routinely marginalise scientists who do not agree. Germany and Western Europe have once again become intolerant. Yet, their latest attempt to cover-up the intolerance has only served to expose it.
 Green has become Germany’s business model
Because of it’s faith in the green movement, Germany has invested immensely in climate protection. Even despite it’s gray and rainy climate, the country has become a leader in promoting solar energy, pouring billions in subsidising solar panels and passing aggressive energy feed-in laws. A vast array of green energy sources are heavily subsidised by the government. Billions are are now being poured into green energy infrastructure projects, like huge offshore wind parks. Europe is now getting set to implement Desertec, a massive €400-billion euro Saharan solar power generation facility, where huge corporate giants like Siemens stand to cash in big. Films like 1010 only serve to cast doubt and jeopardise already shaky public support.
Can’t afford to lose it
So with Germany so deep in Green, with everything at stake, it risks losing its very purpose, its mission, the imagined moral high ground that green promises to deliver, it’s entire bank-rolled future. Germany, like many other European countries, has put itself in a position where it simply cannot afford seeing the green movement collapse. Therefore it is doing everything possible to sustain it, and to bury anything that could threaten it.
No, 1010 must never reach public awareness. People could start thinking that the movement is run by zealots. That must never happen.
The deafening silence speaks volumes.

" Bill Shorten has declared Labor will run its own race on climate change, and will “listen” but not replicate Julia Gillard’s joint policy process with the Greens in any minority government scenario after the election. In an interview with Guardian Australia on the campaign trail this week, the Labor leader rebuffed a recent overture from the Greens leader Richard Di Natale to revive the process that applied in the 43rd parliament where the parties worked together to produce the clean energy package.  “Richard would say that wouldn’t he? So, who cares? Richard is looking for relevance at the moment,” Shorten said. “I don’t blame him for doing that, it’s legitimate, but I’m going to lead a Labor government”. Asked what he would do if the Greens made a joint policy process the price of supporting a Labor government in the next parliament, Shorten said: “Well [Di Natale] has to face progressive voters. “The Greens cost us action on climate change in 2009. I didn’t come down in the last shower. Just because Richard Di Natale proposes a sequence of events doesn’t not make those events inevitable. “I’m not going to negotiate before an election what happens after an election, but what I am saying is – we use the word mandate a lot in politics. It gets thrown around. In my case, though, I think people can genuinely accept we have been upfront with the people, we’ve got our mandate, they will be my negotiating instructions. “The Greens really stuffed up climate change in the 43rd parliament by their terms. I’m not going to sign up to a deal that damages our chances to deliver [enduring action] on climate change.” In 2010, Gillard set up a multi-party committee to develop the climate change policy comprised of herself, the deputy prime minister Wayne Swan, the climate change minister Greg Combet, Bob Brown, Christine Milne and Adam Bandt of the Greens and the lower house crossbencher Tony Windsor. A week ago, in an interview with Guardian Australia, Di Natale said: “I would hope Shorten would show the maturity that Julia Gillard demonstrated and bring people to the table to negotiate constructively.” Di Natale made it clear he wanted to negotiate with Shorten to strengthen a policy the Greens regard as insufficiently ambitious, but he also wanted to be clear that the Greens are prepared to vote down a policy “if it’s going to lock in failure”. Shorten said he would behave constructively post-election in the event of a victory, but referencing the Gillard process explicitly, he said: “There will not be signings at the table with a sprig of wattle for everyone. “Let’s see what happens when we get elected but I’m not going to have this argument that somehow, we are going to go into coalition with the Greens. “That doesn’t mean I won’t listen, or I won’t talk to the Greens, I’ll talk to all parties in the Senate and I’ll talk to the opposition if we get elected. I’m a very pragmatic personality and my record is getting things done.” Labor’s climate change policy has been a feature of the opening weeks of the campaign, with the Morrison government trying to land blows on the package in a facsimile of Tony Abbott’s “carbon tax” offensive in 2013, even though Liberals in metropolitan contests are facing a backlash from voters concerned the Coalition has been destructive on climate action. As well as the government attack, Labor’s policy has been criticised by the Greens as not ambitious enough, and Shorten has faced a difficult balancing act on the hustings in Queensland this week about the controversial Adani coal project, with several marginal seats up for grabs, and significant local concern about jobs. Asked whether Labor would persist with a detailed policy to drive emissions reduction if it loses the election on 18 May, given the electoral pain of the past decade and the toxic politics around the issue, Shorten said he was “not contemplating failure”. He said the coming election needed to break the policy deadlock for the good of the country. “Whether we shift post-election is up to the caucus of the day. But we cannot give up on the climate change arguments. “We’ve got to break through this paralysis. We are selling out our future and future generations if we give in to the knuckle draggers on the right. “The problem is this government is not serious about climate change, and whenever anyone comes up with any ideas to do something about it they will always find an excuse to do nothing. “Just ask Malcolm Turnbull.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterBy bitter, I mean much colder than normal. This is a summary of what the experts are saying and what the data are showing.
We just got a strong El Nino behind us and now a La Nina is forming in the Pacific and is barreling ahead in full development, see the chart below. It’s got the potential to be a big one, meaning global temperatures will go into a nosedive in the months ahead.
Joe Bastardi thinks temperatures will reach levels we saw back when Pinatubo blew its top, and maybe lower.
The next chart shows the NWS/NCEP forecast for the fall and winter. Strangely, the German weather services here are predicting a 60% chance the coming winter in Germany will be warmer than normal – which doesn’t agree with what NWS service is forecasting. Europe is projected to be about normal. Note: As Joe Bastardi’s latest video shows, regional forecasts coming out of NOAA are sometimes very very wrong!

Take a look at the Arctic in the right side panels above, i.e. December to April. We’re talking deep freeze. That’s quite a difference from the constant red bloodbath we’re used to seeing from GISS and NOAA. The months ahead are going to be really tough for those trying to avoid the Al Gore effect.

Average global temps to a great extent will depend on the depth of the La Nina. Look at the following graph and compare this La Nina with the last one back in 2007-08. What do you see? Where were we at this time in 07? Looks to me right around zero. This time around we’re already 1°C below that. Also look at the overall slope in this year’s plummet.
This La Nina will seriously depress global temps in the months ahead, thus throwing ice water on the NCDC’s fantasy of the hottest year ever. It’ll be interesting watching them try to pull it off. They need it for Cancun.
The poles are also indicating lower temperatures. No death spiral in the Arctic. Zed’s dead, baby. The DMI chart already shows freezing at 80°+N latitude. But it has ticked up a bit. No matter it was the coldest melt season in that area on record – in the “hottest year ever”. Go figure!
The Arctic will not set a new record low sea ice minimum this year, as many were hoping, panting and drooling for. It isn’t even going to set the second lowest.  A third lowest is still in the works, though the odds are tightening. Total sea ice of the north and south poles is smack normal – and again, this in the “hottest year” on record.
Okay, a winter’s forecast is not climate – many will crow. Yes, but weren’t we told that such winters were a thing of the past? To the contrary, more and more we’re hearing they may very well be a thing of the future.
Folks, all these nice graphs are available at my Climatic Indicators side bar on my homepage. Take a look and you be the judge.

"The wet tropics world heritage area in north Queensland has been damaged by climate change in a manner “equivalent” to coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef, the area’s management authority has said. In an extraordinary statement issued on Monday, the authority’s board said the tropical rainforest was in “accelerating decline” and that some of the area’s unique species were at imminent risk of extinction.  Last summer was the hottest on record. “Extreme heat is the wet tropics world heritage area’s coral-bleaching event equivalent, with some mountain-adapted species, like the lemuroid ringtail possum, unable to survive even a day of temperatures above 29C,” the statement said. “Mount Bartle Frere recorded an unprecedented 39C at its peak on six days this past summer. The board is convinced that, given the evidence, these key species endemic to the wet tropics world heritage area are under severe and immediate threat from climate change. “This is occurring now, not in the future, and requires an immediate response.” The authority was due to release a climate adaptation plan in June, but says its observations this past summer have added to the urgency. Reports on the state of the wet tropics have consistently warned about the threat of climate change. In 2016, a report recognised that biodiversity in the area was in decline, with species reducing in population and size, largely due to climate change. Modelling by the co-author of that report, Steve Williams, based on data collected over 10 years, showed more than half the species endemic to the wet tropics were at risk of extinction before the end of the century. The authority’s new statement said: “The latest rates of decline suggest that these extinctions are happening even sooner.” Monitoring has found declines in bird and possum species have continued apace and are “reaching alarming levels”. The authority believes the lemuroid ringtail possum, which is not listed as endangered, could be locally extinct within three years. In 2017, the International Union on the Conservation of Nature found that climate change threatened to disrupt the fine ecological balance of the area and could result in “rapid and catastrophic” changes. “These scenarios are increasingly proving true,” the authority said. “While understandably the Great Barrier Reef has received significant funding to address climate change impacts in recent years, investment in terrestrial world heritage areas has not been commensurate with the urgency for mitigating climate impacts on their world heritage values.” The board has outlined a 10-point plan for action on climate change, which includes local measures and a “call for urgent action on reducing global emissions”. The Australian Conservation Foundation said the statement showed climate change was not a “game of costs”. “While much has rightly been made of the damage climate change is doing to the Great Barrier Reef, we know significant harm is also being done to almost all of Australia’s world heritage sites like Kakadu and Shark Bay,” ACF chief executive Kelly O’Shanassy said. “Our political leaders must explain how they will protect places like the wet tropics of Queensland by urgently cutting our climate pollution and showing global leadership to encourage other countries to do likewise. And they must explain how they will invest in building the resilience of our natural world so it is in the best condition possible to handle what warming is already in the system. “This is a clear and urgent call for action from the normally dour public servants and scientists charged with looking after one of Australia’s most precious places.”"

Award-winning Daniel Hannan, a conservative MEP of East England, has written a critical piece of Greenpeace called: Greenland to Greenpeace: your hunger for publicity is putting our lives at risk.
h/t: R. de Haan
Readers may have noticed I’ve been focused on Greenpeace over the last week or so. The once peaceful organisation, which used to be concerned with real environmental issues, has long since turned into a militant, intolerant, greedy and increasingly violent group that is bent on forcing others to submit to their will. So I’m pleased when people like Hannan bring it up.
According to Hannan at the Telegraph:
The prime minister of Greenland – a socialist, no less – has attacked Greenpeace for sabotaging an Arctic exploration rig.

When even the socialists get mad at Greenpeace, then it’s a sure sign how radical the organisation has gotten. Greenland’s socialist PM, Kuupik Kleist, is fuming about Greenpeace’s recent criminal sabotage.
The cabinet regards Greenpeace’s action as very serious and an illegal attack on the country’s constitutional rights. It is worrying that Greenpeace, in their hunt for media exposure, violate security rules made to protect human lives and the environment.
I wrote a post about this as well.
Fantasising and drooling over the next Holocaust? 
It seems so. Greenpeace has no resemblance of the organisation it used to be. Even Greenpeace co-founder Patrick Moore thinks the environmentalists have lost their marbles.

Moore says:
They depict human beings as a malignancy, a cancer on the face of the earth. There’s way too many of us. Guys like Paul Watson and a whole bunch of his ilk are coming out and saying there should only be 1 billion people, and not 6 billion people. 
And: 
I fought for nature all through my years at Greenpeace, and I’m proud of what we did back then. But I do not understand how people can write off the whole human race. 
They’ve gone from green to red, and are now headed for brown.

"As the adage goes: “There are decades when nothing happens, and there are weeks when decades happen.” After decades of climate complacency, for those in the environmental movement it certainly feels like we might be living in those weeks. Direct action by striking students and Extinction Rebellion has propelled the climate emergency to the top of the news and the political agenda. But while protesters have – quite rightly – called on the government to take more responsibility, the City of London has largely escaped the firing line.  In the three years since the Paris climate agreement, as the government has spoken (often empty words) about doing its part in lowering emissions, our financial sector has been pouring hundreds of billions of pounds into fossil-fuel projects, unleashing environmental havoc across the planet. In its role as the regulator of the financial system, the Bank of England has the power to stamp out irresponsible fossil fuel lending – using the same tools it has used to clamp down on risky mortgage lending since the financial crisis. In choosing not to use these powers, it is complicit in the climate crisis. The Bank rightly recognises that climate change is a huge risk to financial stability, and it has made encouraging first steps on climate, announcing in April that it will disclose its own climate risk. But with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warning that we have only 11 years to avert the devastating impacts of climate change, central banks can, and must, go further. Mark Carney, the Bank’s governor, has admitted that meeting even the modest targets of the Paris agreement will require a “massive reallocation of capital” – trillions of pounds globally – to deliver the transition to a low-carbon economy. Alongside being able to shape the behaviour of commercial banks, the Bank also has the resources to mobilise huge amounts of its own capital. Since 2009 it has created £445bn of new money, to buy assets from financial markets, through quantitative easing (QE). But since 2016, the Bank has introduced corporate QE, buying £10bn worth of bonds from some of the world’s most socially and environmentally irresponsible companies. Nearly half of the bonds listed as eligible for purchase are from companies in high-carbon sectors, including the likes of Shell and BP. While the Bank has not yet disclosed which bonds it has purchased, even the very act of declaring them eligible has a positive material impact for these fossil companies, by pushing up the prices of their bonds and lowering the yield they have to pay to investors. The behaviour of the central bank reverberates throughout the financial system. In signalling to the market that it is willing to invest in fossil fuels, it is setting an example for other banks and investors to do the same. The Bank is legitimising climate criminals. With speculation mounting that more QE will be rolled out in response to a Brexit shock or a coming recession, Positive Money and Fossil Free London will be demonstrating outside the Bank on Thursday as it releases the latest inflation report. They are calling on the Bank to use its power to create money to help, rather than hinder, the green transition – by committing to “green QE”. We are demanding that the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee at the very least blacklists bonds from fossil fuel companies, and instead considers kickstarting a Green New Deal by buying assets in low-carbon sectors, such as renewable energy. Ed Miliband and Caroline Lucas have called on the UK to be on a “war footing” to fight climate change. The Bank of England was founded in 1694 to finance a war – now it’s time for it to help fight the biggest war of my generation. • Simon Youel works for the campaign group Positive Money"

The German edition of the Financial Times has a story today on wind energy’s latest debacle in Germany: treehugger-bureaucrats. In one corner we have environmentalists demanding the installation of wind energy to avert a climate catastrophe, and in another corner you have environmentalist bureaucrats stopping windparks in order to protect local wildlife.
Green offshore windparks clash with green German bureaucrats.
Meanwhile, energy prices for the consumer are going through the roof.
The Federal Office For Nature Protection (no joke!), responsible for approving offshore wind parks,  is having second thoughts about the foundations used for offshore windmills because “they pose a threat to wildlife”.  As a result that have stopped approving any additional windmills until further notice. This is confirmed by a letter to the FT from the Federal Office For Nature Protection.
The FT reports that 2 types of foundations are used for anchoring offshore wind generators. In one type, huge piles are rammed into the seabed by 15,000 blows delivered by a heavy pile driver. But the noise this work creates is disturbing the whales, and they are leaving their living areas for quieter places. That has to stop.
The second type of foundation is the so-called gravity foundation made of concrete. But the heavy concrete pads end up sealing the seabed and thus damage crabs and mussels. Can’t have that either. According to the letter:
Gravity type foundations cannot be considered as an alternative foundation because they are installed on the seabed using  acoustic ramming. A better way would be to use a foundation that is installed using some sort of boring process.

Technically this is possible, but there exists no company to do it. Meanwhile investors and the numerous companies that are currently installing offshore windparks in Germany’s North Sea now face heavy losses. The FT writes:
Severely impacted are companies that are deep into the approval process. This is because the approval processes are lengthy and costs millions of euros, as they entail comprehensive expert attestations and environmental impact studies.
Needless to say, offshore windpark companies are outraged. And all companies that are in the approval process have left out the question on foundations – fearing not being granted approval. But without a foundation, it’s impossible to put up a windmill – thus every approval becomes worthless.
Lawmakers are also outraged by the delays. Yet, the Federal Office For Nature Protection insists it is not imposing a moratorium of any kind, and that rather it is only trying to find a way to bring offshore wind energy production in harmony with nature.
According one German Parliamentarian, Torsten Staffeldt.
The Federal Office For Nature Protection is drifting into absurdity. If we continue like this, we’ll never reach our goals for expanding offshore wind energy.
Well I’d hate to disappoint Herr Staffeldt, but that point has long been reached and surpassed. Worse yet – the treehugger wars are just beginning.

"Hundreds of schools, hospitals and tube stations in London are at risk of flooding or overheating as the climate crisis accelerates and global temperatures continue to rise, according to a study. The report, commissioned by the Green party on the London Assembly, paints a bleak picture of life in the capital as global temperatures increase by 1.5C above pre-industrial levels – a conservative estimate based on current projections.  The study is one of the first to chart the likely impacts of the crisis and comes amid growing pressure on politicians to take radical action. Earlier this month 1,000 people were arrested during the country’s biggest civil disobedience protests in generations aimed at highlighting the climate crisis. On Wednesday, parliament will vote on whether the UK should follow the example of Scotland, Wales, the Labour party and scores of councils and declare a climate emergency. Caroline Russell, GreenLondon assembly member who commissioned the report, said it represented the start of a process of “telling the truth” about the impacts of the climate crisis on day to day life in the capital. “Many of the real risks and challenges London, and Londoners, will face on a hotter planet are set out,” she said. “But it also shows significant areas where more research is needed because we just don’t know what other effects climate breakdown will bring.” The report found: Half of the underground stations in central London will be “at significant risk of flooding” with the Northern and Central lines most affected. One in five schools in the capital will face a high-risk of flooding. Two-thirds of London flats will face extreme overheating by the 2030s. London is the most vulnerable city in western Europe to floods, extreme cold, windstorms and drought as global temperatures rise. Russell said: “Anyone who commuted through last summer’s heatwave will know how unpleasant that was – these will be normal summers in the next couple of decades. What will that mean for schools, teachers, and schoolchildren during the struggle to stay cool?” She added: “London is an ancient city, and its buildings weren’t designed to keep us cool – and the Victorian infrastructure of our sewers and plumbing just wasn’t constructed with extreme weather events in mind.” The report gathered existing evidence from key sectors including housing, transport, emergency services, utilities, and workplaces and schools. But Russell said it was far from complete as “crucial information” was not available and she called on the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, to work with her to address the urgent issues raised. “The time for action is now. I urge the mayor to tell the whole truth about climate change and fill the gaps this research has shown, so we can know all the risks Londoners face. He must prepare for these huge changes, London needs to be ready.”"

"Climate change is hurling humanity towards disaster. There is no more room to question the science, when nearly every climate scientist is in agreement that the implications of a global rise in average temperature will spell drastic changes for human civilisation. In the face of such a rapidly encroaching threat, political niceties and traditional incrementalism and compromise cannot come close to the level of change and upheaval required to solve, or even mitigate, the problem of global climate change.  Climate scientists continue to stress the importance of lowering carbon emissions significantly, yet they are currently increasing at an accelerating rate. A 2018 UN study found that unless promised emission reductions under the Paris agreement were tripled, they would cause the global temperature increase to reach 3C by 2100 and continue to rise after that. Meanwhile, some of the most influential people in the world continue to deny the very existence of climate change. Even as the relatively tame 2018 IPCC report states that we must cut our emissions in half within the next decade, people are feeling that their elected leaders, and mainstream political avenues as a whole, cannot measure up to this task. The current ineptitude and impotency of the ruling class is unacceptable when the consequences of inaction are so far-reaching. More than ever, it is time for workers – those who will be hardest hit by soaring food and healthcare costs, and by property destruction caused by natural disasters and the rising sea – to exert their power and force the hand of major players (governments and corporations) to avert what is almost certain to be the next global mass extinction. As such, climate activism of all types is blossoming. Greta Thunberg’s school strikes led to one of the largest global climate demonstrations in history. Extinction Rebellion has shut down major intersections in London and held events around the world. The Sunrise Movement caught the attention of the US when children in San Francisco confronted the Democratic senator Dianne Feinstein over her climate policy. Indigenous groups across the globe have been fighting tooth and nail against resource development on their ancestral lands. And Earth Strike is preparing for a global general strike on 27 September 2019. Through all of this, as Greta Thunberg has said, one thing must be made clear. There is no greater way to capture the attention of the public, and the powers that be, than a general labour strike. An old and effective strategy, it is the holy grail of activism. And in such dire times, there is no question that a general strike is sorely needed once more. Earth Strike is seeking to revive the general strike in service of a global, apocalyptic problem – one that encompasses the lives of every creature on the face of this planet. The reason Earth Strike exists is that shutting off the global labour supply will force governments and industry giants to listen. There’s no way to avoid the conversation when profits are in danger of eroding, and production has stalled to a halt. Every day we go into work and spend our time and labour building a system that is burning us alive. The top polluters in the world are directly dependent on this effort. It is time to withhold it. Some will inevitably argue that labour action is too disruptive, and too messy, but that’s the very point. The system causing this crisis needs to be disrupted. A general strike is an exceptionally powerful tool with a long history of gaining concession. In Iceland in 1975, a women’s general strike was instrumental in guaranteeing equal pay; and in India earlier this year, a general strike by between 150m and 200m workers illuminated the injustices inflicted on them by Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata party. We simply don’t have the time to forge a new tool from scratch. In fact, the opposite reaction is more likely. 27 September is only the first strike, and sympathisers all over the globe are bound to take notice. To those who do not feel like they have the power alone, organise. Unions and workers must work together in solidarity. The growing number of participants in this general strike, numbering in the tens of thousands, are already talking about what will come next. For whatever comes, we will fight, and strike, together. • McEver Dugan is the writing coordinator for Earth Strike. Evan Cholerton is the international organiser for Youth for Earth Strike.

"How can chickens teach us about the great acceleration of human activity on the natural world? What can Kate Winslet show us about human survival if we fail to act on human-made global warming? Canberra-born theatre maker David Finnigan last year began what he decided would be a six-year stage project, You’re Safe Til 2024. To begin his research, he asked 30 scientists two simple questions: What’s the biggest change happening in the world today? What’s going to happen in the future?  Thus briefed, the playwright employs symbolism and metaphor on stage to communicate climate change, pollution, biodiversity loss and the planet’s ecological future, to try to get past the defences of those who switch off from climate “preaching” and to give hope to climate activists who fall into “numb despair” over government inaction. He wants the subject to “flare in the chests” of his audience rather than be lost to abstraction. The first version of You’re Safe Til 2024 was presented over the weekend at Sydney’s Griffin theatre company. Finnigan’s new work is in essence a lecture he hopes will be inspiring in its own lo-fi way, which he breaks up by dancing to pop songs nominated by his scientist interviewees as inspirational, including cuts from Alanis Morissette and Faithless, played on stage by DJ Reuben Ingall. Later, by email, Finnigan says he nominated the year 2024 because “it’s the year my niece turns 18”, something he doesn’t explain in the show. “In a lot of ways, she’s the person this piece is to and about.” Neither a scientist nor, he says, a climate activist, Finnigan’s concern with future generations began when he grew up with lots of science books in the family home as the son of a CSIRO micrometeorologist. His father would open doors for Finnigan to talk to other scientists ahead of an infamous earlier stage project, which the playwright perhaps unwisely called Kill Climate Deniers, the satirical story of an ecowarrior attack on the Australian parliament. Before it even had been staged, the title sent conservative News Corp columnist Andrew Bolt into a predictable rage over taxpayer funding of the script’s development, sparking a chain of indignation to rightwing United States media outlets. Finnigan responded by working the punditry outrage into his final script, but not before being assailed with online death threats, such as suggestions to change the title: “What about, Kill David Finnigan?” Despite attempts to muzzle it, Kill Climate Deniers has had a long and varied life, constantly retooled and reinvented as a radio play, a stealthy audio tour of parliament, a performance lecture-DJ set and, finally, a funny, well-received play with a mostly-female cast in Sydney, with Australian comedian Felicity Ward set to take it to London in June. Now, after all the fireworks have died down, Finnigan is back on stage himself, alighting on the humble chicken to illustrate the concept of the great acceleration of human impact on the planet that began in the second half of the 20th century. Consider, he says, that the average weight of a chicken in 1945 was 1.4kg. Today, the average is 5.2kg; a four-fold, hormone-boosted growth over the lifetime of a human being. Over the same period, the chicken population has risen from 18 million to 23 billion. Many years from now, Finnigan predicts, archaeologists will find trillions of fossilised chicken bones discarded from our era. But the playwright says he has learned the lessons he gleaned from the advice of the Climate Communication Project, such as don’t preach about the meat we eat, and don’t overload with facts and figures. He certainly doesn’t admonish the substantial number of audience members who raise their hands when prompted to admit they have run over wildlife – several kangaroos and even one wombat – as a neat way of demonstrating animal habitat destruction. Finnigan then pours some sand through a sieve, just like professor of ecotoxicology Tamara Galloway of the University of Exeter did with sand from the presumed pristine Galapagos Islands, finding countless tiny bright microplastics washed up from the ocean. Each of us is full of plastic more than any previous human generation, Finnigan notes, thanks to our waste making its way into the ocean food chain. Next, to illustrate the future if we don’t act to mitigate climate change, Finnigan asks us to consider the Titanic’s disastrous striking of the iceberg in 1912, when more than 1,500 people drowned, and lifeboats were in short supply. Passengers in the lower classes were much more likely to die than those in first class. The Hollywood film version (spoiler alert) has Kate Winslet’s character, a first-class passenger, survive, while Leonardo DiCaprio, who plays a “plucky young scamp in steerage”, drowns. And so it goes with the catastrophic future impact of climate change. “The human race is not going to be extinct,” says Finnigan, before pointing to the largely white, middle-class audience. “We are Kate Winslet.” Small wonder then that, with our collective privilege, Finnigan finally abandons the idea of being our inspirational guru, after showing some cheesy pictures of children installing solar panels – his interpretation of the Climate Communication Project’s advice for instilling hope about the pending climate meltdown. It is then that the whole exercise clicks. We need to shake ourselves out of our torpor, our “numb despair”, whether we’re activists or people simply not too selfish in a neoliberal economy to care for future generations. We don’t need to panic, nor do we have to be too scientifically literate to grasp the urgency of the matter, nor do we necessarily need stories about geese being sucked into the engines of planes that belch carbon as we head to our next holiday. Instead, we need to lead by example in our own lives by consuming less, voting for those with the planet’s future in mind, and demanding that they follow through by prioritising the environment, reducing our collective carbon footprint and grasping the world as a global community. “You give yourself hope,” Finnigan concludes, and he’s right. “You make yourself useful.” • You’re Safe Til 2024 is at Bunjil Place, Narre Warren in Melbourne May 10 to 12 during the Art + Climate = Change Festival • This article originally stated that the cast of Kill Climate Deniers was female only.

"Where I grew up, visits to Manchester’s Science and Industry Museum were a staple rainy-day activity. I remember the clanking of the huge, iron waterwheel and being amazed by its power. It was the plentiful rain, I was told, and the ingenuity of those behind the technology that powered the mills that ushered in the first industrial revolution, bringing Manchester and Salford into existence. I remember thinking: if this is how far we’ve come in 200 years, what’s the future going to look like?  But the future is no longer such a rosy place, as those who saw David Attenborough’s Climate Change: The Facts earlier this month will have realised. If you see a scientist on TV these days, they’re probably talking about the perilous state of our climate and the threat to our planet’s living systems. From the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to the Met Office to Nasa, some of the greatest minds of our generation are modelling the future, and their conclusions are stark. These conclusions have not been lost on the thousands of school pupils and Extinction Rebellion protesters taking to our streets in recent weeks. Unless we take rapid action to reduce the carbon dioxide we are releasing into the atmosphere, we face catastrophe. The industrial revolution also started a long process of environmental degradation that now threatens life itself. We stopped dumping industrial and human waste into rivers, but still treat the atmosphere like an open sewer. If we’re going to turn this around – and we have no choice but to turn this around – we’ll have to start by acknowledging this for what it is. Last month Labour’s shadow environment secretary, Sue Hayman, declared an environment and climate emergency on behalf of our party. Labour councils have been doing the same. And this Wednesday, Labour is leading the charge for the UK parliament to be the first in the world to formally recognise the climate emergency. Tackling this emergency is going to take something big, something on the scale of the first industrial revolution. But unlike the first industrial revolution, this must be anchored in dignity at work, social justice, equality and international solidarity. The central mission of this industrial revolution must be to stop dangerous climate change and reverse the environmental degradation kickstarted by the first. That is why Labour is calling for a green industrial revolution. Just as a new generation of democratic socialists in the US are calling for a Green New Deal, we too must draw on our history for inspiration, and appeal to the collective achievements of the past to find a way through to what will be our greatest achievement. The green industrial revolution will also bring tremendous economic opportunities. It is estimated that the energy from deep-water turbines in the North Sea could provide four times Europe’s entire electricity demand. This could be built and delivered from the UK – just like that old waterwheel. And this is not just about jobs. The green industrial revolution will make our cities livable, our natural spaces rich and alive, and our own lives satisfying and secure. It must tackle class, race, gender disparities – and deliver climate justice not just in the UK but around the world. This will not happen by itself. We will need a government that is truly representative and responsive to the public interest, willing to invest to safeguard our future, as well as unashamedly interventionist. We will need modern and participatory democratic institutions, rolling back the privatisations that have led to rip-off energy and public transport costs. Ultimately, tackling the environment and climate emergency will require the UK to reimagine its energy system, transport, agriculture, housing – its entire economy – so that it works for the many, not the few, long into the future. Rebecca Long-Bailey is Labour MP for Salford and Eccles, and the shadow business secretary"

Share this...FacebookTwitterResearchers at Germany’s Karlsruhe Institute for Technology have laid the cornerstone for a pilot plant that will produce a new kind of cement called Celitement®. Read here. This new cement developed by KIT researchers can be produced at far lower temperatures and with less lime than conventional cement. It has the potential to save 50% of the energy used during manufacturing.Manufacturing cement, like glass, is a highly energy-intensive process. Cement is an indispensible building product which has made an enormous contribution to civil engineering and to our standard of living. Our prosperity and modern standard of living as we know it would be unimaginable without it. The cement industry consumes about 2 to 3% of the world’s energy and emits more than 5% of manmade CO2, approximately 3 to 4 times more than air traffic.
Not only does the process involve the mining of limestone as the raw material, but also includes transport, handling, processing in rotary kilns, stocking and distribution.
Conventional Cement Production Process
The Celitement® process was developed by KIT researchers and uses new chemical processes during the curing of concrete, according to Prof. Dr. Jürgen Mlynek, President of the Helmholtz Association, to which KIT is a member.
Beginning in 2011, the pilot plant will deliver about 100 kilograms per day. By 2014 an industrial plant will be put into operation and have the capacity to produce 30,000 tons per year. The target is to bring an environmentally friendly, energy-saving product to market as soon as possible.

Share this...FacebookTwitterEarlier today German Radio reported that an uusually large number of dead whales have washed up on the North German Baltic beaches over the last 2 weeks.
Now some believe that a newly installed Baltic 1 offshore windpark (see map) consisting of 21 2.3-MW turbines may be responsible, according to reports.

I searched the Internet for more information, but the story appears to be bottled up for now. The online dnews.de has a small report.
It writes that according to the German Marine Museum, 12 cadavers have appeared so far. According to whale researcher Stefan Bräger:
This high frequency is extraordinary. It is unclear what the cause of death could be, and it cannot be determined due to the extent the whales are decomposed. Researchers believe that it’s due to biological reasons. Young whales and mothers are especially vulnerable shortly after birth. They do not exclude the possibility that the construction of the windpark near the Darss peninsula  may have been a factor.
The windpark was just completed and is operated by energy giant EnBW.

This video link here is an animation of how the windpark was constructed. The video shows how huge mono-piles with a wall thickness of 100 mm are pounded into the seabed. That certainly cannot be very pleasant for any marine wildlife nearby, and certainly represents a major disturbance of habitat.
The issue of ramming huge piles into the seabed is becoming increasingly controversial in the installation of offshore windparks.
According to the Director of the German Marine Museum in Stralsund, Harald Benke, in this n-tv report here:
Whales whose hearing is disrupted or permanently damaged by noise are basically sentenced to death because they are no longer able to orient themselves.
And according to Kristin Blasche of the Federal Ministry For Maritime Shipping And Hydrography:
It has been determined that during pile driving work for offshore windparks – when the foundation is anchored to the seabed – extremely intense shock waves are produced under water.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWith the early harsh winter in Europe and North America, the floods in Australia, snowstorms in USA, bitter cold in China, alarmists never have problems finding creative, acrobatic ways of assigning blame on the most remote of factors (think Tucson and Palin).
According to the warmists, these recent weather events can all be traced back to the sins of man and conservatives.
Alfons Kaiser of Germany’s online Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) puts it all in perspective here, keeping a clear and cool head about it – unlike the rest of the catastrophist media in Germany – and attributes it mainly to the current strong La Nina which is now gripping the Pacific.
The FAZ writes about media reporting on the flood in Australia and other catastrophes:
To keep the interest of the distant audience awake, they are made bigger than what they are. Now it is being constantly claimed that in Australia an area as big as Germany and France combined is flooded – this is grossly exaggerated.
The FAZ then describes how this is attributed to the El Nino oscillations that occur every few years in the Pacific region, and how now a La Nina is running rampant and having an impact.
The temperature in the Pacific is sinking, warm moist air is moving over eastern Australia and the people – who up to now were basking in a semi-arid climate – have suddenly gotten 20 inches of rain within 4 weeks.
Naturally, some researchers are blaming climate change for enhancing this age-old weather-phenomena, a claim that the FAZ slaps down.
But even if this is the strongest La Nina phase since 1917, it doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with climate change because there was a La Nina that was just as strong back in 1917. Not even complex meteorological models can determine how the CO2-induced temperature increase can enhance the anomaly in the Pacific Ocean. For this reason we should not just immediately doubt the connection, but we also cannot fabricate a causal effect where one doesn’t have to be.

Read here (German).Human emissions of CO2 lead to higher concentrations in sea water and thus lower its pH value. The study is led by marine biologist Prof. Dr. Ulf Riebesell, who explains:
This phenomenon can lead to drastic changes in maritime life systems. Calcium forming organisms like shellfish, snails and microscopic plankton, which are at the base of the food chain, react sensitively to ocean acidification.
Cold water  can absorb more CO2, and so ocean acidification will occur earlier and more intensely in the Arctic than in other regions, according to the IFM-GEOMAR press release.
Scientists anchored nine 17-meter long tubes in the Kongsfjord of northwest Spitzbergen. These jumbo sized test tubes held a water column of 50 cubic meters and were subjected to various concentrations of CO2.
According to Dr. Riebesell:
We simulated conditions that we expect to see 20, 40 and 60 years in the future.

As the scientists took measurements and samples daily, they observed changes in the seawater and the enclosed life systems. The simulated ocean acidification led to unexpectedly large changes in the production activity of the plankton with considerable impacts on the release of climate-relevant gases and in turnover rates of important elements in the seawater.
The scientists took measurements and samples for 6 weeks. Every day 300 liters of water were removed from the large tubes and analysed. With over 60 measurement parameters and tens of thousands values, this will be the most comprehensive experimental data set ever taken in studying ocean acidification, according to the press release. Dr. Riebesell says:
We expect to make a great jump in the research of ocean acidification.
Currently the large tubes are now being removed from Kongsfjord. For this job, the scientists are getting assistance from Greenpeace, who have put their vessel ESPERANZA at their disposal.
Greenpeace is on expedition in the Arctic this summer to record the life systems on the sea floor of the Arctic Ocean for the first time and to continue work on glacier melt in Greenland. (Yeah right! Science by an environmental activist group – I wonder what kind of results they’ll come up with!)
The Greenpeace ESPERANZA vessel is expected to arrive in Kiel on July 22. The ship will be open to the public at the IFM-GEOMAR pier on July 24-25.
EPOCA (European Project on Ocean Acidification) started the project in May 2008. The project involves more than 100 scientists from 27 institutes from 9 countries (and Greenpeace). The project will be 4 years long and is funded by the European Commission.

"“Make no mistake, this report will change your life,” says Prof David Reay at the University of Edinburgh. “If the meticulous and robust expert advice here is heeded it will deliver a revolution in every facet of our lives, from how we power our homes and travel to work to the food we buy.” The government’s official advisers the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) said on Thursday that the UK’s net greenhouse gas emissions should fall to zero by 2050, emphasising that the transformation is necessary, affordable and desirable.  Setting the legally binding target, which has wide political support, will be the easy bit. But the scale of transformation needed to meet the target is enormous. By 2050, petrol and diesel cars should be a distant memory, ideally banned from sale in favour of electric vehicles two decades earlier. “2030 would be my ideal switchover date, but we have said 2035 at the latest to be cautious,” said Chris Stark, the chief executive of the CCC. The current date is 2040, but switching sooner will save people money, he said, as electric cars are cheaper in the long run. The cars will need a lot of electricity, meaning clean power generation must quadruple by 2050, the CCC said. That certainly means more offshore windfarms, but the cheapest option – onshore windfarms – are effectively banned in England. Big storage will also be needed, but battery costs are plummeting. Homes heated by natural gas will also be long gone, with the CCC saying no new home should be connected to the gas grid after 2025. Electrified heating will be more common, but hydrogen could be an alternative to natural gas, if it can be produced cleanly at scale. Meat has a heavy environmental impact, but the CCC envisages only a 20% cut in beef, lamb and dairy consumption in 2050, far lower than in other studies and the 86% cut needed to meet UK health guidelines. “We absolutely don’t think there would be support for that [huge cut], or that it is necessary,” said Stark. “A 20% cut seems cautious and prudent to us, but it is true that if you were to shift more to plant-based diets, the [net-zero] target would be easier overall.” The UK landscape will also significantly change by 2050, if emissions are stopped. A fifth of all farmland – 15% of land – will have been converted to tree planting and growing biofuel crops. This is essential because some activities, like cattle rearing and aviation, will still emit greenhouses gases in 2050. The CCC target is for “net zero”, with these residual emissions cancelled out by taking carbon out of the air. New trees are the simplest solution but tree planting must triple from today’s rate, the CCC said, meaning more than 107 hectares (267 acres) a day of new forests from now until 2050. That would be 1.5bn trees, according to Beccy Speight, the chief executive of the Woodland Trust, who said new woods would also help reverse huge losses of wildlife in the UK: “There is a potential win-win here.” Guy Smith, at the National Farmers Union, said it was working towards net zero greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture by 2040. Activity in the North Sea should also switch from pumping up carbon in oil and gas to piping down CO2 for burial. The CCC said carbon capture and storage (CCS) was “absolutely essential” to hitting zero emissions. However, the government cancelled a pioneering £1bn CCS competition in 2015 and has yet to establish a major new initiative, despite the potential world-leading role the UK could play. Flying is included in the net zero target of the CCC, which said there could be a limited expansion of aviation if airlines can cut their emissions per flight, potentially with electric planes for short-haul flights. A few nuclear power stations may still be running, if they can compete on cost, though they are not necessary to meet the target, the CCC said. “Fracking is largely an irrelevance,” added Dr Rob Gross, from Imperial College London. “But a massive expansion of renewables is perfectly feasible, particularly offshore.” With Brexit perhaps another distant memory in 2050, the UK will need greater links with the continent when it comes to power. “The biggest challenge is making good use of this cheap low-carbon power,” said Gross. “That means storing some as hydrogen and a lot more interconnection – it will be essential to share resources with our neighbours in the rest of Europe.” All these changes would provide new types of jobs for people. The UK is a world leader in offshore wind and technologies such as CCS could also become important industries for the UK. “We started the [first] industrial revolution and we have an opportunity of leading the new industrial revolution, based on a sustainable economy,” said Lord Deben, the chair of the CCC. “We will make money as a nation if we do it properly.” The nation would be healthier too, according to the CCC. Air pollution would fall as fossil fuel burning ends, while more walking and cycling and less meat-eating would cut the damage to people’s health. Furthermore, if the world’s nations follow the UK’s zero emissions lead and global warming is limited to well below 2C, the impacts of heatwaves, floods and storms will be much lower. “The only way to stabilise the climate is to achieve net zero emissions,” said Prof Simon Lewis at University College London. “[The CCC] shows that it is possible. The question now is if the political will is there to take on the vested interests that will try to stop it.”"
"Rory Stewart, the new secretary of state for international development, has reiterated his support for the government’s commitment to spend 0.7% of national income on overseas aid. Stewart, the former prisons minister, who was appointed to his new role on Wednesday night after Penny Mordaunt replaced the sacked Gavin Williamson as defence minister, also pledged to put climate change at the heart of his work.  While Mordaunt was an aid budget sceptic who wanted to overhaul the way the Department for International Development (DfID) spends money, Stewart identified the foreign aid target as “hugely important”. His stance stands in stark contrast to that of his predecessor, who believed the 0.7% target was unsustainable and called for programmes to be jointly funded with other departments, and for greater private sector investment. Asked for his response to colleagues who believe Britain’s £14.1bn aid budget should be cut or used to encourage trade, Stewart told ITV’s political editor Robert Peston on Wednesday night: “It’s hugely important, also after Brexit. We have to come out of Brexit, proud global Britain. “Obviously, we are going through a difficult stage, our relationship with Europe is difficult, we’re going to have to make a new relationship with the world, and having some money to do it, some resources to do it – to put Britain on the world stage again – is hugely important.” Climate change was among the most important challenges facing DfID, said Stewart, who expressed agreement with Jeremy Corbyn’s view that the world is confronting a climate change emergency. “People can get into the arguments about the language, but it’s a cataclysm that the ice sheet is going at 10 times the predicted rate and we’ll lose 30 or 40% of species on earth by 2050 … the work that DfID does internationally is right at the heart of it. “I would argue that spending, not 7%, not 1%, but 0.7% of your GDP [sic] on that kind of issue really makes a difference, not just to the planet but to you and me.” DfID has said it is committed to spending £3.6bn on climate change between 2016/17 and 2020/21. The government’s overall budget on climate change over the same period is £5.8bn. Aid charities welcomed Stewart’s appointment. Gavin Crowden, World Vision UK’s head of policy, advocacy, and campaigns, said Stewart’s “experience in this field stands him in good stead for the task ahead” and hoped he would “put UK aid back on track”. “I fear that Penny Mordaunt, at times, lost sight of the real purpose of aid.” Stewart, who was a joint minister for DfID and the Foreign Office before moving to the Ministry of Justice, was elected Tory MP for Penrith and the Borders in 2010. His work for the the Foreign Office included spells in Indonesia and Montenegro. In a reflection of his adventurous nature – between 2000 and 2002, Stewart undertook a 6,000-mile trek through Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran before travelling to Iraq to help write the country’s constitution – Brad Pitt’s production company bought the rights to his life story for a biopic."

"Extinction Rebellion supporters around the world have held a series of mass die-ins to highlight the risk of the human race becoming extinct asa result of climate change.  Protesters in France, Australia, New Zealand, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Italy, The Netherlands, the UK and other countries lay across the ground on Saturday at transport hubs, cultural centres and shopping centres to demand drastic action to avert environmental collapse. At the Kelvingrove art gallery and museum in Glasgow, about 300 activists lay down beneath Dippy, the famous copy of a diplodocus skeleton which is currently touring the UK, for 20 minutes on the sound of a violin. Many held handwritten signs with the question “Are we next?”, while children held pictures they had drawn of their favourite at-risk animals as part of the event organised by Wee Rebellion, a climate-change protest group for young people in Glasgow associated with Extinction Rebellion. Twelve-year-old Lida said: “We want to raise awareness about climate change. If we keep carrying on the way we are humans may become extinct, like Dippy.” Aoibhìn, 7, said: “Lots of animals are dying out because of climate change.” Organisers of the die-in said Wee Rebellion would continue to hold protests until local and central governments committed to zero greenhouse gas emissions within 11 years and established climate citizens assemblies to oversee the changes. #ExtinctionRebellion die-in in central #Lund today pic.twitter.com/mr3ojUZ5e3 The group said industrial agriculture, overfishing and deforestation could lead to food shortages in the UK and serious flooding in parts of Glasgow. In Lund, a number of people took to the cobbled streets of the southern Swedish city in the rain, urging people to take greater notice of what they called a looming climate catastrophe. Meanwhile, in Oslo, about 30 people occupied the floor of a shopping centre. Extinction Rebellion Norway tweeted: “Full stoppage at Oslo City while we campaigned against the clothing industry’s wild environmental degradation. It is the world’s second largest polluter after the oil industry.” Earlier, in Melbourne, protesters held placards saying, “You are never too small to make a difference” and “Species go extinct every day” as they lay on the pavement outside Flinders Street station. pic.twitter.com/L1Q62hqJ68 The actions were part of worldwide celebration at 12.05pm called by Extinction Rebellion Berlin following the protests that began in London in November 2018, which have since spawned a mass movement. A spokesperson for the group said in a statement: “Our ecosystem is threatened by collapse, which will not only lead to mass extinction of countless species, the loss of soil fertility and more extreme weather but will also bring with it the social crises of famine, war and migration. “The small efforts we are doing each and every day, [such as] using less packaging, buying organic food and clothes, stopping drinking with plastic straws are clearly not enough. We need our governments to take their responsibilities seriously in order to ensure a future worth living to the inhabitants of our world.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterAccording to innovations-report.de, a new paper on Antarctic and Greenland ice sheet melt will be published in the Geophysical Research Letters later this month. Its title: Acceleration of the contribution of the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets to sea level rise.
It’s authors: E. Rignot and I. Velicogna both of the University of California, Irvine, California; M. R. van den Broeke of the Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Research, Utrecht University; A. Monaghan of the National Center for Atmospheric Research; and J. Lenaerts of the Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Research, Utrecht University claim the trend is “accelerating rapidly”.
According to innovations report (emphasis added):
The authors conclude that if current ice sheet melting rates continue for the next four decades, their cumulative loss could raise sea level by 15 centimeters (5.9 inches) by 2050. When this is added to the predicted sea level contribution of 8 centimeters (3.1 inches) from glacial ice caps and 9 centimeters (3.5 inches) from ocean thermal expansion, total sea level rise could reach 32 centimeters (12.6 inches).
Rignot’s used two decades (1992-2009) of monthly satellite measurements and advanced regional atmospheric climate model data to examine trends in acceleration of ice loss.
The paper’s abstract states:

Here, we present a consistent record of mass balance for the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets over the past two decades, validated by the comparison of two independent techniques over the last 8 years: one differencing perimeter loss from net accumulation, and one using a dense time series of time-variable gravity. We find excellent agreement between the two techniques for absolute mass loss and acceleration of mass loss. In 2006, the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets experienced a combined mass loss of 475 ± 158 Gt/yr, equivalent to 1.3 ± 0.4 mm/yr sea level rise. Notably, the acceleration in ice sheet loss over the last 18 years was 21.9 ± 1 Gt/yr2 for Greenland and 14.5 ± 2 Gt/yr2 for Antarctica, for a combined total of 36.3 ± 2 Gt/yr2. This acceleration is 3 times larger than for mountain glaciers and ice caps (12 ± 6 Gt/yr2). If this trend continues, ice sheets will be the dominant contributor to sea level rise in the 21st century.
Jason/Topex however don’t show an acceleration in sea level rise over the last decade or so. If anything, one sees a deceleration. One has to wonder if ice sheet melt is still accelerating. It may have in the 1990s, but there’s plenty of data that say it isn’t so today.
One also has to question sea level rise due to thermal expansion. Ocean heat content does not seem to be rising. As far as measuring sea level rise, it is an extremely complex affair that is fraught with vast uncertainty. I’d also be very suspicious of anyone claiming they can measure sea levels to the millimetre. It’s hard enough to do it in inches. That’s why sea level projections among experts range so widely. Of course, that allows a lot of flexibility when drawing conclusions.


There are a number of studies out there that show no sea level acceleration. So one has to wonder where all those gigatons of melted ice sheet are going, and how much of it is being compensated by ice accumulation in other areas.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSo much for settled science! With every new climate study, the science just gets more and more unsettled.
Germany’s Max Planck Institute’s latest press release is about a new paper titled:
Tracking the Evapotranspiration Cycle
Reduced evaporation from the earth’s surface despite warming of the atmosphere
to appear in Nature Journal, click here, and is titled in English: Recent decline in the global land evapotranspiration trend due to limited moisture supply
Nature, 10. October 2010; doi:10.1038/nature09396
The Max Planck Institute press release starts as follows:
The earth’s climate system is complex and is not fully understood. Up to now scientists believed that global warming would speed up evaporation and the evapotranspiration cycle. But now scientists of the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemisty in Jena, Germany have run into a huge surprise: using 250 measuring stations distributed over the earth’s surface and satellite data, scientists have determined that the worldwide trend of increased evaporation of the earth’s land surface has weakened immensely, or has even reversed between 1998 and 2008. And this despite that the earth’s atmosphere having warmed up during this time period. One possible explanation is that the scientists found that the ground, especially in southern Africa, Australia and South America, dried up increasingly, and so less moisture could evaporate. Why the land’s surface in the southern hemisphere became drier and whether this trend will continue is still unclear (Online-Version Nature, 10. October 2010).
The scientists of the Fluxnet Initiative have estimated how much moisture rises into the atmosphere. Between 1982 and 2008, 65,000 cubic kilometers of water evaporated globally each year, That’s a water amount equal to the Caspian Sea, the world’s largest lake. According to Markus Reichstein, research group leader at the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemisty in Jena and coordinator of the study:
For the first time our data shows how evaporation has changed during this time period.
First the amount of water evaporating from the global land area rose steadily by 120 cubic kilometers until 1997. But then the trend weakened significantly thereafter. According to Martin Jung, who evaluated the data at Max Planck Institute in Jena:



<!--

google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




That the temperature increased slightly while the rate of increased evaporation weakened was very surprising. After all, warmer air is known to have the capability to absorb more moisture.
Climate scientists thought up to now that a warmer earth would evaporate more water. However, this appears to be limited regionally. Especially in Australia, East Africa and South America the exact opposite occurred between 1998 and 2008. There, much less water evaporated. This decrease was not able to offset the increase occurring in China and India.
The scientists believe that ground in the southern continents has become more dried out, and thus does not evaporate as much water. Jung warns explicitly against concluding that this is a clear sign of climate change: most probably it has to do with a natural fluctuation that cannot yet be explained.
Dr Reichstein says that the trend must be observed for a longer period and that ENSO cycles may play a role.
According to Nature Journal:
Whether the changing behaviour of evapotranspiration is representative of natural climate variability or reflects a more permanent reorganization of the land water cycle is a key question for earth system science.
The scientists are concerned that drier land in the southern hemisphere could lead to reduced photosynthesis, and thus more CO2 in the atmosphere, and thus more warming. But there is still a lot of scientific that needs to be done to understand what is going on.
Future measuremnts will tell us more, says Reichstein.
——————————————————————————————————
Conclusion: Obviously the models used up to now for predicting future climate have had no semblance to what is actually going on out in the field. They’re not even close. The scientists of the prestigious Max Planck Institute are very surprised by the findings. So much is still unknown about how the climate works.
Note: I didn’t translate the entire MPI press release, just the major parts of it. Here’s a post I wrote in July about the same topic: https://notrickszone.com/2010/07/06/max-planck-institute-report-its-back-to-the-drawing-board-for-climate-modellers-alarmist-scenarios-unrealistic/

"Proposals to replace the EU’s strong environmental protections after Brexit “fall woefully short”, according to a highly critical report from a cross-party committee of MPs. The environment secretary, Michael Gove, said in December that the UK’s environmental standards would be enhanced after Brexit. But the MPs’ report said the proposals “severely downgrade” the environmental principles that underpin current EU rules.  It said the new Office for Environmental Protection (OEP), proposed as a replacement for the EU’s enforcement mechanisms, lacks independence from Gove’s office and has limited powers. The report from the environmental audit committee also criticises planned exclusions from environmental rules, which one expert called “absurd”. Most of the laws that protect the UK’s air and water from pollution and its nature from destruction come from the EU. These allow the government to be sued and fined if laws are broken – for example, ministers have lost three times in court over illegal levels of dirty air. Mary Creagh, the chair of the EAC, said: “If we want to be a world leader in environmental protection, we need a world-leading body to protect it. “The government promised to create a new body that would go beyond the standards set by the EU. The bill, so far, falls woefully short of this vision. “The draft bill means that if we leave the EU, we will have weaker environmental principles, less monitoring and weaker enforcement, and no threat of fines to force government action.” The MPs said: “Urgent action is needed to plug gaps in environmental protection post-Brexit.” The report said the OEP must be independent and “free to criticise the government and hold it to account”. But evidence from the National Audit Office said the OEP’s independence was at risk because it would be funded by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and its chair would be appointed by the environment secretary. “The environmental principles which guide and inform EU legislation and policy have been severely downgraded by the proposals in the bill,” the report said. “They are [also] subject to a number of exclusions and to the veto of the secretary of state.” The exclusions include policies relating to taxation, the armed forces – which are large landowners – and “any other matter specified in regulations made by the secretary of state”. William Wilson, a barrister and environmental lawyer, told the EAC the exclusions were “absurd”. Taxation is important in embedding the “polluter pays” principle across government and preventing environmental harm, said Emma Howard Boyd, the chair of the Environment Agency, in her evidence to the EAC. The report also found the enforcement of cuts in carbon emissions to fight climate change “has been deliberately excluded from the scope of the OEP”, an omission Creagh called shocking. Enforcement by the OEP is also limited to whether rules were followed, not whether environmental targets have actually been met, the MPs said, weakening the power currently held by the European commission. The Guardian has requested a response from Defra. On Tuesday, Gove attended a speech to MPs given by Great Thunberg, the Swedish teenager whose solo school strike for climate change action has inspired a global movement. Gove said: “Your voice – still, calm and clear – is like the voice of our conscience. When I listened to you, I felt great admiration, but also responsibility and guilt. “I am of your parents’ generation, and I recognise that we haven’t done nearly enough to address climate change and the broader environmental crisis that we helped to create.”"

Too bad the data does not cooperate.
Reader Juraj. V. has just assembled an interesting graphic that is a composite of all stations located in Greenland.
Temperature chart of Greenland by reader Juraj V. Composite of all Greenland stations
Although I suspect this is only a preliminary, unadjusted plot of all the raw data available in Greenland, it indicates that it was just as warm in the 1850s and 1930s as it is today. I myself added the blue trend lines. The last 10 years or so even show a downward trend. I guess the alarmists simply refuse to look and acknowledge this, and so choose to journey to the Arctic in late summer to get their melt photos.
Schellnhuber confirmed
Therefore it shouldn’t be any surprise when someone like Hans Joachim Schellnhuber of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research says (2003): after examining temperature records of 95 stations distributed over the globe:

In the vast majority of stations we did not see indications for a global warming of the atmosphere.
and:
Most of the continental stations where we observed significant trends are large cities where probably the fast urban growth in the last century gave rise to temperature increases.
and:
The fact that we found it difficult to discern warming trends at many stations that are not located in rapidly developing urban areas may indicate that the actual increase in global temperature caused by anthropogenic perturbation is less pronounced than estimated in the last IPCC Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAnthony Watts reports here on how a Canadian climate bill just bit the dust (hooray!). We also know there’s no chance the US Congress passing anything, and that the French government just killed plans for a Super Environment Ministry, read here. So what on earth are Europeans going to do in Cancun when the rest of the world isn’t playing along with the hoax?
Well, I’ll tell you. They are going to make themselves look more concerned than ever about rescuing the climate, then they’re going to blame the failure on the US and China, and then act all indignant. Of course, they are all going to look a little stupid doing that, especially if the European forecast for the next 15 days holds up.
While Europe preaches in sunny and balmy Cancun about the perils of anthropogenic global warming and the need to limit it to 2°C , many citizens in Europe are going to be freezing their fannies off.

While Europe frets about a heating planet in Cancun, much of it is forecast to be frozen over.

Expect many of the delegates to extend their stay in Cancun in order to take advantage of the lovely warm climate down there. After all, who is going to want to go back to icy Europe (see above)? Who said awhile back that snow in the wintertime would be rare and exciting?

"The Greens have hailed a “phenomenal” set of local election results in which the party has so far gained nearly 90 seats, including some in distinctly non-traditional Green areas such as in north-east England. In another sign of a shift away from the major parties, independent councillors gained more than 300 council seats. However, even with Nigel Farage’s new Brexit party not represented, Ukip lost the majority of its councillors.  The Green co-leader Jonathan Bartley said that while the party had been building gradually in many of the areas where it gained new councillors, it had also benefited from pro-remain sentiment and from the recent prominence of global warming protests. With 148 of 248 councils fully tallied, the party had won 108 councillors, an increase of 86 on 2015. The Greens had done well in 2015, in contrast to the other big winner in Thursday’s elections, the Liberal Democrats, whose gains came after terrible results four years ago. The 2015 poll was held on the same day as a general election in which the Greens won more than 1m votes, 3.8% of the total. Bartley’s co-leader, Siân Berry, said the party had won its first councillors in areas not seen as traditionally Green areas, including South Tyneside, Sunderland, Colchester, Folkestone and the Cotswolds.  “We’ve broken through on to the councils to become the new voice,” she told BBC News. “We’ve done that through hard work, basically. I can pretty confidently say we’re going to have a record number of Greens on a record number of councils.” In Sunderland, the Greens defeated Labour in Washington South. In South Tyneside, the party crushed Labour as its candidate took more than two-thirds of the vote to become the first Green member of the council. Bartley called it “a phenomenal set of results so far”. He told the Guardian that the gains came from a combination of concerted local efforts coupled with a boost from both the Brexit impasse and the prominence of climate change issues after the Extinction Rebellion protests and the young Swedish activist Greta Thunberg’s UK visit. “You can clearly see the result of that work, but also there has clearly been a natural lift in results, which helps,” he said. “You’ve got that underlying groundwork, but also that few percent on top of that because of Brexit and climate.” On Brexit, Bartley said, the Greens were also tapping into “what underlies the Brexit vote, which was that anger of neglect and people not listening, and the safe seats which never changed hands”. But he acknowledged there was also a direct benefit to the party from disgruntled remain-minded Labour supporters switching sides. He said: “That’s undoubtedly true. We’ve had 2,000 new members in April, and a lot of them were former Labour supporters. It’s the focus on climate, the anti-austerity approach and being unequivocally pro-remain – and that kind of trinity is unique, there’s no one else doing it.” In contrast, it was shaping up to be a terrible election for Ukip, which was fighting only 16% of all seats, against 44% in 2015. It had so far lost 71 councillors, winning only 18 seats. Independents, with their haul of more than 300 seats, more than doubled their combined numbers across councils."

Share this...FacebookTwitterMost skeptics have had a discussion with an alarmist at one time or another and experienced the raw irrationality of their obsession that the end of the world is approaching.
I’m not speaking about luke-warmers here, or even warmists – I’m talking about the climate alarmists, the very people we sadly are forced to deal with in climate science, e.g. Hansen, the Hockey Team, PIK, to name a few.
To deal with them, it is helpful to explore the mind of the alarmist and understand the psychology of doomsday purveyors in general.
When in discussion with alarmists, I’m always baffled by their constant insistence that the world is going to hell in a hand-basket, no matter what facts you present. The more you take their arguments apart, the more they stubbornly cling to their belief. Why is it they insist a doomsday is coming, and don’t want to hear anything else? Why do they crave a climate doomsday? Why do they react to good news as if it was the plague? Seems very irrational.
Unfortunately, what we find in the minds of alarmists and the purveyors of end-of-world scenarios is not a pretty sight, as you are about the see. We are dealing with irrationality here, and maybe worse.
A normal, rational person who is confronted by a life threatening possibility would welcome ANY evidence showing the situation is far less dangerous than first believed. But not the climate Armageddists. In fact, the doomsday not being true is their biggest nightmare. We’ve seen how alarmist climatologists and proponents have mobilized to prop up the doomsday scenario whenever it’s threatened. That’s what Climategate was all about – keeping the good news out and the doomsday scenario alive.
Being curious about the psychology of doomsday prophets, I came across a piece in Psychology Today by Howard Bloom written about a year ago called:
Why The World Will End In 2012 – Is Catastrophe In Your Brain?
It’s well worth the read (some may find Bloom controversial). I think there’s a lot behind what he says.
End-of-world predictions are as old as civilization
The main psychological undercurrent in the modern climate movement is the human fascination with (and wish for) a global apocalypse – a coming climate Armageddon. It’s what propels the movement. But this is not a new social phenomena. Such doomsday visions are as old as civilisation itself. The obsession with end-of-the-world visions is one of civilisation’s recurring psychological illnesses. Today’s global climate Armageddon obsession is just the latest bout.
Bloom provides a number of examples from history. The early Christians believed in the second coming of Jesus, and with him a cleansing of the earth to clear the way for a new order. So did the Mayans and the Aztecs. For the Aztecs it even became a self-fulfilling prophecy. Today, 85% of Muslim Shiites believe in the coming of the 12th Imam, which will cleanse the earth and lead to a world ruled by the laws of Islam. Frighteningly, Iran’s President Ahmad Ahmaddinejad is a believer, writes Bloom.
When doomsday predictions don’t come true
In recent times there have been many cults, sects, etc., and they all believed the end of the world was imminent. The 7th Day Adventists and Jehovah Witness, or Japan’s Aum Shinrikyo to name a few. They made end-of-the-world predictions which never came true. You’d think people would wake up and abandon these charlatans, but they don’t.

For example, 7th Day Adventist founder William Miller preached in the early 19th century that the world would end in 1843. The end never came. So his followers rescheduled it for a year later, 1844. That too never materialized. Did followers abandon the belief? Hardly. Today the 7th Day Adventists church has 16 million followers. Beliefs in Armageddons are not rational, and refuse to die.
Paul Ehrlich predicted also cataclysmic events back in the 1960s and 70s, claiming global starvation of unprecedented dimensions. Today we see just the opposite. The world’s population is far greater and better fed than ever. Have followers abandoned Ehrlich? Far from it. Followers base their loyalty on faith and emotion, and not rationale.
Why are many people hooked on doomsday prophesies?
A lot of people are simply malcontent with the world and the direction of the human race and society, and so it appeals to them that it could get wiped out, and thus clear the way for a fresh start – one that would reflect their own view of how the world ought to be. Many loathe today’s modern prosperity, and would like nothing more than to change it radically. So there is a deep and dark desire to rid the place of competitors. This deep passion to do so  appears to be evolutionary and biological, Bloom calls it the passion for disaster:
Surely biology and evolution must have a greater reason for holding on to such a deep disaster passion.”
To illustrate the dynamics of this kind of thinking, Bloom describes a German experiment conducted in the late 1940s where 15 brown rats, all strangers to each other, were put inside a box. At first the rats cowered in corners, afraid of each other. But over time things changed. Two of the rats eventually paired up and soon eliminated the rest. Bloom writes:
The rats had cleared the new territory of competitors, transforming the cage into a spacious land of milk and honey for themselves. A new promised land. Now, they could found a tribe that might if left to its own devices thrive for generations to come. A tribe that would carry the parental line of genes.
How does this relate to the popularity of notions that the world is about to end? Think for a second. Every millennial end-of-the-world movement has a hitch. We’ll all be broiled, fried, or caught in the crossfire of apocalyptic battles and plague. WE’LL be wiped out. But not the true believers. They’ll be saved. And they’ll have a fresh new world, a world purged of us, a world they can turn into their own private paradise.
Apocalypse-beliefs, I suspect, are land-clearance and land-grab dreams in disguise-dreams left over from our time as beasts.”
The green movement promises paradise, where the climate is friendly and the land is abundant in fruit, and human misery is practically non-existent. It’s about shaping the world according to the view of one particular group, one that happens to be very malcontent, and about eliminating competitors.
Greenhouse gases deliver the hope of a new order
Bloom ties all this in with catastrophic climate change, which, as readers here can tell you, is the very much hoped for fantasy of the alarmists. No matter what data refuting the doomsday scenarios are presented, the radical warmists don’t want to see or hear any of it, as it could disrupt their cherished fantasy. Bloom writes:
One of the most popular apocalyptic belief systems of the last 30 years has been the idea that we humans are bringing the destruction of the planet. The greenhouse-gas scenario is partly a scientific hypothesis and partly a deeply appealing myth. Climate-change-beliefs are a secular expression of an antique pattern…perhaps an instinctual pattern. They are a new way of saying that the end is coming and that only the believers will be saved. Only those who’ve embraced the right god or the right philosophy will survive. Only they will know the truth behind the new world order. And they will do more than remain alive, they will come out on top. They will flourish and thrive.”
Frustration and the desire to see a whole new order – that’s what’s common to all doomsday prophets. They are all disenchanted with the society they find themselves in, and are angry that it does not conform to their view of the world. Either the world changes so that it complies with their view, or it deserves destruction. There’s anger and the desire to punish. Whether that is a healthy psychology to see among leaders, I’ll let the reader make the call.
Howard Bloom is author of: The Lucifer Principle: A Scientific Expedition Into the Forces of History and The Genius of the Beast: A Radical Re-Vision of Capitalism (see widgets in side bar, above right). In the coming days I will be posting the next essay on the psychology of the AGW movement.

===================================================
Is CO2 Warming a Mirage?
By Ed Caryl
There are three levels in the atmosphere where CO2 could act: at the surface, in the troposphere, and high in the atmosphere where radiation to space is greater than thermal absorption. In each location the conditions are different, and the way CO2 acts is different.
At the surface, the CO2 “back radiation” has been a mystery to many, this author included. Some argue that such a thing doesn’t exist, that it is against the second law of thermodynamics. It does exist, but the mechanism does not work very often, or exactly as advertised. This article will throw you some curves, and many numbers, but will stay away from complicated mathematics. Complex math is unnecessary.
First, the basics: CO2 is a three-atom molecule. It can be visualized as one carbon atom with two oxygen atoms attached, one on each side, in a straight rod configuration. As such, it is “non-polarized”, that is the charges on each atom balance, and the charge on the whole molecule appears to be zero as viewed from any angle. Thus, it has only two modes of vibration when excited by infrared radiation (IR). It can vibrate in and out along the long axis, like a rod that has been struck on one end, or it can vibrate parallel to the axis, like a rod that has been struck in the middle.
The vibration mode along the long axis is only excited in an asymmetric mode, where the end atoms move together in the same direction at the same time. The symmetrical stretch, where the oxygen atoms both move away from the carbon atom then back towards it, does not expose any charge, so doesn’t radiate or absorb radiation.
Figure 2. The vibration modes of CO2. From the top, only the 2nd and 3rd modes contribute to CO2’s IR activity. (Source: Chemwiki, UC Davis)
Figure 3 below shows radiation transmitted by the atmosphere. Conversely, that part that is not transmitted is absorbed. Note: only two peaks of CO2 act to absorb radiation that water vapor does not. Those peaks are at 4.25 µm and 15 µm. The 4.25-µm peak occurs at a wavelength that has little long-wave radiation by the earth.
Figure 3: Source Wikimedia Commons.
The 15-µm peak is the only one that is important in the greenhouse gas discussion. The atmospheric transmission at that frequency is such that less than 5% of the radiation gets through a 1-meter path at one atmosphere with the normal amount of CO2. This means that any radiation from the ground at the wavelengths that CO2 will absorb and re-radiate will be intercepted very close to the ground, most of it within a meter. The standard story is that when the energy is re-radiated, half goes up and half goes back down to the ground. But here is the rest of the story:
When a CO2 molecule is irradiated, it takes from 7 to 15 microseconds (a microsecond is 10-6 seconds) before it re-radiates. In air at standard pressure (1000 millibars), the air molecules are undergoing 1010 (10 billion) collisions per second. This means that before the CO2 molecule can get rid of the energy by re-radiating, it has very probably gotten rid of the energy thermally by colliding with other air molecules, oxygen and nitrogen, that do not re-radiate, about 100,000 times. It is true that some CO2 molecules will gain energy by these same collisions, at room temperature about 5% are excited at any time, but most of them lose the energy thermally before they can radiate.
At the surface, the ground is radiating long wave IR into the atmosphere. But, as described above, that radiation does not go very far. Half of it is absorbed in a few centimeters. If “back radiation” exists, some of the energy would be returned to the ground, but on the way back to the ground, CO2 molecules would absorb an additional fraction. That heat is then further absorbed by more thermal collisions with other air molecules. In any case the result is heated air.

This is especially visible above dark, flat surfaces, like asphalt roadways, or flat gravel deserts, if conditions favor, as an interior mirage, as in figure 1. An interior mirage occurs when the air at ground level is hotter than the air above it, making the ground level air less dense, thus with a lower index of refraction. This acts as a crude lens, making things higher up in the background, like the sky, hills, or higher background objects appear as if they were inverted at ground level. The sky or distant terrain can sometimes look like rippling water in this situation.
This phenomenon does not happen everywhere, only where conditions are right to hold the hot air at the surface and where IR heating is high. Any vertical relief, such as sloping ground, trees, grass, brush or other vegetation, will encourage convection and interfere with the radiation, and the warmer air will rise away from the surface. Lighter surfaces and vegetation also have less emissivity, thus there is less IR to interact with CO2. It does not happen over water, ice, or snow. Over those surfaces, another type of mirage happens, a superior mirage.
Figure 4. This is a superior mirage of Point Reys National Seashore seen in the background from San Francisco Bay. The image is not inverted. Point Reys is over 50 kilometers away, and over the horizon from this location. Source: Wikipedia Commons.
A superior mirage occurs when the air is colder and denser at the surface than higher up, and refracts a distant image along the surface, sometimes one that is over the actual horizon, making it visible as in Figure 4. This is an indication that IR heating is not taking place. We know that IR heating will not take place over ice or snow, because both the temperature and the emissivity are low. It does not take place over water because the water temperature and air temperature over it are usually very close. Any heat generated by IR is lost to water evaporation.
What happens to an inferior mirage when CO2 increases? The atmosphere becomes a bit more opaque at the wavelengths where CO2 absorbs energy, and the height where the energy is absorbed lowers slightly. Instead of 95% absorbed at 1 meter, we have 95% absorbed at 80 cm. Only where it is absorbed changes, not how much. There would be little difference in appearance of the mirage, and no difference in heating.
What happens further up in the atmosphere? For that I bow to others. It involves a concept called Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. Tom Vonk has a good explanation here. The CO2 in the atmosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) up to about 100 km. If the atmosphere is in LTE, an increase in CO2 does nothing. It is only at the top of the atmosphere that CO2 can radiate heat to space, and more CO2 there will result in more radiation.
At the top of the atmosphere (TOA), if there is more CO2, there is more long-wave radiation to space, and the high atmosphere cools. Google Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium on the web; you will see many articles talking about non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. Many of these are discussing cooling at the TOA by ozone, CO2, and other processes.
Some readers will say that my explanation is wrong; that an inferior mirage is simply from the surface heating the air by conduction. Air is an insulator. There is some heating of the air by convection, especially if the surface is sloping or irregular, but most of the air heating is by radiation.
There is no “back radiation” if the air is cooler than the surface, because heat (radiation) cannot flow from a cooler body (the air) to a warmer body (the ground surface). There is only radiation upward from the hot ground to the cooler air, which is then absorbed by the CO2 in the air. If the air happens to be warmer than the ground, then radiation can flow the other way and heat the ground, but this is rare. For a good tutorial on the subject of heat flow, go to this site, and download Chapter 26 – Heat Transfer.
In summary: The ground surface is heated only by solar shortwave radiation. This heats the ground, which then radiates long wave IR back into the atmosphere. At the wavelengths where CO2 and water vapor are opaque, this IR is absorbed and heats the atmosphere. If CO2 increases, only the height at which this happens changes. This height is very close to the surface, on the order of 1 meter or less. Back radiation only happens if the air is warmer than the ground. At elevations above 1 meter, the atmosphere is in LTE and increased CO2 does nothing. At the TOA, increased CO2 can radiate to space, cooling the TOA.
Increased CO2 warming is nothing but a mirage.

"Short answer: no.  As reported on page one of the Australian on Wednesday, the Coalition says the country’s largest companies would face a combined bill of up to $26bn under Labor’s 2030 climate target (a 45% cut in emissions below 2005 levels). It says it will “strangle growth” and is effectively a carbon tax. Among those claimed to be in the gun were the energy giant Chevron (allegedly facing a carbon bill of up to $1.6bn), the aluminium producer Alcoa ($867m) and BlueScope steel ($890m). Woolworths was said to face a $77m bill, potentially pushing up food prices. Similar stories appeared in News Corp papers across the country based on short spreadsheets and background material provided by the Coalition. Versions of it, yes. Headlines have claimed Labor’s climate policies could cost anywhere between $25bn and $60bn. Those estimates were dismissed by some of the researchers whose work the articles cited. They spring from changes Labor plans to make to a scheme known as the safeguard mechanism, which was set up by Greg Hunt as part of Tony Abbott’s Direct Action climate policy. Big polluting industrial sites that emit more than 100,000 tonnes each now get a limit on how much carbon pollution they can release. The limit is known as a baseline. There is no cost on the businesses if they stay within their baseline but, if they exceed it, they must buy an emissions offset – a carbon credit – for every tonne they go over it. Hunt implied that baselines would be reduced after 2020 to cut emissions but the Coalition doesn’t talk about that now. Instead, companies have been allowed to increase their baselines and, in most cases, pollute without penalty. Labor says it would expand the safeguard mechanism so it also covered smaller industrial sites – those that emit more than 25,000 tonnes. It would also reduce pollution limits over time, as Hunt intended. To stay within their baseline, industrial sites would either have to cut emissions on site or pay for offsets for every tonne they go over their limit. Conversely, businesses that emitted less than their baseline would earn free carbon credits they could sell – a reward for reducing pollution. There are questions about Labor’s approach that are yet to be answered – how rapidly it would require industrial sites to cut emissions over the next 11 years, for instance – but the Coalition has based its analysis on assumptions that have little to do with how the scheme would operate in the real world. Crucially, it seems to have assumed that businesses under the mechanism would not cut pollution. The analysis seems to works on the idea they would just pay for international offsets to meet their obligations. The Coalition has used two reports to assume these offsets would cost between $62 and about $100 a tonne by 2030 on an international market. That market does not now exist. (There are a handful of carbon markets that are mostly not linked.) For starters, it not yet clear what sort of offsets will be available to businesses under Labor’s version of the safeguard mechanism. The Coalition assumes a flood of international offsets, but Labor’s policy says it would allow only limited use of credits from overseas. Australia has its own carbon offsets market, where credits sell for about $16 a tonne. The market is small owing to limited demand, reflecting that businesses are mostly allowed to pollute without penalty. Most of the offsets are created through native vegetation projects and paid for by taxpayers via the $2.55bn emissions reduction fund. Labor plans to expand it and have polluters pay for the offsets. Internationally, an obvious market Australia could link to is the European emissions trading scheme, where the carbon price is now about $43 a tonne. That’s unlikely to be appealing to business in the short term. Other offset markets may develop but it is also likely it will be cheaper to cut emissions or buy local offsets rather than pay for credits from overseas, especially in the early years. Analysts at RepuTex found the cost of emissions cuts should line up with the relatively cheap Australian carbon market – less than $20 a tonne – and that a 45% emissions target would push down wholesale electricity prices. An analysis by Citigroup reportedly found that total costs for major emitters under Labor’s scheme were likely to rise by less than 1% a year from 2020 to 2030. It is also worth noting that it is highly unlikely Labor would require every industrial site under the safeguard mechanism to cut emissions by 45%. It says it would provide “tailored treatment” for trade-exposed big polluters such as aluminium, steel and liquefied natural gas. It implies they would be shielded from some of the cost if their competitors overseas did not face a similar regulation. Both. While notable industrial players have repeatedly obstructed attempts to introduce bipartisan climate policy, many companies have been planning for a shift to a low-carbon world for a while. Some multinationals including Rio Tinto have contingencies for future carbon prices of up $140 a tonne built into their decision making. Clean technology is getting cheaper. Some businesses under the safeguard mechanism would use offsets but others are investing or planning to invest in renewable energy and energy efficiency. Not explicitly, but it is worth asking. One of the odd things about the Coalition’s analysis is that it is partly based on a World Bank-backed study that found global carbon prices in 2030 would need to be between US$50 and US$100 to limit global warming to two degrees. But it doesn’t acknowledge that the Coalition has also committed to the two degrees goal (and more) by signing the Paris agreement. Should we also assume the equivalent of up to a US$100 carbon price under Coalition policies? Or is it walking away from its commitment to Paris? Media reporting often focuses on the cost of climate policy while ignoring the other side of the equation – the cost of doing nothing. Several studies have suggested it is significant. A paper in the journal Nature estimated warming of between two and a half and three degrees could cut per-capita economic output by between 15% and 25% this century. Four degrees would be worse again. This sort of scenario is increasingly being considered and factored in by insurers and long-term investors, who say they want action to avoid it. Whether political leaders and newspaper editors are listening is another question."
"Kevin Patterson was delighted when he saw the salmon suddenly jump from the Tweed. Moments later, it happened again and then once more. Such sightings have become remarkably rare. “We’ve got to the stage where we say: ‘Bloody hell, I saw a salmon,’” he said. “That’s a good-sized fish.” Patterson has been a ghillie, a Gaelic term for attendant, on this mile-long stretch of the Tweed for nearly 30 years. He gives expert advice to his anglers, and this is one of the worst seasons in living memory. The Atlantic salmon that once crowded the water have disappeared. It is a similar picture across Scotland’s famous salmon fishing rivers, including the Spey and the Dee. Earlier this week, official figures showed that 2018 was the worst year on record for wild salmon numbers, when just 37,000 were caught across the country. When Patterson first took over the Tweedswood beat near Melrose, about 40 fish would be caught in the spring season. In 1995, three anglers landed 19 in one session. So far this spring, his clients have caught two. Salmon numbers have “gone off a cliff”, he said. He now feels sorry for his clients. “They just want to come here and enjoy their fishing. Anglers aren’t expecting 10 fish. They just want one; two would be mega. But it’s just not happening.” If one is caught, he immediately puts it on Instagram, to alert other anglers his clients have had some luck. The low numbers means ghillies must compete hard to attract clients. Times have changed. Now the emphasis for him and his colleagues on the Tweed is not on numbers of salmon, but a nice day out for the clients. His wood-lined cabin, tucked under the steep, wood-lined banks of the Tweed valley a few hundred metres from Trimontium, the largest Roman army camp remains in Scotland, overlooks the placid, slow-running waters. A heron flaps lazily along the opposite bank before landing to fix its eyes on the river. A brown trout breaks the surface. Patterson said before anglers were banned under a voluntary code from killing their catch to conserve numbers, spring salmon, the youngsters returning for the first time to their home river, were the most prized. Rich in omega 3 fish oil, they have a bright red flesh and a fine flavour. “These are the best fish you can eat, a wild Scottish salmon – and what price can you put on it, because you’re not allowed to kill one. They are the Rolls-Royce of salmon. You don’t get anything better than what’s in there,” he said. The Tweed had its highest catch in recent history in 2010, when 23,000 were caught. Patterson describes that as a freak year but, on average, 10,000 to 15,000 are caught every year. Since 2014, those numbers have halved. Last year, 5,510 were caught. The collapse in salmon numbers means fewer anglers are turning up. So the prices charged for a day’s fishing have been slashed up and down the Tweed. Patterson charges as little as £40; he once charged £140 at this time of year. The most sought-after sites have cut prices by 50% down to a few hundred pounds a day. Local hotels are struggling; many beats are losing money. That economic impact is deeply worrying, said Fay Hieatt, the clerk to the River Tweed Commission, an august body set up by act of parliament in 1807 to police and conserve salmon stocks on the river and its tributaries, which straddle southern Scotland and Northumberland. In 2015, an economic impact study calculated that angling brought £24m into the Tweed region’s economy, supporting the equivalent of 520 jobs. That spending has fallen by between 50% and 60% since then, Heiatt said. The Tweed commissioners suspect natural weather and sea temperature patterns at global level are having an impact. Their records over the last 200 years show there is a 60-year cycle in salmon stocks rising and falling, linked to a meteorological phenomenon known as the North Atlantic oscillation, which affects the climate across the region. That affects food supplies for salmon out at sea, increasing competition for food with species such as mackerel, and altering water temperatures. Climate change, which is warming the sea and harming marine life, is making those pressures much more significant. Their extensive monitoring of salmon breeding suggests there has been no fall in the number of juvenile salmon leaving the Tweed. It is just that very few make it back, perhaps only 1%. “Most of the problems we’ve got are out at sea,” Heiatt said. Alan Wells, the director of Fisheries Management Scotland, says each salmon river faces different challenges, of differing severity. In the north, they come from hydro-electric dams blocking salmon migration routes; on the west coast they are hit by sea lice, parasites attracted by large commercial salmon farms in numerous sea lochs; inland, pollution from farms affects water quality. He said salmon numbers across northern Europe were plunging: the rest of the UK, Ireland and Norway were affected too. But in Scotland there seems to be a lack of coherent action by government agencies, none of which have over-arching responsibility for Atlantic salmon. Protecting their stocks needs to be a national priority, Wells said. “The driver has to be about conserving a species absolutely iconic to Scotland.”"
"Labour will this week force a vote in parliament to declare a national environmental and climate change emergency as confidential documents show the government has spent only a fraction of a £100m fund allocated in 2015 to support clean air projects. Jeremy Corbyn’s party will demand on Wednesday that the country wakes up to the threat and acts with urgency to avoid more than 1.5°C of warming, which will require global emissions to fall by about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, reaching “net zero” before 2050.  The move will place Conservative MPs under pressure to back the plan, or explain why they refuse to do so, now fears over the combined problems of air pollution and climate change have risen to the top of the political agenda. On Saturday night Corbyn said the recent wave of protests were “a massive and necessary wake-up call” that demanded “rapid and dramatic action, which only concerted government action and a green industrial revolution can deliver.” He said that if parliament backed the move and became the first national legislature to declare a climate emergency it would “trigger a wave of action from governments around the world”. The motion was welcomed by Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish climate activist who has criticised the inaction of the world’s politicians. “It is a great first step because it sends a clear signal that we are in a crisis and that the ongoing climate and ecological crises must be our first priority,” she said. “We can not solve an emergency without treating it like an emergency. “I hope the other UK political parties join in and together pass this motion in parliament – and that political parties in other countries will follow their example.” The motion will call for new targets on the mass rollout of renewable and low carbon energy and transport, proper funding of environmental protection, reversing species decline and developing plans to move towards a zero waste economy. The plan comes as confidential minutes of a government advisory group obtained by the Observer show how all but a small proportion of a £100m pot allocated to Highways England to combat air pollution “on and near our roads” in 2015 has not been spent, despite a 2020 deadline. Minutes of a meeting of the Highways England designated funds advisory group from last December and marked “Sensitivity - Official”, reveal concerns at the highest level that the money may not be spent within the defined timetable. Highways England is the government company charged with operating, maintaining and improving England’s motorways and major A roads. The minutes state that a “key risk remains of fully investing all remaining air quality designated funding by the end of March 2020. By the end of October 2018 just £2.82m had been invested.” A Highways England spokesperson said on Saturday night that the total spent was now £7.7m: “We aim to deliver £75m of investment, as set out in the government’s road investment strategy. “Since 2015 we have been doing the necessary investigation to find meaningful and effective measures to improve air quality alongside our network; to date we have spent £7.7m, of the air quality funds, including support for the electric van demonstration centre in Leeds, which is being delivered in partnership with Leeds city council, and electric charging points. We are also progressing the rollout of the national air quality barrier programme, and continue to support local authorities with the delivery of their clean air zones.” Polly Billington, director of UK100, a network that campaigns for clean air, said on Saturday night: “This is scandalous. Ministers and quangos have sat on funding that should be used to clean up toxic fumes from our major roads and motorways 700 people in the UK die every week from diseases related to air pollution, 20 times the number of deaths in road accidents. No more dithering or delays – government must deliver this funding urgently to prevent more needless illness and deaths.” UK100 has written to the transport secretary Chris Grayling and the chief executive of Highways England, Jim O’Sullivan, to demand a comprehensive action plan to use the remaining funding, including a major expansion of electric vehicle charging points. As of January 2019, there are just under 16,000 electric charging points in England. This week, Pascal Lamy, the World Trade Organisation’s former director general, will add to the pressure on the government, warning a London audience that Brexit risks damaging the UK’s leadership on climate change. Lamy’s intervention accompanies new research from leading lawyers showing that existing preparations would not prevent damaging roll-backs on key climate change and environmental protections. It comes just days before the Committee on Climate Change publishes advice to the government on long-term climate change targets. Lamy will say: “It is vital that any new trade deal or environment treaty between the UK and EU protects the region’s global leadership position on climate change. Without safeguardsto ensure strong continued cooperation and alignment, Brexit could destroy environmental protections – well beyond allowing chlorinated chicken imports.” Writing in Sunday’s Observer shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey says: “Unless we take rapid action to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide we are releasing into the atmosphere, we face total catastrophe.”"

The German Greens think it is their duty to conduct inquisitions whenever anyone challenges prevailing environmental dogma. But whenever they themselves are asked tough questions on democracy and freedom of expression, they go silent and run for cover.
When the questions get tough, the Greens get silent. This is what has recently happened with some Green Parliamentarians in Germany.

           (Photo source: Wikipedia)
The Greens bully those who express different views
Back in August, Fred Singer visited Germany and spoke before an audience at a German parliamentary forum discussion. Many of those listening found Singer’s speech interesting and even “enlightening”, some even calling the climate protection craze that has swept through Europe a substitute religion. At this forum, freedom of thought and expression had been awakened, though only very briefly.
But this questioning of climate dogma borders on crime for the German Greens, who have become Germany’s new and growing intolerant. They, along with the Socialists, were livid and unleashed their hellfire and brimstone at those that expressed different views at the forum, read here.
These same Green Parliamentarians then presented Angela Merkel’s ruling government with a list of 13 questions, demanding how such environmental-blasphemy could have been given a forum within the ruling government, background here.
Asking questions is okay, of course, but the problem was the particularly aggressive, arrogant and intolerant tone contained in the brown Green query, so much so that it set off a wave of outrage throughout the blogosphere, leading many to question whether Germany was on track to a dark time it once had visited in its history.
It didn’t take long for the Greens got answers to their 13 questions; they came swiftly. First from physicist Lubos Motl here, and then from the German CDU/FDP coalition government read here, and from EIKE here.
The Greens (aggressively and arrogantly) demanded explanations and answers, and got them, even though they were not worthy of any response.
But it did not end there. Those on the receiving end of the Greens’ fire had questions of their own for the Greens to answer – questions about tolerance, democracy, freedom of expression, and how science progresses.
The German Free Democrats present 16 questions of their own to the Greens
Wondering if the German Greens still respected free speech, democratic principles and the scientific approach, a group of Free Democrats of the Friedrich Naumann Institute and other freedom-friendly organisations prepared a list of questions of their own for the Greens to answer, and sent it to the Green Parliamentarians. Several thousand concerned persons have also already signed a copy in the Internet.
Here are the questions posed to the Greens, 30 November 2010,  in short:
1, Are the Greens aware of the 800 peer-reviewed papers that question AGW?

2. Are the Greens aware that climate science is a relatively new science that still entails lots of uncertainty, and that there is no consensus?
3. Will the Greens even send a representative to the 3rd International Conference on Climate and Energy in Berlin?
4. If the Greens think the question of climate change is already settled, then why spend billions more for financing of climate research work?
5. Are the Greens aware of any other institution, except for the Pope and their own party, that claims to be infallible?
6. Are the Greens aware that scientific papers questioning man-made climate change were suppressed, and are they aware of Climategate, Himalayagate, Glaciergate, Amazongate?
7. Are the Greens aware of the scientific achievemnts of Prof. Fred Singer’s distinguished scientific career?
8. Are the Greens aware that Prof. Dr. Judith Curry said: “Man made climate change is a theory and is highly uncertain?
9. Is it the Greens’ view that serious, scientific work is only so if it supports the political standards of your party?
10. Why is it that no journalist has ever gotten the idea to check up on the scientific reputation of experts that are paid by the Greens?
11. What is the Greens’ position on the fact that your politics accompanies the profligate subsidies to solar and wind energy, bought by donations from, among others, IBC Solar AG, SMA Solar Technology AG, Ostwind, Umweltkontor Renewable Energy, EWO Energietechnologie GmbH, Conergy AG, Pro Vento, Nordex AG, Windpark G. W. Meerhof GmbH & Co. KG, Ersol AGder Windpark GmbH & Co. KG, Wind Project Development GmbH, Solarworld AG, SMA Technologie AG, Solon AG fir Solar Technology, AGU Energy and Electrotechnology GmbH?
12. In which renewable energy industries and to what extent have Parliamentarians of the Green Faction invested?
13. Do the Greens intend to continue their constant use of the expression “climate denier”?
14. Will the Greens continue to use public money to encourage and incite others to commit acts of crime, such as vandalizing rail tracks?
15. Do the Greens call protests at nuclear waste storage facilities only when they are in the opposition, and do the opposite when they are not?
16. Are the Greens aware of the point you’ve reached today, when you are asked such questions?
Response: deafening silence
Well, it’s been 2 weeks, and still not a peep from the Greenshirts. And glancing over at the debating-table, we see they have snuck away, bolted through the back door, and disappeared into the darkness.  Their silence speaks volumes.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn Germany, reporting on the Richard Curtis-produced 1010 No Pressure child-slaughter clip has been virtually off the radar.
Still, NoTricksZone reader Ike has found a short blurb at the online Suedeutsche Zeitung (South German News) publication called jetzt.de, which found the clip: ‘hilarious’.
The blurb was written by someone who goes by the name okkasionalsozialist and is titled:
What’s in Store For Enviro-Skeptics: ‘No Pressure’
Keep in mind that the Sueddeutsche Zeitung is a leading center-left national daily in Germany. But judging by what it feels is fit to print, I’d say it’s slipping back toward the bottom of the gutter.
Here’s what okkasionalsozialist of the Sueddeutche Zeitung jetzt.de says about the 10:10 clip:
10:10 is a funny British campaign that motivates individuals and organizations of every type to reduce their CO2 emissions. To make their educational intent more clear, they had Richard Curtis produce a hilarious little film, which in my opinion is really a bit expressive though.
Allegedly too many viewers misunderstood the clip, and so it was taken down, at least officially, by 1010.
So there you have it. Appalled viewers are simply not sophisticated enough to understand what the exploding kids who chose to dissent really means.

Here’s a screenshot of their little report, just in the case they get the idea to pull a 1010 deletion.

Okay, some will say that jetzt.de is only a sub-publication of the Sueddeutsche Zeitung, and so the Sueddeutsche Zeitung is not really responsible for the content – right?
Wrong.
At the jetzt.de website, it is specifically written that the Sueddeuteche Zeitung is responsbile for content.
Obviously the Sueddeutsche Zeitung is not at all offended by the smut, and offered no words to condemn it.

"The Coalition has rated a miserable 4/100 on the Australian Conservation Foundation’s climate change policy scorecard. The scorecard, released on Monday ahead of the 18 May election, finds that Labor rates better on 56% but is held back by “fairly weak” policies on stopping the burning of coal and an “unclear” position on the Adani Carmichael coalmine.  The Greens rated a near perfect 99%, with “very good” policies in all areas including ramping up renewables and protecting natural habitats including reefs, rivers and forests. The ratings are based on a comparison across 50 policy measures. The ACF chief executive, Kelly O’Shanassy, said stopping climate change and protecting nature “are top issues for Australians at this election, according to numerous opinion polls and the ABC’s vote compass”. “Australians are already being hurt by climate damage and they want to be represented by politicians who take the issue seriously and will act with urgency.” The ACF rated the Liberal-National Coalition “very poor” on renewable energy, noting it has made “piecemeal promises for pumped hydro storage” but has no plan to lift renewable energy above 23%. The Coalition started 2019 by trying to bolster its climate change credentials with a $2bn cash injection to the emissions reduction fund but has resorted to scare campaigns against Labor’s policy, labelling it a Trojan horse for a carbon tax and falsely claiming the opposition would tax petrol cars. The ACF labelled the renamed climate solutions fund “grossly inadequate” and said the Coalition “actually support burning more coal, making climate change even worse”. O’Shanassy said the emissions reduction fund “has not curbed Australia’s climate pollution”. “For the Coalition to again offer this ineffective policy as its main plan to tackle climate change shows a disregard for farmers, survivors of natural disasters fuelled by global warming and the next generation of Australians.” The ACF concluded Labor has “fairly good” policies on renewables, including a 50% renewable target, but the Greens were “very good” with a 100% renewables pledge and plan to reach net zero climate pollution by 2040. The ACF also rated the Greens higher on stopping coal, noting the minor party has pledged to stop the Adani mine but Labor has “made no commitment as to what they will do about Adani’s mine if elected”. Last week Bill Shorten was questioned repeatedly about whether Labor will review Adani’s approvals if it wins government. Shorten replied Labor has “no plans” to do so, but has not definitively ruled it out. Labor has promised to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 45% using the framework of Malcolm Turnbull’s national energy guarantee and a revamped safeguards mechanism to limit pollution from heavy industry. The Greens have promised stronger environmental regulators and demanded greater emissions reduction ambition from Labor, but been rebuffed by Bill Shorten who has ruled out negotiating a new policy with the Greens. The ACF concluded the Greens policies to protect nature were “very good” because it wants to end deforestation, create an independent science-based watchdog and significantly increase funding for habitat and species protection. While Labor has promised a federal Environment Protection Agency, the ACF said its plan for new nature laws “lacks detail” and the party has not set aside sufficient funding for nature restoration or wildlife recovery. Many minor parties snubbed the survey, with One Nation, the United Australia Party, Katter’s Australia Party, the Liberal Democrats, Centre Alliance, Derryn Hinch’s Justice Party and the independent for Wentworth Kerryn Phelps not responding. Independents Zali Steggall and Oliver Yates – who are taking on Tony Abbott in Warringah and the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, in Kooyong – both provided responses supporting strong climate policies, including opposing the Adani mine. Yates called for coal-fired power stations to be “rapidly” phased out to keep global warming to 2C or less, while Steggall called for an orderly transition. In addition to the scorecard, the ACF is campaigning in marginal seats in “middle-Australia” including Chisholm and McNamara in Melbourne and Bonner in Queensland. O’Shanassy said as a result of campaign activities 91,000 voters have pledged to make climate change a key priority when they vote, although the ACF campaign does not directly advocate a vote for any particular party."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThat’s Joe Bastardi’s advice. But some out there are sure the warming is going to continue no matter what. “Just look at the models!”, they keep saying. Problem is, models are not data from observation, instead they are scenarios of data that might be measured in the future.
The start of this decade certainly isn’t paying attention to the models, as Joe Bastardi explains in his latest video here.
JOE’S LATEST VIDEO
The 9-month ENSO lag is going to put 2011 a long way away from “one of the warmest years”. These “warmest” years are about to disappear for awhile as the PDO goes into its cool side. Note what Joe said:
Unfortunately, this La Nina shows no signs of stopping, and is going to stay down there for quite awhile.”
That’s not what the models were projecting 6 months ago. Seems like the activity that modellers spend the most time working on after making models, is revising them. Here’s what THE MODELS projected 6 months ago:

And here’s what THE MODELS are now projecting:
The models are all over the place. Huge uncertainty. 
Note the huge range! There’s gonna be a whole lot of revising going on in the months ahead.
Next, all you need to do is to look at the following chart to see where we’re headed on a decadal scale. The warm phase is behind us and we are now starting a cool phase – that means more La Ninas in the works, which means cooler global temps ahead.
Headed back into the cool phase.
Many out there are gonna continue banging their heads against the wall insisting that the warming will defy PDO gravity and the cycles, and continue in the years ahead. Nothing we say will change their minds. That’s why I say, let’s just let the events unfold, and we’ll see who’s right soon enough.
This coming decade is going to be a cooler one – all because of natural cycles – and that’s why I’m betting on a cooler decade. The big climate bet is out there, and the next 10 years very very likely will answer the big climate question. You can join the bet too. Best of all, no matter who wins, it’s for charity.
JOIN THE CLIMATE BET FOR CHARITY
Winning this bet may end up being as easy as taking candy away from a baby. We’ll know soon enough.
And finally, my advice to you warmests who are in it for politics – milk the last decade being the warmest all you can, while you can – because it’s about to get doused with lots of cold water.

"If only the Daily Express was right. That is not a sentence I ever expected to type. “Extinction Rebellion protests have WORKED as MPs succumb to calls for change”, bellowed the rightwing rag. Alas, the government has not capitulated to demands to declare a climate emergency, let alone to decarbonise the British economy by 2025. But Extinction Rebellion has retaught a lesson every generation must learn: that civil disobedience works. Amid the spluttering of obnoxious news presenters, it has forced the existential threat of climate change on to the airwaves and into newsprint. But as this phase of protest winds down, the demands must radicalise. With capitalism itself rightly being challenged, the focus must shift to the fossil fuel companies and the banks. As long as they remain under private ownership on a global scale, humanity’s future will be threatened.  Standard Oil’s monopoly is broken up by the US supreme court. The trust which had been set up by John D Rockefeller in 1882, had gained control of nearly 90% of US oil production. The US joins the first world war and supplies allied forces with oil. President Woodrow Wilson appoints multiple oil executives to war-effort committees and nationalises the railways. Brought together by the war, oil executives form a trade body, the American Petroleum Institute (API) in 1919. Ten years later, another trade association, the Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA) is formed to represent smaller companies. During the second world war, the US government worked closely with the oil industry, putting a federal  investigation into its monopolistic practices on hold. A peacetime version of a wartime committee becomes the National Petroleum Council, an advisory committee that exists today. API hosts renowned nuclear physicist Edward Teller at a conference at Columbia University, where he warns of impending global warming. Lyndon B Johnson is the first US president to publicly acknowledge climate change, calling it a serious global threat during a speech. Scientists at the Stanford Research Institute deliver reports to API, warning of global warming induced by CO2 emissions from fossil fuels. President Nixon signs an executive order creating the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Exxon starts an internal climate research programme on carbon dioxide. The EPA relaxes the standard for ozone, which contributes to smog. The move angers environmentalists and industry alike. API sues the agency. Nasa scientist James E Hansen testifies before Congress that the planet is warming because of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from fossil fuels. The Kyoto protocol treaty is signed. Countries pledge to reduce greenhouse gases and recognise the scientific consensus that global warming is occurring and is likely caused by fossil fuel emissions. Some 195 countries back the Paris climate agreement, pledging efforts to reduce emissions and curb global warming. President Trump announces the US exit from the Paris climate agreement, citing industry-hired economists that call the accord a bad deal for US businesses. Supporting the move is Scott Pruitt, a climate-change sceptic, who Trump appointed to head the EPA. Take ExxonMobil, which plans to pump an astonishing 25% more oil and gas in 2025 than it did in 2017. As that well-known bastion of eco-socialism, the Economist, puts it: “If the rest of the industry pursues even modest growth, the consequence for the climate could be disastrous,” adding that “the market cannot solve climate change by itself”. According to the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, if we wish to prevent global temperatures rising by more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels – beyond which climate disasters multiply – then oil and gas production has to fall by 20% by 2030, and 55% by 2050. However, the economic self-interest and political power of the fossil fuel industry is deliberately sabotaging this goal. Last year, the industry spent an astonishing $124,837,199 on lobbying politicians in the US. During the 2016 elections, the industry spent over $100m on campaign contributions; recent top donors include the Koch brothers, Chevron and ExxonMobil. This is not wasted money, far from it. In the neoliberal era, rolling back the state has in practice meant withdrawing state support and social security for the majority, but continuing vast subsidies for vested interests. One recent study found that worldwide fossil fuel subsidies amounted to $4.9tn in 2013. It estimated that eliminating those subsidies would have cut global carbon emissions by 21% and air pollution deaths by over half.  The tentacles of Big Fossil reach further into the political elite: in the US and Europe, there is a revolving door between government and public sector on the one hand, and fossil fuel companies on the other, with lucrative jobs in these Earth-destroying industries on offer for compliant politicians and civil servants. As Bill McKibben – one of the most prominent US environmentalists – tells me, the primary challenge now is not having the means but the will. “We have the tech we need,” he explains. “The work of engineers over the last decade in lowering the costs of solar and wind panels is quite remarkable. We can do what we need to do, or much of it. The problem that remains is fighting the political power of the fossil fuel industries. If we can do that, we can proceed quickly.” Then there are the banks. Since the Paris climate agreement on tackling climate change was signed in 2016, 33 global banks – led by big US financial institutions such as JP Morgan Chase – have provided $1.9tn in finance to the fossil fuel industry. HSBC is funding the expansion of coal plants in Bangladesh, Indonesia and Vietnam; while Barclays bank has shelled out $85bn of financing for fossil fuels since 2015 alone.  So long as these sectors remain in private hands, they will continue to place short-term profit for elite investors ahead of the future of the planet and continued existence of humanity. They must be brought under public ownership, with a legal mandate to “green” the economy. One suggestion by the Next System Project is that the US government could create a community ownership of power administration, modelled on Roosevelt-era New Deal agencies. It would grant legal authority and funding mechanisms to buy back the energy grid and take over energy utilities. But there are more radical solutions. Since the crash, quantitative easing (QE) has been used extensively, with central banks creating money to buy bonds from financial institutions. Why not use QE to buy a controlling stake in the fossil fuel companies? It has been estimated that the US has spent nearly $6tn on its post-9/11 wars. If it has the resources to engage in catastrophic wars, could it not afford to pay a small fraction of that sum to help save the planet from destruction? The same goes for the banks – except rather than nationalising the risks and privatising the profit, as the state did in 2008, they should this time be brought under democratic, accountable public control. These proposals will undoubtedly be dismissed as extreme, but they are nowhere near as extreme as the fate awaiting humanity. According to the IPCC, we must cut global emissions by 45% by 2030 – little over a decade away – compared to 2010 levels to meet the 1.5C target. If not, the droughts and floods will come, the crops will fail, the seas will rise, the ice will melt, the heatwaves and extreme weather will kill and millions will be forced to flee their homes. What do we value more: an economic system which privileges profit above all other considerations, or the continued existence of human civilisation as we recognise it? A reckoning is coming. • Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist"

I got an e-mail message from Theodore Hadzi-Antich, attorney at the Pacific Legal Foundation, about the new set of proposed EPA greenhouse gas regulations for governing heavy and medium duty vehicles, such as trucks, tractor-trailers, RVs, etc., the so-called HDVR regulations.
Here’s a YouTube video sent by Ted which illustrates what all this means.

This is serious because trucking represents the backbone of transport and logistics of America’s freight and interstate commerce. Interfering and meddling with nation’s flow of goods is a good way to slow down commerce and to cause much higher prices for the consumers at the end of the supply line.
But this is exactly what the activists want. The activist bureaucrats at the EPA, far away in Washington D.C., think that American consumers and small-to-medium size businesses are spoiled and need to wean themselves off prosperity so that the absurd notion of  saving the climate can be achieved.
Ted Hadzi-Antich writes:
If implemented, these regulations could wreak havoc on the United States economy, and Pacific Legal Foundation is taking immediate steps to block the regulations.
In the video he tells us:
And these regulations, if they go into effect, could have the potentially devastating impact on interstate commerce as we know it today.”
These proposed EPA regulations are going to really hurt small businessmen like Skip Brown, and threaten to run them out of business for good. The big winners will be the big corporations who have the capital, connections and lobbyists in D.C.
Government is supposed to be helping people like Skip Brown, and not be ruining them. This is not about job creation – it’s about killing jobs and businesses. You can visit and contact the PLF: http://www.pacificlegal.org/

"The last week has seen environmental activist Greta Thunberg meet with MPs in London, Extinction Rebellion disrupt cities and the BBC air David Attenborough’s rousing Climate Change: The Facts documentary. It feels like we’ve reached a pivotal moment in the climate movement. Readers tell us how it has affected them.  Extinction Rebellion, the School Strike for Climate and Greta Thunberg have changed my understanding of the climate issue by highlighting to me – in a way I didn’t realise before – the urgency of the problem facing us. I have been extremely concerned about the future of our planet in a way I haven’t felt before. While I once imagined having children in the future, I’ve come to realise that may not be possible anymore. I did not fully grasp how quickly we need to act to save the planet – I had a false sense that someone, politicians, scientists, billionaire philanthropists, would swoop in and sort it out before it is too late. Extinction Rebellion and Greta Thunberg have really highlighted that this is not the case. Politicians will not do anything until the public starts caring about these issues and voting in line with them – both in elections and with their pockets.Mairi Jeffery, 24, London This movement has given me great hope. I have felt for a long time that it was almost impossible to talk about the climate emergency; the government has acted so indifferently and there has been such little focus in the media that it seemed difficult to believe we are rapidly approaching a crisis. The protests give the issue a tangible urgency in a way that the scientific reports have struggled. For the first time, my friends and family are talking about the issue without me raising it. This movement has shown me that ordinary people can mobilise effectively and act when our government is failing us.Anna, 31, London I’ve followed the whole climate movement, and I try as best I can to understand all aspects of climate change and how to stop, tax or regulate it. I really hope that things change, but I feel the movement needs to find a way to talk to the normal working-class people I work with. There’s a thousand people working in the same warehouse as me, and I haven’t heard more than one say anything about climate change, and if they have it’s been to make jokes about the people down in London. I really support the people who went to make a huge show down there, to get the media to pay attention, but we need all classes of people to get this, and fast. I do believe that the vast majority will be behind the changes we need to make, but only if they know what we’re up against. They need to be mobilised, not scared.Stephen, 46, Newcastle-under-Lyme I have been campaigning for environmental issues and climate change for almost three years – since I was 12 years old. I have always felt isolated and actually, quite alone. If the movement has given me anything it’s solidarity and hope. It has also allowed me to really feel and express the fear I kept inside. It also made me want to shout louder and become more active. I have been striking from school and I feel empowered – no longer alone but with 1 million children around the world. I feel quite terrified of the future. I think the world adults are presiding over now will be unimaginably different by the time I’m in my 30s. I also feel hope because there is such a surge in involvement and the brave demands are finally being listened to. I thank Extinction Rebellion and Greta Thunberg, you have energised and inspired us to be brave and fearless.Dara McAnulty, 15, naturalist, conservationist and activist, Northern Ireland  I fully support the goal of raising the issue of climate change (and other pressing environmental issues) but Extinction Rebellion’s way is not the way.  There has been some attempt to show that it’s not just a middle-class indulgence but that has only been demonstrated to a limited effect. The alienation of the climate change issue by the campaign has excluded a huge proportion of the UK population, which is potentially very damaging. There’s a very real risk that the smug message the campaign gives out could have a similar effect on the UK as Brexit has. I’m a firm Remainer and environmentalist, but I’m deeply worried that XR has hijacked the issue of climate change to the detriment of any real and proper progress, and we’ll all suffer as a result of that. Tribalism and band waggon-hopping is not an attractive social development.Anonymous, environmental lawyer, UK The movement has been intensely irritating, and the irritations have been self-defeating. I agree with the principle of free speech etc, however, that free speech should not come at the expense of someone else’s rights. So blocking bridges with plastic tents fails to support the reasonably sound motives of the majority of the participants. The protests went on far longer than necessary. It has been damaging to any chance of addressing the fundamental issues. High profile people, like Sir David [Attenborough], ranting on, has consistently ducked the biggest issue: there are too many humans on this planet. I have only heard one pundit in the last five years ever mention population control. If the human population stops growing (or shrinks) the problems of pollution etc also reduce.  The repeated poor and often flawed arguments mean that I now find the environmental movement tedious.David Helliwell, 60, retired engineer, Cambridge For years I have felt quite powerless about the issue of climate change. It has been self-evident for at least three decades, but the political and economic systems of the world are quite unwilling to acknowledge the issue. I have felt fed up, depressed and unable to effect any change to the system.  Suddenly with Greta Thunberg there has been a significant shift and young people have realised that the leaders are not doing enough to address the climate issue. Prior to Easter 2019 I was a bit anxious about Extinction Rebellion and was concerned it might be a cover for anarchists and far-left socialists. But this is different.  I do now believe that it will be possible to convince the political and economic leaders to make the changes required to prevent the crisis.Andrew Mottram, 65, former priest, Herefordshire Throughout my formal education years, and then as an adult, I have always understood the need to protect our planet and its diversity, and have taken steps to do my bit. The recent demonstrations have not changed my views on climate change. The demonstrators do not represent me. None of us are ever guaranteed a future. We have the choice to be forces for good or bad – to be selfish or sharing in all that we do. We can, therefore, help to shape a more positive future for everyone, but there will always be those who feel they deserve more at any level.Anonymous, 58, beekeeper, UK My understanding of the science was sound but the means of expressing it in general conversation was helped enormously by the impact that the protests have demonstrated in TV news programmes. The future is less threatening than it was before the movement was formed. There’s now a real chance that we will be able to face it with concrete proposals for realistic change to prevent catastrophe.Allan Sharman, 75, Cockermouth, Cumbria I am heavily involved in organising the Birmingham Youth Strike for Climate events which has made me aware of the power behind our voices and our actions. Although I would personally not carry out as extreme actions as Extinction Rebellion, like causing £6,000 worth of damage to Shell headquarters, I have so much appreciation for what they are doing: bringing media attention to the issue and pressuring the government to take action. The future will become more hopeful once I feel that as an individual I have done as much as I can to protect my future, and also that the government is actively doing as much as they can.Georgina Nott, 15, Birmingham  "

Share this...FacebookTwitterRahmstorf and Vermeer 2009: The art of mathematical distortion. (Photo source: Wikipedia)
Tom Moriarty at Climate Sanity has done a thorough analysis of Stefan Rahmstorf ‘s and Martin Vermeer’s PNAS 2009 paper Global Sea Level Linked To Temperature, hereinafter RV2009, which claimed sea levels would rise 1.8 m by 2100 due to rising temperature.
Turns out they used awfully “brutal mathematical contortions” and bad assunptions to reach this figure.
Moriarty finds the paper is riddled with gross errors and false assumptions, read overview here.
New studies have since come out that would allow Rahmstorf & Vermeer to make corrections, but they are perfectly content in letting the press run crazy with their wildly exaggerated 1.8 meter figure.
Keep in mind that practically all sea level experts have called the 1.8 meter fígure hugely exaggerated, some even calling it preposterous. Even the alarmist IPCC 2007 3rd Assessment Report projects a sea level rise of 18 – 57 cm by 2100.
Most skeptic scientists project it will be in the neighbourhood of 20 cm – similar to last century. So how did Rahmstorf and Vermeer arrive at such an inflated figure? Tom Moriarty explains.
Fudging groundwater depletion and reservoir water 
First, Rahmstorf and Vermeer completely neglected the sea level rise correction that is due to groundwater depletion, which is man pumping water from the ground and adding it to the oceans, read here. Moriarty writes:
About 25% of the yearly sea level rise comes from pumping water from the ground and adding it to the oceans, not from melting ice. … “Mistaking this groundwater as ice-melt-water in calculations designed to ferret out the effects of global temperature on sea level greatly prejudices the calculations toward higher sea levels in the future.”
RV2009 improperly, but gladly, applied corrections by Chao to account for man-made reservoirs of water that would otherwise be added to ocean volume, thus boosting computed future sea level rises. But at the same time, they conveniently neglected groundwater depletion because that correction would have led to subtracting from sea level rise caused by rising temperature.
When asked why this was done, Rahmstorf and Vermeer said there were no adequate datasets on groundwater depletion available. Now a recent Geophysical Research Letters paper (﻿Wada, Y., L. Pet al (2010), Global depletion of groundwater resources, confirms that “Vermeer and Rahmstorf were low-balling the effect of groundwater depletion”.
Moriarty, citing Geophysical Research Letters:
It seems preposterous not to include a correction for groundwater depletion when its effect is ‘the same order of magnitude as the contribution from glaciers and ice caps’.”
That means that RV2009 overstated the effect of temperature on sea level rise by a factor of two.
RV2009 also used outdated sea level rise data

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




Next, Rahmstorf and Vermeer used old, outdated sea level data from Church and White to model sea level rise for the future. At about the time RV2009 was published, Church and White came out with revised data showing that sea levels were rising more slowly instead, read here.
The new 2009 version of Church’s and White’s sea level data extended out to the year 2007.  More importantly, it also had corrections that drastically changed the sea level versus time for the previous 100 years.
What do these new sea level, groundwater deletion and reservoir numbers mean?
When these new numbers are inserted into Vermeer’s and Rahmstorf’s model equation, and 21st century IPCC temperature scenarios are applied, the resulting sea level predictions are half of what Vermeer and Rahmstorf claim. 
Testing the RV2009 formula.
Moriarty also reverse tested the RV2009 formula by applying it to the best sea level data available, from the Topex and Jason-1 satellites, read here. Note how the RV2009 formula-calculated sea level shows an accelerating rise rate, in contradiction to the actual satellite data showing a decreasing rate. VR2009 is off in the wrong direction.

And when Moriarty back-calculated the temperature increase by plugging in the sea level rise data into the formula, the result is a preposterous temperature increase, proving their formlua is junk.
Moriarty concludes:
Let’s face it, Vermeer’s and Rahmstorf’s sea-level rise predictions come from the forced confession of innocent data.  Every effort is made, no stone unturned, in a quest to wring out as much sea level rise as the most gullible audience will believe. 
 RV2009 refuse to correct their projections.
Rahmstorf and Vermeer have yet to correct their calculations, and are content to see the media continue using their wildly exaggerated projection. And let’s not forget that the NAS allowed such a faulty piece of work to be published, likely because it suits the prevailing dogma there.
Moriarty attempted to bring this to the authors’ attention, but without success. He even left a post at RealClimate, where Rahmstorf is a contributor. Not surprisingly, real science has a way of being deleted at RealClimate, read here.

"A Banksy collector and expert believes a mural that appeared at Extinction Rebellion’s Marble Arch base overnight is an authentic piece by the Bristolian street artist. John Brandler, who owns a dozen pieces by Banksy is convinced the artwork – which features the slogan “From this moment despair ends and tactics begin” next to a young girl sitting on the ground holding an Extinction Rebellion logo – is an original because of its execution and theme.  The art dealer and gallerist said: “I’m convinced about the one in London for two reasons: it’s a topic that he would support, and it’s a continuation of the Port Talbot piece that appeared in December 2018. “The name in the corner is not important, the signature is the work. And this is a Banksy. It’s a wonderful statement and a beautiful piece.” The work appeared at the site which had been occupied by climate activists since protests began in the capital almost two weeks ago. A spokesperson for Westminster council confirmed the work was being investigated but had not been authenticated yet. “We’re aware of the possible Banksy which appeared in Marble Arch overnight. Our officers are looking into this,” he said. Banksy has not confirmed whether the painting is legitimate, and his press team did not respond to a request for comment. Brandler said the Marble Arch piece was much more convincing than another possible Banksy that appeared on a primary school wall in Maidstone over the Easter holidays. “There was a suspected Banksy on a school in Kent, but it was obviously not one,” he said. “‘If we don’t act now, what happens?’ That’s what this little girl is saying. Now is the disaster; now is the time to act. [The Marble Arch piece] is similar to the boy with the flag during the 2012 Olympics. “The only thing I don’t like is that the top of the girl’s head is the same height as the concrete block. Visually, it jars.”"
"Bill McKibben is right to believe in humans (To stop global catastrophe, we must believe in humans again, 23 April). After all, in the blink of an evolutionary eye we have gone from being able to stand upright to being able to fly off our planet, from believing that the horizon was the end of the earth to being able to peer into deep space-time, from understanding how our bodies work to being on the verge of being able to create life itself. We love to compete and we love to collaborate, often combining both activities in the name of sport. We are inherently social and have formed our immensely complex civilisation on the basis of agreeing what is “socially acceptable” and enshrining that with laws and rules. With climate change, where we have gone astray is failing to update those laws and rules to cope with our burgeoning population, especially in our relationship with nature and the functioning of our economy.  There are two actions we could take that would transform our chances of surviving into the future. The first would be to enact a law of ecocide – the death of whose principal proponent was sadly reported in the same issue (Polly Higgins, tireless advocate for ecocide law, dies aged 50, 23 April). And the second would be to change the rules of accounting so that all companies using natural resources had to reinvest, say, 2% of their revenues in the restoration and repair of the natural environment. In Extinction Rebellion and the UK Student Climate Network, we are seeing the emergence of social acceptance that it is wrong to not just allow but to actively reward the destruction of our future. We now need to press for these rule changes that would bring our destructive economy under control.Harold ForbesWareham, Dorset • Greta Thunberg hits the nail on the head in calling for more support from the older generation and for the unions to get more active in tackling climate change (Activist lends support to general strike for the climate, 23 April). A crucial part of generating this support is to recognise that any effective response to the climate threat will mean a massive green infrastructure programme which will generate jobs in every constituency. This would include a labour-intensive upgrading of the energy efficiency of every building countrywide, plus the upgrading of local transport systems and recycling provision. To get support for this approach not only from older people, but also more conservative ones, it will be imperative to emphasise the advantages for small and medium-sized businesses, as well as the investment and savings opportunities involved in addressing climate change. Add to this the concerns of these sectors of society about the future of their children and grandchildren, and this approach should result in a broader range of support for a net zero-carbon future. As such it should appeal to all political parties and so help ensure the urgent demands of Thunberg and Extinction Rebellion can be more swiftly met. Colin HinesConvener, UK Green New Deal Group  • While I applaud the awareness being raised by Extinction Rebellion campaigners, I object to Gaby Hinsliff saying “past generations were oblivious” (Opinion, 20 April). I am 73 and was brought up just after the war. We had no plastic bags and walked to the shops with our own bags. We got 2d on returned glass bottles. We walked to school. We beat cakes with a wooden spoon. We dried our clothes on the line. There was no bubble wrap – we used scrunched-up newspapers for fragile things and also for takeaway fish and chips. We pushed lawnmowers and we didn’t drive to the gym to get our exercise. I could go on! As soon as new products came in, such as plastic and labour-saving electrical goods, some of us realised they were polluting and led to tremendous waste, so I don’t feel our postwar generation should be held entirely responsible for our present appalling climate problems and ocean pollution.Elizabeth EarlChard, Somerset • We are experiencing two protest movements – Extinction Rebellion and Brexit – which might seem to be diametrically opposed. But to what extent do they reflect a shared understanding – that, at least for rich and ageing societies, the costs of a growing GDP are simply too high? For some those costs are represented by the need for an immigrant workforce; for others they are the destruction of the environment. But both movements can be seen as a call for deceleration – a call that traditional politicians simply do not have the language to meet. The empty branding that characterises our main political parties no longer reflects any significant values; the chasms within those parties make that abundantly clear. The response to both these protests – however different they appear – will require a new narrative of interdependence between citizens, particularly between young and old; we need a revised vocabulary to enable new kinds of conversation. Charlotte RouechéLondon • I write in response to letters published on 20 April. I can assure Jean Corston that many Extinction Rebellion members go far beyond using a green energy supplier. We can also tell her that individuals’ energy suppliers don’t count for much if your government’s energy policy is fracking and nuclear power stations. Yes, Andy Brown, most protesters are white but, as I said to a fellow protester, if I were a young black man I would not want to risk being arrested for fear of how a historically institutionally racist judiciary and job market might treat me. Incidentally, the only people to verbally abuse me were white; the many black and non-British people who stopped to talk were all very supportive. Finally, I can tell Colin Baker that, apart from the initial jams last Monday, the police did an admirable job in keeping traffic flowing and minimising disruption. What will be interesting to see is the pollution records for London over the week. Many car journeys in central London are unnecessary, and if we showed some people an alternative way to travel, that can only be for the good of all of our lungs. I did not take part in acts of civil disobedience lightly, but to help protect the beautiful country, and world, that I live in – not just for my son but for future generations.Rebecca FrickerLoughton, Essex • I welcome the contributions from Mark Carney and Larry Elliott (Mark Carney’s warning on climate change is only a start, 18 April) on the role of finance and global heating, but as I returned home after five days on the bridge, what struck me most was the silence from our politicians. Perhaps I was too busy handing out sunscreen or enjoying the atmosphere and music. Or is it because our government has nothing to say on anything? Paradigm shifts in public attitudes and even revolutions occur when the right time comes. Extinction Rebellion have, unlike our politicians, through long preparation and some luck, appeared on the scene just when our politicians’ minds have been emptied of coherent thought, and the supporting establishment (here business and the cut-to-the-bone police) has lost confidence in them.John PaynePenallt, Monmouthshire  • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

Share this...FacebookTwitterLast week I wrote about a Russian-German temperature reconstruction from 1600 to 2000 derived from tree rings from the Kola Peninsula in northwest Russia . The paper appeared in the journal Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine Research, Vol. 41, No. 4, 2009, pp. 460–468, by Kononov, Friedrich and Boettger. 
In response, German media outlets all hollered “RAPIDLY RISING ARCTIC TEMPERATURES!”, focussing solely on one statement that temperatures have been rising since 1990. 
It’s a classic example of how a scientific study comes up with Result A, but the public ends up understanding Result Z, all thanks to sloppy and incompetent communication that exists between the two. 
The press release here  provides the following Kola temperature reconstruction graph for summertime temperatures:
Kola Peninsula tree-ring temperature reconstruction. Source: Stephan Boehme/UFZ 
Here it’s plain to see that the temperature reconstruction shows that Arctic temperatures in the Kola Peninsula have been rising since about 1670. This corresponds exceptionally well with Loehle’s 2007 reconstruction using 18 non-tree-ring proxies for the last 2000 years shown as follows: 
 
Both graphics show the Little Ice Age from 1650 to 1750, at which point a warming event ensues. Then it was generally flat from 1750 to about 1920, and then followed by another rise that took place until 1950. Then Kola tree-ring proxies show a cooling up to 1990. Since 1990 warming has occurred again, but it’s  a warming that is completely within the natural range of variation. 
The Kola reconstruction (1) agreed with an earlier reconstruction (2) done in the area, see map below.  What’s more, the Kola reconstruction (1) was compared with tree-ring reconstructions from other Arctic regions: Swedish Lapland (3), Yamal (4), and Taimyr (5).
Proxy locations used for Kola comparison. Source: Journal Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine Research, Vol. 41, No. 4, 2009, pp. 460–468
The result of the comparison:

The reconstructed summer temperatures of the last four centuries from Lapland and the Kola and Taimyr Peninsulas are similar in that all three data series display a temperature peak in the middle of the twentieth century, followed by a cooling of one or two degrees. 
Only the Yamal reconstruction differed completely, resembling the shape of a hockey stick with the blade beginning at 1900. The hockey stick is becoming an artefact of activism.
Except for the Yamal reconstruction, all tree-ring and non-tree ring reconstructions appear to agree, and so indicate no correlation between temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentration.
So what could be driving temperatures then? The authors compared the tree-ring based reconstructions with historical records of sunspots (Lean et al, 1995; Lean, 2000), and say: 
We found that over the whole investigated period fluctuations of summer air temperature reconstructed for the Khibiny Mountains in the central part of the Kola Peninsula have a good consistency (r >0.50) with changes of solar radiation (Fig. 10), especially for the low-frequency signal. 
In the paper’s conclusion we read: 
The broad similarity between this temperature construction and solar radiation indicates that solar activity is an important driver of centennial to multi-decadal trends in summer temperatures of the Kola Peninsula. 
So why did all media reports holler “RAPID TEMPERATURE INCREASE IN THE ARCTIC”. Call it complete communication incompetence by the media players between science and the public.
The Kola reconstructions show no link to atmospheric CO2 concentrations. It all started with a solid scientific paper, and but then was distorted (purposely?) by a vague press release that culminated in alarmist media headlines. 
Let’s call that press release incompetence-gate.

Share this...FacebookTwitterProf. Knut Löschke, a solid state physicist, who conducted research until 1986, founded PC-Ware AG, and then turned it into a European IT company before leaving in 2009, had some harsh words about climate science and policy in an interview with the magazine Smart Investor.
 This is reported in the German realist blog Ökowatch. Dr. Löschke:
What is happening with regards to the climate hypothesis today is that profound and far-reaching conclusions are being based on pure suspicions. That’s religion, and not science. There are also many other well-founded hypotheses on climate dynamics that allow completely other conclusions to be drawn. But strangely, they are being massively suppressed – simply because they don’t accommodate the political concept of rescuing the planet. That’s propaganda, manipulation, suppression of the freedom of expression and demagoguery. As ‘an educated citizen of former communist East Germany’, I’m experiencing grand déjà-vu.”
Today Löschke is also honorary professor at the Leipzig Technical University, a member of the supervisory board of the Deutsche Bahn AG (German Railway) and a board member of Softline AG.  In the interview with Smart Investor he added:
Rescuing the climate – which is absolute nonsense – and the discussion about energy systems and energy policy, which is absolutely necessary, are unfortunately all getting thrown into one pot and mixed into a formless slop. Moreover, environmental protection is getting lumped with ‘climate protection’, which in turn is only harming the correct idea of environmental protection. Not only does the German Railway (Deutsche Bundesbahn) have to preoccupy itself with the topic of energy, but so do many other large energy consumers. Not in relation to “climate”, but in relation to economics and environmental protection.”

According to MSNBC News here:
Lee said he experienced an ‘‘awakening” when he watched former Vice President Al Gore’s environmental documentary ‘‘An Inconvenient Truth.”
Hey – it’s a planetary emergency, a climate crisis. We have only a few years, or months even. The tipping point is here. This summer’s extremes confirm it. So action has to be taken!
Nothing is more important than saving … the Lions, Tigers, Giraffes, Elephants, Froggies, Turtles, Apes, Raccoons, Beetles, Ants, Sharks, Bears, and, of course, the Squirrels. The humans? The planet does not need humans.

"Nobody could have predicted that a Swedish teenager would shift the terms of the global climate debate in the way that Greta Thunberg has done. Since she began her school strike in Stockholm last August, Greta has addressed the World Economic Forum in Davos, the European parliament and the UN climate talks in Poland. Last week she met the pope in Rome. On Tuesday she met UK political leaders at the House of Commons. That Theresa May opted out of an encounter with one of the world’s foremost young activists is an embarrassing error of judgment. By any rational calculus, Greta is in the process of doing humanity a huge favour. That is because we struggle to give the global warming and wildlife crisis the attention they deserve. We have the science, with predictions of a manmade greenhouse effect dating back to the 1890s. (One of Greta’s distant relatives, Svante Arrhenius, was a pioneer in the field.) We have the international structures to collate the experts’ findings: the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued its first report in 1990. We have some, although not all, of the knowledge and technology we need to wean us off our addiction to fossil fuels: wind and solar energy; healthy alternatives to meat; bicycles and trains. Many nations have laws to help us transition to a low-carbon future. The world has the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the agreement struck in Paris in 2015. But for reasons that are psychological as well as political, we seem mostly unable to concentrate on the existential threat we face as global warming gathers pace (20 of the hottest-ever years were in the last 22) and climate chaos unfolds. Something else is always more important – or more manageable. Even those who recognise that we must use all the tools at our disposal, to stop emitting greenhouse gases as soon as possible, struggle to be heard. Thanks in no small part to the eye-catching tactic of the school strike, over the past nine months the movement spearheaded by Greta Thunberg has cut through. Green activists and scholars have spoken for years of the generational injustice of climate change. The school strikers belong to a 21st-century generation who have either taken this idea on, or arrived at it through a process of deduction of their own. Greta, who believes her outlook has been influenced by her autism, says she learned about climate change at school aged eight, and became depressed at 11. By 15, her angst had translated itself into a distinctive form of civil disobedience – the Friday school strikes which spread around the world. Hints that Greta has been manipulated by adults appear to be unfounded. As a teenager, she is in any case entitled to advice. And while it is natural to focus on her as a figurehead, the movement does not depend on her. As she told the audience at a Guardian Live event on Monday, she does not see herself as a leader, but as a participant. How the wave of demonstrations she helped start develops will be fascinating, as will the progress of the Extinction Rebellion protesters. Peaceful protest and activism are vital to democracy. The climate crisis makes them urgent and necessary. But decision-making requires processes and structures. This is not easy, and partly explains why so many of the successful civil disobedience campaigns of the past have been shaped by charismatic individuals. The school strikers’ message, similar to the extinction rebels, is that we should panic. Our house, in Greta’s memorable phrase, is on fire. We must embrace “cathedral thinking” – laying the foundations for the carbon-free future without knowing how we are going to paint the roof. This way of thinking does induce fear. But since doing nothing is not an option, except for nihilists and misanthropes, the rest of us have little choice but to battle through these darker emotions – and act with hope. The IPCC said last year that the next 12 years are critical, a warning echoed on the BBC by David Attenborough in a landmark documentary last week. The film should have been made a decade ago. We should have been alert to the dangers before children went on strike. But we still have some time."

Sangat sulit untuk diintimidasi jika Anda tidak tahu. Atau bahkan tidak dapat melihat lawan Anda dalam bermain. Hal ini juga menciptakan peluang untuk berteman melalui ruang obrolan jika diinginkan. Hal ini bukan cara eksklusif untuk bermain permainan online. Tetapi Anda cenderung lebih nyaman terlibat dalam forum online dalam pokerqq.
Dalam bermain online juga menawarkan kesempatan untuk memainkan beberapa tabel sekaligus. Pemain pokerqq online yang berpengalaman akan segera merasa bosan jika fokus hanya pada satu meja meskipun mereka adalah game yang sangat cepat dibandingkan dengan permainan langsung.
Sebentar lagi mereka akan bermain 2 sampai 4 meja pada saat yang bersamaan. Tetap fokus pada banyak lawan dan jepit akan membantu Anda belajar untuk melakukan banyak tugas. Ini akan sangat membantu Anda ketika bergabung dengan tabel langsung, karena tidak ada seorang pun yang bisa membantu menghitung semua angka-angka itu dan semuanya harus terus masuk ke dalam kepala Anda. Ketahui informasi terlengakpnya mengenai permainan pokerqq online di http://www.ligaqq.com/.
Tetap Diinformasikan
Perbedaan penting lainnya dari dunia digital ke dunia nyata sebenarnya adalah aspek digital dari permainan online. Saat bermain di ruang poker online, Anda akan diberikan banyak informasi berbeda seperti jumlah chip Anda dan jumlah chip lawan.
Mungkin juga ada berbagai statistik yang ditampilkan tentang lawan Anda seperti peringkat, berapa kali masing-masing telah dilipat, berapa kali mereka mencuri pot dalam permainan pokerqq dll. Semua data yang tersedia ini membuat perbedaan besar ketika datang untuk menghitung peluang dan membantu dalam Anda keputusan ketika All In yang ditakuti diumumkan.
Jadi Mana yang Terbaik, Pokerqq Online atau Poker Offline?
Namun dalam permainan poker offline, Anda harus mempertahankan angka-angka ini di kepala Anda. Sampai tingkat tertentu jika Anda ingin mempertahankan keunggulan ini dalam permainan. Bahkan di ruang poker langsung terbaik, saya telah melihat banyak pemain yang melebih-lebihkan tumpukan lawan mereka atau salah menilai jumlah chip dalam pot.
Di kasino, Anda akan sering mendengar pemain bertanya kepada dealer berapa banyak chip yang ada. Ini akan berubah menjadi permainan yang panjang, yang tidak mungkin dimainkan secara online, karena putarannya diatur secara kaku.
Sekali lagi ini memberikan keunggulannya sendiri pada permainan, karena beberapa pemain akan menggunakan taktik ini untuk membuat orang lain frustrasi untuk melakukan gerakan yang ceroboh. Ini adalah salah satu kelemahan utama ketika Anda bermigrasi dari bermain langsung.  Pemain online jarang mendapatkan kesempatan untuk mengembangkan kesabaran mereka, terutama karena banyak pemain sering bermain empat meja sekaligus.
Ada juga keuntungan tertentu untuk bermain online ketika datang ke turnamen bermain. Online, Anda bisa mendaftar di turnamen mana pun yang Anda inginkan, jika Anda dapat membayar biaya masuk tentunya. Ukuran, tanpa batas, biaya masuk, taruhan tinggi, ini semua adalah pilihan yang Anda inginkan.
Turnamen lokal oleh kasino favorit Anda akan selalu tersedia untuk Anda, tetapi turnamen itu tidak sesering dan dapat diakses seperti saat bermain online. Juga fakta bahwa Anda berada di zona nyaman bukan lingkungan asing akan sangat membantu meningkatkan kepercayaan diri Anda. Plus Anda bisa bermain tanpa celana jika itu yang Anda sukai.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe September Arcus Sea Ice Forecast, August Report, is out, and quite naturally, the doom and gloom projections of a death spiral have returned to the closet, at least until next June.
The mean of the 16 projections provided by scientists is 4.9 +/- 0.51 million square kilometers, which is likely to be lower than what the final result will end up being.  The July Report  outlook was 4.8 +/- 0.62 million square kilometers. Even that knucklehead Wilson sobered up and realised that his July projection of 1.o million square kilometres was perhaps just a tad too low.
The June report outlook is shown below for comparison.
Why not make a projection for next year? NOAA is forecasting  a brutally cold Arctic winter, meaning colder than normal, La Nina is strengthening, and the major ocean cycles have switched. These all point to more ice for next year. I’ll project 5.75 million square kilometers for September 2011. That’s what my top secret super model says.  (PS: Don’t tell my wife!).

"Five weeks after historic flooding in the midwest, waters still cover pasturelands, corn and soybean fields. Much of the water has receded, but rivers still run high and washed out roads force people to take long detours. Residents in Missouri are putting their ruined possessions on the street and corn stalks heaped by floodwaters look like snowdrifts in the fields. In March, more than 450,000 hectares (1.1m acres) of cropland and 34,000 hectares of pastureland flooded, according to an analysis of government and satellite data, prompting governors from Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, Wisconsin and Minnesota to declare states of emergency.  In all, the damage could cost the country more than $3bn (£2.3bn). Farmers and ranchers are still tallying the number of bushels and heads of cattle lost. And though the damage is unlikely to immediately affect the national or international price of grain and meat, the farmers who experienced the loss will feel the pinch. “We’re talking about an event here of historic proportions, circumstances that nobody ever recalls ever happening in their lifetime,” said Steve Wellman, the Nebraska Department of Agriculture director and third-generation farmer. The “bomb cyclone” – an intense winter storm – that swept through the US in March followed record-breaking cold in January and unprecedented snow in February. Huge blocks of loose ice jammed waterways, and the Missouri river swelled, topping levees in four states, and breaking dams. Climate change, experts say, is altering the landscape for the American farmer. Climate models predict more extreme weather patterns in the midwest over the coming decades that may further damage small-scale commodity and meat producers, making it more difficult for them to make a profit as hurdles mount. The threat of more flooding still looms over the region. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts that snowmelt could inundate rivers as the spring wears on. As these events happen more frequently, “it will be tougher for producers to stay in business long-term”, said Scott Brown, an associate extension professor at the College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources and the University of Missouri-Columbia. Federal farm assistance programmes, he said, probably won’t save the hardest hit. The extreme weather, which occurred during calving season, whisked newborns into freezing waters, and ice jams broke the legs of cattle. Floodwaters seeped into bins where farmers stored grain ready for sale, the soybeans inside expanding until the containers exploded in slow motion. “That will all have to be destroyed because it’s contaminated,” said Blake Hurst, a farmer and president of the Missouri Farm Bureau of the wet grain. “It’s a mess.” Though uncounted bushels of grain were ruined, a large surplus of the crop still sits on higher ground or in bins elsewhere. In the last few years, farmers and ranchers in the midwest have had record yields. Crop production in Nebraska alone, the third largest corn-producing state in the country behind Iowa and Illinois, reached $8.8bn last year. Adam Meyerkorth owns a crop dusting business and helps on his dad’s 800-hectare corn and soybean farm in north-west Missouri’s Atchison county. He said he could be feeling the flood’s effects all year. More than 95% of the farm is still submerged and is likely to stay that way until the US Army Corps can repair the levee along the Missouri river. For now, Meyerkorth and his family of five are staying at the municipal airport. “The general public, when they hear ‘flood’, they hear, ‘Water up, water down – you go in, you fix it, and get back to life.’ Well, we could be displaced for nine months or more,” he said. “This one happened 16 March and we could be looking at September or October before we can physically drive back in, turn power on, and start cleaning everything back up.” Though consumers are unlikely to feel the immediate impact, the floods came fast on hard times for American farmers. In 2018, bankruptcies of midwestern farms were up 19% from the year before, the American Farm Bureau reported. Incomes have fallen by more than half over the last five years thanks to the high quantities of grain on the market. Tariffs from China, Mexico and Canada on American meat and dairy products, in response to President Trump’s tariffs, have also made trade sluggish. Many farmers hoping for higher prices stockpiled grain on their land. Destroyed roads and bridges make getting grain to feed cattle more costly. Some farmers may not be able to plant their crop this year because the land is either too wet or still underwater. “You can draw a scenario where a substantial number of farmers will go out of business if all the breaks go the wrong way,” said Hurst. “It’s too early to tell how many people will lose their farms.” For those farmers and ranchers who felt the brunt of the flooding, government programmes exist to help manage their losses. If a farmer can’t plant this year, crop insurance can pay up to 60% of what a farmer would have made. States and towns will have to fix broken levees, however, before a farmer can purchase insurance for next year’s crop. And no programme exists for stored grain lost in a flood. For ranchers, the Department of Agriculture’s Livestock Indemnity Program pays ranchers for cattle lost in a natural disaster. It will take up to a year, though, for ranchers to see how this event changed their herd sizes or profits because calves won’t go to market for another year, and illness could still affect the herd. “It’s the local issues that are the most important when we think about what’s happened from a flooding standpoint,” said Brown. “For those directly affected, what’s already a tough situation becomes a lot harder.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterNot long ago environmentalists stridently demanded mankind stop its addiction to fossil fuels and convert to renewable energy sources, like wind power. And so some countries did just that. But now we’re finding out that environmentalists don’t like that either.Today Der Spiegel online reports that environmentalists are going to court and challenging almost every planned windpark project under the sun, now claiming they are a threat to birds and wildlife.
For example in 2007 the company Neue Energie Berlin GmbH was getting ready to install Hamburg’s first windpark in an industrial zone called Pankow-Nord. It seemed like a model project for responsible energy production. But before too long, the project ended up getting challenged in court. The environmental protection group called Nabu filed a lawsuit claiming the planned 180-meter tall windmills endangered the only two remaining red kite bird pairs in the city. The project was halted.
Eventually, the court decided the birds were not at risk and gave the project the green light. The nests after all were three kilometres from the construction site. The case clearly illustrates that not only are windparks riddled with technical probelms as reported read here, but also face huge, costly legal obstacles.
Because windparks generally are situated out in the countryside, conflicts with natural wildlife habitats are inevitable. Environmental lawsuits against planned windparks are mounting and threatening to throw sand into Germany’s vision of a green future. Indeed, according to Der Spiegel, Germany’s Minister for Environment Norbert Röttgen warns:
That of all things, precisely the environmental activists are putting plans to expand renewable energy at risk.
The exasperated Minister Röttgen then demands

…that the German environmental organisations put forth their own plans as to how they think wind energy and biomass plants are to be intensified without billions of euros in investments getting blocked by ecological objections.
Currently environmentalists are barricading against government plans for further expansion of windparks in the North Sea. Already 4400 square kilometers of sea area are now planned for offshore windparks. But environmentalists now cite dangers to sea birds and whales. Der Spiegel writes:
A total of 95 offshore-parks are planned to be built in Germany’s so-called  Excluded Business Zones  and thus will seriously encroach on the living space of protected species such as the red-throated and Arctic divers. Even the Federal Office for Nature Protection says the birds will respond by making a wide circle around the windmills. There’s also a danger that construction noise will harm the protected common porpoise.
The regulators at the Federal Office for Nature Protection say:
For this reason not every place in the Excluded Business Zone will be permitted.
So indeed it looks like billions of euros emarked for investment in wind energy are about to hit the big green legal wall.

"Microsoft has joined a conservative-led group that demands fossil fuel companies be granted legal immunity from attempts to claw back damages from the climate change they helped cause. The stated goals of the Climate Leadership Council (CLC) include a $40-a-ton fee on carbon dioxide emissions in return for the gutting of current climate change regulations and “protecting companies from federal and state tort liability for historic emissions”.  Microsoft has become the first technology company to join the CLC, which includes oil giants BP, ExxonMobil, Shell, Total and ConocoPhillips among its founding members. Handing legal immunity to these oil companies would squash a cavalcade of recent climate lawsuits launched by cities and counties across the US, including one by King county, Washington, where Microsoft is based. “When Microsoft is underwater it should ask itself if this is a good deal,” said Matthew Pawa, a lawyer representing King county, which includes Seattle, in its lawsuit against five major oil companies. Pawa also represents New York City in its suing of the same five firms – BP, Exxon Mobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Shell. “Microsoft and other tech companies have been looking for a whizz-bang technocratic solution to climate change and they think this is it,” he said. “But they don’t know what they are doing. This is a raw deal that would stick taxpayers with the bill for decades of carbon pollution. It’s much like the NRA trying to get Congress to give them a free pass from our system of legal justice.” Facing rising costs from sea level rise, storms and heatwaves, a growing band of elected officials from across the US have turned to the courts to force fossil fuel producers to pay compensation to ameliorate the escalating damages. Many of these claims point out that firms like Exxon privately knew of the consequences of climate change for at least 40 years, long before it was a public issue, only to deny the problem and block meaningful action to address it. This raft of legal action – waged by places including Rhode Island, San Francisco and Baltimore – would be nullified under the CLC plan, which was drawn up by veteran Republicans James Baker and George Shultz, both former secretaries of state, and backed by former Federal Reserve chairs Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen. Citing the need for a “much-needed bipartisan climate breakthrough”, the CLC is lobbying Congress for a gradually rising tax on CO2 emissions, with the proceeds returned directly to Americans. Under the plan, this would enable regulations on coal-fired power plants to be scrapped and fossil fuel companies to be legally inoculated from any legal ramifications. “The details of our plan are being developed by the largest and most diverse climate coalition ever assembled with the single focus of finding a bipartisan solution to the greatest environmental challenge of our time,” said Greg Bertelsen, senior vice-president of the Climate Leadership Council. Microsoft has said it was motivated to join the CLC due to its support for a price on carbon, which it has backed in Washington state and sees as a key method to drive down emissions. The tech company already charges itself an internal $15-a-ton carbon fee on everything from employee travel to electricity used on its premises. By next year, Microsoft expects its data centers will use 60% renewable energy. “We are getting extremely impatient, frankly, for policy action on climate change,” Lucas Joppa, chief environmental officer at Microsoft, told the Guardian. “We support a carbon fee because we believe it’s a policy mechanism that works and accords with economic principles. For us, joining the CLC gives us the opportunity to have this debate at a federal level.” Joppa would not be drawn, however, on Microsoft’s support for the idea of handing legal immunity to fossil fuel producers. “There are a lot of details involved and we are interested in being part of the conversation,” he said. “The devil is in the detail. We are looking to take an inclusive approach. We need to transition away from the use of fossil fuels but that isn’t going to happen without the inclusion of the fossil fuel sector.” Aside from Microsoft, the CLC’s member companies include Unilever, Pepsico and Johnson & Johnson. A handful of environmental organizations also back the plan, including WWF and the Nature Conservancy. But other green groups have been sharply critical of the CLC and what they see as a problematic relationship between large oil companies and technology firms, in particular. Last month, more than 6,000 Amazon employees wrote to its chief executive, Jeff Bezos, and the company board to lambast Amazon’s offering of web services to oil and gas companies and its vague plan to reach 100% renewable energy. Google and Microsoft also offer a range of technologies for fossil fuel companies, with both businesses recently criticized for co-sponsoring a conference that featured groups that deny the science of climate change. “Microsoft is throwing King county taxpayers under the bus by endorsing the Baker-Schultz-Exxon proposal that would void the county’s lawsuit against Exxon, leaving King county residents on the hook for all the costs of climate adaptation,” said Richard Wiles, director of the Center for Climate Integrity. “The Baker-Schultz-Exxon plan is lipstick on a pig, or worse, and Microsoft’s endorsement doesn’t earn them any real climate kudos.” Putting a price on carbon is viewed by proponents as the most effective way of both slashing emissions and garnering support among Republicans who have refused to address the existential threat of climate change. The concept was bolstered last year by the Nobel prize committee, which handed its economics award to Yale’s William Nordhaus, who has long called for a tax on emissions. There is evidence that any carbon fee would have to be ratcheted up swiftly in order to change behaviour and transition the world away from fossil fuels. A landmark report by the UN last year estimated that governments would need to impose carbon prices of $135 to $5,500 a ton by 2030 to help avoid disastrous climate change, with this figure ballooning to $27,000 a ton by the end of the century."

UN Climate Chief Christiana Figueres says a general framework will have to be hammered out in Cancun, one that will lead to a treaty later in the future. Efforts to sign a treaty in Cancun will not be attempted.
Der Spiegel reports that the gridlock in the negotiations resulted from disputes between China and USA.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAnke Richter of Der Spiegel has a piece on tourism at the epicentre of climate change catastrophe: the islands of Tuvalu. According to Der Spiegel, the small group of islands is milking the catastrophe scenario for all it’s worth. Call it Tuvalu-gate.
The tiny islands may disappear under the rising oceans in just the matter of a few decades, so it is claimed. Book now and travel to Tuvalu and see a sinking island for yourself! Catastrophe tourists are now jetting in to the Tuvalu island of Funafuti.

5000 people live on just a few square kilometers on the island of Fogafale, the inhabited island of the Funafuti atoll. The remaining 5000 Tuvalu inhabitants are spread out on the other atolls and islands, which are accessible only by boat.
A paradise it is not. Groups of tourists check into the only hotel on the island. Behind its courtyard one finds rotting garbage between the stones. It reeks of raw sewage. The lukewarm shallow lagoon is littered with broken bottles and cans. Eco-tourism seems as remote as it could get.
But don’t bother with that. Tuvalu is raking in the money with climate catastrophe. Tuvalu even has its own Climate Change Official who telephones and organises tours, interviews, studies or projects for climate journalists and tourists. Even though no one is in danger on the islands, the PR machine needs to tell a different story, describes Der Spiegel.
One main attraction for climate catastrophe tourists  is beach erosion. Uprooted palm trees, bleached by the sun, lay on the coral beach like corpses as tourists snap photos from every angle.
Another sight is the island of Tepuka Savilivili, which, writes Der Spiegel, is the Ground Zero of the south seas: a barren moonscape.  But don’t mention that three typhoons wiped out the island’s vegetation back in 1997. That’s just a minor detail. The day trip out to the island costs $200 – catastrophe tourism pays big.
Afafoa Irata, State Secretary in the Foreign Ministry freely admits it:
 We’re sensationalizing the topic.
The Japanese are especially attracted to the islands. Der Spiegel writes:
No where has the “sinking” of Tuvalu captured more interest than in Japan. Every year in February, when the annual spring flood hits and temporarily divides the island for a short time, an Asian camera-team storms the island. “They always film the same thing over and over, they always ask the same questions”, says Shozo Tsunashima, who works for a Japanese NGO in Tuvalu. “Indeed all the hype is completely beyond reality.”
As the circus takes place, the island inhabitants wonder what all the fuss is about. Focus on other real problems is non-existent. Westerners don’t care at all about the rampant problems of alcohol, diabetes, violence. corruption and pollution.
Der Spiegel writes:

The international audience hears nothing about that.
Instead a media sympathy crusade is being conducted. The propaganda machine is humming. Four years ago then Tuvalu Prime Minister claimed before a UN assembly that the climatic threat for his people was like a slow and insidious form of terrorism. One of his predecessors even called it “genocide through environmental destruction”.
That’s the way to attract international funding.
Not surprisingly, what is being conveyed to the world has nothing to do with reality. Many of the islands are in fact growing a couple of millimeters annually. The situation is the same for all the atolls.
Arthur Webb is coastal specialist at the geoscientific organisation of Sopac in Fiji and says much of it has to do with decadal tidal cycles. Erosion is a natural process that has always existed. The sea takes away the beach at some places and deposits it elsewhere.
Webb says;
Surely climate change is a big problem. But that’s not all that is going on in Tuvalu. That’s only a part of it . The atolls are constantly changing. A lot of this is just getting confused. Suddenly everything is getting blamed on climate change.
Meanwhile, writes Der Spiegel, the Finance Minister of Tuvula has to attend a conference in Brussels to take care of some things involving the UN Global Environmental Fund, which will funnel money to the islands. How much can Tuvalu expect? The Minister says:
We’re supposedly at the top of the list.
Catastrophe have never been so profitable. Meanwhile the next plane lands. Der Spiegel writes:
White people pour out of the plane. One is a photographer, one is a sociologist, and two are volunteers who want to plant trees. The show must go on.
It’s the little island that bilks big – all helped along by the UN.

The German online TAZ here reports on Spain’s solar energy industry debacle in an article with the headline:

Botched Spanish Solar Roofs

Yet another example of the havoc governments can cause by excessively interfering in the free market (with the best intentions of course).
The boom was great – while it lasted. Solar panels flew onto the roofs of buildings faster than you could make them, and companies couldn’t keep up with the demand.
The very leftist TAZ writes that in 2008, 2600 megawatts of photovoltaic capacity were installed in 9 months alone. Why so much? Because buyers wanted to take advantage of the generous feed-in subsidies paid to solar panel operators, guaranteed for 25 years, before they expired. Unfortunately, quality and reliability took a back seat in the mad rush for gold. Today, everywhere there are signs of shoddy quality and poor function with the installed solar systems.
The boom turns into a fiasco
And now two years later, the warranty period for the installation work has expired and panel owners are no longer under guarantee. TAZ writes:
50,000 installation with a total rated output of 3500 megawatts are now up and running in Spain. 80% of the systems were installed in 2008. There was a gold rush feeling. Everybody wanted to lock into the feed-in tariffs guaranteed for 25 years. In addition to the known brand-names, some used new brands of solar panels – most of them from China – the opportunity was seized in an overheated market. Installation companies bought whatever they could get their hands on.

All the haste was propelled by generous government subsidies, and everybody wanted to get on the gravy train. Now, just 2 years later, many installations are showing up to be defective, shoddy, and running far below the expected efficiency rates. TAZ writes:
The synthetic resin coating in which the cells are embedded is now turning yellow, electrical contacts are oxidizing, various layers are peeling apart and blistering. In addition “hot-spots” are appearing, which in extreme cases leads to a total breakdown of the entire module. Also the overall design of the system is showing to be considerably shoddy.”
30,000 jobs lost in the last 2 years
And because the exorbitant feed-in subsidies were abruptly canceled, many solar installation companies have since gone bust and have disappeared. TAZ writes that industry associations and unions calculate 30,000 jobs in the photovoltaic sector have disappeared since 2008. Meanwhile the Spanish government has turned a blind eye, claiming there are no reliable figures out there to base conclusions on.
30% is expected to be scrapped in the next three years
TAZ writes that solar panel recycling companies are now poised to take on the big business of recycling all the installed scrap. According to some estimates, 30% of the panels are expected to be scrapped in the next three years alone.
Not so, says a state research center, which insists the figure is too high and is closer to “5 to 10%, which is still a figure that is too high”.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s leading tabloid has a report today called: Expert: More and More Extreme Weather In Germany. What is this claim based on?
It’s based on short-term observations made by official Bild tabloid meteorologist Dominik Jung, who is quoted as saying:
Just take a look at the monthly deviations in average temperature in Germany from 2010. There you’ll notice an almost symmetrical up and down. Every positive extreme has a corresponding negative.”
One year of data says this will be the case for the future, with extremes even growing wider? So claims the Bild weatherman. Strangely, Bild refers to Jung as “Der Klima-Experte” (the climate expert). I thought meteorologists and climatologists were completely different. Obviously, when one makes extreme forecasts of disaster, then it qualifies a person as a “climate expert”.What data does Jung use to draw his extreme weather conclusion?
Numerous weather exremes resulted from the temperature anomalies last year, such as the coldest May since weather records are kept, and the long lasting heat wave of June-July, or multiple high water in East Germany.”
In summary, Jung bases his climate projection on 3 events that occurred in one single year. And my recollection is that the “long lasting heat wave of June-July” was a whole three weeks long, starting at the end of June and extending to about July 22, and was interrupted at least twice by cooler weather. What the heck – good enough to count as an extreme.
Jung then admits in the Bild article that no “general increase in storms or significant weather events” could be detected“, yet, storms will become “always more extreme and violent”. No trend is there? So what – let’s make a sensational baseless prediction – just for the tabloids!

Just how good a meteorologist is Jung? Not very good if you examine his forecast for the winter. On November 9, 2010 Bild published his seasonal forecast for the 2010-2011 winter, predicting Germany would have a very mild first half of December with temperatures reaching 15°C!
The exact opposite was the case.
He also predicted a short thaw in early February, then followed by another cold snap that would extend deep into March. That now looks doubtful. January and February have been a bit over normal, and looks to continue that way. But let’s give him credit where it is due: he predicted a white Christmas, which turned out right.
Lately we have been hearing a lot about weather extremes, many claiming 2010 was an extreme weather year globally. Just how extreme was 2010? You be the judge, from http://www.coaps.fsu.edu/~maue/tropical/:
 For the calendar-year 2010:
**66-tropical cyclones globally, the fewest in the reliable record (since at least 1970)
**46-tropical cyclones in the Northern Hemisphere, fewest since 1977
**Global calendar year ACE total of 529 was the lowest since 1977.
**The Northern Hemisphere ACE total of 373 was the lowest since 1977.
**Combined North Eastern and Western Pacific ACE total of 171 lowest since at least 1970.
**Western North Pacific had 8 Typhoons fewest in at least 65-years of records. 
**Eastern North Pacific had 8 TCs: 3 were hurricanes, the fewest since at least 1970. 
**North Atlantic ACE for 2010 was 170, the 11th most since 1950, and most since 2005.

Overall, since 1979: 
**Global Tropical Cyclone ACE shows no upward trend.
**Northern Hemisphere TC ACE shows no upward trend.
**Southern Hemisphere TC ACE shows no upward trend.
**North Atlantic TC ACE has doubled since 1995, exactly compensated by a halving of Eastern Pacific ACE. It appears that in the context of global and NH ACE, the NATL increases are at the expense of the other basins, or simply within the common climate framework.
**Global TCs of Tropical Storm force show no upward trend in frequency.
**Global TCs of Hurricane Force + show no upward trend in frequency.”
Tropical cylone ACE looks to be close to a record low. But that kind of news news doesn’t qualify to be printed in sensationalist tabloids.

Ed takes a look at some temperature plots from stations in Antarctica and compares them to the Southern Oscillation Index and wind. Forget the back seat! – CO2 is only riding the rear bumper of the climate science bus.
A Wind In Antarctica
By Ed Caryl
 
High winds in Antarctica. Source: Wikimedia
The Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) crowd claims that warming caused by CO2 will appear first in the Arctic and Antarctic. We showed that there is little to no warming at locations in the Arctic that are sufficiently isolated from Urban Warming. In Antarctica this should not be a problem because research stations are mostly small, and many have been of constant size since they were established. Yet, we have this example to cast doubt on that idea.
Figure 1
(Note: All temperatures in the following charts are plotted in Excel from GISS raw temperature data.)
In Figure 1, McMurdo and Scott Base are only 5 kilometers apart, and Marble Point is just 87 kilometers away from both. Temperatures at all three track one another except that McMurdo and Scott Base are warming at just under a degree over the 50 years seen here, and Marble Point is flat over the 30-year record we have. Why the large temperature difference between McMurdo and Scott Base? Unknown. If any reader has been there, and can answer the question, leave a comment.
The answer may be as simple as that the population of McMurdo is over 1000 people every winter, and Scott Base population is 10 over-winters, and those figures have been roughly the same since the beginning of both bases. Marble Point is an automated station, one of the few in Antarctica that authorities have managed to keep operating with any consistency. Usually the wind blows the automated stations away, or the snow buries them. Automated station = no people = no warming.
If we shorten the records to the last 30 years, we get a slightly different result (Figure 2).
Figure 2
McMurdo has been warming just slightly since 1980, Marble Point is flat, and Scott Base has been cooling nearly as much as it had warmed in the previous 25 years. Conclusion? McMurdo base has an urban warming problem.
Are there other patterns in warming and cooling in Antarctica? 
There certainly are. Here are two charts, both covering the last 30 years, Figures 3 & 4. The cooler stations near the bottom of the first chart are closer to the South Pole.
Figure 3
Figure 4
Notice that the temperatures on the Continental chart and the Peninsula chart go in opposite directions. In any year when the stations around the rim of the Antarctic continent are cooling, the stations on the Antarctic Peninsula tend to be warming and vice-versa. Especially obvious is 1989. Why should this be?
There is a similar pattern in the Antarctic Oscillation Index. The AOI is the difference in mean sea level pressure between 40°S and 65°S latitudes. The same pattern is seen in the Southern Hemisphere Annular Mode Index or SAM. This index is similar to the AOI, but it is the pressure difference between 40°S and 70°S. In the plot below, Figure 5, the SAM index is in phase with the Antarctic Peninsula average temperature, and is inverted compared to the Antarctic Continental average. The Continental average has been inverted in this plot.
Figure 5
The Southern Oscillation is also somewhat related to winds and temperatures in Antarctica. The Southern Oscillation is an index calculated from the difference in barometric pressure between Tahiti and Darwin, Australia. It is also referred to as the El Niño Southern Oscillation or ENSO.

The SOI is also in phase with the temperatures on the Antarctic Peninsula, and inverted compared to the Antarctic Continental station temperatures. This isn’t totally consistent, but remember that these charts are of yearly averages, so some detail is lost.
Figure 6
Figure 6 is also an average of the Antarctic Continental and Antarctic Peninsula station temperatures, the Continental plot is inverted, and all compared to the SOI. 1988-89 was a strong La Niña year. 1995 also had a La Niña, as did the period from 1998 to 2000.
Figure 7
Figure 7 source: http://faculty.washington.edu/kessler/ENSO/soi-1950-98.gif
Is the Antarctic warming? 
So, we still have not answered the question: Is the Antarctic warming? The problem with the answer is that most of the stations in Antarctica, including the peninsula, were only established in the mid-1950’s, during the 1957-1958 International Geophysical Year. This means that most of the temperature records don’t span the longest ocean cycles, like the AMO.
Only Base Orcadas, Figure 9, on Laurie Island in the South Orkney Islands goes back to the early 20th century, to 1903. It clearly shows the AMO signal of cooling in the 1920’s and 30’s, warming to the late 1950’s, cooling to the 70’s, and warming to the present.
Figure 8
The total warming of Base Orcadas in the last 100 years is about 1 degree C looking at the 6 year moving average. Three other stations are cooling: Halley, Mawson and Neumayer; all are on the Antarctic continent. Only two have records going back to 1957 or earlier, Halley and Mawson. Halley is the only one with significant cooling over the last 50 years (Figure 9).

 So, why is the Antarctic Peninsula warming? The answer seems to lie in increases in the circumpolar winds in that region. These cause increased adiabatic (down-slope) winds as the circumpolar winds blow over the spine of the peninsula. These adiabatic winds heat the air as they compress it flowing to sea level. The resulting heating can be seen in this NASA image, Figure 10.
Figure 10
Figure 10 source: http://www.coolantarctica.com/Antarctica%20fact%20file/science/Antarctic_temps_AVH1982-2004%20source%20NASA.jpg
The reason for the heating is paradoxical. The Antarctic Continent is cooling, especially at the South Pole. The continent is mostly a high plateau, subject to continuous high pressure. This leads to winds that flow downhill, the adiabatic winds. The earth’s rotation (coriolis force) bends these winds into the Polar Easterlies. As these flow over the Antarctic Peninsula, the west side of the peninsula is heated.
Figure 11 is the annual average pressure at Vostok Station on the plateau and the wind speed at Syowa Station on the coast. The atmospheric pressure is slowly increasing at Vostok over the period measured and the wind speed is also increasing on the coast. (These locations were picked because they had the most continuous records.)
Figure 11
Will the pressure and wind increase, and the Antarctic Continental cooling and Antarctic Peninsula heating continue? The recent trend in Antarctic sea ice and the current succession of La Niñas suggests not, see Figure 12.
Figure 12
Source: http://www.bom.gov.au/watl/enso/
In the above plot, Figure 12, La Niñas are positive and cooling, and El Niños are negative and warming as in the first SOI plot above (Figure 7). Remember that the ENSO is a pressure difference index. During a La Niña, winds are blowing the warm surface waters away, and during an El Niño, the winds calm, allowing the surface waters to warm. It is rather surprising that these are commonly thought of as equatorial events, but have affects at the South Pole.
What do these indicators say about AGW? It casts doubt. It says that to see the truth, we need to look at more factors over a longer time span, and over wider distances than we have in the past. As in the Arctic, we need a few more years of careful measurements.

"Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed the Scottish government will rethink plans to cut air travel taxes after agreeing to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2045. The first minister said Scotland needed to dramatically step up its efforts after she accepted a target from the UK Committee on Climate Change (CCC) to set a tougher goal of net-zero emissions over the next 25 years.  Sturgeon told the Scottish National party conference on Sunday that she accepted the world faced a climate emergency, and on Thursday her government tabled amendments to its environment bill that will set legally binding targets to reach the target. Chris Stark, the chief executive of the CCC, said Sturgeon needed to drop her plan to cut and then eventually abolish air departure tax from Scottish airports, because it would drive up emissions from aviation. During first minister’s questions Sturgeon was pressed by Richard Leonard, the Scottish Labour leader, Alison Johnstone from the Scottish Greens, and several other MSPs on whether she would abandon the policy entirely. Johnstone said reducing aviation duty would be a “climate-busting tax cut”. Leonard said it would reduce tax income by £150m and mostly benefit the richest, since it would cut the cost of long-haul air fares the most, and would drive up emissions. The first minister had deflected criticisms of the aviation tax last week but told MSPs the policy would now be reviewed. “The increase in our scale of ambition today means we will need to reconsider policies across the whole range of our responsibilities,” she said. “All of us recognise we have to do more and we have to do it quickly.” She challenged Leonard and other Holyrood parties to stop their “kneejerk opposition” to policies designed to cut emissions. Scottish Labour and the Tories are blocking proposals from the Scottish Green party for new taxes on private parking at workplaces. Scotland’s carbon emissions have fallen by nearly 50% since 1990, driven chiefly by the closure of coal-fired power stations and a concerted drive by Scottish ministers to support windfarms, paid for partly by a levy on household energy bills across the UK. Rail travel has also increased, with the Scottish government investing heavily in electrification and new trains, and initiatives to promote electric car use. Sturgeon has set a target of phasing out all new petrol and diesel car sales by 2032, eight years ahead of the rest of the UK. However, environmental campaigners and opposition MSPs accuse the SNP of failing to tackle a steep fall in bus travel and a steady increase in private car use; a failure to adopt Scotland-wide 20mph zones in urban areas; a lack of opposition in Westminster to the expansion of Heathrow airport; and of delaying an outright ban on fracking in Scotland. Sturgeon’s government remains wedded to a strategy of maximising North Sea oil and gas production, producing 74m tonnes of oil in 2018, and Scotland has seven open-cast coal mines, which in 2017 produced 800,000 tonnes, more than a quarter of the UK’s coal. The CCC said on Thursday that the UK would continue to use fossil fuels well into the future; as a result, Scotland must dramatically increase forest cover and store excess CO2 underground to offset that. Environmental campaigners believe ministers covering farming, finance and transport have been blocking or watering down policies that could be politically or electorally unpopular, and protecting those seen as vote winners. Roseanna Cunningham, Scotland’s environment and climate secretary, said she intended to press other Scottish ministers to reassess their priorities, as well as plan public information campaigns on food waste, green travel and home energy use. “One of the things I need to do now is have quite urgent conversations with some of my colleagues about the implications of this and thinking very carefully about what they can up the pace on,” she said on Thursday. Getting to net zero was an overriding priority, she said. “Yes this is challenging but there’s no alternative; the alternative is going to be much worse.”  Cunningham agreed Scottish ministers needed to do more on decarbonising transport but confirmed she too opposed the Greens’ proposal for mandatory 20mph speed limits in urban areas. The Scottish government has full control over all speed limits in Scotland, but has never reduced them. “As I understand it, there are issues in a large number of urban areas which would make [20mph zones] extremely difficult,” Cunningham said. “I live in an urban area where, I’m sorry, that would be extremely problematic. “We live in a democracy, and we have to be able to persuade people that this is the right thing to do and take them with us.”"

My blogroll has a number of non-English, foreign, skeptic blogsites.
I’ve put them there because I feel it’s important that the rest of the world knows that skepticism is not just a thing one finds in North America, UK and Australia, but all over the world.
One site that caught my eye is Maggie Thauersköld Crusell’s theclimatescam.se/; it’s the WUWT of Scandinavia.
Why do I say that? It’s because even though Sweden has a population of only 9.35 million (compared to USA’s 300 million) and her posts being written in Swedish, she often gets 50 – 100 comments per post, and more, from her readers. By comparison Anthony Watts would have to get 2000 – 3000 comments per post to match her per capita-wise!
A few days ago I got the idea to write a post about the WUWT of Sweden, and so I wrote Maggie to ask her if she’d mind, and included a few questions. She happily went along.
Here’s Maggie on what’s going on with climate science and politics in Sweden, and also a  little bit about herself. Things are looking up in Scandinavia. Hope you enjoy this look at the climate situation in Sweden.

The Climate Scam Website
by Maggie Thauersköld Crusell
The Climate Scam is by far the largest blog about climate issues, not only in Sweden, but also in Scandinavia.

I began blogging at the end of 2007, as a reaction to the “streamlined” reporting on climate issues in traditional media. Soon, the number of visitors doubled, tripled and quadrupled. Obviously, there was a need for an open forum where all views were allowed. The Climate Scam has never been moderated and still isn’t. As long as people refrain from ad hominem-attacks, everyone is free to express their opinion.
Public opinion on global warming is definitely changing in Sweden. After Copenhagen, and the oddly cold winter 2009/10, people are more or less sick of hearing about climate and becoming increasingly skeptical. The phrases “climate change” and “global warming” are used much less today, and mostly by leftish fringe organizations.
There was an election to the parliament earlier this autumn and climate was hardly ever mentioned in the political debates.
What’s bothersome though is that there seems to be a great preference for wind power among Swedish politicians and many dream of wind replacing nuclear and hydropower, which today provide more than 90 percent of Sweden’s energy.
Many people within the environmental movement seem to wish for our society to go back to where it was in 1850s, or even before that, disregarding the fact that technological advances have done so much to improve the state of the world. The hard core of the environmental movement is highly misanthropic and consider humans a plague on earth. Progress is seen as detrimental, consumption as a threat to the environment and population increase as a fast lane to total destruction.
I feel we need to spread a more optimistic view of the future. Today, pessimism is the politically correct attitude and those who are optimists are considered naive and stupid. I am currently writing a book about this very issue.
I follow a lot of blogs, both skeptical ones and more politically correct. Among my favorites are WUWT, Climate Audit and Roy Spencer’s blog. I also subscribe to climate news from all around the world and I receive daily tips from my readers. I have participated in three of Heartland Institute’s climate conferences and would like to recommend them to everyone who wishes to meet some of the most prominent skeptical scientists in the world. I assume there will be a new conference arranged in spring 2011.
One last thing I’d like to add is: treat everyone with respect, no matter what their opinions are. Far too many skeptics and warmists turn to foul play, calling their opponents names and making the debate personal. I prefer to believe that we all want to do good, to preserve our planet and to further evolve humanity. And I try to stay open for views that differ from my own. We can all learn something from each other.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDoubt over the science of climate change goes beyond USA, Great Britain and Australia, and is now spreading into mainland Europe, in particular Germany. So much so, that the German Greens are getting alarmed about the waning alarmism.
This is why the alarmists in Germany, led by the Green Party and Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute For Climate Impact Research, are now all trembly-handed about it and have organised a pow-wow in Berlin in March on how to counter the growing climate scepticism. The event is called:
The Interest In Doubt – The Strategies of the So-Called Climate Sceptics
Below is a translation of the announcement. As you read it, you will find it confrontational and militant. It’s the paranoid “us against them” mindset.
The climate alarmists simply cannot accept that the catastrophe is not coming. I wrote about why this frightens them: ALARMIST PSYCHOLOGY.
Here’s the event announcement in English
============================================================

What’s it about?
Climate scepticism is not a new phenomena in the debate surrounding anthropogenic climate change. To obstruct an ambitious climate protection program and to hinder energy transformation, the seeds of doubt concerning the findings of science has a long tradition, especially in the USA, where it has reached a new dimension. In addition to spreading lies and untruths, the defamation of politicians and covert operations also belong to the repertoire of climate policy obstructionists. Also in Germany the activities of climate sceptics and climate deniers are increasing. At first these activities were restricted to the Internet and blogs, but have since reached the German Parliament. Politicians of the CDU/CSU and FDP parties even publicly welcome known climate sceptics, and thus provided a forum for their non-serious and unscientific assertions.
In our focused discussion, we wish to cast light on the background the current activities of the climate sceptics. What is the motive behind the current climate-sceptic activites and media attention? What are the strategies of the so-called climate sceptics, who is behind them and who finances them?
We warmly invite you to attend.

By S-Bahn, get off at station “Hauptbahnhof” or “Brandenburger Tor”. By bus…blah blah blah [Just take your car and follow your navigation system].
Important advisory:
To enter the Jakob-Kaiser-Haus, you’ll need your ID or passport and an additional photo ID. It is also required to register with your name, DOB no later than 11 March 2011.
=======================================================
I urge concerned German readers to attend if you can. Perhaps someone should tell them how much oil money sceptics get, and how much the green groups get. I have yet to receive a cent.
I can tell you what this is going to be about: Koch Industries, Fred Singer, Big Oil, Tobacco, etc. the usual crap that appeals to people who crave disaster. Of course German sceptic group EIKE will be a target as well. Incidentally, EIKE has sent a letter to the Green Party, expressing their wishes to attend this conference.
Does anyone believe the tolerant and progressive Greens will welcome them?

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe push towards Green Fundamentalism. This is one of the most dangerous surveys the German government has ever commissioned. 
What do you do when the global warming dogma is collapsing all over the world and people in Germany start expressing doubts, as they shovel snow almost daily and battle the icy cold? You produce a bogus study that shows otherwise. Of course you make the survey look scientific and authoritative (an old trick practiced in climate science).
German government releases its latest environmental survey, which suggests citizens want the government to step in even more. 
The online Handelsblatt reports here on a new survey titled Environmental Consciousness in Germany 2010 – Results of a representative survey commissioned by the German Ministry of Environment.
The text was written by Dr Fritz Reusswig of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and Dr. Silke Borgstedt of the Sinus Institute. Consider the whole thing as the Church of Green doing a survey of the faithful, and looking to see if they are worshipping and practicing the green religion enough.
Moreover, the survey is designed to legitimize further government intrusion into people’s lives and their choices in order to make sure they live “green”. That’s the dangerous aspect of the survey. The target is to acheive 100% green intellectual purity in Germany.
The overall result is: People are more environmentally religious than ever, but it’s still not enough! And the survey alleges that the majority of the citizens want the government to step into their lives even more. The survey suggests that people want the government to do more to make everybody green.
The enviro-friendly Handelsblatt provides us with some of the results. But be warned – this study has PIK fingerprints all over it.
85% of Germans believe a changeover to renewable energy is needed, (only 8% actually use it).
34% buy organic food, down from 43% in 2008.
58% want a speed limit of only 30 km/hr in cities.
62% want the government to do more for the environment.
Poor people and conservatives are stupid
They don’t come out and say it, but we know damn well what they are getting at. The survey marginalises conservatives, and de facto declares war on people with other beliefs. That’s the impression the Handelsblatt gives:
The study suggests that well-educated, liberal, young people, who use the internet daily, are more environmentally conscious. But poor and conservative groups see environment and economy as opposites, and take the environment less into consideration.”
Yes, conservatives have the same thinking as those you find in the squalor of the lower social strata, the Handelsblatt suggests. In general, people who aren’t environmentalists aren’t hip. They’re like tea partiers.

But Jochen Flasbarth, President of the Federal Ministry of Environment has some quaint things to say about the poor and the narrow minded conservatives in German society:
Although the traditional postwar generations don’t care so much about environmental protection, they have s smaller ecological foot print.”
That’s because they fly less, shop less, and drive less. So in that sense, we have to applaud them. Is this how people are going to be measured by the state in the future? This is pretty damn scary. Since when is it the the state’s job to dictate how people live. German democracy and freedom are taking a gigantic leap backwards.
According to Section 6.2.4.1 of the survey: “Liberal-intellectuals and social ecological persons look closely to see products have the “Blue Angel” environmental seal.”
A majority are calling for more government and higher taxes
And stricter regulations, too. At least that’s what the Church of Climatology survey claims.
62% says the government isn’t doing enough for climate protection.
89% believe industry is not doing enough.
54% say the citizens aren’t doing enough.
61% say Germany should be the global leader in climate protection.
Handelsblatt writes that between 72 and 89% are in favour of better insulation for homes, more environmentally friendly production, more environmentally friendly cars, higher taxes on products that damage the climate, tougher laws or curtailing subsidies that damage the climate.
But Flasbarth thinks there’s a lack of willingness in contrast:
There’s gap there that is interesting for the state because it shows where we can get started. For me this is a clear mandate for environmental policy not to hesitate in implementing the law.”
Talk about a guy who wants to be an environmental Napoleon!  In Flasbarth’s view it’s: the people want us to regulate them – so give us more power! Handelsblatt writes:
In the rankings, environmental protection ranks third with 20% behind economy and financial policy (24%) and jobs (51%). It moved up one position.”
I find it a bit strange that such a survey was not conducted by an independent polling institute, like Infratest or Emnid. Why is the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research involved? I expect other such bogus studies to be used as the next propaganda tool in other countries – soon.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German online Süddeutsche Zeitung has a report by Peter Lemke, who directs Climate Sciences at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven, Germany, and was a lead author of the now infamous 2007 IPCC report. He presents his views of the Cancun Agreement.
In the agreement, countries made pledges to limit global temperature rise to 2°C (no word if they are pledging to limit solar radiation, ocean dynamics and the Earth’s orbit as well – just to remind readers of the folly of the entire endeavour).
So what does Lemke think of the Cancun result?
What’s missing are concrete resolutions on cutting back emissions so that these targets can be reached.
The EU has already declared reducing its CO2 emissions by 20 to 30% by 2020 compared to 1990 levels. However, these commitments are not binding, and they are hardly sufficient. What is really necessary is that all industrial countries cut their GHG emissions 25 to 40 percent by 2020, and 80 to 95 percent by 2050. So it’s disappointing.
Yes, it is disappointing when people have doubts about why it’s necessary to inflict ritual self-flagellation.
Lemke then provides an overview of the history of CO2 greenhouse physics, mentioning Fourier in the early 19th century, Tyndall, and then Arrhenius. Lemke adds:
Today, using modern climate models, we expect a temperature increase of about 3°C [for a doubling of CO2].

This of course requires FAITH in climate models. Everyone knows they neglect cloud feedbacks, and can’t predict what oceans and the sun will do, and lots of other things, and so are thus just tools of modern-day charlatans.
Yet, Lemke would like to have us think that the models are infallible, and so we ought to commence with the self-flagellation rituals as soon as possible. Here Lemke cites the Holy Bible of AGW, the 2007 IPCC report.
The IPCC report of 2007 asserts that the warming of the earth is beyond doubt and that man is responsible for most of the warming over the last 50 years.
2010 will be one of the warmest years ever recorded. Sea level is rising 3.4 mm per year.”
We just had an El Nino year, and so temperatures have been warm. But that the sea level is now rising 3.4 mm/year is false. I think Lemke is still stuck on the 2007 IPCC report. He then goes on about 1 meter sea level rises and 4°C temperature increases. Remember that all these projections are based on the crystal ball models. Yesterday I wrote about how meteorologists are forecasting the opposite. Lemke adds:
Yet another calculation shows that relative to today’s standards, unusually hot summers like the one in 2003 will be normal by the year 2040, and by 2070 these hot summers will be considered as cool.
I think we’ve heard enough quackery for one day. This of course is all unscientific and is purveyed for the sole purpose of spreading fear and getting  people to start torturing themselves. In Germany, we read such rubbish almost daily in the media. Lemke puts in one last word of support for the climate crystal balls:
And even if the climate models are not perfect, they are still one of the best tools for forecasting; at least they are more reliable than any tax revenue estimate or projection of economic development. For this reason they should serve as the basis for all planning.
Everybody start whipping yourself – because the models say so. Too bad the models couldn’t predict these cold winters just 2 years ago.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn Germany, climatology has become the Trabant of sciences.
Reading all the climate doom and gloom in the more prominent German online papers like Der Spiegel, Die Welt, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, etc., you’d think by now readers would have long since barricaded themselves inside their homes and crawled under their beds in angst, in order to hide from the dreaded Klimakatastrophe. 
So frequent are the alarmist climate stories. Normally such stories would be better placed in the comics section. But in Germany newspapers don’t have a comics section, and so they get mixed in with the news.
Day after day normally respectable papers are filled with worst-case reports, often extracted from press releases dribbled out by tax-payer funded panic-houses like the authoritarian Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.
But, hardly anyone believes them anymore:  90% to 10%.
Yesterday I read yet another rehashed panic story in Die Welt, whose title translates: Heat Waves Threaten With Increasing Frequency.
Very revealing are the reader comments. Judging from them, a majority of German readers scoff at the claims the planet is heating up catastrophically, and do so with a whoppingly huge majority.

At Die Welt, readers who write comments can be rated by other readers with either a “thumbs up” if you agree with the comment, or a “thumbs down” if you don’t. So I counted up the number of “thumbs up” and the number of “thumbs down” for the first 20 reader comments that appeared after the above mentioned piece. The result (Saturday, 5:15 pm): 
Number agreeing with the sceptics:   1864  (90.2%)
Number agreeing with the warmists:  203  (  9.8%) 
Wunderbar! Alarmist climate science has lost its credibility, authority and trust, it seems. There’s hope for real climate science after all. Yes, a broad majority of informed Germans, at least Die Welt readers, believe climate science forecasts fundamentally are rubbish. Sure this is not a real survey. But to me it’s a clear signal.
 Some online papers have even given up allowing readers to have their say, having grown tired of being told their “news” are rubbish. So give Die Welt some credit for allowing readers to have a voice.
Interestingly, the Germans have a wide selection of words that mean “nonsense”, and one finds them used regularly in reader comments about climate. Here are some: Unsinn, Bloedsinn, Quatsch, Unfug, Dummheit, and Humbug. 
Now we can add another to the list of synonyms: Klimawissenschaft (climate science). So now when my son worries about a minor matter, I simply tell him: “Don’t worry, it’s all climate science”.

Share this...FacebookTwitter2500 years of tree rings.
This newest tree ring study completely refutes Mann’s bogus hockey stick. That question is now forever resolved. There were warm and cold periods – with plenty of extremes. But that’s nothing new for many of us.
Der Spiegel reports on a new study put out by Science where scientists gathered data from a large set of tree rings from the Alps and used them to reconstruct 2500 years of climate in fine detail. The scientists were able to reconstruct past climate with unprecedented precision and found some significant results.
The press here is acting like these results are new. But to skeptics, it only confirms what they’ve been saying all along.
It turns out that Hannibal indeed most likely did cross the Alps with elephants way back in the year 218 BC, at a time when Europe was in a warm optimum. The study shows that weather and climate events triggered human and cultural shifts and events like wars, famine, disease –  or prosperity and growth, depending on whether it was warm or cold.
Der Spiegel writes:
From 9000 pieces of wood from old post and beam homes and trees, scientists Ulf Büntgen of the Swiss WSL Environmental Research Institute and Jan Esper of the University of Mainz read off the climate story – a unique global historical archive was created.”
Der Spiegel presents the most important results, which I myself think are not a surprise. The bulk of the Der Spiegel piece focuses on the hunger and misery precipitated by the climatic cold periods throughout the 2500-year period. One really gets a sense of how temperatures in Europe by no means followed the hockey stick shape proposed by Mann, and went from cold to warm, and vice versa. Numerous other proxies show the same applies globally.
Disease, war, famine and societal collapse  in cool, raw times
Witches were burned for bad weather. (Photo source: http://www.suppressedhistories.net/)
2500 years ago Europe was gripped by a cold period and temperatures were 2°C below today’s levels. Wars raged and societies collapsed. In the 4th century AD, after the Roman Warm Period, the climate again went downhill. It got cold and dry in central and southern Europe. The Huns invaded, and the Roman Empire collapsed. The temperature continued to drop through the 6th, 7th and 8thcenturies – and with catastrophic consequences. Der Spiegel writes:
In the famine year of 784, one third of Europe’s population died. ‘It was a cool summer’, says Büntgen’s sober diagnosis, looking at the data. ‘With the worsening climate, not only did harvests in Europe go bad, but livestock also shriveled away’, reports historian Berninger.”

These cool times continued into the 10th century. Crops continued to fail, famine, unrest, war, disease and misery spread – all because of the cold climate.
Finally, by the 11th century, the climate turned the corner and warm times started up again (all naturally, without man-made CO2). Europe prospered again, cathedrals were built and society advanced until the 14th century.
In the early 14th century, climate-related hunger and famine began to spread again. From 1346 to 1352, half of Europe’s population was killed off by the Black Plague. As the temperature dropped, starvation and misery continued, all blamed on witches, who were burned. Sound familiar?
Europe had plunged into madness. The 30-year war raged across Germany from 1618 to 1648. At this point Europe was in the middle of the Little Ice Age. Der Spiegel writes:
In 1709 the weather in Europe rendered one of the worst natural catastrophes Europe: In the grisly cold of 1709, rivers in Portugal froze, palm trees were buried in snow. All over Europe rivers had frozen fish, livestock froze in the stables.”
Prosperity and the emergence of empires in warm periods
Heydays, the Roman Empire and the German Empire coincided with warm times. For example, by 300 BC, the climate again got warmer, and with rains. It got so warm in fact, that the Alps became passable. The Roman Empire emerged – all helped along by the climate. Harvests were bountiful, and England had vineyards and made wine.  The MWP was similarly warm, read above. There’s ample evidence showing that the Roman Period and the MWP were warmer than today.
Weather extremes were greater in the past than today
Büntgen and Esper’s ring studies also show that rainfall amounts in Central Europe fluctuated much more year-to-year in ancient times and in the Dark Ages than in recent times, and also weather extremes were greater. In the year 1135, very little rain fell and the Danube River almost dried up. Regensburg used the opportunity to build its landmrk Steinernen bridge. The historical records also show a number of great floods, storms and periods of drought during Europe’s history.
That was climate and it was all natural. It was not caused by witches and bad behaviour. This study clearly shows that warm times are good, cold times are bad, and that the past had more extremes than today. Not only is it more nails for the hockey stick’s coffin, but also nails for the AGW theory.

"Democrats on Thursday passed their first significant climate change legislation since gaining control of the House of Representatives this year, directing Donald Trump to remain in the landmark international agreement to limit the pollution that is heating the world. The measure would not directly reduce the greenhouse gases causing worse heatwaves, droughts, wildfires and storms. It falls far short of the action scientists say is needed and the vision outlined by progressives and supported by many Democrat presidential candidates in the Green New Deal.  Only a few Republicans crossed party lines to vote for the bill, which the Republican leader of the Senate, Mitch McConnell, said will “go nowhere”. McConnell said the US participating in the Paris climate agreement would have an “unmeasurable effect” globally and hurt the economy. “My colleagues on the left think these self-inflicted national injuries just feel like this greening of America is the right thing to do,” McConnell said in a statement. Republicans in the House have also sought to force a vote on the Green New Deal, expecting that many Democrats would not be able to stand behind the specifics and the costs of the sweeping proposal. Donald Trump made it a campaign promise, later carried through, to exit the 2015 Paris deal, in which almost all the nations in the world set voluntary goals for tackling climate change. His administration has aimed to roll back Obama-era rules meant to nudge the US toward its commitments. And his agencies have made efforts to bolster fossil fuels. The US in the global deal agreed to cut its climate pollution 26-28% by 2025, but data shows the country far off track from that goal. Democrats defended their efforts, calling climate change an immediate danger to the American public and the world. “Last year was an abject failure in addressing the climate crisis in both policy and real-world emission reductions. In the US and globally, we fell short,” said Illinois congressman Mike Quigley, a Democrat. “We cannot afford another year like it.” Trump cannot formally leave the deal until a day after the 2020 election. In a morning press conference ahead of the vote, the House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi, did not expand on her party’s climate plans, but noted the bill is one of many measures Democrats are passing that the Republican-controlled Senate will not consider. Jean Su, the Center for Biological Diversity’s energy director, called the bill necessary “but far from sufficient”. “The science demands an economy-wide mobilization to end our addiction to dirty energy and harness renewable sources on an ambitious new scale,” she said."

But that’s about to change, reports the German edition of the online Russian news service Ria Novosti here.Russian scientists say that the sun will soon come alive after having observed a total eclipse at Easter Island in the Pacific yesterday. They warn that magnetic storms could soon occur.
Dimitri Semyonov, who belongs to the team of observers, says the shape of the sun’s corona indicates an increase in solar activity, but cautions that the observed data still need to be evaluated. He adds:
 The sun is waking up.
Ria Novosti reports:
Dr. Sergei Bogatchov of the Laboratory for Solar X-Ray Astronomy at the Lebedev Institute of Physics told Ria Novosti that the back side of the sun has probably just seen the highest level of activity since the start of the year.
Dr. Sergei Bogatchov says:
In seven to ten days this active area of the sun will reach a position that will enable charged particles to reach the earth. That’s going to impact the geomagnetic situation – may even lead to magnetic storms.
The following graphic shows the location where the solar eclipse was observed yesterday. Sorry it’s in German, but it’s still interesting to look at.
So, it looks like a Maunder Minimum type of solar lull may not happen after all. We ought to be thankful for that. The next one or two weeks will tell us more.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s a brilliant satirical piece on German radio by journalist Dirk Maxieiner on how the state thinks it can regulate weather and climate.
Unfortunately the audio and text are only available in German. To all German readers here, if you have yet to hear it, then you really ought to do so.
Dirk Maxeiner is the author of: Hurrah, wir retten die Welt. I’ve read it, and can only recommend it.
First he focuses his satire on the contradictory predictions made by climate crystal ball forecasters. Stefan Rahmstorf recently declared that cold winters are now a sign of global warming, while Mojib Latif claimed that winters will get warmer. No matter what, it’s proof of man-made climate change. Maxeiner:
Even a new ice age would not refute the theory of unstoppable global warming, rather it would be claimed that it confirms it. Climate debate strongly reminds us of the joke about the four enemies of Soviet agriculture: spring, summer, fall, and winter – as well as the two auxiliary enemies: day and night.”
He points out that even weather normalcy is now viewed as indisputable evidence of man-made climate change. When North Sea storm Kyril hit Germany in 2007, the media was shocked that the storm surge predicted the coast never materialised, and so was thus some sort of surreal extreme event.
Today, says Maxeiner, “Germany is in the grips of ‘Immerschlimmerismus’ (things are always getting worse), even though Germans today are more prosperous and healthier than ever.

People no longer accept taking responsibility, he says. When something goes wrong, it’s never your fault – it’s always the fault of someone else. For example “if you crash your car, it’s not because of poor driving skills, but rather it’s the fault of the Road Commissioner who failed to make traffic conditions safe enough”.
The peak of stupidity, and/or arrogance, is the State’s belief that it can now control our weather, and thus keep the menace of extreme weather at bay. The truth is that the State, the great protector, cannot even control its own spending. Maxeiner describes the State’s policy to regulate climate as:
A type of politics that is not even able to stop health insurance premiums from rising, yet pretends it can regulate the temperature of the globe to 2°C. The climate is thus viewed by the public as a system that can be brought into a state of calm simply by switching off human-made influences.”
Some of us of course ask how is it that some people can be brought to the point of believing such absurdity? A new standard of public-dumbing-down has unquestionably been reached.
Indeed Maxeiner makes us realize that one has to be quite gullible on a variety of issues to believe the State can regulate climate. It’s official:
The State is now responsible for our weather”.
But accountable for bad weather, however, will always be the citizens and their lifestyles. Get ready to sacrifice.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIndeed here in Germany the media have stepped up the dramatic reporting in the wake of Deutsche Welle’s international conference on journalism and climate, reported here: Journalism for Dummkopfs.Driving home yesterday I heard a report on publicly funded German NDR News radio, asking a climate expert (paraphrasing):
Are the recent, numerous weather extremes seen worldwide ominous signs of the climate catastrophe?
NDR went on to mention the weather anomalies in Moscow, Pakistan, China and the local floods in the eastern part of Germany, and emphasized all the death and destruction along with it (They forgot to mention the severe cold in South America). Fortunately, the data tells the opposite story.
Cyclones and storms near all-time lows
Yet anyone taking a closer look will see that all the extraordinary drama is confined to the newsrooms, and is not what’s going on outside.  The latest tropical cyclone energy index shows that cyclones are near all-time lows. Where are all the big cyclones we were told would be coming in the wake of Katrina?

Nasty weather extremes have always occurred, and there are no statistics to show they’ve picked up. The number of deaths resulting from weather and natural disasters is also declining. There are many factors involved here, but the sky fell more often back then than today.
No upward trend in storms and bad weather since 1850
What about tornados in the USA? The following graphic also shows a downward trend. http://www.oism.org/pproject/s33p36.htm

Indeed looking at the top 10 weather catsatrophes in the USA, the worst ones happened long ago. See Live Science here.
  1. 1900 Galveston  Hurricane, 8,000 dead
2. 2005 Hurricane Katrina, 1,836 dead
3. 1930’s Dust Bowl
4. 1906 San Francisco fire / earthquake 3,000 dead
5. 1928 Okeechobee Hurricane, at least 2,500 dead
6. 1980 Heat Wave, massive drought, and 10,000 dead
7. 1988 Heat Wave, between 5,000 and 10,000 dead.
8. 1889 Johnstown Flood, leveled 1,600 homes, killing 2,209
9. 1871 Peshtigo Fire; scorched 12 towns and left 1,200 dead
10. 1925 Tri-State Tornado, nearly 700 dead
But let’s not focus only on the USA, where statistics are easy to get. Let’s look at other parts of the world. Now here’s a graphic (sorry about the quality) showing cyclone activity in the bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea from 1890 until 2000. Looks downward to me. Here the vertical axis shows the annual frequency of cyclones and the x-axis shows the year. The dark line is the 10-year moving average.

Fewer people than ever are dying from weather extremes
And what about deaths globally? With all the bad climate change and growing populations, you’d think people would be getting killed on a massive scale. The following graphic shows the opposite is true.
http://www.disastercenter.com/disaster/TOP100K.html

All the panic is in the newsrooms
So why do some believe that extreme weather events are occurring more often than ever and that more people are dying and suffering? This is because the media stories have increased dramatically over the years, as they report on every Tiny Tim storm out there as if it were a Cat 5.  It’s overhyped.

Mounting media reports

The above graphic shows the number of newspaper reports about climate change, which is often cited as the reason for every weather anomaly happening out there. Fortunately, things on this big blue planet of ours have been quieter weatherwise, and people have caught on with respect to what all the media hype is about.
All the commotion is coming from the over-agitated folks in the newrooms.

"Climate change is becoming hard to ignore. Extreme weather has grown more frequent. Scientists are loudly and urgently sounding the alarm – and people have noticed. The 10-day Extinction Rebellion protests were the biggest act of mass civil disobedience in the UK for generations. The protests, by people drawn from all sections of society, are sure to have a lasting impact. This month has seen the most mentions of climate change in the British media since the landmark Paris agreement in 2015. The country’s political class has been at pains to show it has been moved by the unprecedented outpouring of political feeling. But politicians need to overhaul policy in a far more substantial way than is currently envisaged to stop net emissions of greenhouse gases. The question is not whether this country should achieve a net zero target, but when. Presently the UK is committed in law to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% by 2050 compared to 1990 levels. This is not ambitious enough. Last year’s UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report suggested that to limit the warming effect to 1.5C, global CO2 emissions must reach net zero by around 2050. Next week the UK’s Committee on Climate Change is expected to formally recommend the government goes further. Extinction Rebellion (XR) would like the UK to reach zero by 2025. Underlying this ambition is a commendable sentiment but the target is impractical. Britain, as the first country to industrialise and therefore responsible for a large historical stock of carbon dioxide emissions, ought to aspire to reach the UN’s 2050 goal faster, but not as fast as XR demands.  This is not a flight of fancy. The costs of renewable energy have come down, with falls in the costs of wind, solar and batteries that are much bigger and faster than were until recently thought possible. The example of organisations that have set bold decarbonising agendas, such as the National Farmers’ Union, should be applauded and emulated on a national scale. Norway has agreed a net zero goal by 2030; Sweden by 2045. If other modern European societies are willing to accept the costs of transitioning to a greener and sustainable existence, it is hard to see why the UK could not. It must be acknowledged that having a goal is not the same as meeting one. Projections show the UK will, on its current trajectory, miss its legally binding carbon budgets for 2023-32. The government’s own advisers last year warned that to deliver decarbonisation in the most cost-effective way, even to meet the 80% reduction target, the UK must achieve deeper emissions cuts than those currently set. Putting off difficult decisions will only increase the cost of mitigating and adapting to a decarbonised global economy in the decades to come. What has been heartening is that the climate protests have been rooted in facts taken from UN reports, official statistics and government papers. The demonstrations worked because their supporters had arguments that resonated and could be easily understood. Whether this translates into votes for XR candidates in European elections will be worth watching. Meanwhile the school strikers have made their own set of uncompromising demands, with a youthful energy that could not be written off. Theirs too is a reasonable reaction to an emergency that politicians are staring at but seem unable to see. If those in power did not respond to recent protests, they risked losing a generation of voters not prepared to accept a future decided by politicians many of whom will, by the time the scientists’ predictions come true, be dead. Remarkably, with a US president who does not “listen to the science” and disrupts international cooperation on climate change, green activism seems to be gathering momentum and has not only shifted the global discourse but also put pressure on decision-makers to change their policies."

============================
Are European Winters Going To Stay Warm? By Matti Vooro
North America’s winters have been getting colder since 2006, and Europe had its two warmest winters ever in 2007 and 2008 as the AO, NAO and AMO were all positive. All this may be changing over the next several decades. Cooling was already evident after 2007 as both the winter AO and NAO went negative. 
Figure 1 shows the European winter temperature departures, land and sea, for years 1948 -2009.  The graph shows above normal temperature anomalies in the  period 1948-1964, followed by a cooler period 1962-1987 when the temperature anomalies were mostly below normal except when they were briefly interrupted by a warm period in the first half of the 1970’s due to a number of years with a warm or positive AO. This was then followed by a warm period 1987-2007. Winter temperatures started to decline after 2007.
Figure 1: Impact of winter AO and winter AMO on European winters 
Figure 2 shows again the European winter temperature departures (land and sea) together with the winter AO and winter AMO Indices. Europe‘s climate seems to be significantly affected by AO and AMO. The drop in winter temperature deviations as the winter AO went strongly negative is especially noticeable in the winters of 2009, 2010 and 2011. AMO is still positive or warm.
Figure 2: Correlation with winter AO, winter NAO and European winter temperature anomalies.
Figure 3 shows a correlation between winter NAO and winter AO and both are reflected in the European winter temperatures. One is a subset of the other. The negative phase of NAO implies high pressure anomaly over Iceland, low pressure anomaly over sub-tropical Atlantic, weakened mid-latitude easterlies, colder over Northern Europe, milder over Greenland, colder and snowier for eastern US. This was the dominant phase from the mid 1950s through late 1970s. The negative AO, NAO and AMO seem to be returning.
Figure 3
The annual and monthly AO data can be found here.
The figures below show how the variation in the number of negative or cool winter NAO’s affected the cool and warm periods in the past.
1920 – 1940: 9 negative or cool winter NAO years [WARM PERIOD]
1950 – 1970: 14 negative or cool winter NAO years [COLD PERIOD]
1980 – 2009: 8 negative or cool winter NAO years [WARM PERIOD]
Figure 4 supplied by the NOAA shows the change in the winter AO from basically being positive from 1989 to 2008 to now becoming strongly negative.

Last cool period for Europe
Figure 5 shows the European winter temperature [land and sea] and the winter AO index for the years 1962-1987, the last cool period in Europe. During this time  17 or 2/3 of the winters were below norm  and had an average mean temperature departure of -0.14°C (range of -1.28°C to +0.93°C).  During the  22 years after this period  , the average mean winter temperature was  + 0.63°C with a range of +1.54°C to -0.27° C. 
Figure 5
Recent historical European winter temperature departures from 1961-1990 base for the years 1998 -2009
Figure 6 shows the European winter temperature departure [land and sea] and the winter AO and AMO index   more recently for the years 1998 -2008. Notice that there has been no significant increase in temperature departures other than 2007-2008 and the temperature anomalies have actually started to decline as the AO stared to decline after 2007 and have done so for the last 3 years and possibly 4 years if 2011 is

 Figure 6

I have estimated the 2010 winter anomaly. It is bound to be negative as UK 2010 winter temperature dropped by 1.57 °C over 2009. Table of recent historical European winter temperature departures (land and sea) from 1961-1990 base for the years 1998 -2009
1998  1.23°C
1999  0.45
2000  0.63
2001  1.12
2002  0.67
2003 -0.06
2004  0.65
2005  0.60
2006  0.12
2007  1.54
2008  1.34
2009  0.52
2010  -1.0 (estimated, not available until May 2011)
2011  not available
The average mean winter temperature anomaly during this most recent period of 1998 to2009 was 0.73°C while during the previous cooler period it was – 0.14°C or almost a full degree cooler. La Nina winters have not been exceptionally cold for Europe.  Seven of the last La Nina winters have been above normal and the average anomaly for the last four was o.89°C well above the 0.73°C average above. The 2011 winter anomaly will be down because of the cold December 2010
Data source
All of the above European winter temperature departure data can be found at the following web page of European Environment Agency.
Final comments
I find no evidence in the field during the post 2007 period to support the IPCC prediction that “The warming in northern Europe is likely to be largest in winter…”.  The flat global temperatures for the last 10 years and the recent cooling since about 2006-2007 seem to be consistent with the cooling taking place now all over Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, as the natural planetary cycles enter their cool mode. Once the North Atlantic ocean SST and AMO start to contribute to the global cooling in a more significant way, the global temperatures of the western coast of Europe and the Arctic will be the cooling  more consistently. This cooler period could last 30 years as they have done nearly 20 times during the last 500 years.

 There’s been talk recently about a new scare that environmentalists have come up with to replace the all-but-defunct AGW scare.  The evil villains are, again, the very thing that have made our lives immensely better: INDUSTRY. The new scare is: industry is destroying biodiversity.   
Today at least two of Germany’s leading online news outlets are reporting on industry’s threat to biodiversity, based on a UN study. Both Stern here and Die Zeit have almost the same title:   
UN: Corporations Driving Ruthless Destruction of Nature   
And both articles are almost identical, indicating they were likely press releases from the UN itself. According to Die Zeit:   
Species, even complete ecosystems, are disappearing at an unprecedented speed. Companies refuse to protect nature, the damage is in the trillions of euros.   
Species are dying 100 times faster than previously assumed. The environmental damage that is caused by the world’s 3000 leading companies is estimated by the UN to be 1.7 trillion euros, this from a study from the UN Environmental Program UNEP.

According to UN Environment Director Achim Steiner:   
The natural capital of the planet is being destroyed on a massive scale.   
Many economists are still blind to the enormous impact on the diversity of animals, plants and other forms of life and their role in the function of the ecosystem.   
The UN study says that awareness for environmental protection is increasing the most in Africa with 50% of company managers viewing environmental pollution as a threat to their business, 45% in Latin America and only 20% in Europe.   
The UN study will be made public at the International Conference for Species and Biodiversity on Tuesday in London.   
Readers ought to recall how it’s the UN itself and government politics based on UN climate fear mongering  are actually in large part responsible for their claimed massive destruction of nature. Read:
Europe’s Latest Green Megafolly. Burning Forests To Save The Planet!  
And maybe the UN has realised that it wasn’t getting anywhere by nagging and blaming the citizens of the planet. Now it probably thinks it can get more support by demonising industry.

"The fact of the matter is finally settled. Not the fact that if we do not stop putting carbon into the atmosphere our children will starve. That was settled three decades ago. Rather that the only way to prevent our extinction is through mass participation civil disobedience – thousands of people breaking the laws of our governments until they are forced take action to protect us. In less than a year Extinction Rebellion has gone from 15 people in a room to creating the biggest organised civil disobedience campaign in British history. In the past two weeks more than a thousand people have been arrested and as a result the climate and ecological crisis is finally on the political agenda. Everyone from the Labour party to the Sun newspaper is accepting we are right – we face the destruction of the next generation unless immediate emergency action is taken. For millions of people this week the penny has finally dropped – this is real and it’s terrifyingly serious. Even Michael Gove says he is hearing the message and held a meeting with XR on Tuesday.  None of this was unplanned. Extinction Rebellion didn’t come out the blue. Two years ago a group of researchers and activists started to meet to seriously consider two questions – why has campaigning failed so catastrophically over the past generation and how can we make it work. There are no more important questions facing our society and the global community. Drawing on the groundbreaking research of Erica Chenoweth and Maria Stephan (Why Civil Resistance Works), we came to the conclusion that the only way to overcome entrenched political power is through extensive campaigns of large-scale nonviolent direct action. In January this year I produced a 30-page paper for XR which formed the basis of the strategy of the past two weeks of mass disruption in London. The document has now been made into a booklet. The strategy is based upon three observations. Firstly that only through disruption, the breaking of laws, do you get the attention you need. Secondly only through sacrifice – the willingness to be arrested and go to prison – do people take seriously what you are saying. And thirdly only through being respectful to ourselves, the public and the police, do we change the hearts and minds of our opponents, which makes it easier for them to negotiate with us. Specifically the strategy – the “civil resistance model” as we call it – needs to involve several key elements in order for successful outcomes to be optimised. Firstly you need a lot of people – thousands need to be involved. You need to go to the capital city because that is where the rich and powerful are – the government, big business and the media. You need to break the law – sit in the road or glue yourself to the entrance of a building and such like. Unlike A to B marches this is what gets attention. You have to stay strictly nonviolent. Indulging in violence and aggressive language excludes vulnerable groups – the old and young – from participation. Crucially it has to go on day after day. Like a labour strike you have to impose economic and reputational damage on the opponent over an extended period. Finally it has to be fun – many more people are attracted to celebratory cultural spaces than narrowly political ones. Of course, this does not always guarantee success but it is vastly more likely to do so than the alternatives. In the real world you have a limited number of options to choose from and a limited amount of time in which to choose. Conventional campaigning – sending emails, payments to NGOs and more reports – is not going to stop the outrageous destruction of our natural world. It is not going to stop our children entering the hell of social breakdown. It’s time to get real. We need agreement on what works on the basis of the social science – just as we insist on following the natural science on the climate crisis. Nothing written here is new. Extinction Rebellion is humbly following in the tradition of Gandhi and Martin Luther King. We are simply rediscovering what people do when they have had enough of failure and really want to make a difference. Dozens of people have come up to me to tell me they have just had the best week of their lives. And that highlights maybe the most important finding of social science – that after covering basic material needs humans beings are not made happier through consuming more stuff. Meaning and happiness – a sense of wholeness and calm – come from engaging with others as a community in making the world a better place. Instead of living the lie that there is nothing we can do we now have a pathway to effective action. Go out with others and break the law. Let’s get on it while there’s still time. •Roger Hallam is a founder of Extinction Rebellion and is standing in the European elections as a Climate and Ecological Emergency independent candidate"
"Should the UK declare a “climate emergency” that would inform public policy and the national budget? The question was been debated in parliament on Wednesday, with the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn declaring the government should “embrace hope” through stronger actions on greenhouse gas emissions, and the environment secretary, Michael Gove, calling the problem of climate change “an emergency”. Outside parliament, the activist group Extinction Rebellion has brought London motor traffic to a standstill on several occasions, and the youth activist Greta Thunberg has held meetings with leading politicians, including Gove and Corbyn but excluding the prime minister. These events have taken place while the courts have given the go-ahead for a new runway expansion at Heathrow, rejecting the UK’s participation in the Paris climate change agreement as the basis on which transport policy should be decided. Meanwhile the government’s statutory advisers on climate change are likely to warn on Thursday that reducing greenhouse gases to net zero by 2050 is achievable but will require sizeable changes in public consumption habits, industry and government policy. The UK’s emissions of greenhouse gases have fallen rapidly in recent decades, but the reasons have been complex. One has been the shift away from manufacturing and towards services, including financial services, which are lucrative but light on emissions, as the basis for economic growth and prosperity. This has come at a cost – the UK coal mining industry was nearly annihilated in the 1980s and 1990s, and other areas of heavy industry shed more than a million jobs in the late 1990s and 2000s. But other areas of industry, such as renewable energy and research and development into low-carbon forms of technology, have shown rapid growth. There are estimated to be about half a million jobs in the low-carbon economy in the UK, though estimates vary widely depending on what jobs are classed as “green”. Tonnes of carbon dioxide emitted per person have tumbled in the UK, while for other countries the equivalent emissions have risen. In the UK, the shift away from coal to natural gas – from the North Sea – in the 1990s was a key factor. In many developing countries, by contrast, in recent decades the shift has been towards bringing electrical power to those who previously were denied it. Taking people out of “energy poverty” has been a key factor in economic growth in the developing world, benefiting all sectors of society. Yet it is possible for societies to move away from greenhouse gases while achieving growth in gross domestic product, as the UK’s recent history shows. This “decoupling” has been heralded by the UK government as an example to other countries, and the growth of renewable energy and much greater energy efficiency have been key to achieving this success. Renewable energy, in the form of onshore and offshore wind and solar panels, was subsidised by successive governments from the 1990s, helping its early growth and boosting developments in the technology that brought down costs and made it more easily adopted. In recent years those subsidies in the UK have been slashed, but worldwide the costs of renewables have come down rapidly, making them more accessible to all countries. Historic emissions have long been a bone of contention at international talks on climate change, which are carried on annually and in 2015 resulted in the landmark Paris agreement, which required countries to stay within at least 2C of global warming, with an aspiration to limit warming to no more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. For many years, developing countries argued that one reason for wealthy countries to take on the lion’s share of emissions cuts was their greater responsibility for emissions before the 1980s, when climate change began to be recognised as a problem. In recent years, however, the rapidly rising emissions from developing countries such as China have dwarfed the UK’s own historic emissions, and this trend is likely to continue. • This article was amended on 3 May 2019.

"News footage showed people boating where they once walked, homes and cars filled with muddy water, volunteers searching for lost pets. Thousands of people in eastern Canada have been forced from their homes as heavy rains and meltwater cause unprecedented flood evacuations. One of the worst-hit areas was a Montreal suburb where more than 6,000 people were evacuated after a dike burst on Sunday. A further 3,000 people were evacuated in other parts of Quebec, and in Ontario and New Brunswick, hundreds more are waiting out the floods in hotels and shelters.  “This year’s flooding is very extreme,” said Ursule Boyer-Villemaire, an associate professor at the Université du Québec à Montréal who specializes in disaster management and climate resilience planning. Climate change means that catastrophic flooding will only become more common, but experts say the events of the past week highlight the fact that Canada has still not done enough to prepare for such disasters. The current mass evacuations have forced Canadian politicians at every level to confront this dramatic evidence of climate change in a federal election year. Speaking on Sunday night, Justin Trudeau, the prime minister, suggested that using federal money to help relocate communities affected by flooding was a possibility. “Once we secure the situation through this spring flooding season, we will have to have significant reflections and conversations on how we move forward,” he said, according to the Canadian Press. This is not the first time Quebec has seen large-scale flooding: in 2017, Quebec rivers reached similar levels. The fact that two so-called “hundred-year floods” occurred so close together has climate preparedness experts concerned. Rapid temperature increases in spring and huge variation in the amount of precipitation, two factors in the flood, are related to climate change, said Laura Coristine, a biologist at the University of British Columbia. But Canada has done little to prepare for flooding that is likely to become even more common as the planet continues to warm, she said. “Responding to disaster is going to be a lot more expensive than being proactive in vulnerable sites.” Ontario’s premier, Doug Ford, whose government has fought hard against the imposition of a country-wide carbon tax aimed at curbing emissions, toured flooded areas near the Ottawa River on Friday night. According to the Canadian Press, Ford did not explicitly mention climate change but did say “something is going on and we have to be conscious of it”. Meanwhile, the leaders of Quebec and New Brunswick, the other affected provinces, are starting to talk about permanently relocating communities in flood-prone areas. That is not a simple thing to consider, said political scientist Daniel Henstra, an associate professor at the University of Waterloo who studies flooding in Canada: when a similar strategy was tried in Calgary after 2013 flooding, only 30% of homeowners in a high-risk flood area took the offered buyout so they could move. Currently, Quebec is offering residents C$200,000 (US$150,000) to move, but that may not even cover the mortgage for many. There are some other options, Henstra said, such as building flood barriers to keep the water in the river. “These types of barriers are really expensive to install and maintain,” he said “and they cause environmental impacts downstream.” A more widely adopted strategy, globally speaking, is just to plan for flooding and keep people from building in flood plains. More extreme attempts to get them to move, such as mandating a buyout, could be politically damaging, but that might be what it takes to get everyone out of a flood-prone area, said Henstra. “These are the kind of tough decisions we’re facing,” he says, “and we’re just at the beginning of having those hard conversations.” • This story was corrected on 30 April to delete an erroneous suggestion that the 2017 floods did not hit the Ottawa-Gatineau region."

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt used to be that scientists communicated their knowledge through reliable professional journals, which then communicated to the media.
Apparently climate scientists are getting increasingly desperate, and so they are now going directly to the very bottom of the media chain and giving interviews to the mass-market, most sensationalist of the tabloids. Such is the latest with James E. Overland and Germany’s no. 1 tabloid Bild in a story titled:
Climatologist: Deadly Weather Chaos Will Be A Permanent Condition
Who would have ever thought it? Scientists from (once) one of the the world’s most prestigious scientific organisations, now have to go to the yellowist of tabloids to be heard.
Bild, the flagship publication owned by Axel Springer, has a circulation of over 4 million, more than the Wall Street Journal and USA Today combined. It is the paper of choice among the lesser educated in Germany.
In the Bild interview James Overland warned: “Things are going to get a lot worse.”
In the past, warm events were cited as mounting evidence of man-made global warming. But as these events diminish and cold events start piling up, desperate global warming scientists like Overland have been forced to concoct dubious science theories, and now claim the cold events are suddenly sure signs of warming. This is what Overland tells Bild over and over. Bild starts with:
Now a US climate scientist warns: ‘This turbulent weather is only the beginning!’ “
Overland claims that all the cold weather can be explained by a newly found theory: The melting of the Arctic sea has led to a complete collapse of Arctic and Northern Hemisphere air patterns – “the biggest collapse since the start of weather records 145 years ago.”
Overland warns:
The disappearance of the currents paired with the extreme winters are signs of something bigger and organised. It is almost frightening.”
It obvious by now that Overland’s “climate science” and tabloids were made for each other.
No absolute evidence!
Bild asked if there is any data to support this. Overland says:



<!--
google_ad_client = ""ca-pub-3545577860068042"";

//-->




We still don’t have any absolute evidence, but we have clearly measured that there is 30% less ice cover in the Arctic.”
Therein lies the beauty of tabloid science. Proof? Evidence? Data? That’s for scientific journals. Tabloids don’t need that sort of stuff. Bild then asks Overland about what to expect in the future.
In 30 years 80% of the Arctic ice may be gone. The extreme weather will intensify further. And the dramatic changes of the atmospheric system are obvious.”
And adds:
All our climate models show that the unpredictability of the weather is increasing dramatically as our planet heats up.”
He claims the models show it. They all but confirms the science. But then he adds the models are not able to detect surprises. For example, he was surprised by the 2007 Arctic ice shrinkage. And now they have just found the latest surprise – unforeseen by their models:
And now we are experiencing the next surprise, the collapse of the Arctic current and the flow of cold air to the south. It is alarming. We are entering new meteorological territory: The extreme weather is going to get a lot worse.“
Rahmstorf’s snowjob.
PIK snowjob
Everyone in Germany knows who is behind this Bild snowjob – Stefan Rahmstorf of the alarmist, science front-group Potsdam Institute For Climate Impact Research (PIK).
That’s the institute that came out with a similar bogus theory to explain the cold winters, read here. But later even Rahmstorf backpedalled on this dubious Arctic sea ice – cold winter connection, read here. Yet Overland thinks even science rejected by Rahmstorf is good enough.
If you can’t make the case in the professional journals, then you take it to the tabloids and the masses and hope that mass popularity will win the day for your alarmist views.
It really is sad to see a scientist fall to that level of scientific destitution. Postulating is one thing, but calling postulates fact without evidence is quackery. Period.
In case there are any remaining questions as to the seriousness of Bild, here’s what they wrote in 2007:
But the heating of the earth is accelerating! If it gets 2 degrees warmer than today, then hundreds of millions of people will thirst and starve to death. Or they’ll drown in flood waves from swelling oceans.”
Like I say, made for each other.

"The world’s oceans have become more stormy during the past three decades, according to the largest and most detailed study of its kind. The findings add to concerns that as the world gets hotter, extreme events such as storms and floods could become more frequent and more devastating in their impact.  Slight increases in average wave height and wind speed were recorded in oceans across the globe, with the strongest effects in the Southern Ocean. The study relied on data from 31 satellites and more than 80 ocean buoys collected between 1985 and 2018, with about 4 billion observations. Extreme winds in the Southern Ocean have increased by 1.5 metres per second, or 8%, over the past 30 years, while the highest waves have increased in height by 30 centimetres, or 5%. The strongest winds increased in the equatorial Pacific and Atlantic and the North Atlantic by about 0.6 metres per second. Prof Ian Young, the first author of the work from the University of Melbourne, said: “Although increases of 5 and 8% might not seem like much, if sustained into the future such changes to our climate will have major impacts.” Young said that increases in wave height could lead to more serious flooding and coastal erosion, and put offshore structures such as wind farms at risk of damage. The researchers said the observations were in line with predictions by climate models and from historical records that suggested that as the world got hotter, weather and storms became more extreme, although the relationship was complex and not fully understood. “The role climate change plays in wind speed and hence wave height is still not clear,” said Young. Others said that the role of global warming in the latest observations was yet to be established. “It’s a bit difficult to extrapolate these finding to the wider picture,” said Dr Paulo Ceppi, of the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London. “During 30-year periods you can still have pretty significant natural variations in winds.” Ceppi said that the observed changes in the Southern Ocean were likely to be driven by the hole in the ozone layer, in the Antarctic stratosphere, to a greater extent than global warming – although this could also be contributing. The study, published in the journal Science, updates previous work from the same team published nearly a decade ago. A major challenge in compiling long-running data series, they said, is accounting for significant changes in technology and data processing over the time period. For the earliest part of the time period the coverage was not as extensive and the measurements were less accurate. The scientists needed to rule out the possibility that they were simply seeing more violent storms because there are now more satellites to spot them, for instance. The findings also suggest that conditions in the Southern Ocean are becoming more treacherous for ships. According to Young, more intense storms circling the Southern Ocean can also generate larger ocean swells that propagate across the Indian, Pacific and South Atlantic. “Increasing wave conditions in the Southern Ocean impact regions across the globe,” he said."
"Support for Extinction Rebellion in the UK has quadrupled in the past nine days as public concern about the scale of the ecological crisis grows. Since the wave of protests began more than a week ago, 30,000 new backers or volunteers have offered their support to the environmental activist group. In the same period it has raised almost £200,000 – mostly in donations of between £10 and £50 – reaching a total of £365,000 since January. The group said the figures showed the public was waking up to the scale of the crisis, adding that pressure was growing on politicians to act. Extinction Rebellion is a protest group that uses non-violent civil disobedience to campaign on environmental issues. Launched in October 2018, with an assembly at Parliament Square to announce a 'declaration of rebellion' against the UK Government, the group has staged regular demonstrations against current environmental policies. More than 1,000 activists were arrested in April 2019 after protesters occupied four sites across London, as well as blocking roads, disrupting a railway line and conducting a protest at Heathrow. Other demonstrations have included a semi-naked protest inside the House of Commons and blockading streets in London, Cardiff, Leeds, Bristol and Glasgow. The group says climate breakdown threatens all life on Earth, and so it is rebelling against politicians who “have failed us”, to provoke radical change that will stave off a climate emergency. The movement has become global with groups set up in countries include the US, Spain, Australia, South Africa and India. Martin Belam “What this shows is that Extinction Rebellion has spoken to people who have been wanting to act on this for such a long time but haven’t known how,” said a spokesperson for the group. “The debate on this is over – ordinary people are now saying it is time for politicians to act with real urgency.” Diane Abbott backed the demonstrators in a speech to the eco-activists in Parliament Square on Wednesday. The shadow home secretary told a crowd of up to 100 protesters – one of whom towered above the group on six-foot stilts while others wielded banners – that she acknowledged a “climate emergency”, one of the group’s key demands. Abbott also emphasised that MPs needed to come together to host a “broad conversation” on one of the activists’ requests to bring the country’s greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2025. She said: “I wouldn’t be in politics if I didn’t think change was possible. If things can change on the issues that I campaigned on when I was a very young woman, I think that things can change … on climate change and we can move towards the 2025 target.” Abbott suggested meeting Extinction Rebellion for a detailed discussion of policy aims – a proposal met with rapturous applause. She reiterated her commitment to learning and listening to protesters and said that, in the long term, climate change was more important than Brexit.  The group’s organisers said the number of people on the streets for the protests had dwindled from a high over the Easter bank holiday weekend but that the number of people who had signed up to support future demonstrations had risen from 10,000 before the protest to 40,000 by Wednesday morning. The Extinction Rebellion spokesperson said the group was also becoming more diverse – attracting more working-class and black and minority ethnic supporters. “But that is definitely a work in progress – there is still more work to do in that area,” she added. The figures came a day after Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish student who sparked a global youth-based movement when she began a “climate strike” outside Sweden’s parliament last year, visited Westminster. In a speech to MPs, she said: “You lied to us. You gave us false hope. You told us that the future was something to look forward to. You don’t listen to the science because you are only interested in solutions that will enable you to carry on like before.” Extinction Rebellion’s youth group wrote to MPs on Wednesday, as parliament restarted after the Easter break, pleading with them to act swiftly to address the crisis. The letter states: “We are writing to ask you to hear the science, to feel the public’s change of heart and to act now to save our futures … Now the time has arrived to stand up and be counted – you are our elected representatives and we need your help.” More than 1,000 Extinction Rebellion activists have been arrested in the past week in a campaign of mass non-violent direct action to highlight how little time there is to halt manmade ecological breakdown. Protesters occupied four sites across the capital and staged acts of civil disobedience including blocking roads, disrupting a train line and conducting a protest at Heathrow. On Tuesday, the group said it intended to carry out further action in the next few days – including blocking roads in and around the City of London on Thursday. It is debating how and when to stop this stage of the protests. On Tuesday, senior Labour figures backed the protesters, likening them to the Chartists, suffragettes and anti-apartheid activists. Speaking in response to an urgent question in the Commons, the shadow energy minister Barry Gardiner said alongside the school strikes, the Extinction Rebellion protests were reminiscent of previous struggles. “All of those victories were won by citizens uniting against injustice, making their voice heard. And Extinction Rebellion and the school climate strikers are doing just that,” he said. Inside the chamber, the former Labour leader Ed Miliband said the government must declare a climate emergency and introduce a “green new deal”. Responding for the government, Claire Perry, the energy minister, rejected the idea of a climate emergency – “I don’t know what that would entail” – and said she had reservations about the Extinction Rebellion protests. She said though she was glad such arguments were being heard, they had caused “disruption for many hundreds and thousands of hardworking Londoners and had required a heavy policing presence. “I worry that many of the messages we are hearing ignore the progress that is being made, and as such make people fearful for the future rather than hopeful.”"

UPDATE: Lubos Motl here.
What is it with these intolerant zealots who refuse to learn anything from history?
Right smack on the anniversary of Kristallnacht, German Parliamentarians, in a frontal assault, are now openly calling out and branding scientists for the crime of scientific dissent. These out-of-control parliamentarians are demanding that the German government take a position against dissenting views in climate science.
What a number of zealous German parliamentarians are calling for borders on a call to launch a science pogrom.
The climate dogmatists are finding it increasingly difficult to cope with the scepticism, free speech, and dissent now spreading in Germany and Europe, and therefore want to stamp it out using the might of the federal government – and now.
The upcoming 3rd International Climate and Energy Conference, REGISTER HERE, has got them spooked as well.
Journalist Dirk Maxeiner here brings our attention to the latest development on the exploding intolerance that has gripped certain factions in Germany. Maxeiner publishes the text of a query written by the Green parliamentarians sent to the German government, read below.
As the text shows, branding of climate science dissenters has begun. Fred Singer and EIKE (European Institute For Climate and Energy) are the first to feel the sting of the denier-branding-iron. German greenshirts have sent the bloodhounds afterFred Singer because of his speech in a German parliamentary forum discussion on the economic impacts of climate protection held by the FDP Free Democrats, the junior coalition partner of Angela Merkel’s CDU/FDP coalition government. Read background here.
Some may think that I’m being over-dramatic here. I am not. The situation that the few, yet very vocal, sceptics face here is precarious. Just read the following query written by a faction of Parliamentarians to the German Government, translated of the German text presented at Dirk Maxeiner’s site (emphasis added, and note the use of the term “denier” throughout the text):
——————————————————————————————————–
Short Query [from the Green faction of Parliamentarians to the German Government]
from Parliamentarians Dr. Hermann Ott, Bärbel Höhn, Hans Josef Fell, Sylvia Kotting-Uhl, Oliver Kriseher, Undine Kurth (Quedlinburg), Nicole Maisch, Dorothea Steiner and the Parliamentary party BÜNDNIS 90/DIE GRÜNEN (ALLIANCE 90 / THE GREENS)
Subject: Deniers of climate change in the coalition government
The so-called “climate change sceptics” or “climate change deniers” for years have been a permanent fixture in American politics. Their influence on American politics is not insignificant. They are mainly supported and funded by the fossil fuels industry like Exxon (Esso) or Koch Industries. Now it appears that their influence is now growing in Germany and in Europe. In the past weeks various press releases and other reports have appeared in the “Financial Times Deutschland” and news magazine “Der Spiegel” about on how certain climate change deniers were given a discussion forum by the CDU and FDP Bundestag’s factions and that some parliamentarians of the ruling CDU and FDP factions were sympathetic to the ideas put forth by climate denier Fred Singer. This and a range of other activities by the so-called climate sceptics in Germany compel us to ask the German Government for its assessment.
We ask the German Federal Government:
1. Is the German Government aware of a scientifically published paper that has been subjected to peer review that questions climate change caused by man, and that is supported by scientific data?
2. In the view of the German Government’s leadership, is there a scientific discussion on whether climate change is taking place and whether man has a decisive impact on climate?

3. Is the German Government aware of the publications from American physicist Fred Singer on the subject of climate protection? How does the German Government view the scientific reputation of Mr Singer in regards to climate protection?
4. For the German Government, do the arguments made by Fred Singer and other arguments presented have merit and are they “enlightening”? How do you assess the statements by Mr Singer that “Politicians that are embedded in climate change are more dangerous than climate change itself”?
5. Is the German Government aware of the ideas Mr Singer has previously promoted? What is your view on the fact that he, for example, questioned the hazards of passive smoke, or that he contested the fact the ozone layer was damaged by CFCs, or that he trivialized acid rain? With this background, how does the German Government judge the credibility of Fred Singer’s activities with regards to climate protection?
6. Is the German Government aware of who financed Mr Singer for his activities? Is the Federal Government aware of the funders who – like Exxon und Koch Industries in den USA – fund the activities of the climate change deniers in Germany?
7. Does the German Government share the opinion that events involving Mr Singer provide a forum for the pure interests of the fossil fuel industry, and thus enhance their unscientific work and non-serious activities?
8. Are there voices within the German Government who question the anthropogenic causes of climate change?
9. How does the German Government view the activities of the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) with regards to climate change? EIKE is supported by Fred Singer. In the Federal Government’s view, does the Institute work on the scientific question regarding the subject of climate change?
10. Is the German Government aware of whether climate denier conferences are also being financed by public funds, for example by the Liberal Institute of the Friedrich-Naumann-Foundation?
11. Fundamentally, does the German Government approve of the use of public funds for spreading the ideas of climate deniers like Fred Singer?
Berlin, 3 November 2010
Renate Künast, Jürgen Trittin and Fraction
————————————————————————————–
There it is folks. All this because some people are asking questions about the science. These Green radicals are scared crapless.  Their media hacks did everything possible to slander and destroy Fred Singer, EIKE, and other dissenting German scientists – but to no avail.
Now for the first time they’re going after the liberty-oriented Liberal Institute of the Friedrich-Naumann-Foundation. They are de facto demanding a declaration of war on scientists and groups that have a different opinion. This level of intolerance has not been seen in Germany in over 65 years. This is their “Either-you’re-with-us-or-against us” declaration to Angela Merkel’s coalition government made up of the CDU Christian Democratic Union and FDP Free Democratic Party.
I hope this query backfires. It would be deserved.
Read here on what happens when someone dares to speak up in Germany.

"April has been quite the month for climate action. The organisation I co-founded, the UK Student Climate Network, held its third Youth Strike 4 Climate demonstrations just two weeks ago which for the third month in succession saw tens of thousands take to the streets across the UK demanding climate justice and a Green New Deal. Extinction Rebellion also kicked off a huge act of extended nonviolent civil disobedience by reclaiming public spaces in London and causing widespread disruption to protest climate breakdown. Many hope this could be a crucial turning point in Britain’s political approach to addressing the climate crisis.  Thousands of people taking positive climate action for the very first time are feeling empowered by bringing their rage and frustration at climate inaction to the streets, visibly demonstrating their discontent. Looking at those taking part in all of these actions shows the potential of an emerging group to drive necessary legislative change. At the youth strikes I look around and see today’s brave and courageous climate activists – and tomorrow’s voters. Meanwhile, lots of current voters have been frequenting Marble Arch, Parliament Square and other sites previously occupied by Extinction Rebellion. All of these people, alongside those engaged by TV shows such as Our Planet and Climate Change: The Facts are becoming a new voting demographic: the climate vote bloc. When we’re shielded from the truths of the climate crisis it’s impossible to understand the gravity of the situation. Both movements are doing fantastic work to make the climate a mainstream issue and help understanding of the crisis we face to spread widely. The power of grassroots, widespread climate action cannot be underestimated. When ordinary people start to organise among themselves and create communities of resistance in our schools, colleges, universities and neighbourhoods, those in positions of power begin to notice. The emergent climate movements are organising people of all ages to fight for a better world and to take the necessary steps to pressure political leaders to act. In a moment of beautiful timing – as this climate organising in the UK is coming to a crescendo – the Swedish activist and inspiration for the Fridays For Future movement, Greta Thunberg, arrived for a three-day visit to Britain. Greta’s trip included her taking part in a huge panel discussion on the new climate movement and ways to escalate it, and also delivering a rousing speech in parliament to tell MPs some hard truths about their lack of action. Crucially, there was also historic cross-party climate talks between Westminster leaders. The UK youth strikers Holly Gillibrand, George Bond and myself sat down with Greta, Jeremy Corbyn, Caroline Lucas, Vince Cable, Liz Saville-Roberts and Ian Blackford for the first climate talks of their kind in more a decade. Theresa May’s chair remained empty. We pushed political leaders to commit to and agree upon some positive first steps to start addressing the climate crisis. Tens of thousands of young climate activists forced party leaders to acknowledge the gravity of the climate crisis, driving home the need to act urgently and collaboratively. We negotiated with political leaders to commit to climate stress-testing their party manifestos against the Paris agreement, holding regular and continued cross-party talks, supporting and engaging with youth climate assemblies across the UK, and reforming the education system to address the climate crisis, as well as reinforced respective party commitments to votes at 16. We’ve achieved these victories in just three months. We’re well aware that we need actions and not just words. We know we need to keep pushing for the type of bold and courageous action required to address the climate crisis and make steps toward climate justice. We will keep calling for a Green New Deal in the months to come. The UK Student Climate Network will keep striking to ensure those elected to represent us know we’re holding them to account. We’re tomorrow’s voters and we won’t stop until we have a healthy, livable planet for each and every one of us. • Anna Taylor, 18, is co-founder of the UK Student Climate Network"

"For most of my adult life I’ve railed against “corporate capitalism”, “consumer capitalism” and “crony capitalism”. It took me a long time to see that the problem is not the adjective but the noun. While some people have rejected capitalism gladly and swiftly, I’ve done so slowly and reluctantly. Part of the reason was that I could see no clear alternative: unlike some anti-capitalists, I have never been an enthusiast for state communism. I was also inhibited by its religious status. To say “capitalism is failing” in the 21st century is like saying “God is dead” in the 19th: it is secular blasphemy. It requires a degree of self-confidence I did not possess. But as I’ve grown older, I’ve come to recognise two things. First, that it is the system, rather than any variant of the system, that drives us inexorably towards disaster. Second, that you do not have to produce a definitive alternative to say that capitalism is failing. The statement stands in its own right. But it also demands another, and different, effort to develop a new system.  Capitalism’s failures arise from two of its defining elements. The first is perpetual growth. Economic growth is the aggregate effect of the quest to accumulate capital and extract profit. Capitalism collapses without growth, yet perpetual growth on a finite planet leads inexorably to environmental calamity. Those who defend capitalism argue that, as consumption switches from goods to services, economic growth can be decoupled from the use of material resources. Last week a paper in the journal New Political Economy, by Jason Hickel and Giorgos Kallis, examined this premise. They found that while some relative decoupling took place in the 20th century (material resource consumption grew, but not as quickly as economic growth), in the 21st century there has been a recoupling: rising resource consumption has so far matched or exceeded the rate of economic growth. The absolute decoupling needed to avert environmental catastrophe (a reduction in material resource use) has never been achieved, and appears impossible while economic growth continues. Green growth is an illusion. A system based on perpetual growth cannot function without peripheries and externalities. There must always be an extraction zone – from which materials are taken without full payment – and a disposal zone, where costs are dumped in the form of waste and pollution. As the scale of economic activity increases until capitalism affects everything, from the atmosphere to the deep ocean floor, the entire planet becomes a sacrifice zone: we all inhabit the periphery of the profit-making machine. This drives us towards cataclysm on such a scale that most people have no means of imagining it. The threatened collapse of our life-support systems is bigger by far than war, famine, pestilence or economic crisis, though it is likely to incorporate all four. Societies can recover from these apocalyptic events, but not from the loss of soil, an abundant biosphere and a habitable climate. The second defining element is the bizarre assumption that a person is entitled to as great a share of the world’s natural wealth as their money can buy. This seizure of common goods causes three further dislocations. First, the scramble for exclusive control of non-reproducible assets, which implies either violence or legislative truncations of other people’s rights. Second, the immiseration of other people by an economy based on looting across both space and time. Third, the translation of economic power into political power, as control over essential resources leads to control over the social relations that surround them. In the New York Times on Sunday, the Nobel economist Joseph Stiglitz sought to distinguish between good capitalism, which he called “wealth creation”, and bad capitalism, which he called “wealth grabbing” (extracting rent). I understand his distinction. But from the environmental point of view, wealth creation is wealth grabbing. Economic growth, intrinsically linked to the increasing use of material resources, means seizing natural wealth from both living systems and future generations. To point to such problems is to invite a barrage of accusations, many of which are based on this premise: capitalism has rescued hundreds of millions of people from poverty – now you want to impoverish them again. It is true that capitalism, and the economic growth it drives, has radically improved the prosperity of vast numbers of people, while simultaneously destroying the prosperity of many others: those whose land, labour and resources were seized to fuel growth elsewhere. Much of the wealth of the rich nations was – and is – built on slavery and colonial expropriation. Like coal, capitalism has brought many benefits. But, like coal, it now causes more harm than good. Just as we have found means of generating useful energy that are better and less damaging than coal, so we need to find means of generating human wellbeing that are better and less damaging than capitalism. There is no going back: the alternative to capitalism is neither feudalism nor state communism. Soviet communism had more in common with capitalism than the advocates of either system would care to admit. Both systems are (or were) obsessed with generating economic growth. Both are willing to inflict astonishing levels of harm in pursuit of this and other ends. Both promised a future in which we would need to work for only a few hours a week, but instead demand endless, brutal labour. Both are dehumanising. Both are absolutist, insisting that theirs and theirs alone is the one true God. So what does a better system look like? I don’t have a complete answer, and I don’t believe any one person does. But I think I see a rough framework emerging. Part of it is provided by the ecological civilisation proposed by Jeremy Lent, one of the greatest thinkers of our age. Other elements come from Kate Raworth’s doughnut economics and the environmental thinking of Naomi Klein, Amitav Ghosh, Angaangaq Angakkorsuaq, Raj Patel and Bill McKibben. Part of the answer lies in the notion of “private sufficiency, public luxury”. Another part arises from the creation of a new conception of justice based on this simple principle: every generation, everywhere, shall have an equal right to the enjoyment of natural wealth. I believe our task is to identify the best proposals from many different thinkers and shape them into a coherent alternative. Because no economic system is only an economic system but intrudes into every aspect of our lives, we need many minds from various disciplines – economic, environmental, political, cultural, social and logistical – working collaboratively to create a better way of organising ourselves that meets our needs without destroying our home. Our choice comes down to this. Do we stop life to allow capitalism to continue, or stop capitalism to allow life to continue? • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"
"Cars and motorbikes running on petrol or diesel will be banned from driving in Amsterdam from 2030. The city’s council plans to phase in the change as part of a drive to clean up air pollution, which the authorities blame for shortening the life expectancy of Amsterdammers by a year.  “Pollution often is a silent killer and is one of the greatest health hazards in Amsterdam,” said the councillor responsible for the city’s traffic, Sharon Dijksma, announcing the municipality’s decision. From next year, diesel cars that are 15 years or older will be banned from going within the A10 ring road around the Dutch capital. Public buses and coaches that emit exhaust fumes will no longer enter the city centre from 2022. By 2025, the ban will be extended to pleasure crafts on its waters, mopeds and light mopeds. All traffic within the built-up area must be emission-free by 2030 under the Clean Air Action plan. The city plans to encourage its residents to switch to electric and hydrogen cars by offering charging stations to every buyer of such a vehicle. It is hoped that the second-hand electric car market will blossom in the coming years. There will need to be 16,000 to 23,000 charging stations by 2025 to make the project viable – up from the current 3,000 in the city. In large part due to heavy traffic in the cities of Amsterdam, Maastricht and Rotterdam, air pollution in the Netherlands is worse than European rules permit. There are concerns that the levels of nitrogen dioxide and particle matter emissions are causing respiratory illnesses. But the Rai Association, the automotive industry’s lobby group, condemned the plan as bizarre and regressive. A spokesman said: “Many tens of thousands of families who have no money for an electric car will soon be left out in the cold. That makes Amsterdam a city of the rich. “In 2030, about one third of the cars will be electric, we expect. But there will also be a lot of people who won’t be able to afford that by then.” In January 2018, the Dutch health council called on the government to devise an ambitious strategy to improve air quality in the Netherlands, warning that the “blanket of pollution” would cause major health problems in the country. City authorities and governments around the world are moving towards pushing cars that produce greenhouse gas emissions off their streets. Last year, Madrid began restricting access to petrol vehicles made prior to 2000 and diesel vehicles made prior to 2006. Rome has pledged to ban diesel vehicles from the city centre by 2024. The Danish government has said it wants to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030 and hybrid vehicles from 2035. "
"Zeynep Gurtin (The myths behind late motherhood, Journal, 18 April) omits one reason why there appears to be atrend for women to leave having babies until their late 30s/early 40s: that in their 20s and early 30s they may not have decided whether they want children at all, rather than just delaying having them. They may be enjoying life free of the ties and responsibility of children, working at jobs they love and have studied for and struggled to obtain – jobs they know will be touched by having children in ways that a man’s career won’t. Women are more than their biological ability to give birth, and I salute those who choose to explore and reach their own potential before deciding if they want to undertake the huge task of producing and raising another human being.Roz TreadwaySheringham, Norfolk  • I’m sorry that Zoe Williams, or anyone, felt or feels diminished over breastfeeding (The ‘breast is best’ lobby has failed women, Journal, 23 April).

Neither is pretending it’s all about individual choice. The breastfeeding debate, like that of climate change, would benefit from more systemic analysis. They have the same root problem – an economic system that aims to turn everything (water, air, life, child-rearing) into a commodity for profit and relies on the free labour of women to succeed. Formula corporations operate like fossil-fuel ones, ruthlessly pursuing billions in profits and lobbying hard against international guidelines on breast milk.

Here’s an ongoing weather event, which is supposed to be rare.
We know it’s been cold as heck in South America. In fact it’s been so cold that fish have been dying on a mass scale. This today is being reported by the German online Stern and other outlets.
Authorities say that 6 million fish have died as a result of the cold. Also read here.  This report writes:
Authorities in the eastern Bolivian province of Santa Cruz declared an alert following the death of fish in the Grande, Pirai and Ichilo rivers that run through the tropical region.
This is an “environmental catastrophe” brought on by the lowest temperatures registered in Santa Cruz in nearly half a century, Gov. Ruben Costas told reporters.
We’ve seen reports on how the cold in South America has been deadly for humans too, see here. Later reports mention 500 dead.
And it’s still cold. And it’s going to remain cold as well, see here.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDr. Roy Spencer’s site has posted the UAH MSU temperature for January 2011 and, as we see, the warm temperatures are gone. A La Nina (cool equatorial Pacific water surface temperature) is raging and is linked to playing a role in the storms now hitting Australia and the US.
Let’s recall that just a few short years ago climate “scientists” were claiming that La Ninas were expected to become rare and that the Pacific would find itself more and more in an El Nino mode. Things are turning out differently though. Time to get back to the drawing board for the 7,000th time.

And what’s with global warming causing more preciptiation? The data also suggests the opposite, at least oceanic.

Trend here is downwards for that too. Using the global warming theory, the warmth is supposed to cause more precipitation, and so this indicates the globe is cooling.
For the catastrophe junkies out there who need their daily dose of catastrophic signs, it looks like a cold turkey day today. Maybe the crack-catastrophe pushers GISS and PIK can help you.

So what could possibly cause that kind of cooling? Not a volcano, not CO2 greenhouse gases, not aerosols…
Joe just calls it weather (that happens to be well below what the climate models predicted). My bet is that it has something to do with solar cycles.
And looking at the latest Unisys SSTs, looks like we’re well on our way to a drastic drop in temperatures. http://weather.unisys.com/surface/sst_anom.html

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis year we’ve been hearing various reports of a cold winter predicted for Europe and western Russia. There has even been a report on the possibly of the coldest winter in 1000 years for parts of Russia.Maybe meteorologists there found out that Gore plans to do a lot of traveling over there, and thus have adjusted their forecasts. We all know what weather he packs in his baggage when he travels. Gore Effect.
Germany’s leading tabloid, Bild, which has a circulation that is twice the size as both the Wall Street Journal and USA Today combined, joins the fray of projecting a cold winter. It cites two German meteorologists who are predicting that Germany is about to experience one of the worst winters in a 100 years. Read here.  For the record, these 2 meteorologists are private and not government-funded ones.
Dr. Karsten Brandt of the private weather service Donnerwetter.de and Dominik Jung of the weather services Wetter.net are predicting that November and the first half of December will have mild spells, with temperatures even pushing near the 60°F mark at times. But, they warn this:
…is a harbinger of a very cold winter“
According to Bild newspaper, Jung claims:
Beginning in January it’s going to be bitter cold with nighttime temperatures under -20°C. After a short thaw in in early February, a new cold snap will roll over Germany. Winter will keep its icy grip deep into the month of March.”
Dr. Brandt projects that the Atlantic current, which pumps mild air over the continent, will break down in December and be replaced by cold easterly continental winds. These predictions are based on computer models using: data over the last 100 years, current oceanic data and volcanic activity, as well as animal migration patterns and animal winter fur. Personally I don’t believe the winter fur hypothesis.

But unlike the claimed consensus in climate science, meteorologists are not unanimous on these predictions of a cold winter. According to Bild, the state-funded German Weather Service for example predicts a normal winter, and adds:
A normal winter will feel cold because of the often mild temperatures experienced over the last 20 years.
I should have known – now global warming causes perceived cold winters!
Meanwhile yet another German meteorologist here, Thomas Globig, says there’s a 70% chance that the coming winter will be too cold. What does the US National Weather Service forecast for Europe?
2010/11 NWS winter forecast for Europe.
So expect to hear a lot about “natural variability” from the European warmists this winter.
=============================================================
UPDATE: Joe Bastardi at his euro-blogsite predicts a cold snap coming soon:
…blocking is developing and a major early season outbreak of cold looks to be shaping up as we wind the clock toward December. Fitting that with the first anniversary of the release of the climate emails, the weather may again try to prove its point that man can’t control nature.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterNot long ago, the IPCC got one on the knuckles for grossly exaggerating Himalayan glacial ice melt, preposterously claiming the glaciers there would be gone by 2035. Now it comes to light that the IPCC has also grossly exaggerated the importance of glaciers as a source of fresh water supply for populations. 
This is what the German language online Die Presse writes here. (Read here in English).
If climate change does come, like some crystal balls are forecasting, then the glaciers melting and diminishing would reduce or eliminate melt water. The IPCC claims that it could impact perhaps 50 to 60 percent of the world’s population, 500 million people in the Ganges region in India alone!
But these numbers are quite exaggerated, claims Austrian experts Prof. Georg Kaser and Dr. Ben Marzeion of the Institute of Geography of the University of Innsbruck in Austria:
In the last few years numbers have been named that do not pass a closer examination. It is an exaggeration when it is claimed that the melting of glaciers endangers the water supply of 2 billion people.“
The professors of geology and their colleagues have examined data like precipitation, temperature and the glaciers, taken together throughout the year.

Just imagine you find yourself at the Ganges delta, it’s summertime, and a lot of melt water is coming down. But during the warm months, there are also the monsoons. And when there is a lot of land area on which the monsoons fall between you and the glaciers, glacier water plays a minor role.”
Die Presse writes that this is the case everywhere for the region south of the Himalayas. This means that the 500 million people in the region of the Ganges would therefore hardly be effected.
Dr. Ben Marzeion says the story is different for the region of the Aral Sea because the region is dry and depends more on glacier melt water. Here 10 million of the 40 million people would be significantly impacted.
In Europe, on the other hand, 81 million people live along the along Danube River.  An absence of glacier melt water would significantly impact only 310,000 people. Marzeion says:
That’s still a lot of people who would be effected, particularly in higher elevations near the glacier. But it is a relatively small number.”
The results of the study have been published in the renowned scientific journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).

For those of you who still have investments in the green stocks since last year, you have my heartfelt condolences.
As if the news from the green economy couldn’t be worse, with all the corruption we”ve seen in carbon trading, and the closure of the Chicago Climate Exchange, and the massive amounts of money that energy feed-in laws and government subsidies have cost the poor consumers.
Now on top of that we have the crash of RENIXX – the first stock index to track the performance of the world’s leading listed companies in the renewable energy sector, “the industrial field of the future”.
H/t: the German online TAZ here in a piece titled: Green Speculation Bubble Blows
RENIXX shares are weighted according to free-float market capitalization. To be listed in the index, companies must generate at least 50 percent of their revenue within the renewable energy industry.
Here’s an excerpt from the RENIXX World press release dated 4 January 2011:

Renewable energy shares: RENIXX World loses almost 30 percent in 2010
Muenster, [Germany] – The international stock index for the renewable energy industry RENIXX World (Renewable Energy Industrial Index) has ended the year 2010 with a drastic fall in value. The market barometer quote was 29.3 percent (at closing: 529.63 points) lower than a year ago(2009: 749.25 points), announced the IWR, a renewable energy institute, in Münster.

Within the framework of the periodic recomposition on January 1, 2011, the market weight of the companies in China listed in the RENIXX continues to climb. With the wafer manufacturers LDK Solar and Renesola and the wind turbine producer Goldwind, 10 Chinese companies have already been listed in the stock index from 2011 on. “The Chinese government pursues a very successful green industrial policy,” said IWR-director Dr. Norbert Allnoch. Other climbers are the renewable energy producer Enel Green Power (Italy) and the US specialist for the encapsulation of PV modules STR Holdings.
Three German producers of solar energy will be removed from the RENIXX World: Centrotherm, Roth & Rau and Q-Cells. In addition, as of 2011 the US wind energy supplier Zoltek and the Australian wind park operator Infigen Energy will no longer be represented in the RENIXX World.”
TAZ here has more, and writes:
The renewable energy economy has experienced the worst recession since the 1930s, explained IWR Director Norbert Allnoch. Many contracts for geothermal plants, offshore windmills and biogas plants have either been postponed or cancelled.”
TAZ also writes:
For the near future, Deutsche Bank in a study sees very little green. Because of increased ‘regulatory worries’, short-term more cautious expectations of companies in the photovoltaic sector and profit warnings issued by wind plant outfitters, the midterm profit expectations for renewables have been in some parts cut in half.”
In summary, it was the reddest year for the green economy thus far. I wonder if we’ll be reading all about it in the print media in the days ahead?

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe self-anointed elite class of “real” journalists exposes the raw hostility and contempt it harbours for the very citizenry it purports to serve.
Sometimes you read something, somewhere, that causes many people to get angry. But the latest piece by the UK Guardian, Andrew Marr unloads on citizen bloggers, calling them “inadequate, pimpled, very drunk, angry and single,” just made my day. They are collapsing faster than I ever imagined.
Chumps like Marr are furious because nobody really takes them seriously anymore. Bloggers and free speech are ruining everything, and so he lashes out. Call it Marr’s controlled, yet expressive tantrum.
Enlightened journalists say they are in favour of progress, but progress is precisely what is killing them. They do not know how to deal with it. The growing sense of irrelevance is really tough on them.
The first reaction of course is to lash out emotionally. This is what Andrew Marr of the BBC has done. The Guardian writes:
The BBC‘s website has nearly 100 blogs and invites its readers to “have your say” on an enormous range of topics, from Westminster to the weather.
But one of the corporation’s most familiar faces, Andrew Marr, has dismissed bloggers as “inadequate, pimpled and single”, and citizen journalism as the “spewings and rantings of very drunk people late at night”.
Quoting Marr, who incidently is hired by the publicly-funded BBC, and whose obligation is to inform the public, cannot contain the utter contempt he harbours for his audience. The Guardian quotes Marr:
‘A lot of bloggers seem to be socially inadequate, pimpled, single, slightly seedy, bald, cauliflower-nosed young men sitting in their mother’s basements and ranting. They are very angry people. OK – the country is full of very angry people. Many of us are angry people at times. Some of us are angry and drunk’.
You really need to read the whole Guardian piece. I guarantee you’ll be entertained by the frustration these malcontents are feeling. You’ll quickly understand why they fantasize of detonators with red buttons, and why they think exploding children are “kind of funny”.

Well, I really think it’s funny that they are emotionally exploding. And yet it is indeed extremely sad to watch these once reputable journalistic institutions fall so far. But it’s by their own doing.
The citizens’ view of “mainstream” journalism
Allow me to use Marr’s own comments and change them to tell you what we as citizens feel about the established media. I think many will agree. Here’s how I’d put it:
Many of society’s common readers have dismissed ‘mainstream’ journalism as inadequate, hypocritical and condescending, and mainstream journalism as the “spewings and rantings of arrogant, narrow-minded, dogmatic, and frustrated people – day and night.
A lot of mainstream journalists seem to be isolated from the mainstream public, dressed in fancy clothes, arrogant, quite seedy, toupè-wearing, high-nosed grumps sitting in their newsrooms and ranting about how atupid their readers are. They are very angry, frustrated people. OK – the country is full of very frustrated people. Many of us are frustrated people at times. Some of us are really angry and frustrated, and we dream of red-buttoned detonators.
So-called mainstream journalism is the spewings of contempt for the working classes, from very arrogant hypocrites sitting in ivory towers that are funded by the taxpayers. Take Andrew Marr as an example.
It is fantastic at times but it is no longer the future of journalism.
Most of journalism is simply too condescending and too arrogant. Much disinformation is printed because they cannot cope with inconvenient truths. Mainstream journalists fantasize of explosive horror clips, about things that they’d love to do to their uncooperative readers.
The former readers of mainstream journalism, like many in the blogosphere, have previously criticised the tone and the quality of journalism, saying we have stopped reading most mainstream journalism like the BBC. It’s out of touch with its original purpose, and the citizens it is supposed to serve, and not insult.
‘It’s a waste of my time,’ say the average citizens, adding that mainstream journalism is most often written by people who think they ought to tell the rest of us how to think, that citizens are too stupid to do so on their own, and think it’s okay to abuse and insult them, just as Andrew Marr does.
But in the end, we “drunk and pimpled” citizens do not need to fantasize about red buttons and blowing up “real” journalists. The “real” journalists are pressing their own self-destruct red buttons all by themselves.

"The collected speeches of 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, who began the worldwide school strike for the environment in 2018, will be released as a book next month. Penguin, which is also rushing out a handbook from Extinction Rebellion, will publish No One Is Too Small to Make a Difference, a selection of 11 of Thunberg’s key speeches, all written by her. It will be published on 6 June as a £2.99 paperback. The first speech in the book was given three weeks after Thunberg’s first climate strike in August 2018, the most recent in the UK parliament last month.  “My name is Greta Thunberg. I am 16 years old. I come from Sweden. And I speak on behalf of future generations,” the teenage Nobel peace prize nominee told MPs. “We children are not sacrificing our education and our childhood for you to tell us what you consider is politically possible in the society that you have created … We children are doing this to wake the adults up. We children are doing this for you to put your differences aside and start acting as you would in a crisis. We children are doing this because we want our hopes and dreams back.” The book takes its title from a speech Thunberg made at the COP24 UN climate talks. Penguin described her as “the voice of a generation facing the full force of climate catastrophe … quiet, angry and unafraid, speaking truth to power.” And after winning it at a publisher auction, Penguin will also release Scenes from the Heart later this year, a family memoir written jointly by her mother, the opera singer Malena Ernman, her sister Beata Ernman, her father Svante Thunberg and Greta herself. All of the family’s earnings from both books will be donated to charity. “It will be the story of the family and how they have been able to support Greta,” said commissioning editor Chloe Currens. Greta Thunberg was diagnosed with Asperger’s and selective mutism “a few years ago and rather than railing against that and trying to make her ‘normal’, they chose to support her when she said she wanted to do something about climate change.” Currens said that Thunberg had “already galvanised millions of children and adults around the world, and she’s only just getting started”. “She calls for change at the highest level – and because her message is so urgent, and so essential, we are working to make it available to as many readers as we can, as quickly as we possibly can. This little book will document an extraordinary, unprecedented moment in our history, and invite you to join in the fight for climate justice: to wake up, spread the word, and make a difference,” said the editor. There will be no foreword to the speeches. “We want to facilitate her voice, not interfere as publishers,” said Currens. “She is an incredibly clear-eyed child, speaking to adults … This is an invitation to get up and join in. There is hope in these pages, not just doom and gloom.” When asked about the environmental sustainability of producing a printed book, Penguin said that it was committed to printing all of its books on “FSC certified paper, one of the greenest possible options” by 2020, and that the book would be printed in the UK. “There is of course more we need to do help combat the climate crisis, and we are committed to supporting Greta Thunberg’s efforts to spread this message far and wide,” it said."

"Once upon a time, about 650m years ago, our planet was covered in ice. Glaciers stretched as far as the tropics, and equatorial regions were as cold as modern day Antarctica. Life clung on, huddling around geothermal springs and in pockets of liquid water under the ice caps. Ancient rock deposits suggest our planet entered this snowball state multiple times.  So what tipped Earth’s climate into such frigid conditions, and how did it revert to the warm temperatures of today? These questions have perplexed scientists for decades. Using a climate model to investigate the unstable melancholia states between warm and snowball, Prof Valerio Lucarini from the University of Reading and his colleagues show that ice stretched as far as mid-latitudes during melancholia phases. Their results, published in Physical Review Letters, reveal that when Earth is in a melancholia state, small changes in solar radiation are enough to tip the climate into snowball or warm states. Today’s big concern is global warming. Lucarini and his colleagues intend to use a similar model to explore whether another melancholia state exists between a warm and very hot climate state."

Share this...FacebookTwitterNot a day goes by without hearing about the “catastrophic BP Gulf oil spill”. Even the media in Europe are fretting hysterically about ocean currents eventually carrying the mess across the Atlantic and over to Europe’s shores – so say all their computer models. There’s now even a lot of discussion about setting up a world environmental court for prosecuting polluters for Crimes Against Nature and Crimes Against Humanity.When I was a kid and milk spilled, we were told not to cry about it, but instead to get up, get a mop, and to clean it up. How are media responding with the latest spill? Many are having fainting spells, some are even leaping out the windows, and the rest just want to beat the crap out of the poor kid who spilled the milk, who by the way gets up early every morning to milk the cow and brings it to the table.
Surely the oil spill was a mess and steps have to be taken to prevent these things in the future. But it’s also important to keep it all in perspective. Globally, once everything settles down, this is not going to be felt at all. It’s reported that 800 million liters have gushed into the Gulf. That sounds like a huge number. Indeed it’s like everyone in the United States dumping 3 quarts.
Pull your head up and look at the big picture. First of all, it has been reported, much to the surprise of the media, that 75% has already been either dispersed or cleaned up. That means 200 million liters are still at large. Of these 200 million liters, what doesn’t end up on shores for manual cleanup, will eventually get carried out to sea.
But for now, let’s stay with the 200 million liters floating out to Europe and beyond. How much is that with respect to the oceans’ sheer volume?
* 200 million liters = 200,000 cubic meters,
* 200,000 cubic meters = 0.0002 cubic kilometers of oil.
* Volume of world oceans: 1.37 BILLION cubic kilometers.
* Concentration of BP oil in ocean: 0.0002 km³/ 1,370,000,000 km³
This equals…folks my calculator doesn’t even get anywhere near that far out! It’s like one rat drowning in Lake Erie. It’s in the trillionths! The average lake has higher concentrations of greasy suntan lotion from swimmers.
Wildlife in the oceans are not even going to notice this, not at all! Fish have other far greater worries on their minds – like not becoming dinner for other fish.

So everybody really ought to just calm down about it. The whole thing has been overhyped a 1000 times.
The Gulf shores will get cleaned up and big mother earth will do the rest.

I’d like to point out that the media focusses too much on the environmental disturbance of the oil spill and ignores the fact that a dozen people lost their lives in the accident. That’s the real tragedy.
And let’s not forget there have been far worse disasters.  167 people lost their lives on the Piper Alpha, making that in my view far worse than anything else in the oil industry to my knowledge. We ought to keep things in perspective.  The environment will rebound – lost lives don’t. How does someone’s business taking a temporary hit compare to loss of life? You coastal residents – you live in America, and so you’ll all get through it just fine. I know it’s tough, but count your blessings.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMan-made CO2-induced global warming leads to more droughts, cyclones, floods, bitter cold winters and heavy snowfalls – so say many German media outlets. Why is that so?
Some people need to hear that the end of the world is coming, and if they don’t, it ruins their day. They need that dose of doom and gloom to make it through the day – just like the junkie who needs the needle.
So that’s why the media does it. What follows are some example stories in the media that appeared this week. But first, Der Spiegel sobered up for a time and actually presented something coherent and sensible.
Der Spiegel
Der Spiegel writes: Deep Heat In the Pacific Fueled Yasi. Der Spiegel asks if storms are fuelled by climate change:
A consenus paper from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) from the year 2006 says that the fluctuations in frequency of cyclones and their strengths cannot be traced back to warming.”
And points out that such storms have happened in the past too:
Also in Australia there have been cyclones: In March 1899 the deadliest ever cyclone ripped through the Bathurst Bay; 300 people died. Cyclone “Tracy” destroyed a large part of the city of Darwin on Christmas Day 1974, killing 71.”
But that was about it as far as sobriety goes from the German media this week. The rest saw to it that the catastrophe junkies get their fix of junk-science based doom and gloom. Here are some examples:
Die Welt
Reports on the real reason for the cold winter: Why Global Warming Leads to Ice Cold Winters
When sea ice area declines, it loses its albedo, which normally would reflect sunlight back into space. As a result, this leads to a warming in the high Arctic and thus changes the large-scale air currents so that large parts of Europe, Asia and North America get subjected to cold air masses.”

Absolutely brilliant scientific work there.
Süddeutsche Zeitung
Reports on cyclone Yasi: Reasons For The Cyclone:
Another factor is because the ocean at the Australian coast has apparently warmed up due to climate change. The sea surface over the Great Barrier Reef off the coast of Queensland has been more than 2°C warmer than normal in some parts over the last few months. This excess was enough to fuel Yasi into a killer.”
Financial Times Deutschland 
Reports on a large chunk of ice breaking off Antarctica Climate Change: An Iceberg Causes Trouble. The breaking off of a 2500 sq km chunk of the Antarctic Mertz-Glacier could have dire consequences on the global climate:
The iceberg breaking off could have dire consequences because a system was destroyed in parts that earlier had been effectively productive in producing salty deep water. Now the general warming of the oceans will be accelerated further, which will then in turn accelerate the melting of the polar ice caps and lead to additional sea level rise.”
Süddeutsche Zeitung 
Reports on the Amazon drought: Again A Drought of the Century
The Amazon Rainforest has gone through a second drought of the century within just six years. More than half of the 5.3 million sq km have received significantly less rain than average years. When the trees rot, five million tons of CO2 will be released. That is almost the same annual output of the USA.
”Two such events of this magnitude in such a short time is extremely rare’, says Simon Lewis of the University of Leeds. But unfortunately that fits the climate that predict a bitter future for the Amazonians.’
What about all the climate models that didn’t predict it? And is USA’s CO2 output really only 5 million tons?

Handelsblatt
Also reports on the Amazon drought: Record Drought In The Amazon
Many climate scientists fear that within the scope of global warming, droughts could increase in frequency and that the region will reach an ecological tipping point.
So, do you doom-and-gloom junkies who insist on a dismal future feel better now? Or do you need more junk?

"Almost three decades on, 1990 is often remembered as one of the hottest summers on record. Temperatures in early August peaked at 37.1C (98.9F), in the Gloucestershire town of Cheltenham, beating the previous record set in the summer of 1911.  Elsewhere across the UK records were set too, including the highest temperature for Wales : 35.2C in Flintshire. Perhaps because of this unprecedented hot spell, an earlier heatwave that year may not be remembered as well. The opening week of May 1990 was the warmest of the 20th century, with monthly records broken not just in England, with 28.6C in Worcestershire, but also Scotland, where in the town of Rothes, Speyside, the mercury soared to 28.3C.  But the early May bank holiday fell on 7 May, by which time the temperatures had begun to drop, though the weather remained sunny and warmer than the long-term average. The rest of 1990 turned out to be the year of the heatwave, with one of the hottest summers of the 20th century, including that record-breaking spell in early August. However, that figure lasted only another 13 years – it was smashed by the 38.5C (101.3F) high reached in the town of Faversham, Kent, in August 2003."
"As someone who once took a work-related day trip to San Francisco it is a little hypocritical of me to criticise others for taking long-haul flights for vanishingly brief holidays. But for all sorts of reasons it really is a terrible idea. The trend has been highlighted in Thomas Cook’s Holiday Report 2019, released this week, which notes “an increasing number of trips for less than seven days to long-haul destinations, with Mexico, San Francisco and other cities in the States rocketing in popularity.”  “We call them bite-size breaks,” says a Thomas Cook spokeswoman. “We’ve seen a big increase in people jetting off to long-haul destinations for a shorter amount of time. They’re trying to get their money’s worth out of their annual leave quota but also satisfy their desire for global travel.” Flying has become cheaper; there are lots of good deals if you only carry hand baggage and check in online; the strength of the euro is encouraging us to look beyond the EU; and younger, unencumbered travellers think nothing of sitting in a plane for 10 hours and then embarking on a sleep-free 72 hours in Cancun or Cape Town. Farewell to the leisurely two-week package holiday – until you have children, at least. Environmentally, the trend is a disaster, whatever the airlines say about greener aircraft and the rise of biofuels making flying less destructive. “That’s like saying we’ve thrown away plastic straws and now the world’s saved,” says Georgina Wilson-Powell, a travel specialist who edits the online sustainability magazine Pebble. “We need to encourage slow travel and local travel rather than jetting halfway across the world for three days. That’s just not eco-friendly.” Wilson-Powell says flying is a touchstone in the war raging over climate change. “One of the most impactful things you can do if you want to live a more sustainable life is not fly,” she says. “Flying across the world for two or three days at a time doesn’t fit in to that.” She suggests that if you are flying long haul you should try to carbon offset – Emma Thompson’s get-out for her recent flight from Los Angeles was to join the Extinction Rebellion protest in London. There is also the question of what weekend breakers get from taking a bite-sized chunk of a complex culture, and what they are putting in to the place they visit. “We encourage travellers to spend their money with people who really deserve it,” says Wilson-Powell. “Local tour groups, local accommodation, conservation projects, so your money is going back into the local economy. If you’re there for two or three days, that’s probably not happening. You’ll be spending most of your time on the plane.” She says the rise in short breaks to long-haul destinations is driven by “a quest for the new”. “Social media fuels a lot of it. There are hotspots around the world that people want to get their photos taken in.” These are less bite-sized holidays than Instagram holidays. We came, we saw, we snapped. But what else is snapping?"
"Friday 15 March was a rare day in Venice: on the concourse in front of the Santa Lucia train station, Venetians outnumbered tourists. Young Venetians had skipped school to join the global youth climate strike, holding placards with statements such as “If climate was a bank, you’d save it.” The movement is especially relevant in Venice, since a 50cm rise in sea levels could see the city vanish beneath the waves.  Critical as the climate crisis is, the city faces a more immediate risk: the rising tide of tourists, presently estimated at 25 million a year and projected to reach 38 million by 2025. Europe, already the world’s largest tourism market, received 713 million international visitors in 2018, an 8% increase on the previous year, according to the UN World Tourism Organization. But, in European cities, the increase is far greater: since 2008, overnight stays have jumped 57%. While tourism provides significant economic benefit – contributing €2bn annually in gross revenue to Venice alone – overtourism is causing cities like Barcelona, Amsterdam, Dubrovnik and others to make international headlines on issues ranging from housing affordability, environmental degradation and the destruction of local life. In 2016 in Dubrovnik, residents were outraged when the mayor asked them to stay home to avoid the dangerous levels of crowds disembarking from multiple cruise ships. The new mayor, Mato Frankovic, has since capped the number of cruise ships that can dock in the city at two per day, cut souvenir stalls by 80% and cut restaurant seating in public spaces by 30%. But similar issues of overcrowding in Palma de Mallorca, San Sebastián, Prague and Salzburg have brought locals out into the streets in increasingly impassioned protests. One of the most dramatic was Venice’s 2016 No Grandi Navi (“No Big Ships”) protest, when locals took to the Giudecca Canal in small fishing boats to block the passage of six colossal cruise ships. And, although plans have been announced this year to reroute the largest ships to a new dock in Marghera (still to be built), campaigners still argue for a dock outside the lagoon at the Lido, where heavy cargo ships historically unloaded. As a series of crises puts Europe under strain, some cities are fighting back with innovative solutions. From hyper-specialist shops beating the online threat in Berlin to the Bulgarian city reversing the country's brain drain, from the Italian city finding new ways to tackle addiction to gambling to the Swedish town that has found innovative ways to combat extremism, we look at what European cities are doing to live better in our increasingly urban world. This is just one of the ways the Venetian Republic safeguarded the equilibrium of the lagoon and the complex system of commerce around it. In fact, the act of sustaining the lagoon for over a millennium is a singular human achievement, because a lagoon by definition is a temporary natural phenomenon. Venice’s lagoon would have silted in 500 years ago if it hadn’t been for careful environmental protection, sensitive technical intervention and strict commercial regulation – a historic blueprint that provides useful lessons for tourism. A new generation of concerned citizens and entrepreneurs is taking up that challenge, combining grassroots activism with socially sensitive, sustainable initiatives to save their island home. Consider waste. What comes into Venice must be removed again via a complex collection and recycling system. Every day an army of sanitation workers knocks on every door in the city, collecting waste to be ferried away on barges. The same rules and fines, however, do not apply to tourists – despite the fact that during high season the bins around Piazza San Marco have to be emptied every half an hour. Troubled by the plastic waste generated by their two boutique hotels – the Novecento and Hotel Flora – the Romanelli family have taken action, eliminating plastic bottles from their properties, and encouraging guests to use steel flasks at Venice’s historic water fountains, for which they supply a map. “We don’t pretend to be [Leonardo] DiCaprio, but through these small actions we hope to do something positive,” says the owner, Gioele Romanelli. With just 50 rooms and 40 members of staff, they calculate they save 36,000 plastic bottles a year. Multiply that by the estimated 40,000 guest beds in Venice – to say nothing of restaurants or the waste unloaded from cruise ships – and you could save hundreds of millions of plastic bottles a year. “Our children learn about these issues at school and all of them carry their own water flasks, so why not us?” concludes Romanelli’s wife, Heiby. Addressing the issue of waste is only the most tangible effort to create a more sustainable tourism in Venice.This June will see the launch of Fairbnb, a not-for-profit home-sharing site that only permits resident hosts; mandates one home per host; and contributes half of the 15% booking fee to social projects. Their launch is timely. Since 2015, Airbnb tourist rentals in Venice have tripled from 2,441 to 8,320, according to Airdna. Of those, 80% are entire home rentals, many are owned by agencies or foreign investors and a 2018 report by Centro Studi di Federalberghi Nazionale found the most prolific host in the city had 135 listings. Other European cities are responding to similar problems. Barcelona is prosecuting unlicensed apartments and has secured access to Airbnb’s host data in order to pursue offenders. In Madrid, home sharing is now only permitted in houses with their own entrances. Palma, meanwhile, has banned short-term tourist rentals completely in flats that are part of multi-family residential housing, although it is still possible to rent detached homes and villas, provided they are not in a protected area. “Without significant regulation of the rental market [in Italy], we saw the only way to change things was to provide a market alternative,” says Emanuele dal Carlo, a Venetian who is one of five co-founders of Fairbnb, which crowdfunded for its startup cash. “We’re not anti-Airbnb – we just want to show that it’s possible to create a tourism model that works for local communities as well as travellers.” On booking, Fairbnb renters decide which project to support and are invited to visit or participate: in Venice this could mean joining volunteers cleaning graffiti or helping turn a centuries-old squero (boat yard) into an educational centre. “We want to bring back the connection between tourists and locals that has been lost,” dal Carlo says. “Nowadays you can go to a place and virtually never meet a local. But this way you can join them in their real pursuits or even just share a drink together.” This loss of connection between locals and tourists is something that Valeria Duflot and Sebastian Fagarazzi are also concerned with. Their website Venezia Autentica directs tourists to Venice businesses that support a sustainable local economy – everything from printmakers to photographers, mosaicists to rowers. This is because too few of the city’s 25 million tourists frequent shops and restaurants owned by Venetians, they say. “Quality local businesses definitely need more customers, visitors included,” Duflot says. Across Europe, other grassroots groups are also fighting to preserve local cultures. In 2017, the social movement Morar em Lisboa, in conjunction with 30 local associations, wrote an open letter denouncing Lisbon’s excessive dependency on tourism and real estate speculation. And last May, 14 cities and islands – 10 of them Spanish, alongside Venice, Lisbon and Malta – joined forces to form the Network of Southern European Cities against Touristification, arguing that mass tourism causes high rents, pollution, the loss of local shops and the proliferation of low-wage jobs. This is what the European Parliament was referring to when, in 2015, it declared that “European tourism must make a transition from a model of quantitative growth to a qualitative model leading to steady and sustainable development.” To kick-start new thinking on the matter, they awarded the inaugural 2019 European Capital of Smart Tourism to Helsinki for the city’s locally-oriented tourism strategy, which is based on sustainability and the assumption that what makes a city attractive to residents will appeal to travellers, too. It is this focus on the liveability of a city that Venetian data scientist Fabio Carrera believes is the key to Venice’s future. Because if a city cannot retain its own populace, no amount of tourist tax will be able to avert its inevitable decline and death. As such, Carrera has dedicated 30 years of his academic life working on the Venice Project Centre, dividing his time between Worcester Polytechnic Institute, the prestigious Santa Fe Institute and Venice. During that time, he has supervised over 250 projects examining the city’s challenges: mapping every bridge, bell tower, well and water bus.  The centre also tracks tourism flows, and has concluded that Venice’s maximum carrying capacity is 55,000 tourists per day, or 20 million per year if European safety standards are to be maintained. It’s not far from the current number of 25 million, he points out – it just needs to be managed better. A new wave of digital tools could offer some solutions. At the centre’s startup incubator SerenDPT, students are working on projects including smart transport apps, hybrid mortgage schemes that use tourism income to assist with repayments, and a Smart Control Room for the city council that they hope they can export to other cities. He believes these new business ideas, among others, would create the kind of high quality jobs that could refloat the local economy. No other city faces a bigger tourism challenge, says Carrera – but given Venice’s uniquely contained and complex character, nowhere is better equipped to meet the challenge of sustainable tourism. “Younger generations have been out in the world,” he says. “They see other possibilities and want to bring that back to Venice.” This article was edited on 1 May 2019 to clarify that Palma has not completely banned short term tourist rentals, just those in apartments in multi-family residential housing Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn an earlier post, Silence of the Greens, I broke one of my own rules (not to delete opposing views, like RC does). But in this case, I felt one particular annoying ultra-warmist reader needed to learn his own lesson. That is, if they are going to make rules for the rest of us to live by, then they too ought to live by those rules too, just to see what it’s like.
We already know that top warmists demand we live carbon-free lives, yet they themselves leave carbon footprints the size of craters.
In the comments of the above mentioned post, I posed the following question to the annoying warmist reader:
You do know that you are free to say what you want here, though I do not agree with it. At RealClimate their rules are a bit different. Opposing comments never see the light of day.
Now, are you going to argue that your side is always correct, and that the sceptics are wrong, and thus it’s correct that their comments are deleted? If so, then you are only confirming the intolerance I’ve written about here. RC is notorious for their suppression of dissent. An exchange of differing views like we are having here would not be possible at RC.
The warmist reader replied:
The reason why climate scientists remove posts is simply because they think Deniers are trolling and don’t even believe themselves what they post!
They think Deniers are merely trying to prolong the debate. This provides the impression to the public of a meaningful debate between two equally informed groups which isn’t the case. To them its like arguing with Apollo moon hoax conspiracy theorists or even flat earthers! They want to move on to debate the detail of how warm and how fast, not if.

Name me one climate scientist (sceptic or otherwise) who believes man has no effect on the rate of warming.
As an Engineer I’m more interested in solutions, but I do get annoyed at people deliberately misleading others, life is difficult enough without that sort of thing.
It’s mean, I know, but I decided that this reader should learn a lesson and live according to his own rules, and so I proceeded to snip all his comments, citing: “trolling and saying things you yourself do not even believe (RC Policy – sorry)”. The small-minded reader must have wasted a good amount of time, as he wrote a good three pages worth of childish provocation.
Really sorry about that.
I won’t do this in the future with other readers, unless of course they get as annoying and provocative as this particular reader did.
I have saved the content of this warmist reader, and so there is the possibility I’ll repost them. It wasn’t all bad. But at the moment, I think this person should find better ways to spend his time.
Deserved? Or not?

"Robin McKie’s piece correctly identifies Extinction Rebellion’s demand for a zero-carbon UK by 2025 as being hugely costly and politically difficult (“Slow burn? The long road to a zero-emissions Britain”, Special Report). He provides a detailed examination of what some experts prefer as a more realistic target of 2050, though even this is difficult. The IPCC’s most recent warnings about the dangers of a temperature rise exceeding 1.5C above pre-industrial levels surely mean that avoiding this must be the key global policy objective. The article’s last two paragraphs show that at current carbon dioxide emission rates (42bn tonnes per annum) the world will exceed the limit (420bn tonnes) at which there is a “two in three chance of keeping global warming down to around 1.5C” in just 10 years’ time. If the aim is to meet this target, 2050 doesn’t seem in any way “more realistic” as a target for a zero-carbon Britain. It does seem “more realistic” if the aim is to avoid costly and politically difficult decisions by kicking the can further down the road. Which is how we got where we are. No wonder people are rebellious. It looks like a bit more rebellion is still required.Dave LewisChurchtown, Illogan, Redruth, Cornwall  The spreading interest of US firms in developing space travel suggested that this may become a trillion-dollar business within the next two decades (“The private frontier: corporate space explorers stand by for a $1tn liftoff”, Business). It would encompass space tourism for the mega-rich. But what about the environmental cost? The Falcon Heavy rocket, for example is powered by 27 engines. In the same issue, there is a report of the Extinction Rebellion protests, an analysis of the difficulties in achieving the targets for reduction in CO2 emissions and an editorial supportive of this cause. Shouldn’t the argument include an assessment of the potential future contribution of space rockets to CO2 output?David WatkinLeicester As someone “eligible to vote in the referendum on Europe – the first one, that is”, I take issue with Andrew Anthony’s dismissive and patronising attitude towards older voters (“Selfies, sweat and blazers as Nigel and Annunziata bask in rally’s approval”, News). I detest Nigel Farage and his views but describing his supporters in ageist terms (“a kind of near-extinction rebellion”) is insulting to those of us who may be of a similar age but are of a very different viewpoint. Are my leftwing credentials of less value because I may no longer have the mobility to “storm the podium”?Denise WhiteSale, Cheshire Your leader on the Mueller report and the prospect of Donald Trump making a state visit to Britain struck a jarring note (“Trump is a disgrace to his office. He is not welcome here”). Surely this is an example of “no-platforming”, something the Observer has condemned in the past. If there’s one admirable thing that Britain and its parliament stand for, it’s a willingness to allow free speech. In addition, we should go on respecting the office of president of the United States, whatever we think of the incumbent.John TavnerDedham, Essex You report that, while 80% of Labour party members and many MPs want Brexit to be put back to the people, other Labour MPs say another public vote would damage faith in democracy (“Labour’s fudge on Brexit a gift to Farage, says Corbyn deputy”, News). It was extraordinary to read this argument when, in the same issue, Carole Cadwalladr wrote about giving her stirring TED lecture in Vancouver concerning “the massive electoral fraud” that took place in the vote in 2016 (“I took on the tech giants in their lair”, Focus). As she pointed out, this attack on democracy has, disgracefully, been almost totally ignored by the mainstream media and the main political parties. If it had been properly covered and acknowledged, public faith in that flawed process would have been undermined. The argument that another vote would be anti-democratic is baseless but unless it is vigorously challenged it will come to dominate the forthcoming debates.Dr Ron GlatterBoxmoor, Hemel HempsteadHerts Tom Watson sits on the fence himself with regard to the questions on the ballot paper for “a new public vote on Brexit” (“Labour can’t defeat Farage by sitting on the fence”, Comment). Labour needs to say clearly that the ballot paper will carry three questions: the deal, if there is one; Remain or Leave; an alternative vote system.Chris BirchLondon SW6 Sources quoted in the story about Seána Talbot’s resignation from the NCT give a distorted picture of infant feeding in the UK (“Childbirth charity president quits in breastfeeding row”, News). An NCT practitioner concerned about the NCT shift from promoting only breastfeeding says: “The odds are stacked against breastfeeding. The formula industry spends millions on promotion. There’s nothing comparable to support or promote breastfeeding.” This is highly misleading as it is government policy to promote breastfeeding. All pregnant women are exposed to breastfeeding promotion, delivered to them by health authorities and trusted professionals. Most maternity services have adopted the Unicef Baby-Friendly Initiative, “a global effort to implement practices that protect, promote and support breastfeeding”. In fact, its promotion by the NHS and NCT was so powerful for me that after a long birth, extremely sleep deprived, I lost perspective and put exclusive breastfeeding above all else. Unfortunately, the hospital did the same. Our baby didn’t feed well and was readmitted 24 hours after discharge dehydrated and jaundiced. I’ve since discovered that rates of readmissions like ours more than doubled between 2006 and 2016. Though formula was the best option for our family, at the time I felt I had failed the first test of motherhood by not breastfeeding. Postnatal depression ensued. Talking about my experience, I have heard similar stories from hundreds of other women. It is obvious that Talbot isn’t listening to what many women are saying about breastfeeding promotion. We are not “annoyed”. We are angry about policies and practices that caused actual harm to us, our babies and our families.Sue HaddonGuildford, Surrey Your powerful article on the story of Joe and county lines gangs brought tears to my eyes (“How a drug gang devastated our helpless family”, Focus). I live in a resort that has been affected by the infamous county lines and earlier this month nine people were jailed for flooding the town with drugs. The holds these drug masters have over young, vulnerable people is heartbreaking. This crisis needs to be addressed urgently before more young people such as Joe are sucked in and made to feel that their real family is surplus to requirements and before the bogus family takes them over entirely.Judith DanielsCobholm, Great Yarmouth, Norfolk John Barton provides a brilliant summary of the New Testament in the penultimate paragraph of his article (“Why are the ancient stories and relics of the Bible still so poignant today?”, Comment). However, it is trying to make sense of having to live through this vale of tears in order to achieve the new life beyond death that inhibits belief in a god.David BuckinghamLeamington Spa, Warwickshire Is it just me or does anyone else find it intensely irritating when St Edmund Hall, Oxford, is referred to as “Teddy Hall” (University Challenge, television highlights, New Review). Jeremy Paxman does it and now you’re doing it. It’s as if we are all supposed to have gone to Oxbridge and are “in the know”. Well, we didn’t and so we’re not. Anne WilliamsDeganwy, Conwy, Wales"
"Three things stand out from the recent youth climate strikes, the visit of Greta Thunberg and the peaceful protests of Extinction Rebellion. The first is the call for truth. The campaigners have all been united in their call for politicians and policymakers to tell the truth about climate change – its impacts and the scale of the response required. The second has been the demand to treat the climate crisis as an emergency and the recognition that “business as usual” is now in effect a form of “climate appeasement”. The third has been the sense of hope. An increasing number of people, young and old, see that the way we run our economy is damaging our climate, our environment and our society, but that, crucially, it is within our power to change it for the better. And change it we must. On Tuesday, the Institute for Public Policy Research launches its Environmental Justice Commission and we are coming together across Conservative, Labour and Green parties to serve on it. We are doing so with a very specific task in mind: to ally the issue of climate change with the economic and social transformation that we believe our country and citizens so urgently need and deserve. To act on that sense of hope.  This means committing to a transformational plan for a Green New Deal, an unprecedented mobilisation and deployment of resources to tackle the accelerating climate crisis and transform our economy and society for all. Ours is a country where people are asking how we can revive communities that have been left out of prosperity, with levels of inequality that should shame us all. People want to know that the great companies and industries of the future will thrive within planetary limits. And people are asking not just about whether they and their children will be able to get work, but what the quality of that work will be and what skills we will all need. Yet too often the issue of climate change seems marginal to the public’s concerns, when it is in fact central. The case for tackling climate change cannot simply be situated within technocratic arguments about technology and targets. These matter a lot, but in making the case in this way it can seem irrelevant to more pressing concerns. Unless we rightly situate climate change within the everyday concerns that people have about their jobs, the fairness of society and the future for their kids and grandkids, we will fail. And failure is not an option. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has warned of the serious consequences if global average temperatures rise by more than 1.5C. We now have only 11 years to take decisive action. We already see 1C of warming and accompanying extreme weather events, including heatwaves and droughts, while sea levels rise. Later this week, the Committee on Climate Change will publish its advice on when we need to meet net-zero emissions. It is imperative to meet our international responsibilities for implementing the Paris agreement on climate change and pursue an accelerated path to limit warming to no more than 1.5C. Doing so will require a commitment, and a plan. We need to mobilise a carbon army of workers to retrofit and insulate homes, cutting bills, reducing emissions and making people’s lives better. We need to move to sustainable forms of transport and zero-carbon vehicles as quickly as possible, saving thousands of lives from air pollution. We need to end the opposition to onshore wind power and position ourselves as a global centre of excellence for renewable manufacturing. And we need to protect and restore threatened habitats, and to secure major transitions in agriculture and diets that are essential if we are to meet our obligations. Just in these areas of policy we already see an answer to the immediate economic concerns people have: jobs and hope. Green jobs must be secure and decently paid, with a central role for trade unions in a just transition for all workers and communities affected.  No doubt some people will say that the UK should not act on these issues alone. We disagree. We believe there is economic and societal advantage, not detriment, in doing so. We also believe our leadership can make a difference. It was the moral authority from the world-leading cross-party Climate Change Act of 2008 that has allowed successive governments to have international influence, including on the groundbreaking Paris agreement. If the government aspires to host the next UN COP climate change summit in 2020, the meeting that will determine the world’s climate change commitments, then we will need to increase our ambition here at home, set out a clear plan and start making some challenging decisions now. It is time for the UK to lead again and the commission will aim to help shape that leadership. And when people ask how we can bring the country together, we believe this issue has the potential to do so. For some, it will be the climate issue that motivates them, for others the economic and social justice gains that can be achieved in the war against climate change. For many it will be all of these. We owe it to our country and its future to make this happen. • Ed Miliband is Labour MP for Doncaster North and a former leader of the Labour party; Caroline Lucas is Green MP for Brighton Pavilion; and Laura Sandys is a former Conservative MP for South Thanet"
"Simon Jenkins’ decrying of anti-Trump and other demonstrations displays a surprisingly simplistic understanding of the politics of protest (To rage against Trump’s visit is simply childish, 27 April). His scattergun disdain appears to condemn as meaningless any mass objection that cannot result in the instantaneous withering of the intended political target. Presumably the actions of the thousands who risked and lost their lives in Tiananmen Square in 1989, for example, would be understood as a monument to childish futility in the world of mathematically harmonious political symmetry that Jenkins’ activism requires, for “unless there are consequential gains to such action, it is mere self-indulgence”. His reference to Ceauşescu, Mugabe and Mobutu as precedents for tolerating Trump’s state visit is equally mystifying. It could at least be argued (however weakly) that in their invitation lay the desperate hope of some leverage to be ventured against murderous tyrants otherwise immune to moral shaming, economic sanction or political threats. By contrast, it is precisely because the US shares with us the same moral universe and democratic principles that anti-Trump protests represent a powerful rejection of his traducing of those shared values. Offering such painful truths from within this so-called special relationship can be easily understood on both sides of the Atlantic as entirely legitimate objections to the man, not the office. It might also offer welcome evidence of solidarity, to the millions of US citizens who feel aggrieved by their contemptuous, megalomaniac representative – but presumably that’s too childish a gesture.Paul McGilchristColchester, Essex  • I am sure Simon Jenkins regards himself as a voice of reason, and he is undoubtedly blessed with considerable intellect. Curious, then, that he writes “If there is a crisis of liberalism at present, it lies in its retreat to a middlebrow bunker of confirmation bias,” even as he demonstrates his own capitulation to that tendency. Climate change threatens so much more than “the lifestyle of [the planet’s] current occupants”. Believing that the way to meet that threat is to continue what we have been doing for the last 40 years, occasionally debating it in an empty Commons chamber and patting ourselves on the back because we have done better in responding to this global problem than some other countries illustrates that Jenkins’ cloak of rational righteousness is cosseting him from the tragedy consuming us all.Dave HunterBristol • Simon Jenkins’ cogent article on Donald Trump’s visit in June is extremely well argued. However, you have also reported on two decisions taken by Trump: the withdrawal, under pressure from the National Rifle Association, from an international agreement on arms sales, and the weakening of a treaty on rape in warfare lest it promote abortion. One senses the influence of the evangelical right wing. It might, therefore, be appropriate to continue to protest against the presidential visit, overriding concerns about the historical relationship. It has surely been irretrievably damaged morally by his behaviour.David HalleyHampton Hill, London • Perhaps it’s out of a misguided notion of balance that you’ve allowed Simon Jenkins to scorn protesters against Trump’s state visit, Attenborough’s climate change programme and Greta Thunberg. He says we need debate, not direct action. Debate is only workable when the participants offer and attend to evidence. UK politicians have not been doing this in relation to climate change – this is Thunberg’s point. No one who has actually read the IPCC report, not just the milder summary for policymakers, could see Attenborough’s programme as “doom-laden hysteria”. Jenkins’ piece lacks grounding; it is not a worthy contribution to the debate he advocates.Dr Caroline FreemanBristol • Like Simon Jenkins, I wish Theresa May hadn’t invited Donald Trump to Britain. As she did, he should be offered the normal courtesies. In the navy I was told one salutes the rank, not the person.John HuntleyManchester • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

"If I were in London over Easter I would have been at Waterloo Bridge or Oxford Circus or Marble Arch, the protest sites for the Extinction Rebellion. Extinction Rebellion (XR) is a movement of tens of thousands of people that has for a week blocked traffic across the UK in simple but powerful acts of civil disobedience. These have ranged from activists gluing themselves to a pink boat in Oxford Circus to a string quartet playing in the middle of Waterloo Bridge. The aim is to force a national and global conversation about climate changes.  Their demands are for governments to tell the truth about climate change, to reduce carbon pollution to zero by 2025 and to create a citizens’ assembly to oversee the whole process. After more than 30 years of climate campaigns, international negotiations, policy change and practical action, climate pollution is still rising. Meanwhile humans have wiped out 60% of mammals, birds, fish and reptiles since 1970 and species are dying at unprecedented rates. Extreme weather events are increasing in frequency and severity. Mozambique has been flattened by two devastating cyclones in two months. Last month a cyclone flattened the city of Beira, killing more than 1,000 people, and in the last two days, Cyclone Kenneth has hit the northern province Cabo Delgado, where 30,000 people have been evacuated. Last year the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change launched a report that said we only have 12 years to halve our global climate pollution. So it’s not surprising that XR is taking the climate movement to the next level, not just in the UK but around the world. And XR is not alone. In the past six months we have seen the rise of climate campaigns that are bigger, bolder and more organised than anything the world has ever seen. These climate campaigns are galvanised by a sense of urgency that a growing number of people feel about ecological collapse and escalating climate damage. All are asking people to take action in ways that are commensurate with the scale of the problem – civil disobedience and sustained action over weeks, months and years. In Australia, there’s the Stop Adani campaign and the current Stop Adani Convoy, that won’t go away no matter how much Bill Shorten and Scott Morison would like it to. Last week also saw the first public actions from Extinction Rebellion Australia. These included a climate teach-in in the South Australian parliament, banner drops and the blockade of coal trains in Brisbane. In the US, youth climate organisation the Sunrise Movement launched the Green New Deal campaign with a bang. In the week following the US midterms, they held a sit-in at now-house leader Nancy Pelosi’s office. The Green New Deal is a society and economy-wide 10-year plan for climate justice. While initially US based, this campaign is now spreading around the world, with a similar campaign just launched in Canada. Then there’s #FridaysForFuture, the global school strike movement started by 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg. From one young woman striking over climate change just nine months ago, the school strike movement has grown to a point where last month young people led 150,000 Australians and 1.4 million people globally in one of the biggest days of climate action. While these campaigns are all different – different asks, different theories of change and different strategies to win – in many ways they are remarkably similar. Firstly, all are well organised with a clear strategy. Indeed, in the case of both XR and the Green New Deal, people were working on the campaign one to two years before launching publicly, giving them time to grow their supporter base. Secondly and most importantly, all of these campaigns are trying to do the one thing we have yet to achieve – shifting the Overton window on climate change to get decision-makers of all stripes to do what is necessary, not what they deem politically possible. Already these campaigns are starting to work. In the UK councils and famous cultural institutions such as the Royal Court Theatre have declared a climate emergency and are placing pressure on the parliament to do much more on climate. On Wednesday, UK MPs endorsed a Labour motion to declare a formal climate and environment emergency. In the US, Democratic contenders for the presidency from Bernie Sanders to Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren are scrambling to back the Green New Deal. Further, it has forced Republicans to actively propose their own climate solutions, something no one would have expected given their climate-denialist president. In Australia, we are in the midst of the climate election. We are seeing a swath of climate independents, and climate and environment has jumped from the ninth most important issue for voters to fourth, according to the latest Ipsos poll. According to ABC’s vote compass, environment is a top-two issue. Unfortunately, despite this growing concern, the public discourse on climate change is still dominated by the positions of the two major political parties federally. On one side there is the Coalition and its lip service to climate change (and occasional denial), enabled by the Murdoch press. On the other side you have the Labor party, which is endeavouring to look moderate and reasonable on climate action. To that end they have split the difference between the Coalition doing nothing and what the science is telling us is needed. Their 45% emissions reduction target is the lower end of what the Climate Change Authority recommended in 2015 would be needed given the climate science, and since then science shows things are getting worse more quickly. And while obviously significantly better than the Coalition, the recent science and real-world experience shows that all of our modelling (which targets are based on) are much more conservative than what is really happening. This is the challenge for climate campaigns and movements in countries like Australia. How do we shift from where we currently stand to where the ALP’s climate policies are considered the bare minimum of what is needed? Because in the end, to quote Greta Thunberg: “Change is coming whether you like it or not.” Nicky Ison is a research associate at the Institute for Sustainable Futures at the University of Technology Sydney and co-founder of the Community Power Agency."

Share this...FacebookTwitterNTZ reader Edward has brought this here to my attention. Journalist James Delingpole, a tireless sceptic of CAGW, has been awarded the Bastiat Prize for Online Journalism at an awards ceremony in New York last night.
Congratulations James! Keep up the good work.
James indeed has become one of the most prolific and effective journalists when it gets down to reporting on the faults and shenanigans of AGW science.
The Telegraph writes:
James’s posts on the Climategate scandal made a huge international impact on the debate over global warming, raising serious questions about the scientific basis of some of the more extravagant predictions of environmental apocalypse.
He has made an immense contribution in forcing the science back to the realms of sanity. The Telegraph:
After James’s posts appeared, generating in some cases over a million page views each, the scientific consensus over climate suddenly appeared a good deal more fragile than it had previously, as even some supporters of the global warming thesis concede. (Others, in contrast, splutter with rage at the mere mention of Delingpole’s name).

Share this...FacebookTwitterThat’s the amazing thing warmist and alarmist Prof Hans Joachim Schellnhuber has recently admitted, according to Der Spiegel here (read the last paragraph).
Now in English here!
And again they assert that the public is just too stupid to have a say in this important public issue.
Schellnhuber even compares himself, his fellow “climate scientists” and climate science to Albert Einstein and the theory of relativity (read below).
More on that in just a bit, but first during the night, Anthony Watts posted news that prominent scientist Hal Lewis is resigning from the American Physical Society. Anthony asked other bloggers to spread the news. Anthony feels so strongly about this that he even equated it to Martin Luther:
This is an important moment in science history. I would describe it as a letter on the scale of Martin Luther, nailing his 95 theses to the Wittenburg church door.
Dr. Lewis has had enough of the charlatans and frauds infesting climate science all over the world. Read his complete resignation letter here.  In it he writes about Climategate’s aftermath and climate science:
It was a fraud on a scale I have never seen, and I lack the words to describe its enormity. Effect on the APS position: none. None at all. This is not science; other forces are at work.- Hal Lewis
Now, Schellnhuber and Der Spiegel
Two days ago Der Spiegel came out with one of the nastiest hit pieces I’ve seen in a long time called: Crusade Against Science – The Charlatans of Climate Science. (Note they’ve softened the title in English). The title I translated was the one used here, scroll down.
Fred Singer. Photo source: CFACT
Der Spiegel singled out Fred Singer and attacked every aspect about him, rehashing all the old tobacco and merchant-of-doubt stuff. Naomi Oreskes’s fingerprints were everywhere here. Face it, she’s hopelessly infatuated with Fred Singer.
Der Spiegel calls Singer “one of the most influential climate deniers worldwide” and a lead denier in the NIPCC, which it describes:

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




Sounds impressive, but is actually just a collection of like-minded scientists that have gathered around him. Also one German is in it: Gerd Weber. a meteorologist who for 25 years was at the service of the German coal industry.
Der Spiegel also goes after Pat Michaels and Myron Ebell, writing that spreading doubt in USA has been easier than in Europe, but that Singer and the “deniers” are working on that too, and have teamed up with the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE). Der Spiegel:
Behind the impressively sounding name is hardly anything more than a post office box in Jena. President Holger Thuss is a local CDU politician [conservative party].
Indeed it is so. There is simply no funding for them and so this small but committed group is forced to operate on a shoestring. EIKE is not showered with tens of millions of euros like activist groups and warmists are. Yet, notice how fearful Der Spiegel and the Science Establishment in Germany are. Even Der Spiegel feels it has to mobilise and slap down the EIKE shoestring operation.
Schellnhuber and debate
Der Spiegel writes that Hans Joachim Schellnhuber of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research has nothing against having a discussion with serious scientists, but refuses to debate with whom he considers “amateurs”. Der Spiegel:
In the end, the science has gotten so complex that the large part of the population is not able to follow it. The climate sceptics, on the other hand, are satisfying “a need for simple truths”.
And that’s precisely where Schellnhuber sees the sceptic’s secret to success. Unfortunately a public debate would not help: “Imagine if Einstein had to defend his theory of relativity on talkshow Maybritt Illner. He wouldn’t have a snowball’s chance in hell.”
What Schellnhuber is saying here is amazing. He’s saying that his climate science would not stand a chance in a public debate. How right you are Herr Schellnhuber. But here it is so because your science is light-years away from Einstein’s when it comes to quality, and not because the people in the land of poets and thinkers are unable to understand it.
And so that’s why he accepts having a discussion only with people who agree with him.

"More than half of the world’s new oil and gas pipelines are located in North America, with a boom in US oil and gas drilling set to deliver a major blow to efforts to slow climate change, a new report has found.  Of a total 302 pipelines in some stage of development around the world, 51% are in North America, according to Global Energy Monitor, which tracks fossil fuel activity. A total of $232.5bn in capital spending has been funneled into these North American pipeline projects, with more than $1tn committed towards all oil and gas infrastructure. If built, these projects would increase the global number of pipelines by nearly a third and mark out a path of several decades of substantial oil and gas use. In the US alone, the natural-gas output enabled by the pipelines would result in an additional 559m tons of planet-warming carbon dioxide each year by 2040, above 2017 levels, according to Global Energy Monitor, citing International Energy Agency figures. This surge in emissions is set to take place at a time when scientists have warned of punishing heatwaves, floods and economic damage if greenhouse gases are not drastically cut. A landmark UN report released last year warned that global emissions must be halved by 2030 and essentially nullified by 2050 to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. “This is a whole energy system not compatible with global climate survival,” said Ted Nace, co-author of the Global Energy Monitor report. “These pipelines are locking in huge emissions for 40 to 50 years at a time, with the scientists saying we have to move in 10 years. These pipelines are a bet that the world won’t get serious about climate change, allowing the incumbency of oil and gas to strengthen.” New gas pipelines outnumber oil pipelines by about four to one, bolstered by a glut of abundant natural gas that is swiftly replacing coal as the leading electricity source for US homes and businesses. The most active area for pipelines is the Permian basin in west Texas, a sprawling formation that contains huge deposits of oil and gas. Other active zones include the shale formations in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia, and the Canadian tar sands of Alberta. Several of these pipeline projects have spurred bitter protests from climate and indigenous activists, such as the Dakota Access project, which resulted in violent clashes at the Standing Rock reservation in North Dakota. The extension to the Keystone pipeline, which would link the Alberta tar sands to refineries on the Gulf of Mexico, has also aroused opposition that Donald Trump has vowed to sweep aside by pushing the project forward. While domestic energy use increased last year – Americans consumed 4% more energy than in 2017, according to US government figures – the boom in oil and gas pipelines is largely set to cater for the US’s increasing role as an energy exporter. Nace said there are “unrealistic expectations” over exports of liquified natural gas to Asia, in particular, due to an increase in gas production there and concerns over climate change. International goals to limit global warming to 2C (3.6F) above pre-industrial times will be “difficult or impossible to achieve” with the completion of the new pipelines, according to Heidi Peltier, an energy expert at the University of Massachusetts, who was not involved in the new research. “From a climate perspective, this is very bad news,” she said. “What we need is increased investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency, not increased investments in fossil fuel infrastructure.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterBack in late October it was all over the media; the jubilation was huge. A German retrofitted Audi A2 equipped with new high-tech batteries was driven 605 km from Munich to Berlin on a single charge with an average speed close to 90 kilometres per hour, read here. It was a new record. The Mayor of Berlin, Klaus Wowereit, even welcomed the electric car at the Brandenburg Gate – a national landmark. The symbolism could not have been more poignant.
Driver Mirko Hannemann even joked that there was still enough power left to charge the iPhones of the reporters, who had flocked behind the car in a media spectacle along the route. The record-setting trip represented the breakthrough that would herald in a new age of environmentally friendly mobility, and it became a symbol of German engineering prowess.
 The 605 km distance smashed all records. Typically an electric car can travel around 70 km on a single charge, and so the 600 km distance represented a quantum leap. Electric mobility was no longer just a utopian dream. It was now reality.
According to the German Information Centre Pretoria:
In Japan, a battery-powered car has run 1,000 kilometres on one charge. That May feat was the work of Japan Electric Vehicle Club. The German engineers said their car was special because the battery was not installed inside the luggage area, but under the luggage area, meaning the full interior space of the car was still available.
German Economic Minister Reinhard Bruderle made sure to be photographed sitting in the car, indulging in its success.
According to the manufacturer of the batteries and electric motors, DBM Energy, the car has a lithium-metal-polymer battery and can function for 500,000 kilometres.
Hannemann, 27, the chief of DBM energy, said 50 experts spent six weeks adapting and tuning up the car for the run.
It was the long awaited feat needed to launch the German government’s ambitious goal of having five million electric cars on its streets by 2030, and by 2050 most urban transport would do without fossil fuels. Germany was on its way to becoming a world leading climate hero.
Is it all just a fraud?
Yesterday leading German newspaper DIE ZEIT wrote a report titled Dubious Record, raising serious questions about claims made by the heavily subsidized manufacturer. What has really raised eyebrows in particular are DMB’s claims that, as DIE ZEIT writes:
Its battery technology is ready for series production and is already affordable in niche markets, like forklifts. It allows 2000 charging cycles and 500,000 km of travel in an automobile. And that with unprecedented reliability. Even shooting through the batteries with live ammo neither led to a fire nor the release of poisonous gases. The wonder rechargeable battery “was able to maintain a constant power output”.

Those are awfully impressive claims. This led DIE ZEIT to ask: If that is so, then why all the future billions for further development? DIE ZEIT:
If that were the case, the auto industry would be at the start of a technological revolution, the military would have to convert over to this new munition-proof energy source. DBM managing director Mirko Hannemann has already received a top offer for its technology from Samsung for € 600 million – and turned it down. Why?
Independent testing refused
Die Zeit points out that when you’re playing with such high stakes, eventually you have to show your hand and become transparent. Potential investors want to see what’s really behind the mainly tax-payer financed record-setting Munich to Berlin trip. DIE ZEIT probes deeper:  
Hannemann drove the car alone while journalists had to tag along behind.”
And in order for the 600 km trip to be recognised as an official record, it was supposed to be certified by a notary public. And the manufacturer refuses to subject the technology to independent testing. DIE ZEIT:
An invited notary public never showed up. German automobile club ADAC offered to test the super-car and its potent batteries, yet the company declined. Concerning an offer to organise an independent test, no reply came to DIE ZEIT by the press deadline. That’s not a good omen! The “breakthrough” in battery technology could very well turn into a PR disaster.”
Shall we call it electric-car gate? The “record”, which probably led to hundreds of millions more being approved for research, could very well turn out to have been just a hoax. If so – fooled again!
======================================================
Update: hat-tip Dirk:
DBM technology “old and unsafe”. Financial Times Deutschland reports:
A packaging manufacturer had bought a DBM Energy battery for the forklift. Just two months later ‘incompatibility between the battery and the charging unit occurred,’ confirms Papstar-Logistik director Gregor Falke. 100 firemen were mobilized, 7 people had to be hospitalized.

"Labor has flatly rejected one of the Coalition’s most persistent attack lines of the 2019 campaign, saying it is “impossible” to cost the impact of its climate policy because it is a pollution limit, not a carbon price. At a press conference in Perth, Bill Shorten and Labor’s climate spokesman, Mark Butler, also defended Labor’s plan to limit taxpayer-funded pay increases to early childhood educators. On Monday evening, Shorten defended Labor’s 45% emissions reduction target in the first leaders’ debate by arguing Australia cannot afford inaction on climate change. On Tuesday, Shorten picked up where he left off, accusing Scott Morrison of using “every excuse in the book not to take action on climate change” and noting it was estimated to cause $18bn of damage a year through natural disasters and more extreme weather events. “This government is going down every rabbit hole, down every burrow, on every sideshow to avoid one fact – they don’t have a climate policy, do they?” Butler said that Labor had adopted the safeguards mechanism introduced by the Coalition to limit pollution and the Parliamentary Budget Office “would not have modelled” the cost of it, the same as it couldn’t for the Coalition under Malcolm Turnbull or Scott Morrison. “But if I can go to the point about the cost impact of the policy we’ve announced, it is impossible to cost this, because a Labor government … would not be imposing a direct carbon price on businesses,” he said. “If businesses are able to stick to their limit, then they won’t hear from the government any more … [and] there is no price impact at all. “And if they’re not able to stick to their limit, in the same way that they’re not under the safeguards mechanism as it operates now, they’ll have the broadest possible range of offsets.” Since Labor confirmed it would allow international offsets, Morrison has ridiculed the opposition for allowing carbon credits from Kazakhstan. Business leaders have defended the use of international credits to mitigate climate change in a cost-effective way. The Coalition has relied on BAEconomics modelling, which does not estimate the benefit of avoiding climate change to claim Labor’s policy would harm the economy. Butler said that how businesses reduce emissions “won’t be dictated by Canberra, so it can’t be costed by Canberra”.  “It will be a matter for them,” he said. “And that is what business unanimously has asked the Labor party to adopt as our policy.” Butler said that Citibank had found Labor’s policy would have an “immaterial” economy-wide impact and that Warwick McKibbin concluded that a 45% target and the Coalition’s 26% target “would have no different impact whatsoever”. “The impact on the economy would be exactly the same, which would be that the economy over the course of the decade would grow in real terms by about 23%.” Butler noted McKibbin had reaffirmed that view “in recent days” with one exception – “which is to say he thinks the costs of emissions reduction will actually be lower than he thought in 2015 because of the extraordinary technological improvements that have been made in the energy sector”. Shorten told reporters that Morrison’s “only argument for re-election is that he’s not Labor”.  “You and I know this is the most threadbare policy offering in a century of Australian elections,” he said. Shorten was asked about Labor’s plan to boost early childhood educators’ pay by 20% at a cost of $9.9bn over the decade. He confirmed the policy of taxpayer-funded pay rises was a “special solution” that Labor would only apply to the childcare sector, which he described as “unique”. Shorten cited the fact childcare workers are the 92nd lowest paid of 96 sectors, in an industry where women are the majority of the workforce. Shorten said Labor had “other mechanisms” to lift pay in other industries – citing the policy to reverse penalty rate cuts to restore $2.8bn of pay for retail, hospitality and pharmacy workers over the next term of government. Labor also has a policy to change the rules for equal pay cases, so that unions trying to prove the undervaluation of work in female-dominated industries will not require a comparison with a male. Shorten said he also thought aged care workers were “underpaid” but said Labor would see “what the royal commission produces”. “I think that we need to invest more in aged care generally,” he said, but ruled out a taxpayer-funded pay top-up."
"Last October, the world’s most renowned climate scientists warned governments that humanity has just 12 years to prevent climate catastrophe. The UK government faces three choices to deal with carbon-heavy fossil fuels: force people to stop using them immediately; facilitate a rapid transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy; or hope business-as-usual market forces solve our problem for us. Strip away the rhetoric, and the Tory government is still relying on the latter option. A few weeks ago, lost in the never-ending fog of Brexit, the cross-party public accounts committee released a damning report on the public cost of decommissioning oil and gas infrastructure. Their report vindicates every argument Labour has made against the government’s massive tax breaks for oil and gas companies, under its Transferable Tax History (TTH) policy.  TTH uniquely allows companies buying North Sea oil and gas fields to inherit the tax histories of the sellers. The aim is to boost further extraction of oil and gas, when existing companies no longer can. British taxpayers will now subsidise multi-billion-pound companies in accelerating the collapse of our natural world. Extinction Rebellion recognises this threat, and is protesting outside the Treasury today. It questions why we continue to subsidise the very companies that jeopardise our future. I stand in complete solidarity with it. These tax reliefs have not brought any tangible benefit in protecting and creating jobs. They simply subsidise big business and facilitate and encourage further North Sea exploitation. As John McDonnell outlined when speaking in Scotland recently, any government intervention must be to secure the creation of new, green, sustainable jobs. The public accounts committee asked the government whether its “support for oil and gas may become incompatible with its long-term climate change objectives”. “No” would be the honest answer. Our current economic system, and everything that goes with it, is the ultimate cause of global climate breakdown. The government must be forced to explain why, if current production takes us past our climate targets,it is giving corporate tax breaks worth billions for the sole purpose of new drilling? Shockingly, the public accounts committee noted that the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) told it “that it expects, with a very high level of confidence, that the UK will need a lot more oil and gas for the next 25 years”. So much for climate stability. Basically, this government department does not expect the government to meet its own emissions reduction targets and is planning accordingly. The Tories are admitting all their talk is just for show. This won’t shock anybody who has been watching the government’s pathetic record on all things climate – its blatant disregard for the school strikers; its persistent support for fracking; its decimation of the wind and solar sectors; and an ignorance about the triggers Extinction Rebellion warn will tip us into climate breakdown. UK tax reliefs for decommissioning are forecast to exceed £1bn for 2018-2019. This will eat up half of our annual oil and gas tax receipts. Moreover, HMRC forecasts the sector’s decommissioning bill will cost the taxpayer at least £24bn. The Office for Budget Responsibility reckons it may easily cost many billions more. Under “the polluter pays” principle, it is corporations, not citizens, that should pick up this bill. As production declines and fields are decommissioned, annual tax reliefs will soon exceed oil and gas tax revenues. The government is setting taxpayers up to subsidise one of the wealthiest industries in the world, while Tory austerity economics slashes public services and decimates communities countrywide. The UK could become a global leader in decommissioning skills and technology as we move to a net-zero-carbon economy. But beyond warm words, there is a paucity to this government’s climate and energy policies.  • Clive Lewis is the Labour MP for Norwich South  "

Share this...FacebookTwitterVarious blogs and alternative media outlets like PR Week today are reporting on the disbanning of the anti-capitalist, anti-carbon radical environmental cult campaign known as the Camp for Climate Action.
This is the crazed campaign that attempted to storm the Drax coal-fired power plant and blockaded the British Airports Authority. According to Wikipedia the campaign’s overall puprose was to…
…act as a base for direct action against, major carbon emitters, as well as to develop ways to create a zero-carbon society. Camps are run on broadly anarchist principles…”
In a statement appearing at its website, the Climate camp is calling the step a “metamorphosis”.
The reason for the metamorphosis is:
The near-collapse of the financial system; droughts in the Amazon, floods in Pakistan; a new government in the UK; a violent programme of unprecedented cuts; food prices rising and real incomes eroding; revolutions across the Middle East… This is all very different from 2005 when the Camp for Climate Action first met to spark radical action on the greatest threat to humanity, climate change.”
The Camp for Climate has apparently grown tired of its civil disobedience and squatting out in nature. Their new mission:
…we will launch new radical experiments to tackle the intertwined ecological, social and economic crises we face.”

Wonderful. That’s exactly what the world needs right now: bored kook activists performing “radical experiments” on society for the pupose of avoiding imagined social and economic crises. Has the British healthcare system deteriorated to the point that it can no longer care for its mentally ill?
Obviously the movement has now been taken over by more refined, sophisticated lawyer-type activists, who see an opportunity to capitalise. Its leaders will probably get offices in London, Paris, Berlin, etc., a staff of legal advisors, and will criss-cross all over the world in jets to every type of UN-sponsored save-the-planet-conference with the rest of the environmental NGO leaders  – all funded by the EU, UN and other special interests.
Expect it to bully corporations into making donations, and threaten to send out its thugs if they don’t. The Climate Campaign ends its statement with (emphasis added):
Now is a chance to team up with the anti-cuts and anti-austerity movements and play a crucial role in the revolutionary times ahead. Anything but co-ordinated action is doomed to fail.
See you on the streets.”
Lovers of democracy and freedom – beware!

"The UK is breaching the Paris agreement on climate change by excluding international aviation and shipping figures from carbon budgets, according to a leading NGO. The Swedish campaigner Greta Thunberg accused the British government this week of “very creative carbon accounting” after the government defended its work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  The UK government does not include emissions from global flights or shipping when it states it has reduced emissions by more than 40% since 1990. Instead, international aviation and shipping are monitored by two UN agencies, but there are growing doubts that – in the case of aviation in particular – the bodies have the power or ability to tackle major transport carbon emitters. Globally, domestic and international flights emitted 895m tonnes of CO2 last year – 2.4% of global energy-related CO2 emissions, according to analysts at Carbon Brief.  Worldwide, aviation is one of the fastest growing sectors for greenhouse gas emissions, which increased by 76.1% between 1990 and 2012, according to the UN’s climate body. Andrew Murphy, of the Transport & Environment NGO, which sits as an observer at the ICAO, the UN agency responsible for international aviation, said this had to change. “Aviation has been kept off the books. If you look at the UK Climate Change Act both international shipping and aviation emissions are kept off the five-year carbon budgets. “We believe the Paris agreement is clear that international aviation and shipping should be included in national climate targets. Paris calls for a bottom-up approach so individual states can include what they want in their budgets. We don’t see this outsourcing of responsibility by governments for international aviation and shipping as consistent with Paris. It breaches the agreement.” The aviation industry is heavily represented at the ICAO, and there is criticism that the agency is too secretive and dominated by countries pursuing their own national interests to make an impact on tackling aviation emissions. Members of the ICAO this year brought in a much heralded system known as Corsia for airlines to report their emissions. The reporting will be two- or three-yearly, and airlines will be required to offset emissions from a 2020 baseline onwards, but full details of how the offsetting will work have not been finalised. It is not yet known whether emissions reported per airline will be made public. Dan Rutherford, from the non-profit International Council on Clean Transportation, said the Corsia system was not about reducing emissions but making airlines offset their impact. But the efficacy of offsetting was “the elephant in the room”, he said, and it would be a logical step for the UK and other nations to account for the emissions in their targets. “It took the aviation industry almost 20 years after the Kyoto agreement to come to some sort of agreement,” he said. “But because of the exemptions built into the system it will only cover about 5% of international aviation between now and 2050, so the impact is very small and then there is the question of offsetting and whether that is really what is needed in the aviation system, and whether the aviation sector really wants to decarbonise.” Alyssa Gilbert, head of policy and translation at the Grantham Institute for climate change and the environment, agrees that it is time for nations to take responsibility for cross-border aviation. “I think it would be a good idea for nations to report on international aviation emissions, if you report on something it makes it visible. It is kind of invisible at the moment,” she said. The UK’s draft aviation policy, published in December, said: “The UK’s trajectory to meeting its Climate Change Act 2050 target is set out in five-yearly carbon budgets that currently exclude emissions from international aviation. However, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), established by the Climate Change Act as the independent advisory body on climate change, recommends that international aviation should be included by 2050.” Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, said the problem of aviation emissions was going to get worse in the UK. “Heathrow, already the biggest point source of carbon in the UK, could soon get 50% bigger, and the draft aviation strategy supports growth at airports all around the UK and anticipates the need for another new runway this side of 2050. “While most sectors have legally binding emissions reductions targets, international aviation and shipping have been left out of carbon budgets so don’t face the same pressure to reduce. “Carbon offsetting has little or no place in a net zero future,” Lucas said. “In reality there’s no escaping the fact that aviation growth and our expectation of cheap flights can’t go on much longer.”"

Total: $ 1,960.00
Please note that Rob Honeycutt has pledged to match all the bets from the cool side, up to $5000.00. That’s very generous of him. And if we can get that many pledges from the coolists, then he’ll start looking for more (gullible 🙂 ) warmists to join in to up the ante. Let’s see how high we can get this.
Payment will be made 2021, and so if you think inflation and/or lack of interest paid, etc. will erode the amount, then please just add a little more to your pledge. Again, we want to keep it simple.
I’ve also added a permanent page for the bet, see side-bar, and have a new category called Climate Bet For Charity where you’ll find all posts, updates, etc. related to this bet.
There’s a lot more room for more bets. Hope more will join in on the fun and excitement for a good cause.  Thanks!

Share this...FacebookTwitterGreenpeace is known for breaking the law, trespassing, putting other people at risk, and chaining its members to drilling platforms to protest and, more importantly, to reap the capital of publicity. That’s one thing – but it’s quite another to recruit, psychologically manipulate, and exploit a child for the purpose waging psychological war on people who have different opinions. Greenpeace is ratcheting up the level of violence.
In the video that follows, posted by a reader at WUWT, Greenpeace instrumentalizes a hooded young boy as a propaganda pawn. The boy’s anger is clearly visible as he threatens and intimidates people with generational conflict. His expressions are militant, like those we see on tapes of crazed Islamic radicals released to publicize their threats. This is the new level of violence, directed and produced by Greenpeace.

Above: The new face of Greenpeace
No pediatricians in their right minds would condone such a use (misuse) of children. The boy is likely damaged behaviorally and socially because of it. Greenpeace needs to reflect on what it has done.
The child has been fed a diet of radical, angry and intolerant ideology; he makes his thinly veiled threats as prompted by his adult instructors. It’s possible the child is only acting out the part, so it’s not so bad – some will claim. But what has it taught him? That anger, intolerance and intimidation are power? That this is the way to reach objectives? And what message does he send to other children? It’s hardly an example of rational discourse. In fact it’s militant, shockingly militant.
The child is not even at an age that would allow him to form a balanced, informed and well thought-out opinion on the issue. Clearly he’s radicalized; he’s been manipulated. Greenpeace has preyed on a very young mind and used it as a psychological instrument of attack. These are methods and tactics which were once normally limited to most radical of religious groups. For sure the boy got pats on the back and high fives from his directors for his performance. The clip, after all, went viral. Aggression rules.
This new quality of violence by Greenpeace is not an isolated incident. The increasingly disturbing level of violence the once peaceful organization has resorted to is demonstrated by a rash of other violent incidents. The trend could not be more troubling. Gone are the days of a real environemtalal concern and peaceful protest.
Actively seeking violent confrontation
Today, Greenpeace purposely goes out and seeks confrontation – not in democratic debate with lawmakers, but in violent and at times bloody collisions with companies or organizations it disagrees with. Not long ago Greenpeace attacked French fishermen, who were minding their own business, working long days to make ends meet. See video here. If you’re against over-fishing, it’s okay. But take the issue up with the responsible lawmakers. That’s the appropriate avenue. Don’t go vandalizing and sabotaging legal businesses and putting families in financial jeopardy.

In another incident, a Greenpeace ship rammed into a Japanese fishing vessel, see below. Greenpeace claims, with the cover of the media, that the accident was the fault of the Japanese vessel. Judge for yourself:

Not long ago a leading Greenpeace official made threats directed at global warming skeptics. Prison Planet writes:
An article carried by the official Greenpeace website written by a Greenpeace member urges climate activists to resort to criminal activity in an effort to reinvigorate momentum for their stalling global warming agenda, while ominously threatening climate skeptics, ‘we know where you live.’
Demands dissenters be charged with high crimes
The promotion of widespread violence has not only been restricted to Greenpeace. Sympathizers like environmentalist staff writer Dave Roberts of Grist Magazine called for the Nuremberg-style trials for the “bastards” who were members of what he termed the global warming “denial industry”.
Then NASA’s James Hansen complains about democracy, and is quoted by the the UK Guardian as saying:
The democratic process doesn’t quite seem to be working.
He called fossil fuel CEOs criminals, not citing any particular law – except his own. Read here. Hansen says:
 In my opinion, these CEOs should be tried for high crimes against humanity and nature.
James Hansen, and former Vice President of the United States, Al Gore, have actively and openly called for civil disobedience.
Clearly they’ve lost all sense of reason and rationale. With such extreme rhetoric and a poisoned environment, it’s no wonder we got someone like James Jay Lee. And unless radicals like Greenpeace sober up and realize the folly and hazard they’ve become, expect worse to come in the future. It’s time to put these well-known radicals under close observation.

"It’s been a strange campaign in some respects, and the so-called debate about climate policy has been deeply strange. With new numbers doing the rounds about the cost of Labor’s climate policy, it’s a useful time to work through the issues step by step. No. Really, we’re not. Let’s take a minute to consider how the campaign debate is being framed. Instead of beginning at the logical starting point, looking at what the climate science tells us, and understanding the risks associated with failing to take action (which is the conventional conversation), the Australian campaign conversation is wedged in a cul-de-sac about the (alleged) costs of acting to avoid the worst-case scenario. We are stuck in a loop of Big Scary Numbers™ not because that’s the most fundamental issue to consider, but because Scott Morrison wants voters to think that Bill Shorten is risky and reckless. That’s why we are here. It’s about politics. One point about the alleged costs – I say alleged costs because forecasts are forecasts. They are not facts. Hold that thought, because we are going there next. The new modelling that’s generated headlines on Wednesday morning is work from economist Brian Fisher. Fisher is a respected economist who used to head up Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics. Of course it’s important to consider the costs of action, policy shouldn’t be formed in a vacuum, but economic modelling is like a cake – it reflects what you put into it. It’s the sum of its ingredients, and a lot of experts take issue with Fisher’s underlying assumptions. I’ll give you a couple of concrete examples. Fisher’s cost of abatement curve is very high. (In plain English, this means the assumed costs of managing pollution). Some experts say Fisher’s cost curve is up to 10 times higher than other economic modellers. Frank Jotzo from the Australian National University says Fisher’s abatement costs go up to $600 per tonne of CO2 reduced, when the real world costs today are $100 or less. Another specific example. Fisher assumes the cost of energy storage is high, up to $200 MW/h. To get some perspective on this, Snowy Hydro is selling firmed renewable energy today (that means energy with storage) at $70 MW/h. So I repeat, what goes in to the model determines the numbers that spit out the other side. Not really. This is the funny thing – even though Fisher’s numbers about the impacts of Labor’s policies are higher than other sophisticated guesstimates, no one needs to grab the smelling salts, but understanding that point does require a sense of proportion, and a willingness to report information in proper context. Under the four scenarios Fisher modelled, gross national product declines by between $542bn to $264bn over 10 years when compared to the reference case. If you accept Fisher’s four scenarios are in the ballpark (and a reminder, there are questions about that given the assumptions are contested) then the estimated cost needs to referenced against the size of the Australian economy in 2030, which is expected to be more than $2tn. Let’s say that again. $2tn. One more point that gets a bit lost in the mix when politicians use hyperbole like a 45% emissions reduction target will be “a wrecking ball” in the economy – Fisher’s calculations say Australia’s economy continues to grow with a higher target. Growth does not go backwards. We don’t know, because Fisher didn’t consider that. He considered that particular question – a pretty fundamental one if you think about it – beyond his scope. The other thing he failed to consider was the cost of ongoing policy uncertainty associated with the last 10 years of brain dead hyper-partisan brawling about climate change. Just to illustrate this point: prominent economist Warwick McKibbin argued in 2015 that policy uncertainty would have a more substantial negative impact on real GDP than taking action on emissions reduction consistent with the Paris agreement. He said ongoing policy uncertainty leads to a lack of investment in new generation, and a slowdown in investment in the energy sectors raises the price of energy significantly, which flows through to economic activity. There’s no free lunch here. Labor has left itself exposed politically by not producing its own a back-of-the-envelope number, given how reductionist the policy debate is in Australia, but, in the world of facts, what Labor is saying is correct. It’s factual for this reason. Labor has set out the framework of its climate policies: the emissions reduction target, which is 45% (compared to the government’s 26%), and the various policy mechanisms to deliver that result. But there is a fair bit of fine print missing because Labor wants to consult with stakeholders on final design before attempting to legislate the policy. One of the missing elements is what proportion of international permits Labor will allow businesses to use to meet their emissions reduction requirements. Having access to permits means businesses can buy emissions reduction occurring elsewhere. Fisher’s work shows permits significantly reduce the costs to the economy of emissions reduction, so until we know the proportion of permits and a bunch of other things we don’t yet know – including what the Senate does to the policy if Labor wins – any number produced would be a guess. One of the more bizarre elements of the election debate has been the debate about permits, not only because the subject is so arcane (you are in a pretty strange place when permits becomes your killer political point) – but also because of a basic logical contradiction. Scott Morrison has zeroed in on permits as symptomatic of the costs Labor wants to impose as a consequence of its climate policies. It’s a weird component to pick on, given permits lower the cost of abatement. This is an orthodox point, and Fisher’s analysis makes that abundantly clear. It’s weird too, because the Coalition decided in 2017 it would use international permits itself for exactly the same reason Labor is planning to use them. Adding international permits to the mix was government policy until about a month before the election. Pretty cynical, right? But doesn’t that sum up the ridiculousness of Australia’s ridiculous climate debate?"

Strangely, this story comes to my attention from a German site: www.donnerwetter.de. Today, February 5, is National Weathermen’s Day in the USA. Actually now it is called National Meteorologists Day.
It is also to honour physician John Jeffries, born 5 February 1744, who kept detailed weather records in Boston from 1774 until 1816.
It’s no secret that a vast majority of meteorologists, i.e. experts in forecasting, disagree with the kook claims made by alarmist “climate scientists”, i.e. physicists who were taken away from their taxi-driving careers, thanks to government job-creation programs.
Okay, I know I’m going to get into trouble with that generalization. I admit – not all climate scientists started out as taxi drivers after getting their Phds.
What meteorologists think of climate science

Here’s what meteorologists think of global warming, according to a 2009/2010 survey of the American Meteorological Society (AMS) that was limited to television weather forecasters who are also meteorologists. Read here www.heartland.org:
* Only one in four American Meteorological Society broadcast meteorologists agrees with the United Nations’ claims that humans are primarily responsible for recent global warming.
* Only 24 percent of the survey respondents agree with United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assertion, “Most of the warming since 1950 is very likely human-induced.”
* Only 19 percent agree with the claim, “Global climate models are reliable in their projection for a warming of the planet.”

* Only 19 percent agree with the assertion, “Global climate models are reliable in their projections for precipitation and drought.”
* The survey results support the claims of rank-and-file scientists who say global warming position statements by the bureaucratic branches of groups such as the American Meteorological Society (AMS) are out of touch with the scientific opinions of member scientists.
Who are are really the better forecasters? 
I’m sure there are readers out there who are going to bring up the academic qualifications argument, as well as claim meteorology and climatology are different…yak yak yak.
All you have to do is look at who has been successful in making forecasts. For example, compare the seasonal forecasts of the Met Office to that of private meteorological organisations – who are not no-risk government-pampered outfits producing results where quality doesn’t matter financially. In fact, the more off-the-wall your results are as a government institute, the more the funding!
If your models cannot even get a 3-month forecast right – don’t even open your mouths about 50 and 100-year forecasts. Even your five and ten-year “climate forecasts” of rare snowfalls and mild winters have been completely wrong. And claiming the appearance of Godzilla is due to AGW and setting your science up as non-falsifiable only make you appear all the more look like charlatans.
Thanks to meteorologists
So thanks to all the meteorologists out there who have made a major contribution in preventing climate science from descending into the realms of mass panic and complete madness. Without you, Al Gore and the rest of the climate kooks would have had us believe that CO2 is the only thing driving the earth’s climate and we would have long since been under enviro-martial law :).
We really ought to make February 5 a national holiday for that.

"A line in a scientific report about what climate change might mean to the UK, which caused a lot of trouble for this reporter 25 years ago, suggested that warmer summer weather would create conditions for malaria to return to the south and east of England.  The front-page story said that conditions in the UK for Anopheles atroparvus, the indigenous mosquito most likely to carry malaria, were improving so much that the disease could return in about 2020. Critics considered it alarmist.  Since malaria, referred to as the ague, was common enough in the UK to be mentioned nine times in Shakespeare’s plays, it did not seem too far-fetched a claim but it caused a lot of debate. The argument seemed to be that while conditions for mosquitoes were improving, and they are thriving in the UK’s current climate, it would need the misfortune of a human already infected with malaria to be bitten in order to transmit the disease to the insects.  The infected insect would then have to bite another human to spread the disease locally. Since more than a million UK citizens currently go to malaria-infested countries each year and round 1,500 return with the disease it seems we have been lucky so far.  "
" School students who want action on climate change will target Tony Abbott’s office in Warringah and Josh Frydenberg’s seat of Kooyong on Friday, as the two senior Liberals face tough re-election fights. After staging two national days of protest in the past six months, the school strike movement is turning its attention to key seats in the upcoming 18 May election.  On Friday, students will also protest outside the offices of Labor’s Anthony Albanese and Jason Clare, prime minister Scott Morrison in his southern Sydney seat of Cook, and Liberal MP Trevor Evans in the seat of Brisbane, among others. Warringah and Kooyong, two formerly safe Liberal seats, may be at risk of falling to climate-focused challengers. Abbott is up against the independent Zali Steggal, and Frydenberg faces the Greens’ Julian Burnside, Labor’s Jana Stewart and independent Oliver Yates, a former head of the Clean Energy Finance Council and former Liberal member. Fatima Kidwai, 18, who lives in Kooyong, said she felt frustrated that Frydenberg, who was environment minister from July 2016 to August 2018, had “not made much of a difference”. “I’ve been living in Kooyong ever since I lived in Melbourne,” Kidwai said. “I once ran into Frydenberg at the train station. He has been in the seat for nine years, he has been environment minister, he had a lot of time to make a difference and advocate for change and we feel like he didn’t do as much as we’d like him to do. “For the first time climate is such a big issue in this election. It’s a climate election – and [that’s] kind of thanks to all the students and all the work they have done. “This time people are talking about how Kooyong is becoming a marginal seat. That’s why we’re so pumped to have a rally going outside the office just to keep up the pressure, to show him that we’ve had enough. You’ve had it pretty easy for a couple of years and now there is a change coming.” In Warringah, Vivienne Paduch, 15, said she would be attending the protest against Abbott, describing him as “one of the most destructive climate deniers in Australian politics”. “My whole life he has been my federal member, and it is a huge source of shame and disappointment,” she said. “He has proven time and time again that he doesn’t care about climate change. During his time in power, he abolished the carbon tax, which was successfully bringing down emissions at the time. “He needs to know and he needs to see that the actions he has done are not OK and we won’t stand idly by.” Paduch said older people were very receptive of the school student strike movement. “There has been a lot of support especially from older generations, who are really concerned that one day we might not be able to have grandchildren of our own,” she said. “There has been a lot of support not just from our parents, and our grandparents. And adults are invited to come along and they have been coming to the last two climate strikes as well. “The outcome is to have as many people as possible and to really get the message across that he either has to change or he will get voted out.” In the NSW seat of Gilmore, Bomaderry high school students Zara Podmore, 16, and Cedar Podmore, 15, took part in the last climate strike on 15 March and will strike again on Friday. They estimate around 200-300 students took part in Nowra. “Last time there was a march across the Nowra bridge, yelling stuff,” Cedar said. Zara said: “I think on Friday we’ll be marching through the town. “But on the last one – it was interesting – there was a Liberal meeting across the road, we were yelling very loudly to get to them. I think Scott Morrison was even there.” Cedar said: “He didn’t even come to the protest – he was in Nowra and he didn’t even come to say hi, which was rude.” Asked what her message for the prime minister would have been, Cedar said: “We probably would’ve told him to get better policies on climate change.” Zara said climate change was “not as real” for politicians because “they’re not going to have to deal with all of the consequences we have to deal with”. Their mother, Sue Cuninghame, said she accepted the opinion of parents who did not let their children out of school and noted that other parents let their children skip school but did not disclose it was to attend the strike. “We really wanted the girls to be able to be honest so we signed them out, to say it was for the climate change strike ... We were strong about it – that if you want to take action, you’re proud of what you do, and you’re happy to put your name to it and say that is what is happening.” Stephanie Liow, 15, lives in the electorate of Chisholm, and will be attending a central Melbourne protest. “Both major parties are quite frustrating given neither party has an effective climate policy. Us young people were hoping that Labor would fight Adani, except they haven’t taken a clear stance against Adani and they even just introduced a 1.5bn gas pipeline that is clearly not in support of urgent climate action. “It matters to young people so much. It will be our futures, and we’ll suffer the consequences of the government’s poor decisions.” Kidwai, in Kooyong, said she was optimistic. “It’s my first time voting in an election,” she said. “I’m pretty excited. The pre-polling booths will be on the way, I am probably going to be voting before the rally starts. “Kooyong is really stepping up their game. The people are really explicitly talking about how they want climate action. It does make me really happy.”"
"Organisers of the climate protests that have seen peaceful mass civil disobedience across London over the past two weeks have said the first stage of the “rebellion” is drawing to a close. How much of an impact has it had, and how realistic are its goals? The group has three core demands: 1) Tell the truthThe government must tell the truth about the scale of the ecological crisis by declaring a climate emergency, “working with other groups and institutions to communicate the urgent need for change”. 2) Zero emissions by 2025The UK must drastically cut its greenhouse gas emissions, hitting net zero by 2025. 3) Citizens’ assemblyThe government must create a citizens’ assembly to hear evidence and devise policy to tackle the climate crisis. 1) Tell the truthThe notion that politicians should tell the truth about what scientists, the UN and countless other experts say is an existential threat to human survival appears, on the face of it, to be a modest ask. But Extinction Rebellion (XR) point out that no political leaders in any country – certainly the current government in the UK – are being honest with the public about the scale or severity of the threat or what it will realistically take to address it. In this context, they argue, telling the truth is a radical act from which everything else will flow. 2) Zero emissions by 2025Hitting zero carbon emissions by 2025 represents a huge, some say an almost impossible, challenge. It would require a complete overhaul of the way we are organised as a society in just six years – fundamentally changing everything from transport to domestic and industrial energy systems, food production to overall levels of consumption. The UK’s Committee on Climate Change has currently set the target of an 80% reduction by 2050. XR and its supporters say rather than being guided by what is deemed “politically possible”, policy must now be driven by what is scientifically necessary. And they point out that the chaos of failing to tackle the crisis will dwarf any disruption caused by acting now. 3) Citizens’ assemblyA citizens’ assembly would, say advocates, help lend public legitimacy to what will need to be a radical overhaul of the economy and our society. It has been used successfully elsewhere – including in Ireland in 2016 on the issue of abortion – and could bypass the party political point-scoring in Westminster. Critics argue that the last thing the UK needs is a parallel government confusing an already chaotic democratic process that is struggling to deal with Brexit. Others, particularly on the Labour left, argue it is possible to meet the challenge through the existing political framework if radical enough policies are pursued. The short answer is no. But in each area progress is visible. 1) Telling the truthPartly through pressure from XR, scores of councils and local authorities in the UK have declared a climate emergency in recent months – as has the Labour party. Increasing numbers of politicians – certainly on the opposition benches – acknowledge that this is the biggest challenge facing humanity. However, the Conservative government in the UK has repeatedly dragged its feet. This week, during an urgent question tabled by Labour, the energy minister Claire Perry rejected the idea of declaring a climate emergency, saying: “I don’t know what that would entail.” She said she had reservations about the Extinction Rebellion protests: “I worry that many of the messages we are hearing ignore the progress that is being made, and as such make people fearful for the future rather than hopeful.” 2) Zero emissions by 2025The UK is nowhere near hitting zero emissions by 2045, never mind 2025. But the fact that this demand is now out there has changed the parameters of the debate. This week, confronted by XR protesters outside parliament, Labour’s Diane Abbott said MPs needed to come together to host a “broad conversation” about hitting net zero by 2025. “I think that things can change … on climate change and we can move towards the 2025 target,” she told them. Next week the Committee on Climate Change will announce its revised targets for the UK, including when the country should aim to reach net zero emissions. 3) Citizens’ assemblyThere is no sign at the moment that the government intends to set up a citizens’ assembly to address the climate crisis. A few Labour MPs – including Stella Creasy and Jon Ashworth – have backed the idea but certainly for now, it has not gained any real traction in Westminster. For many the peaceful mass protests of the last week have been transformational. Media coverage of the action has been widespread. The truth about the climate crisis – and the existential threat it poses to humanity – is, campaigners argue, now in the public domain and can no longer be ignored by those in power.  The language around climate change has also changed. Words like “extinction”, “rebellion”, “crisis” and “breakdown” are now part of everyday conversations when discussing the environmental threat. But perhaps most importantly what is deemed “politically realistic” has changed. In the eyes of many seasoned observers, the past two weeks represent a “tipping point”, with the Extinction Rebellion protests coinciding with more school strikes for the climate, the BBC’s David Attenborough documentary, and Mark Carney telling bankers they can no longer ignore the threat. The question now is whether politicians are prepared to rise to the challenge."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe cold now sweeping over Europe and other parts of the globe are due to natural cycles, says German meteorologist Thomas Globig. He points out that the first 2 weeks of December in Britain have been the coldest since the last little ice age 350 years ago, and claims some climate models have criminally under-estimated solar influence on climate and that we ought to expect colder winters, and expanding Arctic ice in the years ahead. “Some climate forecasts will have to be thrown in the dustbin.”
All the talk and hype among the clueless masses have been, and still is, about global warming due to human emissions of CO2. Will the temperature rise be 2°C, 4°C or 10°C? Will we be able to avert the climate catastrophe?
Yes, it all sounds like a really bad B-rated movie. But it’s not – it’s all junk science produced by green activists. Ignore it. Dr Benny Peiser here brings our attention to an essay posted at wetter.t-online.de here.
The talk of this essay is not about warming, but of drastic cooling. According to wetter.info:
‘The year 2010 will be the coldest in ten years for Germany,’ says Thomas Globig of the Meteomedia weather service in a discussion with wetter.info.
Now it’s sure: temperatures in Germany this year have averaged 8.1 °C, or 0.2°C below the long-term measured average of 8.3°C.  ‘I’m afraid that by the end of the year, we are going to end up much lower,’ says Globig.”
Us sceptics know that climate goes in cycles. Back in the 60s and 70s Europe got a lot of snow. Then it got milder – due to man-made global warming! – all the government funded scientists opportunistically chimed in. But lo and behold, it’s getting colder again. People have been caught off guard says Globig.
Why is it getting cooler? 
Globig attributes it to natural cycles: mainly the large-scale changes in the air flow over the Atlantic and fluctuating solar activity. There are Lows near the Azores and Highs in the North Atlantic, which means cold Arctic air is getting pumped down across Europe. “The weather situation has been turned up on its head,” says Globig.
Oh – but this is all due to man’s disruption of the weather, the alarmists will tell you. It’s actually abnormal! Not so, says Globig:
This change in the so-called North Atlantic Oscillation is completely normal – only that they are difficult to forecast in detail.’ With storm Kyrill in 2007, it was the peak of air mass flow from the warmer Atlantic into the European region.
Globig points out:

 Since then, the weather over the Atlantic has gotten calmer.”
Calmer weather over the Atlantic? Time for the climatologists to bring their crystal balls in for a major recalibration. Their crackpot models predicted just the opposite.
The NAO has switched. That means we ought to expect more cold winters in the years ahead. That’s right – forget warming. Ignore all the morons in the mainstream media.
These low temperatures could continue for a few years, maybe decades. Even icier winters can’t be ruled out. ‘This has occurred before in the past, and has to do with natural climate changes,’ says Globig. We could even be at the start of a little ice age, ‘the probability is there.’
It has to do with solar activity, according to wetter-t-online.de:
It has gone past its high point of its 200-year high-phase and will decrease over the coming decades. Around the year 2040/2050, scientists calculate there will be a new so-called solar minimum, that means much less feed-in of solar energy into the Earth’s atmosphere.
And when that happens, it means colder times ahead. And that means colder poles, which means expanding Arctic ice. Like Joe Bastardi, and probaly hundreds, if not thousands, of meteorologists, Globig thinks so too.
‘I find it quite plausible that Arctic ice will expand considerably over the next years,’ says Globig. ‘The influence of solar activity on climate has been criminally under-estimated.’
‘We will really know what is in store for us in the next five to seven years,’ Globig believes. Indeed one thing appears to be very probable for meteorologists: ‘We will have to throw some climate forecasts into the dustbin.’
Today, I can practically tell who gets their longterm forecasts from whom. I went to a home & garden center today to buy a snow shovel – they were all sold out. The next shipment? At the end of January! How much worse can you get?
Tomorrow I will call the headquarters of this home & garden center to see if I can find out where they are getting their forecasts. I’ll bet you they are getting them from the warmist DWD German Weather Service.

"Up to 400 Extinction Rebellion activists have been stopping traffic in moving protests across the City of London to highlight the role of the finance industry in fuelling climate change. Protesters are periodically forming human blockades across roads in the capital’s financial hub, occupying the street and halting traffic for seven minutes before allowing vehicles to pass, and then repeating the action. Traffic on Fleet Street was brought to a standstill for several hours after activists obstructed the road outside Goldman Sachs. A dozen protesters lay on the floor and connected their arms with tubes, blocking up to 30 buses and several cars as they called on the financial sector to divest from the fossil fuel industry. One of the activists on the ground was Cleo Peterson, 33, who seemed unfazed when a police officer told her she was going to be arrested, saying: “I want it on my record as a human being.” Other groups targeted junctions outside Bank station, King William Street, near Rothschild & Co, and Fleet Street. One protester held up a sign that read “Sorry for the delay, we won’t be long”, as about 40 people blocked Upper Thames Street, near London Bridge. Jane Goodland, 29, a maths teacher from Cambridge, said the so-called swarming protests allow small groups of people to cause disruption, while attempting to have engaging conversations with drivers to increase awareness of their cause. “We’ve targeted the financial sector because we believe the economic system in this country is part of the problem,” she said. Augusta Hull, 48, a massage therapist from north London, said: “It’s my first time swarming, but I’m out here because we have a climate and ecological crisis. I’ve been with Extinction Rebellion all week and have been inspired by the way they do things, the non-violence, the support of protesters when they’re being arrested, and the focus on love of the planet.” The environmental group said it was the last day of action before choosing to end its campaign of peaceful mass civil disobedience, following actions that led to hundreds of people being arrested and thousands of police officers deployed to sites occupied by the group for more than a week. Earlier on Thursday, climate change activists glued themselves to the entrances of the London Stock Exchange wearing LED signs saying “Climate emergency”, “Tell the truth” and “You can’t eat money”. Simultaneously, protesters in east London climbed on top of a train at Canary Wharf holding signs including “business as usual = death”, in what the group said was a reference to “the financial sector’s role in our collective suicide”. Protesters at both sites were later removed by police and five people were arrested at Canary Wharf. Among the protesters at Canary Wharf was Phil Kingston, an 83-year-old grandfather who has been involved in multiple direct action protests. One of the first members of Extinction Rebellion, he gained notoriety after chaining himself to a pipe in Oxford Circus. “Like all parents and grandparents, I want a future,” he said. He expressed his concern over the impact of climate change on the poorest people, arguing they would be most affected by ecological collapse. “Everything is going to have to shift,” he added, eating a sandwich on top of the train. Diana Warner, 60, a retired GP, had superglued herself to the train. “I’ve done it because, what else can I do? I want to speak up for all of our children. I also want to speak up for those who are losing their land now, and those who aren’t able to get enough food,” she said. Police detached Warner from the train and arrested her. When asked whether she was scared of being put in remand for a long period of time, Warner said no. “It made it more necessary to be here. We are part of them and they are part of us. We all need to survive. Some people can see it, understand it, and feel with compassion that we need to prevent more death and catastrophe, but there are many who don’t.” There were mixed responses from the public towards the demonstrations. One female bus driver, who did not want to be named, said she had been waiting for an hour for the protesters to move. “They have the right to protest, but it’s not fair for the public who want to go to work. They made their point and it’s been over a week. We all care about climate change, but people have to get to work,” she said. BREAKING: Time for MONEY to tell the truth on its role on the Climate and Ecological Emergency Extinction Rebellion UK is hitting the financial industry today to demand they tell the truth about the devastating impact the industry has on our planet. #lse #rebelforlife pic.twitter.com/zqof4bkCbR Grant, a support services assistant, said: “Climate change is a bigger issue than a lot of politicians are making out and I think something does need to be done about it. Most of the people hanging around here do have kids they need to leave the world to, yet they’re not really considering it.” The protest follows similar action last Wednesday in which Cathy Eastburn, 51, from south London, Mark Ovland, 35, from Somerton in Somerset, and Luke Watson, 29, from Manuden in Essex, were remanded in custody until their trial in May, after they were charged with obstructing trains or carriages on the railway by an unlawful act, contrary to section 36 of the Malicious Damage Act 1861. On Wednesday, the London protesters agreed to remove blockades and campsites at Marble Arch and Parliament Square. The group, which has been backed by senior academics, politicians and scientists, said in a statement that it would leave its remaining blockades on Thursday, but added: “The world has changed … A space for truth-telling has been opened up. “Now it is time to bring this telling of the truth to communities around London, the regions and nations of the UK, and internationally. In this age of misinformation, there is power in telling the truth.” The group said it would like to “thank Londoners for opening their hearts and demonstrating their willingness to act on that truth”. The statement added: “We know we have disrupted your lives. We do not do this lightly. We only do this because this is an emergency.” The activists said protesters had “taken to the streets and raised the alarm” in more than 80 cities in 33 countries. “People are talking about the climate and ecological emergency in ways that we never imagined,” they said. The group said it would work to build up a resilient movement to force politicians to address the climate crisis. The move came as it emerged the environment secretary, Michael Gove, had agreed to the meet representatives of the group. A spokesperson for XR said this was “totally unconnected” to its decision to end the current phase of the protests, adding that the meeting was under consideration. “It may or may not go ahead, depending on the details of how public it is and who will be attending,” they said. Support for Extinction Rebellion has quadrupled in the past nine days as public concern about the scale of the ecological crisis grows. Since the protests began last Monday, 40,000 new backers or volunteers have offered support to the group. In the same period, it has raised almost £200,000 – mostly in small donations of between £10 and £50 – making a total of £365,000 since January."
"MPs have endorsed a Labour motion to declare a formal climate and environment emergency, with Jeremy Corbyn hailing the move as a necessary response to school climate strikers and groups such as Extinction Rebellion. The Labour leader said the decision by the Commons to pass the motion without a vote “can set off a wave of action from parliaments and governments around the globe”. Conservative MPs were told to not oppose the motion. Corbyn, in a statement after the debate, added: “We pledge to work as closely as possible with countries that are serious about ending the climate catastrophe and make clear to Donald Trump that he cannot ignore international agreements and action on the climate crisis.” Labour also organised a rally outside parliament, which Corbyn was expected to address. Opening the debate Corbyn told MPs that at current trends the point of zero net emissions would not be reached until the end of the century, by which time “our grandchildren will be fighting for survival on a dying planet.” Responding for the government, the environment secretary, Michael Gove, said he accepted “that the situation we face is an emergency”, and called for a consensual, cross-party approach so the UK could take a lead on climate action. The opposition day debate was called in the wake of weeks of direct action by protesters, including school climate strikers and Extinction Rebellion sit-ins that closed roads and bridges around London. Last week both Corbyn and Gove were among MPs who met the teenage Swedish activist Greta Thunberg at parliament. Corbyn told the Commons that young activists “get it right away”. He said: “They grasp the threat to their own future. And in fact they want to be taught more about it as part of their curriculum. “Are we content to hand down a broken planet to our children? That is the question members must ask themselves today. We have the chance to act before it’s too late. It’s a chance that won’t be available to succeeding generations. It is our historic duty to take it.” The motion called for the declaration of a climate emergency and urgent remedial action such as a green industrial revolution as well as changes to transport, agriculture and other areas. Corbyn said the world faced a climate crisis that would “spiral dangerously out of control” unless rapid and dramatic action was taken immediately. He said: “We are talking about nothing less than the irreversible destruction of the environment within our lifetimes.” Corbyn added: “It’s too late for tokenistic policies or gimmicks. We have to do more than just ban plastic straws. Individual action is not enough. We need a collective response which empowers people instead of just shaming them if they don’t buy expensive recycled toilet paper or drive the newest Toyota Prius.” Gove, in response, said he shared the same broad ideas: “Not only do I welcome the opportunity that this debate provides, I also want to make it clear that on this side of the house we recognise that the situation we face is an emergency. It is a crisis, it is a threat, that all of us have to unite to meet.” There was, Gove argued, “a green thread of ambition running through Conservative governments”. However, when the Green MP Caroline Lucas intervened in the speech to ask how that approach could be reconciled with the government’s decision to back a third runway at Heathrow airport, Gove did not reply, prompting shouts from MPs of “Answer the question.” Gove promised to challenge Trump and other world leaders on climate inaction, saying he hoped to discuss the issue with the US president during his forthcoming state visit to the UK: “I want to make it clear to him that as the world’s biggest polluter he has to take responsibility.” Gove said it was wrong “to say that any one party in this house has a monopoly of virtue.” He said: “Let’s try to ensure that we have a civilised debate that combines a sense of urgency about the challenge in front of us and a determination to take action in the future.”"

Stop smoking - save the planet!
Don’t be surprised if someday soon cigarette manufacturers are required to modify their warning labels.
At the online Handelsblatt (Germany’s version of the Financial Times), Michael Kuhndt of the Wuppertal Institute Collaborating Centre on Sustainable Consumption and Production gGmbH replies to a reader’s inquiry on how smoking impacts climate change. Read here.
This is all part of a campaign by the Handelsblatt in cooperation with the Federal Ministry of Environment.  
Yes – smoking is not only bad for your health, but also helps to kill the climate. According the World Health Organisation, about 1.1 billion people worldwide smoke, and this number is expected to triple over the next 25 years.
All that smoke and tobacco farming will surely have an impact on the climate. Smoking alone spews 2.6 million tons of CO2 and 5.2 million tons of methane into the atmosphere every year, says Kuhndt.


But that’s not the worst part, tobbacco farming and disposing of waste has impacts on the environment too. The widespread monoculture inherent in growing tobacco extracts six times more potassium from the soil than growing other plants does.
But now comes the big hammer: 150 kg of wood are needed for drying one kilogram of tobacco, which converts to 1.2 million hectares of forest. About 600 million trees are chopped down annually to make room for tobacco plants. These trees could remove 22 million tons of the climate-killing gas yearly.
Not only that, all those cigarette filters end up on the ground and contaminate the groundwater with nicotine, dioxin, formaldehyde and cadmium, so claims Kuhndt.
Great, now we can blame the next NYC snowstorm on smokers.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAn increased frequency in extreme weather events, a cooling North Atlantic, and growing Arctic sea ice were viewed as signs of climate change. The odds of a warmer climate in the future, according to one scientist, were “at best 1 in 10,000” (see below). That’s what Der Spiegel wrote in a 3700-word article back in 1974, warning the world of a coming ice age. 
Hat tip: oekowatch.org. 
In that issue Der Spiegel described a series of “weather extremes” occurring all over the world, claiming they were unmistakable signs of a climate change to cooling: deluges of rain in West Germany, severe thunderstorms that uprooted trees and blew off roofs in Berlin, the worst storm in 100 years devastating much of Lower Saxony, hurricane Agnes inflicting 3 billion dollars in damage, floods in Japan and Peru, temperatures in Argentina, India and South Africa dropping to their lowest levels in 300 years.
Back in 1974, in its introduction, Der Spiegel wrote:

Is a new ice age coming? Not right away, but the rainy summers in northern Europe, scientists fear, were only a part of the worldwide shift in weather — a preview of cooler and wetter times ahead.

It’s the same type of stuff we’re hearing today from the hysterical media. As Der Spiegel wrote, there were signs of climate change happening everywhere, and the world was seriously threatened. Scientists and experts were forecasting widespread global suffering and that billions could die. Today, thirty six years later, we see they were all wrong.
To provide an overview, look at the NAO 36 years ago (dark blue line is CET, orange/light blue is NAO). Back in 1974 one expert said the warming that followed had only a 1 in 10,000 chance of happening:

North Atlantic Oscillation index compared with CET winter record, 1860-2010 (CET graph source: http://climate4you.com/ ). Right now we really ought to be worried about cooling!
Today life is far better as a whole than what the doomsayers projected – thanks to technology, and to the warming that ensued – against the 10,000 to 1 odds. Strange how governments, media and activists want to return to those cold and miserable days that Der Spiegel complained about in 1974. Back then they were unanimous in saying warmer was better.
Der Spiegel wrote that the signs of cooling were detected in the North Atlantic:
At the latest since 1960, in the NorthAtlantic, meteorologists and climate scientists have believed that something is wrong with the vast system of the global weather: The earthly climate they believe is on the verge of changing over… First measurements showed a cooling of the North Atlantic. There the ocean temperature dropped over the last 20 years from 12°C on average to 11.5°C.
And the Arctic ice was growing at an alarming rate (ignoring man’s emissions of GHG, apparently):
Meanwhile the ice pack and glacier-covered area of the northern hemisphere grew by about 12%, at the Arctic Circle the coldest temperatures in 200 years were recorded.
In the 1974 report, Der Spiegel wrote about the warming period of 1890 – 1945. Recall how many of today’s scientists are claiming that the recent rise in temps over the last 50 years is “unprecedented”. Der Spiegel, however, documents that the same happened in the early part of the 20th century:
In the time between 1890 and 1945 scientists registered a general warming of the earth’s climate. The global annual average temperature rose during this time by about 0.7°C. — in polar regions the rise was even several degrees.
So much for unprecedented. Der Spiegel also wrote about the MWP of 800 years before (which some scientists today say never really existed).

Pessimism back then, like today, was the order of the day
Der Spiegel also wrote about the causes of climate change:
One thing climate scientists know for sure– already very small irritations, and for that reason often they are difficult to measure, can throw the global climate out of whack. A reduction of solar radiation of one percent or an increase in the world’s average cloudiness by just 4% is enough to trigger a new ‘big ice age’.
Der Spiegel then wrote that the consequences of this would be catastrophic, as agricultural output would decline, crops would be wiped out, etc.  US scientist Reid Bryson of the University of Wisconsin said:
If the current worsening of the climate continues, all of humanity will suffer — a billion people will starve.”
US weather researcher James McQuigg:
 The chances of a rash return to the optimum climate of the 1930s are at best  1 in 10,000″.
Der Spiegel wrote:
Some climate scientists even foresee the coming of a worldwide natural catastrophe. That’s what Austrian science author Peter Kaiser (‘The Return of the Glaciers’) believes. Canadian weather scientist Kenneth Hare advises governments of impacted countries to stockpile food.”
Überpessimist Paul Ehrlich warned of the consequences of global cooling:
Only a rapid aid program can prevent the catastrophe, fears Ehrlich. But the rich countries of the west, he complains, proved themselves to be failures during the crisis management of the 1973 oil crisis.
Back in the 1970s, it was common practice to seed clouds as a way of manipulating local climate. Scientists discussed methods that could be used to stop the cooling. But scientists warned of unintended consequences and complex feedback systems. US climatologists William W. Kellogg and Stephan H. Schneider described a climate model back then. Der Spiegel:
Such a climate model, so explain the two US climatologists William W. Kellogg and Stephan H. Schneider, must contain all ‘climatic feedback mechanisms’ of the global weather system — a completely unmanageable chaos of feedback loops and interactions.”
Amazing at how an unmanageable and complex system like climate in 1974 became and elegant and simple system that could be easily regulated today simply by varying the concentrations of a single trace gas. Later Schneider just could not be bothered by complexities.
Kellogg and Schneider also warned of interfering with the climate system.
Both scientists request that an international organisation for climate monitoring be set up as quickly as possible. In the view of the 2 experts, these weather monitors would have the job of maintaining the earth’s climate status quo.
It took a few years, but today we have the IPCC as a result.

"The Trump administration plans to weaken protections for a beetle threatened by extinction from climate change, lifting restrictions on oil and gas drilling in Oklahoma and surrounding states. The American burying beetle, a shiny black bug covered with orange splotches, feeds it young from carcasses it buries, making it vulnerable to disruptions in soil. The species was listed as endangered in 1989.  The beetle has been reduced to about 10% of its historic range, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service. It was native to 35 US states and has been eradicated from all but nine. Biodiversity advocates said the proposal is yet another move to benefit industry at the expense of at-risk species. The interior department secretary, David Bernhardt, is a former oil and gas lobbyist. The Fish and Wildlife Service is proposing to “downlist” the species, labeling it as threatened rather than endangered. The decision would allow drilling and other industry activity in Oklahoma and parts of Kansas, Arkansas and Texas, with some exceptions in conservation areas. Currently, drillers must obtain permits for any activity that would lead to an “incidental taking”, or killing of beetles. Noah Greenwald, endangered species director for the Center for Biological Diversity, said: “The science shows the American burying beetle is even more endangered now, yet the Trump administration is severely reducing its habitat protections. “David Bernhardt and his crew are only downlisting these unique beetles to please their oil and gas industry benefactors.”  Kevin Stubbs, a biologist for a Fish and Wildlife Services field office in Oklahoma, said the analysis “shows that climate change is the overwhelming risk for most of the populations”. “The southern portions of the range would have temperatures that we think would exceed their tolerances within about a 10- to 30-year window of time,” he said. Beetles living farther north could find their habitats too hot to survive within 50 years, he added. Stubbs said the Endangered Species Act (ESA) has no clear mechanism for the government to protect species based on the longer-term threats expected from climate change. Those threats include heat, as well as sea-level rise. “There really isn’t anything we can do ESA protection-wise to address the climate risk,” Stubbs said. The beetle will only be able to survive farther north after a few more decades of rising temperatures, the science shows. The service plans to leave some protections in place where the beetle lives in Nebraska and South Dakota and on two islands off the coast of New England. Industries there would need permits to disturb the soil of suitable habitats for the beetle. There would be an exception for ranching and grazing activities. The Fish and Wildlife Service defended the proposal, noting conservation efforts in the northern habitats and a potential discovery of a burying beetle population in Michigan. A final decision is expected within a year."
"Nicola Sturgeon has said she believes the world is facing a climate emergency and pledged to speed up efforts to achieve zero carbon emissions. Following similar moves by the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, this weekend, the Scottish first minister said she was declaring the emergency because the science showed global warming was worsening.  She told the Scottish National party’s spring conference in Edinburgh that if the UK’s expert advisory committee on climate recommended more urgent action to cut CO2 emissions in a report later this week, her government would act. In Holyrood last month, SNP MSPs voted with other parties against a Scottish Green party motion calling a climate emergency, while the Scottish parliament has been targeted three times this year by Extinction Rebellion protesters. “I am making this public promise to the young people I met, and to their entire generation,” Sturgeon said. “If that advice says we can go further or go faster, we will do so. Scotland will lead by example.” In a speech focusing heavily on the SNP’s bid to become Scotland’s main anti-Brexit party in the European elections next month, Sturgeon offered few new details about the timescale for a second independence referendum, focusing instead on measures to build the popular case for independence. She made several domestic policy announcements including a £150m scheme to co-fund mortgage deposits for first time buyers with new loans, and a promise to provide £250 grants for poor children going to nursery, with a second grant once they start at primary school. The Guardian revealed last week the island of Arran was suffering a housing crisis, due to a boom in holiday lets, and Sturgeon said new proposals to control short terms lets in places such as Arran and Edinburgh would be unveiled soon. Sturgeon cited opinion polls this weekend that give the SNP a substantial lead over the other parties in Scotland, of between 23 and 26 points in all three legislatures: Holyrood, Westminster and the European parliament. Today’s @YouGov poll in @thetimes is amazing. 23 point lead for @theSNP in Westminster election, 24 point lead for @ScotParl and 25 point lead for Euro elections. And #Indy at 49%. Happy #SNP19 Two polls by YouGov and Panelbase this weekend suggest the SNP will win three or four or Scotland’s six seats in the European elections next month, reducing Labour and the Tories to one each. YouGov showed the SNP has 40% of the vote for a European election. “As voters go to the polls for the European elections on May 23 our message will be clear and direct. And unlike Labour’s, it will be unambiguous,” Sturgeon said. “Scotland’s not for Brexit, Scotland’s for Europe.” To applause and cheers from delegates, she confirmed the Scottish government would publish legislation next month setting out the rules for a new referendum. Sturgeon said last week she wanted it to be held before May 2021. She acknowledged that the UK government had confirmed last week it would refuse to authorise a fresh referendum, but offered delegates no solution to that problem. In a significant political challenge to pro-UK parties, she announced the SNP would launch its biggest campaign on the economics of independence this summer, including a guide on the subject for all 2.4 million Scottish households, which would need to be delivered by hand. The SNP also plans to set up a social justice and fairness commission to investigate policies designed to make sure the proceeds from future economic growth are shared out more equally. Many critics of independence warn it would result in billions of pounds in spending cuts, but Sturgeon insisted the new project would “demonstrate how we can use the powers of independence to end poverty, achieve full employment, and drive equality for all”. She told delegates: “As an independent nation we will face challenges, as all independent countries do. And we must be responsible with our finances. “But few countries on earth can match our resources and our potential. So never let anyone tell you that Scotland doesn’t have what it takes to be a prosperous, independent nation.” Two weekend polls also showed a slight lift in support for independence up to 49% and 47%, excluding don’t knows, taking the SNP much closer to achieving majority support a yes vote. Support for independence jumps to 52% if the UK were to leave the EU with no deal, again excluding “don’t knows”. She cautioned that the party’s activists still needed to build popular support for independency and demonstrate a tolerant and openhanded way of campaigning that respected the fact many voters were still not persuaded. “We must always make our case with the decency, respect and dignity that we want to be the hallmark of our independent country,” she said, urging delegates not to divide voters into yes or no voters, but as “fellow citizens who all want the best for ourselves, our families and for Scotland’s future”."
"The UK government must immediately set a legally binding target to cut greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050, its official advisers have said, signalling an end to the nation’s role in driving climate change. Doing so will be challenging, said the Committee on Climate Change, meaning the end of petrol and diesel cars and gas boilers, less meat on plates, quadrupling clean electricity generation and planting an estimated 1.5bn trees. It will require tens of billions of pounds of investment every year, the CCC said – about 1-2% of Britain’s GDP. But not acting would be far more costly and the changes would deliver a cleaner and healthier society, the advisers said, as well as potentially bolstering the UK economy and jobs. The CCC’s request for urgent action comes after Labour, Scottish National party and the Welsh assembly declared a climate emergency. It also follows a week of high-profile protests by the Extinction Rebellion group and Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teenager who inspired the global school strikes, telling the UK government that its support for fossil fuels and airport expansion is “beyond absurd”. The UK is forecast to miss existing carbon targets in 2025 and 2030. Hitting zero emissions in 2050 will require a leap in the ambition of government policy, particularly on heating and transport. The zero emissions goal would fulfil the pledge made by the UK when it signed the Paris agreement in 2015 to limit the rise in global temperature to as close to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels as possible. In October, the world’s scientists warned of severe global impacts above this rise. The CCC target includes flying and shipping and all greenhouse gases, and allows no offsetting of emissions abroad, making it the toughest of any major economy. The CCC said it could prove a vital catalyst in unlocking matching pledges from other countries. The current plans of the world’s nations would lead to 3C of warming and catastrophic damage. The CCC’s recommendation was welcomed by many politicians, business leaders, energy and water companies, doctors and farmers. Some green groups, including WWF, called for zero emissions by 2045, while Extinction Rebellion activists have said 2025. The CCC said the 2050 date could be brought forward if good progress was made. The former environment secretary John Gummer, now Lord Deben, the chair of the CCC, said the zero emissions target for 2050 must be passed into law immediately. “We [must] do it now. The urgency is not just a matter of a shortness of time, but the quicker you do it, the cheaper it is.” Referring to the climate protests, he added: “Recent events have shown how strongly people feel.” Chris Stark, the chief executive of the CCC, said planning to cut emissions rapidly could begin as soon as the zero emissions target was set. “I would like to see it happen as soon as possible, preferably before the big UN summit in September,” he added. António Guterres, the UN secretary general, is demanding nations bring ambitious pledges to that summit to deliver the action needed. The Committee on Climate Change says cutting greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 is necessary, affordable and desirable. Here are some of the actions needed to make that happen: • Petrol and diesel cars banned from sale ideally by 2030 and 2035 at the latest. • Quadrupling clean electricity production from wind, solar and perhaps nuclear, plus batteries to store it and connections to Europe to share the load. • Connection of new homes to the gas grid ending in 2025, with boilers using clean hydrogen or replaced by electric powered heat pumps. Plus, all homes and appliances being highly efficient.   • Beef, lamb and dairy consumption falling by 20%, though this is far lower than other studies recommend and a bigger shift to plant-based diets would make meeting the zero target easier. • A fifth of all farmland – 15% of the UK – being converted to tree planting and growing biofuel crops and restoration of peat bogs. This is vital to take CO2 out of the air to balance unavoidable emissions from cattle and planes. • 1.5bn new trees will be needed, meaning more than 150 football pitches a day of new forests from now to 2050. • Flying would not be banned, but the number of flights will depend on how much airlines can cut emissions with electric planes or biofuels.  Gummer said cutting emissions to zero would incur significant costs but would not lower living standards if the costs were shared in a fair way. “We are not asking people to lead a miserable life, we are looking to have as fulfilled a life as today, but to do it in a way that takes responsibility for the future by respecting the planet which gives us life,” he said. “We would have cleaner air and we would live in a better society.” As a wealthy nation, and one with a long history of carbon emissions, the UK had a responsibility to lead in the fight against global warming, Gummer said. “If we want the world to win then we have got to set that example.” The CCC target is for “net zero” because some activities, such as flying and farming, will unavoidably produce some emissions in 2050. But these will be balanced by taking carbon out of the air by growing trees or burying CO2 under the ground. The government did not immediately accept the recommendations but Greg Clark, the business secretary, whose department has responsibility for climate change, said: “This report sets us on a path to become the first major economy to legislate to end our contribution to global warming entirely.” Rain Newton-Smith, the chief economist of the business group the CBI, said: “The CCC recommendations mark a new dawn for climate change action in the UK. Recent protests have shown the strength of public passion and sense of urgency. What we need now is a supportive and timely response from the government.” Steve Waygood, the chief responsible investment officer of Aviva Investors, said: “The CCC’s report makes a significant contribution, showing that a net zero economy is necessary, feasible and desirable.” Businesses including Siemens, Legal & General, BT, Thames Water, Marks & Spencer, John Lewis and Coca-Cola all backed the target. There is wide political support for the 2050 net zero target, with almost 200 MPs already in favour. Michael Howard, a former Tory party leader and now a peer, said: “The science is clear – we must not shirk from this challenge, nor should we be afraid of it.” Laurence Tubiana, who was France’s climate change ambassador when the Paris deal was sealed, said the CCC report was hugely important, adding: “I look forward to seeing many other countries in Europe, and beyond, follow suit.” Many scientists backed the CCC report. Prof Paul Ekins of University College London said: “Hopefully it will lay to rest once and for all the misperception that deep decarbonisation is either impossibly difficult or impossibly expensive.” But Prof Mark Maslin, also at UCL, said: “The zero-carbon target is essential, but the date of 2050 is too far in the future. The UK must adopt a 2030 zero-carbon target.”"

But hey, it goes to show that the waxwings were right! Winter 2008-2009 turned out to be a harsh one.
My excuse: I wrote the post late last night after having a little fine whiskey with a mate of mine. Surely you can excuse that.
————————————————————-
The UK daily Telegraph has a piece on waxwing birds invading Britain, which means the winter may be a cold one. I wonder if Joe Bastardi takes such factors into account when formulating his seasonal forecasts.
H/T: NTZ reader: Edward.
In my last post I wrote about natural, “non-scientific” indicators for winter forecasting, which are often more accurate than models. The Telegraph piece is just another one to add to that list. So far I haven’t seen many signs that the coming winter will be warm, except that is for the worn out warnings propagated by the warmists and their goofy “models”.
The Telegraph writes:
The birds, from Scandinavia, have appeared all along the east coast of Scotland and England, and have been moving steadily south and west in search of food.

Gee, I thought global warming was supposed to force species further north, and not south. Actually, weren’t we told species were just too stupid to move, and would just die and become extinct. The Telegraph:
Although they are occasional visitors to the UK, the numbers this year are unusually high and have been classed as an “irruption”, to signify a large-scale arrival of a bird not normally found here.
It’s got to be climate change! Yeah, that’s it. Add waxwing birds to the list of things caused by global warming. I bet it aint on the list. Anyway:
Irruptions, or “invasions”, are prompted by failures of berry crops in Scandinavia.
Scandinavia did not have the warmest of summers this year, and light frosts have already hit the region. Good thing that birds are smart enough to adapt and move, and not stay stupid like warmists and just sit there, and rain-dance instead. And, says the Telegraph:
In the UK, large numbers have traditionally been linked to a cold, hard winter.
Another one! Man – I thought cold winters were suppose to be rare, and exciting.
All this of course is anecdotal, and it does not mean that the winter will be cold. It may be just another piece of evidence to support the claim the winter in Europe may be harsh.
And recently, another dodo-bird German scientist said that global warming will mean colder winters for Europe, and so maybe it will be a cold winter for sure. So if it’s cold out this winter – blame it on AGW.
Do read the Telegraph piece. It’s a good article for bird lovers (like my cat Hayli).

Share this...FacebookTwitterGreenie Walter Russell Mead has an interesting perspective on Cancun called Bureaucrats Swindle Greens In Cancun. Remember how Cancun was cheered as a success? In his view, Cancun was a complete disaster for the eco-zealots – “a rout”.
Maybe some hard truths are beginning to dawn on the author, like the greens have been led around by the nose for years, or that bureaucracies are lethally inefficient, and once created, are really hard to kill. Let’s not even talk about if they are capable of solving problems (They aren’t – they create disasters). People like Mead are naive if they believe otherwise.
Here are some of his more profound comments:
As green negotiators in Cancun ended their embarrassing two-week junket (videos of partying bureaucrats did not go down well with voters in a northern hemisphere freezing in an early winter), it’s clear that the bureaucrats did what bureaucrats do: they kept a ‘process’ (job-creating bureaucratic gravy train) alive while doing little or nothing about the problem they were supposed to solve.
I just love it when things dawn on people, that moment when they see the light. I thought this world government / bureaucracy and all that was just small-minded conspiracy theory stuff from feeble minded sceptics. It’s not a conspiracy, is it? No. It’s what governments do if there are no checks and balances – when democracy gets pushed to the sidelines. Stuff like Cancun just grow naturally.
Mead is disgusted by Cancun, and the way they pretend to be rescuing the world, when actually they are doing nothing but feasting and freeloading. Well Walter, worse is that they are doing all this to rescue us from a pretend-problem, and ignoring today’s not-pretend problems.
Look around you. Don’t you see the millions children that are dying of hunger today? They aren’t pretending! It’s not a computer model. It’s real.
But no matter: for the bureaucrats and NGO staff it’s a clear and resounding win.  The mice have unanimously voted to keep meeting at taxpayers’ expense until someone bells that pesky cat.  The UN process has kept just enough diplomatic credibility to make several new rounds of vast, unfocused global gabfests of bureaucrats and NGO administrators inevitable.  More pre-meeting meetings will be held; more secretariats will employ new staff; more non-papers will be circulated, marked up and revised.  Paychecks will be mailed; travel vouchers issued.  Life will be good.
And the children continue starving – by the millions, and today! Thanks to the invented distraction called anthropogenic global warming. We’ve forgotten about them.
Mead seems to have woken up to what the charade of the UN (and their mission to rescue the climate) is all about. They aren’t rescuing anything, are they?
How about waking up to the fact that AGW is a charade – the fictitious raison d’etre of a bloated UN bureaucracy.

Next to the bureaucrats and the White House, the real winners are the climate change skeptics.  If you think that climate change is a myth or a naturally occurring phenomenon, Cancun helped you out.
We’re hardly on the same side here. But if Cancun somehow serves to curb the bureaucracy and the kills the myth that bureaucracies can regulate the world’s temperature and weather, then we’ll take the win.
Bureaucrats will dance, journalists will spin and carbon will spew, and the greens will be unable to escape this dysfunctional UN process for years and maybe decades to come.
Mead, did you ever believe that a bureaucracy could regulate nature and climate?  Don’t worry, you’re far from being alone on that.
Mead is clearly frustrated and angry with the UN.
If you are a climate skeptic, a global warming hand-off to the UN is the best thing since the Hummer.
No sane green would want this result, but the greens have run up against a force stronger than climate change, more insidious than the desertification of the Sahel, more inexorable than the rising of the seas: the bureaucratic instinct for process.  Processes and institutions once initiated cannot be allowed to die.
All that is left is for Mead is to wake up and realise the fact that man made climate change is simply an invention of the bureacracy. If you want to kill the bureaucracy, then kill its raison d’etre – the junk science of AGW. Then we coul at least begin to focus on today’s problems.
Mead comments as follows concerning reporters and Cancun
…reporters know that at the level of substance this is a complete travesty and a rout”.
Enjoy reading the rest of Mead’s post on how all it was handled by the media. I can’t help but feel Schadenfreude.

Share this...FacebookTwitterCan animals and late summer events indicate what the winter will be like? Our cat Hayli claims she can!
Forget all the satellite photos, charts, meteorologists and their reams of data – and especially all the computer models forecasting barbecue winters – or  barbecue summers. (Right now it seems most computer models are projecting a freezer-winter for the northern hemisphere and Arctic regions).
When you talk to people who make their living working outdoors, like farmers, fishermen, etc., especially the old-timers, they sometimes have ways of making seasonal forecasts that seem just as accurate, if not more accurate, than all them super-computer-satellite generated forecasts. Just ask Hadley!
As a kid in Vermont in Northern New England, I recall hearing that heavy fogs in late summer were a sign of an upcoming snowy winter.
Well, this also appears to be a rule for North Carolina too, read August Fogs Could Mean Lots Of Snow. Here Jason Gilmer writes:

There’s an old wives’ tale that says the number of fogs on August mornings are the same as the number of snows in the winter. According to some reports, there were anywhere between 14 and 31 foggy mornings in August.

It looks like we are going to get the chance to test that theory, at least this winter anyway. Fill up the jar with beans.
And according to Gilmer, SkiSoutheast.com’s Mike Doplehas, who has been covering the ski slopes in the area for 15 years, says this was the first year that each morning has been foggy.
”That much snow would make for another great ski season, he said. ‘

The Farmer’s Almanac also forecasts a harsh winter, according to Jason Gilmer:
Farmers’ Almanac gives these other ways to determine the severity of the winter: the thickness of onion skins, lots of acorns, a small orange band on a wooly worm, pigs gathering sticks and trees laden with leaves late in the fall.
Bauernregeln
Germany is big on so-called Bauernregeln: farmer rules for the weather. Here’s a list Bauernregeln in German, and a few I’ve selected for the coming winter:
1. Jakobi ohne Regen, deutet auf strengen Winter – Jakobi klar und rein, wird’s Christfest frostig sein. In English: “A Jacobi (July 25) without rain means a hard winter.” A Jacobi that’s clear and clean, means Christmas will be frosty.
Here it was sunny and dry. So it looks like a cold winter.
2. Bringt der August viel Gewitter, wird der Winter kalt und bitter. In English: “If August brings a lot of thunder, then the winter will be cold and bitter.”
Last August was cool and wet, but not much thunder. I guess it could mean a cold winter.
3. Tragt der Has’ lang sein Sommerkleid, ist der Winter noch sehr weit. In English: “If the hare wears its summer fur for a long time, then the winter is still far off.”
4. Ist der November kalt und klar, wird trüb und mild der Januar. In English: “If November is cold and clear, then January will be mild and gray.”
And I’ve noticed our cat Hayli has had a voracious appetite lately, constantly hanging out near her food bowl and yowling for more food. It’s autumn and nature is telling her to fatten up for the winter. This time around nature is screaming at her to do so.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’m alerted by Tom Nelson’s blog of a ZDF German television clip featuring Hans von Storch and Ottmar Edenhofer.  Edenhofer is a researcher at the Potsdamer Institute for Climate Impact Research, which is headed by Prof Doom & Gloom Hans Joachim Schellnhuber and his underling Stefan Rahmstorf. Need I say more?
ZDF clip here (in German)
The ZDF starts out by introducing the 100+ page IAC report, which was critical of how the IPCC worked and how fundamental reforms are required, and also on how other scientific views have to be included. Hans von Storch’s first comment:
Time and again there have been cases where the complete range of scientific knowledge was not included. The task of the IPCC is not to declare the truth about climate change, but the truth about the knowledge on climate change.
Ottmar Edenhofer on the other hand, sees the situation as far less serious, and attempts to play down the IAC’s findings.

I simply do not agree with the claim that the IPCC knowingly kept out knowledge that it found inconvenient, that didn’t fit the overall narrative. For that, also the team of authors was simply too heterogeneous in the past.

Already the first comment out of Edenhofer’s mouth provoked a harsh reaction from Richard Tol here:
The first remark by Edenhofer is a lie. Edenhofer was a lead author in AR4 WG3. That chapter does not reflect the literature. Papers that were at odds with the IPCC authors’ viewpoints were omitted or cited incorrectly.
Here’s the background on why Tol accused Edenhofer of lying. Edenhofer selected gray literature over peer-reviewed literature.Edenhofer does admit that the Himalayan glaciers blunder was embarrassing and regrettable,  and that the use of gray literature has to be restricted to a minimum. Hans von Storch adds (paraphrasing):
I would ban all literature that comes from interest groups like environmental organisations, re-insurers and energy companies.
On The IPCC getting involved with political advocacy, Edenhofer agreed that it has happened in the past, and that it should not occur. He recommends that a code of conduct ought to be followed.
That’s an understatement. How about just bringing in new personnel?
The IPCC has at least taken the first step in an attempt to reform, says the ZDF clip. It has invited von Storch to be a lead author for the next IPCC report.
Hans von Storch is a luke-warmer to warmist scientist, but we can expect him to be, as his website claims, an “honest broker”.

"Protests against climate change should be extended to the other greatest threat facing humanity, according to England’s chief medical officer, who says an Extinction Rebellion-style campaign is needed to save people from antibiotics becoming ineffective in the face of overuse and a lack of regulation. The threat of antibiotic resistance is as great as that from climate change, said Dame Sally Davies, and should be given as much attention from politicians and the public.  “It would be nice if activists recognised the importance of this,” she said. “This is happening slowly and people adjust to where we are, but this is the equivalent [danger] to extreme weather.” Davies said efforts to combat the problem of common illnesses becoming untreatable by antibiotic medicines should be coordinated at a worldwide level in a similar way as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the body of scientists set up in 1988 to tackle global warming. The IPCC warned last year that climate change would lead to disaster within 12 years if urgent action was not taken to reverse the growth in greenhouse gas emissions. Davies said the consequences of antibiotic resistance posed at least as great a threat to humanity’s future, and in the same timescale, but few efforts had been made to deal with the issue. “There is not the appetite [among pharmaceutical companies] to develop new medicines,” she said. “There is a systemic failure. We need something similar to the IPCC.” She listed a series of problems that the world has allowed to build up, from overuse of antibiotics and a lack of restraints on prescribing strong medications, to the rampant use of the drugs on animals, including by farmers for “growth promotion”, as the drugs can make animals put on weight faster. Such use has been banned in Europe and the US, but is common elsewhere, and even in the EU and US, the use of strong antibiotics critical to human health is still allowed on animals despite scientific advice to the contrary. Davies said she had to be persuaded to regard any use of antibiotics on animals as ethical, given the potential for overuse leading to increased bacterial resistance. “I do think now they can be used on sick animals, I have been convinced,” she said. But she is still concerned that antibiotics are vastly overused in farming, and that this is one of the biggest factors behind the growing problem of resistance. Globally, by far the majority of antibiotic use is for animals. Fish farming is also a major concern, said Davies, as the use of antibiotics has been largely overlooked in that industry. Few areas of farming are free from concern – she noted antibiotics are allowed to be used in spraying citrus fruit in the US, which she regards as a serious danger. Davies will leave her post later this year, so will no longer have a government role when post-Brexit trade deals with the US are likely to be signed. But she made it clear she would continue to speak out against deals that she viewed as weakening the UK’s protections on antibiotic use. The US has different rules to the EU on antibiotic use on animals and plants. A landmark report published on Monday by the the UN’s Interagency Coordination Group on Antimicrobial Resistance (IACG) recommended stronger rules should be brought in across the world to prevent the overuse of such medicines on farms, and on people. Haileyesus Getahun, the director of the IACG, said the threat of antimicrobial resistance was “a silent tsunami”. He said the public were still largely unaware of the problem, but that it could yet be solved if people were educated about the dangers. “We are calling for people to come together,” he said. “We don’t see the effects of it yet, but what is coming will be a catastrophe.” The report calls for the use of antibiotics as growth promoters in farm animals to be abolished globally, and for the strongest antibiotics to be reserved for human use. The authors also called for pharmaceutical companies to “prioritise public good over profit”, because of the market failure that means developing new drugs, while of enormous public benefit, does not result in companies making more money. Another critical issue is sanitation, because the lack of clean water and good sanitation that afflicts more than 2 billion of the world’s population is fuelling the rise of antibiotic resistance that quickly spreads around the globe, including to rich countries. The report found that failing to take urgent action would result in 24 million people being forced into extreme poverty by 2030, and lead to 10 million deaths a year by 2050."

Share this...FacebookTwitterMy local newspaper Osnabruecker Zeitung (OZ) has an online story here about the dramatic ARCTIC sea ice melting in June. This is typical of German media climate reporting. The introduction reads:
Arctic sea ice last month melted faster than in any June since measurements have been taken, since 1979. 88,000 square kilometers of white area disappeared daily, reports the American NSIDC in Boulder.
The OZ peppers the story with dramatic details like:
Also the extent of northern ice this June reached a record low average of 10.87 million sq km. According to the NSIDC, this ice area is 190,000 sq km below the previous June record set in 2006.
The air temperature is very high, and the ice continues to melt very rapidly.
The OZ then brings in the WWF as experts and polar bears for emotion to round out the propoganda effect.
So let’s stop right here. This is why it’s so important to keep an eye on the 11 Climatic Indicators which I have provided on the right side of my homepage. They allow a sure way to quickly debunk all media climate propaganda. The 11 Climatic Indicators are links to updated charts and graphs that treehuggers and alarmists don’t want you to see.

ARCTIC TEMPERATURES
Have Arctic temps really been very high lately? Judge for yourself, see below, or click here:
Arctic temps
Clearly the chart shows that since the start of June temperatures in the Arctic over 80°N latitude have not been “very high”. Most of the melting ice was ice that had formed in the cold late spring at lower latitudes.
CURRENT MELTING RATE
What about the claim that Arctic ice is melting rapidly now. Again, look at the chart under my 11 Climatic Indicators as follows or, click here (Sea Ice Arctic IJIS).
Arctic Sea Ice
If you look closely you’ll observe a few things: 1) There was a record high ice extent in April, 2) the ice indeed melted rapidly in May and June, but 3) the melting rate has slowed down considerably over the last 10 days, averaging only 59,000 sq km – something the media forgets to mention.
TOTAL GLOBAL SEA ICE
The media also forgot to mention that total global sea ice is dead-on normal, see next chart. They completely ignore Antarctica at the South Pole. Here’s where total sea ice stands now. It’s actually been increasing over the last few years.
Total sea ice, north and south poles
Now let’s take a look at what the sea ice in Antarctica alone is doing, see below or click here. Indeed Antarctic sea ice is near a record high!
Antarctic sea ice anomaly. Sea ice extent is far above average and trending upwards. 
Moreover, look at the trend (blue line which I eyeballed in) over the last 25 years or so. Have we heard any reports about that? Perhaps the journalists at the OZ ought to take a closer look.

"Climate policy has never been easy in Australia. But despite the debates of the past, Australians are pretty used to many of the policies that seek to regulate carbon emissions in our everyday lives. We know how to purchase green power for our homes; that our buildings are regulated for the energy they use; and that our household appliances come plastered with energy-efficiency star ratings. But what about our bank accounts, our super, our insurance policies and investment funds? How does our money contribute to causing – or preventing – dangerous climate change? How much financial risk are we exposed to from the effects of climate change, or from a delayed, bumpy transition to a low-carbon future? What are policymakers and regulators doing about those risks? Climate Risk and the Financial System, a new report from the Monash Sustainable Development Institute, addresses these fundamental questions.  This second type of climate risk and opportunity – the massive implications of climate change for the financial system – is a fairly new frontier in climate policy. It has developed rapidly over the last three to four years internationally, and is now reaching Australia, where both the potential risks and opportunities raised by finance sector and regulatory reforms to address climate change are immense. These reforms have their roots in the last financial crisis and a growing determination by international policymakers to avoid climate change being the cause of any future crisis. Two events pushed them to the top of the agenda: the landmark speech of highly respected Bank of England governor Mark Carney in September 2015 on the potentially grave risks to financial markets from climate change; and the Paris agreement in December of the same year, which firmly and for the first time placed a key responsibility upon the finance sector to shape the transition to a low-carbon economy. Both raised the clear risk of trillions of dollars of high-emitting assets – including coalmines, power stations, oil rigs and gas plants – becoming “stranded” (ie devalued or worthless) assets in a world shifting rapidly out of high-carbon activities. Australia is disproportionately exposed to such risks due to its highly carbon-intensive economy and its rebounding levels of emissions since 2013. Yet Australia also stands disproportionately to benefit from a successful low-carbon transition, with a world-class solar and wind energy resource base, mineral resources critical to battery production and a large and sophisticated funds management industry on hand to provide financial services to realise these opportunities. This makes it all the more important for Australia to study the rapid progress made on the international sustainable finance policy agenda in recent years, and to draw on this experience for its own reform process. For example, central bankers and financial supervisors have started to tackle the risks of climate change, establishing the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) in 2017. From an initial founding coalition of eight members, the network has grown within 18 months to number 35, including the Reserve Bank of Australia. Each has committed itself to “contribute to the development of environment and climate risk management in the financial sector, and to mobilise mainstream finance to support the transition toward a sustainable economy”. This is new terrain for traditionally conservative institutions, speaking to a growing urgency behind this agenda. Further, Europe has embarked on a comprehensive sustainable finance policy reform agenda. Initiated in late 2016, and moving to policy design and implementation from early 2018, it includes important down payments in reforming sustainability benchmarks, disclosure regulations, investor duties and in defining a “taxonomy” of sustainable activities. These will have a large impact also beyond Europe’s shores, both since they apply to businesses operating in the vast European Union capital market, but also because of the best practice example they offer for others to copy. The United Kingdom ran its own related policy reform process, reporting in March 2018. Government has yet to respond, but the process signals an interesting pro-green finance direction at odds with fears that the UK would turn in a deregulatory direction once freed from European frameworks. Both Canada and New Zealand have convened similar expert panels to push sustainable finance reform. Intriguingly for Australia, our largest trading partner China has moved with speed on the same agenda, mandating liability insurance for environmental pollution and disclosures of environmental information. The potential size of China’s green finance sector gives these reforms an international resonance beyond their domestic impacts. In conclusion, Australia has numerous positive reform examples to draw on. The recently announced Australian Sustainable Finance Initiative brings together finance sector leaders to develop a roadmap for the sector to address climate risk. Key industry players are aligned, domestic regulators have done solid groundwork, and there is a well-defined set of international best practices and international fora within which best practice can rapidly be transmitted. All the ingredients are there for Australia to catch up with the rest of the world, and quickly. • Chris Barrett is executive director, finance strategy, at the European Climate Foundation and former Australian Ambassador to the OECD.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDer Spiegel here gives us a good idea of the scale and magnitude of Japan’s massive Sendai earthquake, which weighed in at 9.0 on the Richter scale. It ought to remind some of us of nature’s fury and that we are powerless to steer it.
The earthquake occurred in the western Pacific Ocean, 130 km (81 mi) east of Sendai, Honshu, Japan. Its epicenter was 373 km (232 mi) from Tokyo, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS).
Massive energy
The earthquake opened up a 400 km long gash in the ocean floor, releasing a surface energy of 1.9×1017  joules (according to the USGS). The total energy released underground was about 205,000 times that on the surface.
This energy is equivalent to about 9.32 teratons of TNT, or approximately 600 million Hiroshima bombs, or about 80 years of global energy usage, estimated to be 4.74×1020 joules for the year of 2008 [Wikipedia]. That’s arguably more energy than what all of mankind has ever used so far.
Earth gets a facelift
All that energy gave the surface of the globe a facelift, literally. Wikipedia writes:

According to Italy’s National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology, the earthquake’s enormous strength shifted the Earth’s axis by 25 centimeters (9.8 in). This deviation led a number of small changes, including those to the length of a day and the tilt of the Earth. The speed of the Earth’s rotation increased, shortening the day by 1.6 microseconds due to the redistribution of Earth’s mass.
A report by the U.S. Geological Survey said that Honshu, the main island of Japan, was shifted 2.4 m (7.9 ft) toward the east. Researcher Lucy Jones said of the precise data, “The Japanese have the best seismic information in the world… This is overwhelmingly the best-recorded great earthquake ever.”
Der Spiegel lists the top 11 earthquakes measured since 1900; location, year and strength:
1. Valdivia, Chile – 1960 – 9.5
2. Prince William Sound, Alaska – 1964 – 9.2
3. West Sumatra – 2004 – 9.1
4. Japan -2011 – 9.0
5. Kamtschatka – 1952 – 9.0
6. Chile – 2010 – 8.8
7. Ecuador – 1906 – 8.8
8. Rat Islands, Alaska – 1965 – 8.7
9. North Sumatra – 2005 – 8.6
10. Assam – 1950 – 8.6
11. South Sumatra – 1957 – 8.6
Strangely these events are bunched in the 1950s – 60s and the 2000s.
The Sendai earthquake has also unleashed of tsunami of hysteria here in Germany, where many media outlets are busy quoting organizations like Greenpeace on the risks of atomic power. The earthquake obviously has driven another nail into nuclear energy’s coffin in Germany, having galvanised opposition even more. So forget nuclear energy in Germany in the future. The results of the upcoming state elections will show this.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Sendai mega-earthquake not only sent a tsunami of water over parts of coastal Japan, but also one of hysteria over the German media and green establishment. As Japan struggles to get a grip on its damaged reactors, German environmentalists are seizing the opportunity in a bid to fan panic across the country, and are now demanding that the country’s older reactors be shut down immediately. The voices of calm reason have been swept away.
Source: http://electricalandelectronics.org/2008/10/02/schematic-arrangement-of-nuclear-power-station/
The blog Denken für die Freiheit (Thinking for Freedom) of the Liberal Institute think tank of the Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom has posted a let’s-get-back-to-reason essay – Japan is not the Soviet Union – written by Dr. Klaus-Dieter Humpich. Here’s a summary:
Dr. Humpich first reminds us that Japan is subject to international regulations and so are reporting minute by minute on what is happening at the reactor sites. All planned and executed measures are reported to the public. Indeed the confusion is often media-related.
Reserve generators for cooling failed
When the earthquake struck, 3 of the 6 Fukushima Daiichi reactors were in operation, and stopped automatically – as they were designed to in the vent of an earthquake. Then diesel-powered back-up generators kicked in to supply power to the cooling water pumps. But within one hour, the diesel-powered generators failed due to yet to be determined reasons. Workers then brought in reserve generators, and it appears there were then problems in getting them in operation. During this time the cooling of the rods was not taking place and this led to overheating. This will certainly be examined later when a comprehensive investigation of the disaster begins.
Pressure cooker
In the reactor, heat and pressure build up if cooling doesn’t occur – like a pressure cooker on a hot stove. If pressure is too high, then steam has to be released into the atmosphere to keep the reactor from exploding. But then an equal amount of water has to be fed in in order to keep the balance. If the level of the water sinks too low, then things inside get hot. Once a critical value is reached, a chemical reaction between the steam and hydrogen can occur. At the Fukushima reactor on Saturday, hydrogen built up and an explosion ensued. Yet, the containement systems were left intact.
Japan’s containment systems not breached
But the situation in Japan developed completely differently from what happened in Chernobyl in 1986. In Japan, the reactors were shut down immediately as planned, thus stopping the nuclear reaction. At Chernobyl, the reactor was operating a full capacity and spiralled quickly out of control.

//-->




With the shutdown of the Fukushima reactors in response to the quake, only about 10% of the capacity still remained in the reactor.  The cooling system powered by the diesel pumps then functioned for an hour, and so the heat generating capacity of the core was brought down to about 1% of total capacity – much less than Chernobyl. Although 1% still means one megawatt, it is not enough to blow the entire reactor and containment. In Chernobyl the chain reaction ran away and the entire reactor vessel and containment building exploded violently, releasing everything into the air. That’s not the case in Japan.
At Fukushima, the reactor vessel, the containment and external concrete housing are still in intact. This means there are still three barriers that would have to be breached before dangerous levels of radiation can escape.
Category 4 accident (TMI 5, Chernobyl 7)
As the reactors are still heating, there’s naturally the risk of high pressure build-ups, which could lead to a Chernobyl type of explosion if not relieved. To prevent a failure of the containment building in an emergency, radioactive steam would have to be released though a filter system into the atmosphere in a controlled manner. .This rersults in a radioactive cloud. A controlled release is relatively not very dangerous as it dissipates quite rapidly. That’s why the accident at Fukushima is at Category 4 (TMI 5, Chernobyl 7). Category means that the reactor is totally damaged, but there is little impact on the surrounding environment. So we are still a ways away from Chernobyl.
Risk not completely eliminated
Although the containment systems are intact, the heat problem is still not eliminated. Sea water still has to be pumped to the damaged reactors to prevent heating and overpressurization. If the reactor has no water to keep cool, the temperatures can rise and lead to a meltdown. The latest news is that three reactors are threatened with a meltdown. The cooling water around the fuel rods in Reactor 2 have dropped dramatically.
The next hours and days ahead will show if the plant will withstand the 9.0 quake.
In the meantime, a panicked Chancellor Angela Merkel, spooked by the media hysteria, has announced that the planned extension of the operating lifetime of some of Germany’s older nuclear plants has been stopped. I wonder if India, China, Brazil and Iran will follow her example and abandon their ambitious plans to build a number nuclear power plants in the future.

"Two-thirds of people in the UK recognise there is a climate emergency and 76% say that they would cast their vote differently to protect the planet. The findings, in a poll commissioned by Greenpeace, come as the group unveiled a detailed “climate manifesto”, listing 134 key actions they say the government should take immediately to ensure the UK hits zero carbon emissions as soon as possible.  The manifesto – which will be sent to MPs, policymakers, thinktanks and other experts for feedback – was released on Tuesday, a day before a parliamentary vote on whether to declare a national climate emergency. This month, the UK experienced the biggest civil disobedience protests for generations as Extinction Rebellion activists blocked roads, bridges and transport systems in London to highlight the escalating climate crisis. Millions of schoolchildren around the world have also taken to the streets to voice their growing alarm. John Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace UK, said the debate around environmentalism had been fundamentally altered by the protests. “Climate activists, young and old, have put the UK government under enormous pressure to officially recognise the climate emergency we are facing,” he said. “There is a real feeling of hope in the air that after several decades of climate campaigning the message is beginning to sink in. What we need now is to translate that feeling into action.” Greenpeace’s manifesto lists 134 “practical actions” the government can take covering power, heat, transport, buildings, industry, shipping and aviation, agriculture and nature. It says these actions, if taken together, would put the UK on course for achieving net zero emissions “well before 2045”. The plan is also available on the Greenpeace website for public comment and critique. Sauven said: “The government clearly needs help as they are not sure how to respond. So we have produced an action plan to show how, with a little bit of courage, the UK can help avert the climate crisis, and take responsibility for our historic emissions. The plan ensures the green transition is fair and democratic for all, with new jobs and economic benefits spread across the country.” He added that it was vital that politicians devised a plan that worked for everyone, not just “climate activists”. “We want this action plan to feed into the many discussions springing up around the country on what is to be done. If you’ve got an idea that could help speed up the transition or expert knowledge on how your industry’s carbon emissions can be cut faster, we want to hear from you. Then the government will have even less of an excuse not to act.” The measures outlined in the manifesto include: A tripling of wind and solar power from current levels to ensure 80% of electricity comes from renewables by 2030. Ambitious targets to phase out the internal combustion engine in cars and vans with all new vehicles to be electric by 2030. Huge insulation drive on all existing and new buildings, and the installation of renewable generation on site as far as possible. A commitment to protect all high-carbon natural habitats and bold targets for habitat restoration/rewilding on land and at sea – including planting at least 700m trees over the next decade. The manifesto was released alongside polling carried out by Opinium in the midst of the Extinction Rebellion protests. It found: 63% of British public think they are in a climate emergency. 76% say they would vote differently to protect the planet and climate. 64% say government is responsible for taking action on climate change. The growing pressure on political leaders to act on the ecological crisis was underlined on Monday when Extinction Rebellion representatives met London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, to urge him to take more radical action. On Tuesday, the group is due to meet the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, and later the environment secretary, Michael Gove. Sam Knights, 22, a member of the Extinction Rebellion team meeting the politicians, said: “The legacy of our political leaders will stand or fall by what they do now. Either they take steps to give our children the future they deserve or they do nothing. “They must respond to the climate and ecological emergency with the clarity and urgency our children demand.” Following this month’s mass civil disobedience protests both the Scottish and Welsh governments have declared climate emergencies. The Labour party, which is committed to overseeing a “green industrial revolution”, declared a climate emergency in March."

Share this...FacebookTwitterFace it – the globe is trending cooler. One El Nino year does not make a trend. All the talk about global warming and snow becoming rare in the wintertime is turning out to be utter nonsense.The AMO, PDO and solar cycles bode cold for the globe. Check very carefully before believing anything else – especially if you’re in the winter sports business.
The Met Office in England even said there’s been no significant warming in the last 15 years. The cold winters are back, and many find themselves caught unprepared.
Too many expected warming
Last winter municipalities were caught without roadsalt because they had gambled on warm winters, and skipped replenishing their winter stockpiles. But then the snow and ice came, and what little roadsalt they had ran out by midwinter. Drivers were left to fend for themselves.
Municipalities will also have to deal with the much higher than expected costs arising from streets being far more damaged by heavy frosts. The deep freezes of last winter wreaked havoc on asphalt surfaces, and many were not properly repaired. This year winter is back with a vengeance, and so the already poorly repaired streets will certainly suffer even more damage. Repair costs will skyrocket, and strain budgets.
Sled manufacturers are caught off guard
They cannot keep up with demand. Everything is sold out, reports Die Welt today here. The traditional manufacturers of sleds are working round the clock at full capacity. And many that had gone out of business over the years, have reappeared. Says Michael Ress, manager of the traditional sled maker Ress-Kuschen in the Lower Franken village of Schwebheim in Bavaria:
Last winter we produced 16,000 sleds from New Year’s to March. The year before it was 3800 for the entire season.

And now the 6-man company is producing 200 sleds a day:
We’ve tripled our production and are practically working round the clock.  We’ve got to make do with 4 hours of sleep.”
Die Welt writes that 30 years ago there were some 20 sled manufacturers in Germany, but as the winters became milder, and the snows rarer, most of the sled makers disappeared.
But now the AMO and PDO have switched to their negative phases, solar activity has petered out, the winters are returning and the sled makers are coming back as a result. KHW Geschwenda in the Thüringer Forest has hired dozens of workers.
Also Company Gloco, which had closed its doors in 2009, has re-emerged and is back in business. Die Welt writes:
Gloco wants to put 30,000 pieces on the slopes this year. He no longer picks up the phone. He just doesn’t have the time for additional orders.
Retailers are screaming for sleds, but only a few are being delivered. Until production catches up, kids will have to make do with plastic bags and the hard shells of old suitcases.
Personally I think the North American toboggan is hard to beat.

"America elected Donald Trump at the end of the hottest year ever recorded, without debate moderators asking him a single question about global warming.But after three years of record temperatures, devastating wildfires and some of the most destructive hurricanes in US history, the media is facing new pressure – often from the candidates themselves – to give the subject more prominence during the 2020 election. Yesterday, MSNBC devoted more than five minutes to Beto O’Rourke’s rollout of a $5tn climate plan, calling climate a “kitchen table issue” for 2020. Jay Inslee, the Washington governor who is seeking to make climate change the central thrust of his campaign, is calling on the Democratic National Committee to host a debate solely focused on climate. Bernie Sanders raised the issue during his town hall on Fox News earlier this month – and even drew cheers from the audience when he talked about new jobs in the renewable energy sector. Rising temperatures and the crisis they pose for humans were part of every Democratic candidate’s pitch during CNN’s marathon of hour-long town halls last week.  In the run-up to 2020, as newsroom leaders grapple with their mistakes in the 2016 election – from reliance on inaccurate polls to underestimating the impact of fake news – the failure to press candidates on climate change is emerging as an area of self-examination.  “In 2016 there were almost no questions asked , which is insane,” says Tony Bartelme, a senior reporter who covers climate change for the Post and Courier in Charleston, South Carolina. “It’s a good start that we’re starting to hear questions for 2020.” The Guardian is joining forces with Columbia Journalism Review and the Nation to launch Covering Climate Change: A New Playbook for a 1.5-Degree World, a project aimed at dramatically improving US media coverage of the climate crisis. The project kicks off today with an event at Columbia Journalism School featuring CJR’s editor-in-chief, Kyle Pope, the Nation’s environment correspondent, Mark Hertsgaard, and the Guardian climate columnist Bill McKibben. The Green New Deal – progressives’ vision for slowing climate change without further burdening the poor – has also helped catapult the subject into the 2020 conversation. In March, MSNBC’s Chris Hayes took the highly unusual step of devoting an hour to the idea, in a show featuring the New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. But even as there are signs that airtime for climate is beginning to increase, questions remain about the depth and quality of the coverage. “I don’t see the media paying much attention to differentiating how serious each candidate is on the climate question,” said David Gelber, the creator and executive producer for the Showtime series on climate change, Years Of Living Dangerously. More Americans than ever are worried about climate change. A poll of likely Democratic caucus-goers in Iowa ranked climate change about on par with healthcare as the top issues they want candidates to talk about. Research indicates that major national newspapers are beginning to pay more attention to climate – but local publications and TV news haven’t kept up. The major broadcast networks – ABC, CBS, NBC and FOX – spent just 142 minutes on climate change last year, according to one calculation from the progressive group Media Matters. And about half of Americans hear about global warming in the media once a month or less, according to surveys by climate communications programs at Yale and George Mason universities. Meanwhile, five major national US newspapers – the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, USA Today and the Los Angeles Times – have, in aggregate, roughly tripled their coverage of climate change since four years ago, according to the Media and Climate Change Observatory at the University of Colorado in Boulder. The New York Times now has a desk of about a dozen covering climate. Climate editor Hannah Fairfield said the team is collaborating with the politics desk to report on the 2020 candidates’ climate positions. But climate coverage is not just a question of volume– it’s also a question of approach. We spoke to experts in the field for their advice on how news outlets should cover climate in ways that make voters listen during the 2020 race. Adam Berinsky, who studies why some people believe political rumors – such as that climate change is a hoax – said people who buy into political rumors are driven by a “combination of conspiratorial dispositions and political motivations”. They are more likely to change their minds if they hear from sources they identify with, often fellow conservatives.  Aaron McCright, a sociology professor who studies public opinion at Michigan State University, said journalists should give the small but growing numbers of conservatives who care about climate change “more of a mouthpiece so that their message could start competing” with science denialism. Republicans who want to limit climate pollution for the sake of national security or as part of a plan for energy independence need to compete better with climate deniers, said McCright. “Those could be effective messages if they’re promoted hour by hour, day by day, week by week, by dozens or hundreds of conservatives in everyday life, TV, papers, Congress.” Gelber says reporters should bring the campaign story back to climate change, even if the candidates aren’t discussing their proposed solutions. He said they should help audiences differentiate between the candidates, explaining to viewers and readers how specific they have gotten in their plans. Edward Maibach, a George Mason climate communications scientist, said “most people are saying they rarely hear climate change news because most people pay attention to local news. Most climate news in America is not local news”. Maibach’s program, Climate Matters, trains weathercasters and local reporters to explain the local consequences of a warming world. Bartelme suggests trying to connect local catastrophes to the climate story and explain why the extreme weather is happening. “What we can do is make those connections for people,” Fairfield said. Reporters can seek out “local stories that have climate fingerprints on them”. Elizabeth Arnold, a longtime reporter and professor at the University of Alaska, argues that “doom and gloom” coverage alone may force the public to disengage. “Repetition of a narrow narrative that focuses exclusively on the impacts of climate change leaves the public with an overall sense of powerlessness,” she said in an introduction to one paper. Susan Hassol, director of the organization Climate Communication, said the phrase “heat-trapping pollution” is easier to understand than “greenhouse gas”, and “global warming” conveys more meaning than “climate change”. The Guardian is partnering with Columbia Journalism Review and the Nation today on “Covering Climate Change,” a town hall event with media leaders about how to change the media narrative on climate change. Watch the event live here between 9am and 2pm."
"Planting more trees, restoring peatlands to health and using new technology to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere should all be pursued as a matter of urgency, the environment secretary, Michael Gove, has told climate change campaigners. His meeting with Extinction Rebellion on Tuesday produced pledges from the government to reduce carbon emissions to “net zero” but without a timeline, though Gove said he was “open” to a more ambitious target.  It was an unusual step for an environment secretary to agree to meet such forthright activists who in recent weeks blocked motor traffic across London and disrupted the Houses of Parliament and the stock exchange. Clare Farrell, one of the Extinction Rebellion activists who met Gove, said: “It was less shit than I thought it would be, but only mildly.  “I was surprised to hear a radical reflection on our economic paradigm from Michael Gove when he talked about how our model is extractive and destructive, and that we need to move to a circular model [of economic production].  “And [he agreed that] a debt-based economy doesn’t do right by young people, that it is creating a huge debt for them and it has to change.” The success of the current generation of activists in forcing political attention on climate change is unprecedented and appears to have taken politicians by surprise.  Previous climate change protests over the last two decades, which have included attempts to shut down a power station, Big Ben and fracking sites, among other actions, have been dismissed as stunts. Never before have such actions of civil disobedience resulted in politicians from all parties agreeing to meet the activists and set out new plans in response. On Wednesday, the government’s statutory advisers on climate change are expected to set out ways in which the UK can reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, including reductions from transport, heating and energy production. But the Extinction Rebellion activists, who also met the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, on Tuesday and the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, on Monday, were unsatisfied with the response from politicians so far.  “I’m pleased with discussions that took place today and that we were met at the appropriate level,” said Savannah Lovelock, a coordinator of the youth wing of the movement, after meeting Gove and McDonnell. But she added: “I am still yet to see politicians listen to young people and do everything within their power to protect our future.” Further plans to tackle climate change are expected to be set out by the Labour party overnight, before a debate in the House of Commons on Wednesday. Extinction Rebellion, whose colourful protests in recent weeks have included activists gluing themselves to the glass of the public gallery in the Commons, and to the London Stock Exchange, as well as disrupting roads in London and other cities, called for ministers to “tell the truth” on climate change and for emissions to be net zero by 2025, instead of mid-century as ministers are suggesting. They also urged the government to “create and be led by” the decisions of a citizens’ assembly on climate change and ecological justice. Extinction Rebellion is a protest group that uses non-violent civil disobedience to campaign on environmental issues. Launched in October 2018, with an assembly at Parliament Square to announce a 'declaration of rebellion' against the UK Government, the group has staged regular demonstrations against current environmental policies. More than 1,000 activists were arrested in April 2019 after protesters occupied four sites across London, as well as blocking roads, disrupting a railway line and conducting a protest at Heathrow. Other demonstrations have included a semi-naked protest inside the House of Commons and blockading streets in London, Cardiff, Leeds, Bristol and Glasgow. The group says climate breakdown threatens all life on Earth, and so it is rebelling against politicians who “have failed us”, to provoke radical change that will stave off a climate emergency. The movement has become global with groups set up in countries include the US, Spain, Australia, South Africa and India. Martin Belam Politicians appear to have been taken by surprise by the upsurge in climate activism from Extinction Rebellion, but polls, including one by Greenpeace published on Monday, show there is widespread support among the public for actions that would reduce the impacts of climate change, even if some come at a cost. John Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace UK, said: “Climate activists, young and old, have put the UK government under enormous pressure to officially recognise the climate emergency we are facing. “There is a real feeling of hope in the air that after several decades of climate campaigning, the message is beginning to sink in. The government clearly needs help as they are not sure how to respond.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterUPDATE 19 July: Steve Goddard has followed this post with a supplement, and provides more detailed information. http://wattsupwiththat.com/2010/07/18/sea-ice-news-14/
WUWT following up on my posts a day or two later seems to be becoming a trend over there.
The NOAA is taking the liberty of declaring 2010 the hottest ever, even though it’s only July! So what’s all the hurry? Well, you have to get them scary global-hotting headlines out while you can, and any way you can. When you’re desperate – you’re desperate.
They’ve seen their own forecasts for the rest of the year, and so they know it’s their last chance. Just check the leading climatic indicators on my homepage and you’ll see why.
Now on Arctic sea ice, allow me to use the same NOAA “scientific” method and declare that the Arctic has experienced the slowest July ice melt ever! (Well, at least  so far).
Look at the ice melts from June 30 – July 15 for the following years, taken from AMSR-E.
                 Sea ice melt                
Year      6/30 to 7/15                Daily rate
2002     1.126 million sq km     75,000 sq km / day
2003     1.014                                  67,000
2004     1.019                                  68,000
2005     1.152                                  77,000
2006     1.210                                  80,000
2007     1.742                               116,000
2008     1.216                                   81,000
2009     1.413                                   94,000
2010    0.807                                54,000
Never has ice melted so slowly in mid summer as it has this year. Indeed sea ice melt in July 2010 is less than half the melt rate in 2007. It’s far below anything we’ve seen on record. Would the NOAA already call it a record low melt for the month?
And as Lubos Motl pointed out 3 days ago here, total global sea ice is above normal. Also see here. Indeed sea ice is rebounding, and surprisingly just at a time when  it’s supposively the “hottest ever”.  Someone is wrong, obviously.
Do you think anyone in the media is going to run this story?

"An increasing number of Americans live in places with unhealthy levels of smog or particulate air pollution – both of which are being made worse by climate change, according to a new report.  Air quality in the US has been improving since the 1970s, but that progress may be backsliding and 43% of Americans are now living in places where they are breathing unsafe air, according to the American Lung Association report.  As temperatures rise, wildfires are getting worse and spewing smoke across the west. And more smog, or ozone, is forming on warmer days.  For the three hottest years on record, 2015 through 2017, about 141 million people lived in US counties that saw unhealthy levels of particle pollution, either in a single 24-hour period or over a year, or unhealthy levels of smog. That is 7 million more people than in the group’s last report. “We’re seeing in this year’s report the impacts of climate change on air quality in really stunning terms,” said Paul Billings, a vice-president for the association. Top 10 U.S. Cities Most Polluted by Year-Round Particle Pollution (Annual PM2.5) Top 10 U.S. Cities Most Polluted by Short-Term Particle Pollution (24-hour PM2.5): Top 10 Most Smog-Polluted Cities: Source: American Lung Association's 2019 State of the Air Report  Eight communities set records for days with spikes in particle pollution, surpassing the group’s data back to 2001, Billings said. Western wildfires might be to blame for much of the uptick, and next year’s report counting 2018 is expected to be even worse, he said. In California, Bakersfield and the Fresno area had among the worst air quality in the country, according to all three measurements. Los Angeles continued to rank worst for smog. Fairbanks, Alaska, ranked third for particle pollution, probably because so many people burn wood to heat their homes. The report is the health advocacy group’s annual assessment of government data. Both smog and particle pollution are linked with breathing problems, lung and heart complications and early deaths. Smog occurs when sunlight reacts with gases from cars and power plants. Particle pollution also comes from burning fossil fuels, as well as from burning wood in fireplaces or stoves, and from wildfires. The federal government’s National Climate Assessment explains that smog levels can increase with warmer days and both smog and particle pollution can increase when weather is stagnant. Worse droughts could also lead to more wind-blown dust. Air pollution has fallen for decades in the US, due to pollution laws like the 1970 Clean Air Act and the use of less coal and more natural gas. One 2018 study found that deaths from air pollution in the US were cut in half between 1990 and 2010. But they still accounted for one out of every 35 deaths – more than from traffic accidents and shootings combined. In comparison, more than 5.5 billion people worldwide, 75% of the population, live in places that do not meet the World Health Organization standard for limiting particle pollution, according to the University of Chicago. The Trump administration has sought to roll back Obama-era environmental progress, including on air and climate pollution regulations, such as rules for power plants and cars. Miles Keogh, the executive director for the National Association of State Air Agencies, said weakening air standards would mean “walking away from a winning strategy”. “We’ve got the tools here,” Keogh said. “We’ve got to use them to shore it up, adapt them to a changing climate and not walk away from things that work.”"

"The outrage of the students striking from school over climate change inaction is “certainly justified”, according to Sir David Attenborough, who said older generations had done terrible damage to the planet. In an interview with the former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres, the broadcaster and naturalist dismissed critics of the widely praised global movement of school strikes as cynics. “[Young people] understand the simple discoveries of science about our dependence upon the natural world,” he said. “My generation is no great example for understanding – we have done terrible things.” The protests by young people were enormously encouraging, Attenborough said. “That is the one big reason I have for feeling we are making progress. If we were not making progress with young people, we are done.” However, asked about the world his great-grandchildren will live in, he said: “I don’t spend time thinking about that because I can’t bear it. I’m just coming up to 93, and so I don’t have many more years around here. I find it difficult to think beyond that because the signs aren’t good.” On Friday, the youth strikes will continue with protests expected in 485 towns and cities in 72 countries, according to the Fridays for Future website. Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teenager whose solo strike sparked the worldwide action, told politicians this week: “You lied to us. You gave us false hope.” “Their outrage is certainly justified, there is no doubt about that,” Attenborough told Figueres, who delivered the landmark Paris climate change agreement in 2015. “There will be cynics who try to dismiss [the school strikers] and say they don’t understand the world and how it works,” Attenborough said in the interview, released in a podcast on Friday by Figueres’s Global Optimism group. “Young people may lack experience but they also have clear sight.” “They can see perhaps more clearly than the rest of us who have been around for some time,’” he said. “We older ones should take notice of what they say.” Global warming is already increasing the frequency of damaging extreme weather. The world’s scientists say sharp falls in carbon emissions are urgently needed to deliver a 50% cut by 2030 and avoid worse droughts, floods, extreme heatwaves and poverty for hundreds of millions of people. However, emissions are still rising. Wildlife is also being annihilated by human actions, with animal populations having fallen by an average of 60% since 1970. Attenborough recently presented a primetime BBC documentary, Climate Change - The Facts, which was watched live by almost 3 million people in the UK. “The scientific evidence is that if we have not taken dramatic action within the next decade, we could face irreversible damage to the natural world and the collapse of our societies,” he said in the show. Attenborough told Figueres action to stop climate change and the destruction of the wildlife was essential: “We have no option, if we want to survive. We have a [moral] obligation on our shoulders and it would be to our deep eternal shame if we fail to acknowledge that.” Figueres, who works with Global Optimism to create social and environmental change, said: “Greta and the other young people are justifiably furious with us. They say we have been at this for 30 years and we still haven’t solved this. Young people are calling us adults to account.” “We now know we can do it: we know we have the technology, the finance [and] the policies,” she said. “The outrage is about how is it possible that, knowing that we can do it, we are not doing it fast enough?” Figueres said that sense of outrage needed to be harnessed to speed up the required transformation to a zero-emission world. She has also backed the Extinction Rebellion protests that ended on Thursday after a week of peaceful direct action in the UK. “Civil disobedience happens when the injustice gets too great,” she said. “That is where we are.” Thunberg resumed her strike outside the Swedish parliament on Friday for the 36th week. The youth strikes now span the globe, stretching from Australia, Japan and Pakistan to Germany, the UK and US. In Islamabad, protesters held homemade banners reading “Don’t burn our future” and “Raise your voice not sea level”. In Bilbao, Spain, another read: “The planet is screaming in pain and we are deaf.”"

"Ian Birrell seems content to mix Asperger’s with autism in considering the diagnostic ramifications of certain pervasive developmental disorders (Opinion, 23 April). He can perhaps be forgiven, on the basis that the terms are now mutually self-inclusive across clinical as well as common parlance scopes of reference. As he might well be aware, the term Asperger’s has been erased from the most recent edition of the diagnostic manual (DSM-5) – itself in continuous flux of conjecture and opprobrium. It’s a pity that either term still prevails, as both are misleading, confusing and carelessly non-specific, poorly serving any person thus labelled. Given that these terms collate and corral a wide spectrum of behaviours, abilities and challenges, why they persist is unfathomable.  Having worked for several years in this challenging area of personal need, I feel that the innate humanity and individuated personality of those foisted with such “diagnoses” is smothered and camouflaged by the imposition of meaningless terminology. Such classifications merely spawn a retrograde claustrophobia, ensuring a blinkered appraisal of need and misguided cultivation of inappropriate nurture. Rightly approving of Greta Thunberg’s rise to global influence, Mr Birrell might want to seek out some further relevant and authentic commentary on the matter from the writings of child and adolescent psychiatrist Sami Timimi. His book The Myth of Autism offers a vital ray of illumination, highlighting the nuanced realities pertaining, promoting a creatively open dispensation beyond useless diagnostic labels. Let children live and adults thrive within a shared communalism of easy tolerance and respectful generosity of spirit. After all, every one of us hovers somewhere along the autistic spectrum, if one insists on allowing that term at all. Thus it is rendered obsolete.Jim CosgroveSenior music therapist, Lismore, County Waterford • Responses to the above letter: How a diagnosis of autism can be your moment of liberation"

Share this...FacebookTwitterDer Spiegel reports here on Russia’s extreme heat that’s has contributed to higher death rates and wildfires, plunging Moscow into a thick, choking smog. Hat-tip to reader DirkH.
The following NASA photo shows where it’s hot, and where it’s cool.
So far 7600 km² have burned. NASA’s Terra satellite shows that the fires began in later July, when temperatures in the areas were 12°C and more above normal. One sees how the heat is concentrated in one spot, while the remainder of the continental area is near normal or even cool. Russian meteorologists say they are unable to find anything in the archives that compares to this, not in the last 1000 years.
While warmists are quick to pin the blame on climate change,  others point out that the fires have other primary causes. Der Spiegel writes that much of the blame for the catastrophe goes to the authorities and mismanagement of forests:

Forest fire experts say the authorities also get most of the blame for the catastrophe. Large fires like this one in Russia are caused primarily by man.

According to Johann Goldammer of the Max-Planck Institute for Chemistry at the University of Freiburg:



<!--
google_ad_client = ""ca-pub-3545577860068042"";

google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




 There is no evidence that the fires ignited by themselves because of the drought.

Goldammer says that excessive deforestation of the landscape may be a factor in the fires because they leave barren steppe-like landscapes that tend to dry out quickly and become a tinderbox.
But then Goldammer’s makes the dubious claim that this was caused by the fact that the forests had been put into private hands, and then recommends Soviet-style land use!

It has something to do with sustainable land use, like land-use in the old Soviet Union, where it was much more efficient than today.

Now that’s the way to solve problems. I suggest Goldammer read up on how the Soviets managed to run the entire country into the ground.

"When Beto O’Rourke launched his presidential campaign, I was impressed. On multiple occasions, including as recently as April, O’Rourke backed calls to effectively zero out all domestic emissions of the greenhouse gases that cause climate change by 2030, and said we’re screwed if we aim for anything less. On Monday, he shifted the goalposts back. He released a detailed climate plan, his first policy proposal of his campaign. There’s a lot to like. He pledged to make climate action a day one priority and included an expansion of resources for climate resiliency and adaptation. But he also pushed back the timeline to achieve net-zero emissions to 2050. Our movement was sad to see him let up on his ambition as he rolled out the specifics, before we even give it a try.  Just in the last year and a half, floods in the midwest, Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico and fires in California have devastated American communities. Waiting 20 more years is not an option for people like Mikala Butson, a 22-year-old Californian who I met recently while on the Road to the Green New Deal tour, whose mother and brother fled from flames in the Camp fire last November. Her hometown, Magalia, was nearly erased from the map alongside Paradise. Ninety-three people died. Tens of thousands lost their homes. Some took issue with my criticism of the timeline of O’Rourke’s plan for being too sharp or unforgiving. They pointed out that this is the most ambitious climate platform yet proposed by a presidential candidate. They are right. But this is the terrible paradox of climate policy in 2019 – even a historically ambitious plan can fall far short of what’s needed. Our measuring stick is not politics; it is physics, and the urgent demands of justice for all on the frontlines of climate disaster. Last year, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said that we have just 12 years to radically transform our economy to avoid catastrophic climate change of more than 1.5C (2.7F). Globally, they said, we need to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. In order to reach that goal globally, the US must do much more, much faster. The US can’t aim to get to net-zero emissions by 2050, as O’Rourke’s new plan proposes. It is absurd to suggest that developing nations such as India, South Africa, Indonesia and Brazil, which are growing rapidly and improving the quality of life for their people, should reach net-zero emissions at the same time as the US. Rich, advanced economic powerhouses like the US have the responsibility to move much more quickly in order to help move the rest of the world toward net-zero emissions by 2050 – otherwise millions of lives will be lost. The Green New Deal calls for a 10-year mobilization to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. This week, many pundits and wonks have criticized us, saying that goal is not possible. They have told us we’re young and naive, that we should keep our goals tied to what’s possible right now. We don’t know if this goal of achieving net-zero emissions in a decade is possible, and many experts tell us it’s not. Maybe O’Rourke talked to those same experts who told him to push back his ambition over these past few weeks. But it is by putting out an ambitious goal and doing everything in our power to achieve it that we will push what’s possible. If you want to argue it’s not worth setting an ambitious goal and fighting like hell to get there, you need to be prepared to explain that decision to the people already suffering from the current levels of warming. To the 800,000 people in India where my family is from who were displaced by record floods last year. To the children whose parents burned alive in their cars trying to escape flames last year in California. To the kids in sub-Saharan Africa who are growing up malnourished because there hasn’t been enough rain to grow food. I believe it is our duty as a generation to push against the limits of the possible and protect as many lives as we can from disasters that can be prevented. Young people are looking for a president who will fight hard for what our generation and our world deserves – and have the courage to rally our nation to put everything we’ve got behind doing it. Even if we fail trying, we will get much further much faster, and prevent much more damage, in the process. After all, mitigating the climate crisis is not an all-or-nothing endeavor. If setting goals that push the boundaries avoid even a tenth of a degree of warming, that additional effort will be the difference between life and death for millions. When Franklin D Roosevelt said we would build a historic air force of 185,000 planes to defeat the Nazis, we barely had an airlines industry. We were producing only about 3,000 planes a year. We didn’t know if we could do it, but we knew we had to try. By the end of the second world war, we had produced more than 324,000 military aircraft (in less than five years). It was the same situation when John F Kennedy said we would send a man to the moon in 10 years; we didn’t know if it was possible, but we knew it was worth trying. When America believes it can do the impossible, we make the impossible inevitable. That’s what the Green New Deal is all about – daring America to dream again, and calling on every sector of society to come together to do what needs to be done.

"Momentum, the youth climate strikers and Extinction Rebellion are to unite in protest outside parliament on Wednesday as Labour calls on the Conservatives to declare an environmental emergency in a parliamentary vote. A coalition of activists and campaigners will rally in Parliament Square to demand the government backs the plan, first put forward by Extinction Rebellion as the primary demand of the protests that engulfed London over the past fortnight.  Last month Labour declared an environment and climate emergency and the shadow environment secretary, Sue Hayman, challenged her government counterpart, Michael Gove, to follow suit. The party has now forced a Commons vote on the issue as concerns over pollution and climate change dominate the political agenda. Momentum said climate change was caused not by ordinary people but by elites, and Labour was right to push the government to recognise the urgency and scale of the impending environmental crisis. “It’s disgraceful that Theresa May has sat on her hands, refused to meet the climate strikers and ignored the huge public outcry about the climate crisis,” said Laura Parker, a Momentum spokesperson. “Climate change isn’t caused by ordinary people. It’s caused by elite politicians, oil executives and bankers who all profit from causing climate breakdown.” She added: “Only Labour can challenge this climate-wrecking elite and deliver a green industrial revolution, which will mitigate climate breakdown whilst transforming our economy and society in the interests of the many, not the few.” The protests follows school strikes in dozens of countries, mass demonstrations in London organised by Extinction Rebellion and the targeting by Momentum of banks that fund fossil fuel companies. The leftwing grassroots movement has previously organised demonstrations outside parliament, such as in 2015 to put pressure on MPs to vote against the bombing of Syria in 2015, and to display support for the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, after a number of shadow cabinet resignations in 2016. Extinction Rebellion representatives are to meet the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, on Tuesday and Gove on Wednesday. The group is also calling for the government to act immediately to halve biodiversity loss and reduce net greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2025, and to create a citizens’ assembly to spearhead reforms."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German online news magazine FOCUS reports here today that a new record low temperature has been set at a station in Antarctica.
The Neumayer III station, operated by Germany’s Alfred Wegener Institute, has recorded the lowest temperature at their Antarctic location since the start of operations there 29 years ago. The mercury dropped to -50.2°C.
According to polar meteorologist Gert König-Langlo of the Neumayer III, such similarly low temperatures have been recorded only 10 times since Neumayer operations began at this location. Says König-Langlo:
This is the first time we’ve gone under the minus 50 degree mark.
The Neumayer III is located on the approximately 200-meter thick Ekstrom Ice Shelf. The station is moving with the shelf ice at about 200 meters per year in the direction of the open sea.FOCUS online is quick to point out that this record cold is not a sign of climate change, but rather it is a local regional weather phenomenon (only warm events are signs of climate change).
According to König-Langlo:
The cause was the ongoing cloudless and very low wind weather conditions, which is rare in the region. A light breeze is enough to put an end to the phenomenon.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGreenpeace activists, in yet another reckless stunt to get on TV and in newspapers, stormed an oil drilling platform off the coast of Greenland, reports Der Spiegel here.  According to Der Spiegel, the intrusion forced an unplanned stop in drilling operation.
Whenever a drilling rig is forced to stop operation, it’s expensive. I can’t imagine what these crazed idiots say when storming a platform. “Stop! We’re here to save the planet! Stop drilling in the name of the planet!”
Anyway, Der Spiegel writes:
Four activists of the environmental organisation climbed onto the oil platform in order to protest the test drilling. Scottish company Cairn Energy stopped their work in response, reported the environmental activists.
“Sure lads, whatever you say”.
The Danish police were not amused. They now threaten the planet-rescuers with consequences. Morten Nielsen, Vice Chief of the Greenland Police:
Laws were broken; those responsible will be punished.

Let’s hope. In the meantime, the activists have chained themselves to the platform, and have enough provisions with them to last four days. They say:
 We have to stop our dependency on oil!
I wonder if they themselves paddle their Esperanza ship as they joyride around Greenland. And I’m sure there are hundreds of activists on-board on exercise bikes all pedalling away to produce the electricity the boat needs. Surely Greenpeace broke its dependency on oil a long time ago. Maybe it’s time to do research on the journeys and footprint of the Greenpeace fleet.
Also Greenland Prime Minister Kuupik Kleist had little sympathy for the publicity-seeking activists, reports Der Spiegel, calling their actions an “openly illegal act” and a “gross violation of safety laws”. It is, he says:
really worrying that Greenpeace, with the sole intention of getting publicity in the media, would employ such efforts to break every safety rule in order to protect people and the environment.
Greenpeace intends to exploit the BP Deep Horizon accident to the max, and take advantage of the sour public mood with oil companies. They want to show how dangerous oil drilling is for the environment. Says Tzeporah Berman at Greenpeace headquarters:
The confrontation in the Arctic is only the start.

Start thinking cold, cold, cold and colder.
Joe Bastardi, AccuWeather meteorologist, meaning he’s an expert in making forecasts, and not producing goofy climate model scenarios for the next 100 years, has been looking at the oceanic and solar cycles for quite some time.
Those cycles mentioned above, combined with volcanoes, are what he calls the “triple whammy”. He again reiterates his forecast for the decades ahead at his European website.
I surmise, though, given what should be becoming obvious to watchers of these things, that the days of thinking warm, warm, warm are over, and quite the opposite will occur in the coming years and decades, and the populace should understand the honeymoon is over, the marriage of low solar and reversing oceanic cycles along with a third-party (let’s not go any further with non-weather implications… ha, ha), the volcanic activity, should raise eyebrows among the rational. Among others, short of being frozen out of ones abode, there is no getting attention.
Here’s what he’s pretty much talking about
1. Pacific Decadal Oscillation. The cycles of warm and cold in the Pacific move in 30-year phases. In the warm phase, we see more El Ninos, which boost the earth’s temperature, see Figure 1. Recently we have flipped back to the cold phase, which means more La Ninas ahead, which means a cooler planet.
PDO

2. Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation has major impacts globally. Right now we are in the middle of the warm phase, but are now on the way down for the next 10 to 20 years, see Figure 2. Strangely the phases are interrupted at about their midpoints. Perhaps we’ve hit one of these midpoint interruptions.

Figure 2: AMO will be likely in decline from its current warm phase over the next 10 to 20 years.
Both the PDO and AMO show why the globe most likely has warmed about 0.5°C over the last 40 years. Now they give us strong indications of what lies ahead for the next 2 or 3 decades.
Another tiny factor that plays a role in our climate is the sun, believe it or not. Low solar activity has shown to be strongly correlated with cold periods on this planet. Currently, contrary to what was earlier expected by NASA, cycle 24 is turning out to be one of surprisingly low activity. That bodes ill for more cooling.
Figure 3: Solar Cycle 24 is a tame one. The question is: how tame can it get?
Throw in one or two significant volcanic eruptions, and the planet is in cooling trouble. Maybe even major trouble. Clearly, many governments are preparing for the wrong scenarios, as this report here so clearly illustrates.
In fact there is a risk that the whole world could be as unprepared as the UK was for this winter, and that for decades. And they won’t be able to say they weren’t warned!

I recently read a news clipping from the Canadian Press headlined: Never mind that cold snap-fed stats suggest Canadian winters are getting warmer. According to the article, the figures were compiled by Environment Canada and released to the Canadian Press on January 25, 2011.
I checked the Environment Canada data and have come to a different conclusion from their climate data record. I have produced two graphs of past winters from 1998-2010 showing the annual winter temperature departure for 11 of the Canadian regions and Canada as a whole. All temperature data comes from Environment Canada.
Here are the 11 climate zones in Canada:

This is what the graph shows.
Canadian temperatures 1998 - 2011
Here is what the graph tells me in my opinion:
* For Canada as a whole, the average linear winter trend is negative (cooling), see graph above.
* The linear winter trend of 8 of the 11 regional areas was also cooling, see graph below.
* The linear trend of the Atlantic coast is flat.
* Only the linear trend for the Arctic tundra and fiords (far Arctic North) shows warming.
Next is a chart showing the plots for all 11 regions of Canada and their winter temperature departures from 1998 -2010. The Canadian average is also included together with the linear trend for all of Canada.
 
Discussion
What my objection to the Canadian Press article and its headline was that it implies to the Canadian public that Canadian winters are getting milder when they have not for the last 13 years. That is significant.You can’t ignore that if you are going to write an article about changes in Canadian winters. The article compared winter data sets between 1970’s and today. I however compared 1998 and 2010/2011 which is much more current and up to date.  
The 1970s were at the bottom of the climate cycle when both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans as measured by AMO and PDO were in the cool mode. Now we are near the top of the current warm cycle and starting to come down fast. So naturally any comparison will show a warming. But it does not mean that the warming will continue. It is like comparing winter datasets to summer datasets and saying we are warming – forgetting that after the summer comes another fall and winter. The PDO and AMO are again heading for the cool phase like the 1970’s.
When costal waters around North America cool, the inland areas will cool first and to a greater degree. This is exactly what is happening in North America and Europe and Asia.
The SST anomalies for US coastal waters [20N-50N] dropped more than 0.65 deg C by January 2011. The January 2011 reading for the U.S. Coast Waters is the lowest on record for the satellite-based Reynolds Oi.v2 SST dataset [as to Bob Tisdale’s recent post on WUWT].
So I think what was missing in the article was the fact that, yes, it is interesting that our Canadian winters have warmed between 1970’s and today but what it did not say is that we should not to expect this to continue, since the climate factors that caused the cooler climate back in the 1970′ are back again and have already caused the cooling to return during the last decade. More cooling can be expected during the next 20-30 years. Even the AGW climate scientists have admitted to the media that there has been no statistical global warming since 1995.
The winter of 2009 perhaps is indicative of what might be ahead for some of the future Canadian winters. It already had winter temperatures close to those of the 1970’s for many regions . Most regions (7 in total) had below normal winter temperature departures except (4) Atlantic coast, Mackenzie District and Arctic Tundra, Mountains and Fjords. The 2009 winter had both the AMO and PDO negative or cool, like what we may get again in the decades ahead.  The 2011 winter also mimiced similar conditions as the coastal waters around North America had cooled to record low levels [similar to a negative AMO and already a negative PDO]

The second wrong message in the article was that the warming between 1970 and 2010 was due to global warming when it has clearly been shown by climate scientists, including the Met Office, that natural planetary cycles ENSO (stronger El Nino’s) were behind the recent warm phase.
Not just Canada is cooling – but the United States too 
http://climvis.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/cag3/hr-display3.pl
– Winter temperatures have been dropping for 10 years since 2000.
– Annual temperatures have been dropping for 4 years.
– US winter temperatures have dropped 6°F between 2000 and 2010.
 Global snow extent
– 2011 winter had the 3rd highest snow extent in the Northern Hemisphere and North America since 1967.
– 2010 winter had the 2nd most snow extent for Northern Hemisphere since the1978/1979 winter [2008 had the 3rd highest since 1967].
– 2010 winter had the highest winter snow extent since 1967 and the extent has been climbing since 2006.
– 5 of the11 highest snow extents for Eurasia have happened since 2003[2003 was the2nd highest since 1967]. 
Let’s do some fact checking about our current GLOBAL MEAN TEMPERATURE ANOMALY
http://climate.rutgers.edu/snowcover/table_area.php?ui_set=1
Other regions of the globe
– The cold weather in US has reached the Mexican/US border with significant lost crops this year.
– Record snow or new cold temperatures set in December 2010 across various parts of the Northern Hemisphere.
– Sweden had coldest December in 110 years and 2010 was the coldest in two decades. Norway had its coldest year since 1941 and 10th coldest since 1941.
– UK had its coldest December since in 120 years. Germany had its coldest December in 41 years, Ireland had its coldest December since 1881 or in129 years
– Similar cold records were set in the Middle East, the Korean peninsula, Mexico, China, and India.
– Following another extended stretch of sub-zero temperatures, ice coverage on the Baltic Sea is greater than it’s been in nearly a quarter century, Sweden’s meteorological agency reports.
– The Russian are having one of hardest winter in the last 100 years during the 2011 winter. The average temperature for February in Moscow was 11°C below normal!
Conclusion
So how can we say that Canadian winter temperatures are getting milder when the data shows that Canadian winter temperatures as a whole are getting cooler for 8 of the 11 regions since 1998? Only the high Arctic shows warming.  The more logical conclusion would be the winter temperatures were fluctuating but the trend is cooling. For some regions like the Prairies and Northwestern forest areas, there was 6.6 to 7.1 C  of cooling between 2006 and 2009. Once the 2011 winter gets added to the data, the cooling aspect will be even more evident.
Here are the winter temperature departures for all 11 regions of Canada. As you will note, the linear trend line for all are negative or cooling with the exception of the Atlantic coast which is flat or no real change and Arctic Mountains , Fiords  and Tundra  which show warming or rising trend line.

"By the end of this year we should expect UK law to mandate net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Thursday’s report by the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), which advises the government, sets out not only why this new target is needed, but how it can be achieved. Last year the UN warned of greatly increased dangers if countries do not stick to the lower end of the 1.5-2C of global warming mandated by the Paris agreement. Experts highlighted sea level rises and risks to insect and coral species among problems likely to be seriously exacerbated by an additional 0.5C rise. This is the reason for governments to set new, tougher targets in advance of upcoming UN climate talks, at which they will be held to account and forced to decide what happens next. At the same time, dramatic falls in the cost of renewable energy and battery storage mean that cutting emissions has become cheaper. The CCC believes it is possible to eliminate the UK’s carbon footprint altogether without investing more than already planned: that is, between 1% and 2% of GDP. So there is some good news, along with the bad.  Costs are concentrated in the power and construction sectors. New energy sources such as hydrogen need infrastructure, while wind and solar must be scaled up. New technologies such as carbon capture and storage require trials. Buildings must become energy-efficient as gas boilers, 1m of which are installed each year, are phased out. Huge numbers of trees need planting, with one-fifth of all agricultural land turned over to forests, peatland or energy crops. People should be encouraged to make different choices, eating less beef, lamb and dairy. The report suggests a target of 2030 for ending the sale of petrol and diesel cars, but then wrongly settles for 2035. Currently, transport emissions are still going up. As well as a practical and moral case for action, the report makes a strategic one. The UK was a pioneer in climate legislation. Where one country leads, others will follow and such leadership brings power as well as prestige. Without a new target the UK will soon be overtaken (France has a 2050 target for net-zero, although not yet a law; Sweden and Norway have earlier deadlines but less strict rules). Since climate chaos will bring political chaos, limiting it is in the national interest. A “green new deal” has become popular currency on the progressive side of politics in the UK, US and Spain. This idea usefully links technological and environmental change with the prospect of a renewed social contract and the questions of justice often emphasised by environmentalists. The CCC’s report must have been all but complete before most people had heard of Extinction Rebellion, or seen pictures of the Swedish activist Greta Thunberg with environment secretary Michael Gove. But the extraordinary success of protesters over recent weeks, both in raising awareness and materially altering the climate debate, makes it more likely that targets will be further strengthened, as they have been before and should be again. The 2050 target is not ambitious enough. A government that purports to accept climate science but promotes aviation, road-building and fracking, while making onshore wind all but impossible and cutting back on subsidies for green energy, deserves to be exposed. To this end, as well as that of helping to shift public opinion, it is crucial that activists, including those opposing airport expansion, as well as politicians, continue their work. About one thing Extinction Rebellion was absolutely right: people must be told the truth. The brave new world of 2050 need not be a dystopia, even if some damaging effects of warming are now inevitable and the prospect of a second Trump term gives cause for alarm. But if we are to avoid the most dangerous consequences of a warmer world, we must find ways not only to limit and mitigate the risks of physical changes; but also to make political ones. The kind of long-termism that climate change requires is not a good fit with modern electoral cycles – or 24-hour news. Finding ways to counter this, and build the future into our politics, is a challenge not just for politicians, environmentalists and civil society groups, but for human civilisation as a whole."
"Greta Thunberg took her climate message to the heart of power in Westminster on Tuesday, with a quiet but powerful message to MPs that prompted politicians to declare contrition for their failure to act. After the noise of Brexit in parliament and the disruption of Extinction Rebellion outside, the 16-year-old Swedish activist cut an extraordinarily composed figure as she arrived with her trademark braids, hand-painted placard and a speech that forced politicians to reflect on a crisis that is growing steadily worse despite three decades of political promises. “This ongoing irresponsible behaviour will no doubt be remembered in history as one of the greatest failures of humankind,” she told the packed audience of MPs, officials and fellow school strikers. “You lied to us. You gave us false hope. You told us that the future was something to look forward to.” There was no let-up for the audience. The UK, she said, was very special due to its “mind-blowing historical carbon debt”, a reference to the country’s record as the birthplace of industrialisation. But this was also, she said, because its claims of world-leading progress on cutting emissions are partly the result of “creative accounting” and are belied by the government’s plans for more high-emissions projects. “The UK’s active current support of new exploitation of fossil fuels, like for example the UK shale gas fracking industry, the expansion of its North Sea oil and gas fields, the expansion of airports, as well as the planning permission for a brand new coalmine, is beyond absurd,” she said. She finished to a standing ovation and cheers, then sat quietly as the panel of senior politicians gave their responses. Several appeared chastened. “Your voice – still, calm and clear – is like the voice of our conscience,” said the environment secretary, Michael Gove. “When I listened to you, I felt great admiration, but also responsibility and guilt. I am of your parents’ generation, and I recognise that we haven’t done nearly enough to address climate change and the broader environmental crisis that we helped to create.” Ed Miliband, the Labour politician who led the UK’s delegation to the 2009 Copenhagen climate summit and oversaw the UK Climate Act, said he recognised that what was done in the past has been proven by science not to be enough. “You have woken us up. We thank you. All the young people who have gone on strike have held up a mirror to our society … you have taught us all a really important lesson. You have stood out from the crowd.” Thunberg listened attentively, applauding only when a member of audience criticised the government for pushing ahead with fracking. Her mantra when dealing with governments has been consistent: Never mind the words. Nothing matters apart from actions to halt emissions. The big test on this will come on 2 May, when the climate change committee announces the results of a review of the UK’s targets, including when the country should aim to reach net zero emissions. This was prompted by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report last year, which warned of the dangers of global warming exceeding 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The recent surge of demands for more ambition – on the streets, from the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, and from David Attenborough – have helped to amplify the message that Greta and others are stressing with their climate strikes. Tuesday saw other signs of progress that would have been hard to imagine a year ago. Caroline Lucas, the former leader of the Green party, announced that during Greta’s meeting with party leaders earlier in the day, participants – including Jeremy Corbyn and Ian Blackford – had agreed to start regular cross-party meetings on climate policy, to open consultations with youth climate activists and to have an independent body assess whether party manifestos were in line with the Paris agreement. Theresa May was the only party leader who did not attend but otherwise Greta’s visit proved an opportunity for a renewal of the cross-party consensus on climate. The mood was strikingly in contrast to the bitterly divisive debates of Brexit: Gove applauded Lucas’s moral leadership on environmental issues and said nobody had done more than Miliband to put the UK’s climate policy on a strong track. Gove was, however, criticised for being the person in the room with the most power to change policy, but the most evasive answers. “He’s environment secretary, so it’s not enough for him to feel guilty,” said Lucas. “I hope he takes home the message that he should not be satisfied with warm words.” The standing-room-only turnout was far better than the recent climate debate in parliament, which drew barely a dozen MPs even though it was the first on the crisis held in the main chamber in two years. Several dozen politicians attended on Tuesday, along with government officials and representatives of the UK student strikers movement. Attendees said it was the most crowded event they could remember in more than 10 years at the Attlee suite. The young Swede spoke so quietly at first that many in the audience struggled to catch her speech above the clicks of the cameras. The low volume was deliberate, forcing people to hush and listen intently. “Can you hear me?” she asked repeatedly. “Is my English OK? Is the microphone on? Because I’m beginning to wonder. During the last six months I have travelled around Europe for hundreds of hours in trains, electric cars and buses, repeating these life-changing words over and over again. But no one seems to be talking about it, and nothing has changed.” But now there is undoubtedly more focus on the subject. After Greta’s speech, she went to the main debating chamber of the House of Commons, where MPs greeted her with a roar of applause and Miliband asked the government whether it would declare a national climate emergency. MPs also held a debate about the recent Extinction Rebellion protests and student strikes. Unimpressed, Thunberg said afterwards that the politicians were missing the point. “They turn this into a question of what methods the protesters use – truancy and civil disobedience – but it’s not about that. It’s about the fact that we face an existential crisis.” After the event, she went to St Pancras station to catch the Eurostar, the first leg of a 36-hour journey back to Stockholm. Passers-by, who recognised her on the street with her climate-strike sign, gave her the thumbs up and words of support. During the Easter holidays, she has received rock star treatment, selling out venues, being followed by paparazzi, meeting the Pope and having politicians humble themselves in her presence. As long as the attention serves a purpose it is tolerable, Greta said. But she is now ready to return home. “I like to be left alone,” she said as she headed back to Sweden, back to school and back to her regular weekly strike."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThat’s what the reporter in the following clip seems to suggest. So it means the warmists will start claiming cold winters as proof of warming. A number of blogs are buzzing about the “coldest winter in a 1000 years” being reported here: RT Prime Time. Western Asia and Eastern Europe are expecting a cold winter, but let’s not go over the edge here. This is a nutty claim.
We are not even in a little ice age. Does anyone seriously believe the Baltic Sea, and possibly the River Thames will freeze over, for weeks this winter? Take this notion of a 1000-year winter, or even a 100-year winter, and stuff it. Aint gonna happen.
The TV reporter in the above clip quotes meteorologists: “It’s supposed to be a beast of a winter.” That’s a fair claim.
NOAA is projecting a cold winter for Russia, Siberia and possibly Europe too. The reporter talks about the cold hitting the western Russia-European region.
Joe Bastardi in his latest post, however, did not make any commitment, though he seems to be hinting that we ought to expect cold. I have to say I get the feeling he sees something unusual, and so he’s going to take his time to really make sure – maybe just my imagination is just running wild.
An unusually cold winter is not far-fetched. But a 1000-year winter? Get out of here! That’s TV bullcrap. Unless Joe Bastardi comes out later this fall and says so, I aint buying it.
What are the reasons for the projected vicious cold asks the  reporter in the studio? “Is it climate change?”

They don’t really know. They’re looking at global warming.

That along with other factors. Global warming – what nonsense. The following NOAA chart definitely supports Russian meteorologists’ claims that the winter will be harsh.

"I shot this in Norilsk last summer. This city, 1,500 miles from the North Pole, is one of the coldest and most polluted places on Earth. It is a place most photographers dream of going to. Getting there, though, is extremely difficult. The city was closed in Soviet times, then briefly opened, and is now closed again. To gain access you have to get permits from the owner, Norilsk Nickel (or Nornickel as it is now known), which is almost impossible. I travelled there as part of the Arctic project I did with Kadir van Lohuizen. We divvied up the continent: he covered the western regions, and I, the Russian side, the longest Arctic border. Kadir’s main interest was to show climate change: the evidence is everywhere, especially in the east. I wanted to document how Russia is taking advantage of this situation to explore for gas and oil. I travelled on an ice-breaker from the port of Dudinka to Murmansk, and there was no ice at all. Kadir battled the elements – there is snow in his photographs. There is grass in mine.  I knew Norilsk would feature heavily in the story, because it is a place where you can understand the tragic history of Russia. As the ice melts, signs for gulag barracks keep appearing. It explains why development of the Arctic on the Russian side is so much more advanced than in the west: they had a head start. They knew already where the oil and gas reserves were and how to operate in rough conditions. In winter the temperatures here plummet to -50C. The city was founded in the late 1930s to meet wartime demand for metal. It was built on the ice by prisoners who were shipped in. The nickel factory you see in the photograph was built first, in 1942, followed by a copper factory and the Nadejda metallurgical complex. The city grew, surrounded by chimneys. When I first travelled there in the 1990s, the pollution was overwhelming. You could not breathe, and barely see. At the time, though, no one cared: it was the last thing anybody thought about. In June 2018, I spent about two weeks there and a local historian showed me round. I commented on how odd it was that there were no trees, but that there was some green. He told me that the green was where the prisoners were buried. There are graveyards everywhere. Thousands and thousands of prisoners were shipped to Norilsk – there are no roads in and out of town – and it was a one-way ticket. Nobody knows exactly how many of them perished. In the 1990s, people in the town were allowed to put up a memorial sign for the prisoners – Ukrainians, Lithuanians, Jews, Russians – who had died there. In the port city of Magadan, I met some former prisoners who had managed to survive this hell, living in barracks without food or proper clothing, and managed to get out of Norilsk. Listening to their stories was fascinating; it is a miracle they did not die. The nickel plant was shut down in 2016, after President Putin threatened Norilsk Nickel with big fines if the environmental situation didn’t improve. While it was still in operation, it emitted 350,000 tonnes of sulphur dioxide each year. Business hasn’t suffered though. The company, which is one of the world’s largest producers of palladium, nickel, platinum and copper, has plants all over (in Russia, China, western Europe, South Africa, Australia and more) as well as its own Arctic fleet. The company’s other two plants in Norilsk are still in operation, and ore is now shipped from there to Murmansk; the journey takes four days. Partly because the factory is now abandoned, fewer people live now in Norilsk than in Soviet times. There is a programme for retired workers to move to the mainland – this city is not a place to retire – and others moved to the company’s other sites. What you see here isn’t a river, but an artificial lake, which was used in the metallurgical process. Guards live and work there: you can see one of them on the boat headed towards the structure in the middle of the water (coincidentally, he’s also headed in the direction of the North Pole). I never managed to speak to one of them, but I realised that they work in a 24-hour rotation. Quite what they do is unclear. The centre of Norilsk looks and feels like Saint Petersburg. This is not because Stalin fantasised about building the most beautiful town in the Arctic Circle. Rather, there were talented architects among the prisoners: they made it beautiful. The prisoners sent to gulag were often educated people. That’s how the city was built within four years and production in the plant started within two. In fact one of the founders of the city was a prisoner: Nikolay Urvantsev, a geologist and explorer with extensive knowledge of minerals in the region who was sent there from the Karaganda labour camp where he had been held on charges of wrecking and sabotage. Talking about this aspect of Russian history is important. I don’t think the story of what happened in Stalinist times has been properly told. It is all connected to Russian identity, that sense of pride that comes from knowing how to survive in the north. • Yuri Kozyrev and Kadir van Lohuizen were granted the Carmignac Photojournalism award to enable their work on the Arctic with support from the Fondation Carmignac. The exhibition of the project, Arctic: New Frontier, is at the Saatchi Gallery, London until 5 May. Born: Moscow, 1963. Trained: Mentored by Valery Arutyunov. High/low points: “It’s not about photography as a career. I’ve had some good and bad experiences but what is important is not who is taking a picture but the reasons why they are taking a picture and telling a visual story.” Top tip: “A nice picture is not enough. It’s about your responsibility, your patience, your commitment in these stories. Photography is an incredible language. It’s universal, you can express yourself, you can tell your story visually.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterWe know that more and more temperature stations have been sited in urban areas over the last few decades, and surely this has had an impact on the measurement of the globe’s temperature. But not to worry, say scientists, the raw data have been homogenized in order to compensate for this.
Elevated temperatures in urban environments. (Photo: NASA)
Have they compensated enough? Just how much uncertainty is in the land-based temperature record for the last 50 years? A new report from NASA shows some results that I think are surprising.
Summer land surface temperature of cities in the Northeast were an average of 7 °C to 9 °C (13°F to 16 °F) warmer than surrounding rural areas over a three year period, the new research shows. The complex phenomenon that drives up temperatures is called the urban heat island effect.
Dr Marc Imhoff, leader of the study, says that urban areas located in forested regions have a much more pronounced urban heating effect than in desert areas. Adjustment is neither an easy nor accurate task (emphasis added):
However, accurate comparisons have long eluded scientists because ground-based air temperature sensors tend to be unevenly distributed and prone to local bias. The lack of quantifiable definitions for urban versus non-urban areas has also hindered comparisons
But thanks to satellites, progress is being made in understanding the urban heat island effect. Satellite data have been used to compare various urban settings. Ping Zhang, a scientist at Goddard and a lead author of the research:
This, at least to our knowledge, is the first time that anybody has systematically compared the heat islands of a large number of cities at continental and global scales,”
Research by NASA scientists shows that compact urban areas have a higher urban heat  island effect that sprawling cities, and depend greatly on the surrounding environment, as mentioned above.
Taking the UHI effect has been the subject of much controversy over the years. This new study shows that it may have been significantly understated, at least in some areas.
Providence, R.I.; Washington, D.C.; Philadelphia, Pa.; Baltimore, Md.; Boston, Ma.; and Pittsburgh, Pa.; had some of the strongest heat islands of the 42 northeastern cities analyzed.

Let’s look at some temperature records:



These 3 examples have all trended upwards over the last 30 or 40 years. The actual siting and history of each station would have to be examined individually. So one can imagine what a mess this is and how arbitrary all this could be. Here we can be thankful for satellites.
The warming indeed is man-made, but in a different sense. The urban warming is what has impacted people in the summertime, especially at night.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that, between 1979 and 2003, heat exposure has caused more than the number of mortalities resulting from hurricanes, lightning, tornadoes, floods, and earthquakes combined.
It is the lack of cooling at nighttime, rather than high daytime temperatures, that poses a health risk,” said Benedicte Dousset, a scientist from the University of Hawaii who also presented data about heat islands at the AGU meeting.
Urban planners will have to take this into account when designing cities in the future. Trees, trees and more trees can help a lot. Meanwhile, all this leaves James Hansen with a pile of almost useless data.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAn AP video report here in German reports on the biggest Merapi eruption in 100 years, and what potentially lurks.
More than 122 people have been killed thus far as the volcano continues to blast clouds of ash into the atmosphere. Over 200,000 people have been evacuated from the area so far. Experts are uneasy. At the 3o sec. mark, the AP video reports:
In the meantime, speculation of a possible gigantic eruption is making the rounds. Although Merapi does not show it, there’s a risk of a mega-eruption at any time. A collapse of the mountain could cause movement of the huge magma reserve underneath. If the heavy rock mass above it were to disintegrate, the magma would be freed and could be blown out. But no expert wanted to make an exact prognosis.
As reported earlier here at this blog, experts estimate that a reservoir of magma three times the size of what was ejected by the mighty Tambora eruption of 1815 remains trapped under immense pressure underneath Merapi. Tambora had a Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) of 7 and led to global cooling, the year without a summer.
For now, it’s wait and see with Merapi.

The following video shows what kind of ticking “time bombs with hidden timers” that lurk beneath us.

"Jeremy Corbyn will urge MPs to take on their “historic duty” over climate change and back a Labour motion calling for the UK to declare a national environmental and climate-change emergency. Speaking in the wake of climate strikes by young people and the wave of protests by Extinction Rebellion, the Labour leader will open an opposition day debate on Wednesday by also seeking a so-called green industrial revolution to transform the economy.  “Today this house must declare an environment and climate emergency,” he will say, according to extracts of the speech released in advance. “We have no time to waste. We are living in a climate crisis that will spiral dangerously out of control unless we take rapid and dramatic action now.” The Labour motion would officially declare an environment and climate emergency, and pledge a response of “commensurate urgency”, including more rapid action to reduce climate emissions, a boost for renewable and low-impact transport and energy, and wider efforts to create a greener economy. With the issue in the public consciousness following the protests, and last week’s visit to parliament by the teenage Swedish activist, Greta Thunberg, who Corbyn met, there will be pressure for Conservative MPs to support the motion, or at least outline alternative plans. The environment secretary Michael Gove, who also saw Thunberg and met an Extinction Rebellion delegation on Tuesday, will respond for the government. Corbyn will argue that urgent action is needed in response to the justified concerns of young activists. “I was deeply moved a few weeks ago to see the streets outside this parliament filled with colour and noise by children on strike from school chanting, ‘Our planet, our future’,” he will say. “For someone of my generation, it was inspiring but also humbling that children felt they had to leave school to teach the adults a lesson. The truth is, they are ahead of the politicians on this, the most important issue of our times.” Describing Extinction Rebellion, whose activists blocked streets and bridges around London for days, as “a massive and necessary wake-up call”, Corbyn said: “Today, we have the opportunity to say: ‘We hear you.’ “Parliament rarely leads change, it usually drags its feet. Think about the huge transformations to our society: workers’ rights, women’s rights, gay rights. “The impetus has always come from outside, from social movements and communities, while Westminster is often the last place to understand it. Let’s not repeat that pattern. Let’s respond to the younger generation, who are raising the alarm. “By declaring a climate emergency, we could set off a wave of action from parliaments and governments around the world. It’s a chance that won’t be available to succeeding generations. It is our historic duty to take it,” he will say. The Labour leader will also call for significant investment in new technologies and green industries: “The hidden hand of the market is not going to save us. Technological solutions are not going to magically appear out of nowhere. “An emergency of this magnitude requires large-scale government intervention to kickstart industries, to direct investment and to boost research and development in the green technologies of the future. “The solution to the crisis is reprogramming our whole economy so that it works in the interests of both people and the planet. This is not a time for despair. It is a time for action.”"

Martin Durkin brings his latest swindle documentary: Britain’s Trillion Pound Horror Story. If you don’t remember Martin Durkin, he produced “The Great Global Warming Swindle”.
Personally I’d call it “The Trillion Pound Heist”. Sorry, but all these politicians who have irresponsibly run up the debt, not only in Britain, but elsewhere too, are a bunch of thieving bastards who ought to be locked up – if you’ll pardon my French.
A must watch for the big spenders in Washington, Berlin, Brussels, Paris,… too.

They looted from the next generations, and even unborn generations.
It’s no wonder they now want to rob us blind with their phony climate scam. “It’s only question of time before socialists run out of other people’s money to spend”. I think Maggie Thatcher said that.
UPDATE: Let me add a little more to this. Go to the 34 minute mark of this Mark Levin audio and listen to it. Listen to how Mark is calm – until the caller at about the 35:40 mark says the politicians ought to be ashamed of themselves. Note the amazing speed – within a tenth of second – at which Mark Levin reacts and is set off .
No, they should be in federal prison!”
Mark Levin’s reaction here is spot on. Bunch of crooks.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNASA has released its picture of the week, which is a graphic of global land temperature anomalies for the period July 4-11. Click here for details. What jump outs at me is the number of blue areas that have suddenly popped up on the continents. Where did they all come from?
We keep hearing about the NOAA’s record hot first half of 2010. and seeing these maps covered with all them red dots all them, like this one here for June (sure looks hot, doesn’t it?):
Surely one can see the differences. In some cases they are very dramatic. Compare:
1. Mexico / western North America
2. Greenland
3. Central and Saharan Africa
4. Almost all of Asia
5. Australia
Can the planet really cool that quickly?
You know what I think? I think the NOAA is producing a bunch of crap.
Curiously, the references cited by NASA above all refer to “scorching heatwaves” and “hotspots”. No mention of the cool or cold spots that seem to have the upper hand on the continents.
UPDATE: For more detail and light on this subject, Steve Goddard at WUWT has written up a great analysis, see: http://wattsupwiththat.com/2010/07/16/co2-optical-illusion/#comment-432509

"Robots replace truckers, sparking a protest movement that snowballs into violence. With just years to spare before a certain apocalypse, there is one chance left to survive climate change.  A small New Hampshire town far from any site of military importance is wiped out by a nuclear weapon on a snowy winter day. These scenarios might sound like they are borrowed from science fiction but they are among the warnings of doomsday, dystopia and war being shared by some of the Democratic party’s 2020 presidential candidates. In the 2016 presidential election, Donald Trump surged into office spreading paranoid warnings to voters that if he were not elected, the US would become a failed socialist state and that immigrants entering the country over the southern border would spread violence and disease – talking points he is warming up to repeat in his bid to stay in the White House. But some Democratic candidates are also outlining dramatic visions of impending doom. The Hawaii congresswoman and 2020 Democratic candidate Tulsi Gabbard had warned that if the Mueller report released this month had found that the president had colluded with Russia, it could have led to civil war. She has also frequently told campaign trail audiences that the US faces greater risk of nuclear catastrophe today than at any other point in history and has warned voters in places like New Hampshire that their home towns face the same threats of nuclear annihilation as her state of Hawaii, a state generally thought to be at risk in any potential nuclear conflict with North Korea and the site of a traumatising false ballistic missile alert last year. Across the board, Democratic candidates acknowledge climate change is an existential threat that must be addressed immediately. But several have gone so far as to put precise limits on how much time is left. Washington’s governor, Jay Inslee, who is running on a platform that would make climate change the nation’s top priority, has said that confronting climate change during the next presidential administration is our “one chance at survival”. For entrepreneur turned politician Andrew Yang, whose platform centres on protecting the country from the negative impacts of automation, America’s downfall could come when the technologies put even more people out of work and exacerbate economic inequality. In his book The War on Normal People, Yang warned that America was destined for a future as a science fiction-like dystopia or failed state if action was not taken. “To me, without dramatic change, the best-case scenario is a hyper-stratified society like something out of The Hunger Games or Guatemala with the occasional mass shooting,” he wrote. “The worst case is widespread despair, violence and the utter collapse of our society.” He goes on to imagine a scenario in which protesting truckers who lost their jobs to robots see armed white nationalists and anti-government groups rush to champion their cause, a move that sparks riots and violence across America’s heartland.  “Maybe the scenario I sketched above seems unlikely. To me, it seems depressingly plausible,” he wrote. Such rhetoric is dangerous, according to Sheri Berman, a political science professor at Columbia University’s Barnard College, who argues that it further polarises the public and makes addressing the very real problems at the base of these apocalyptic visions – climate change, political divide and nuclear proliferation – more difficult to agree on. “The idea that we’re facing civil war, nuclear apocalypse, environmental apocalypse - I think that’s neither empirically correct nor politically helpful,” said Berman. “It becomes increasingly difficult to see situations where compromise or reasonable policies on any of these issues could possibly be reached.” “I would first suggest that people take a deep breath, because automation has been with us throughout the modern era,” said Michael Belzer, a former truck driver who is an economics professor at Michigan’s Wayne State University. While automation could certainly change trucking, Belzer sees it as a gradual process. “The notion of an abrupt change I think is kind of wishful thinking on the part of the technology people,” he said. Darrell West, director of Governance Studies at the Brookings Institution and the author of The Future of Work: Robots, AI, and Automation, says job loss created by automation could create a “chaotic and turbulent” time economically and politically, putting even some white-collar jobs at risk. However, like Belzer, he does not see automation as immediate. “I don’t see [Yang’s] scenario taking place, just because the impact on the workforce is going to be more gradual,” he said. Amid heightened polarisation, as well as the rise of armed “patriot groups” and episodes of political violence like the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville in 2017, the idea that the US could see another civil war has re-emerged. Most talk of potential civil war has come from prominent rightwing internet, radio and television commentators. But as Gabbard shows, the idea is not confined to the right; even people like New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman have worried that the US may be destined for a conflict. According to a poll last year, 31% of Americans said it was likely there would be a civil war within the next five years, including 37% of Democrats. Steven Webster, a post-doctoral fellow at St Louis’s Washington University who researches political polarisation, said civil war remains unlikely. “It’s easy to shift opinions about some sort of legislation. But to actually follow through on something as costly as taking to the streets and engaging in violence? I don’t know, that seems like another step for me,” he said. However, Webster says the polarisation is only set to increase. “When voters are angry, they tend to vote loyally for their own party. So since elected officials are single-minded in their pursuit of re-election, they have incentive to stoke anger and heighten polarisation,” he said. Gabbard’s warnings did not emerge from a vacuum: Trump threatened nuclear war with North Korea in 2017 and experts have warned that Pyongyang’s ballistic missiles are now capable of hitting all parts of the continental United States. Since those warnings, tensions have cooled somewhat, with Trump holding two summits with North Korea’s Kim Jong-un. Vipin Narang, a professor of political science and a nuclear proliferation expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, says that in contrast with Gabbard’s statements, the US and the world faced a much greater threat of nuclear catastrophe during the cold war. “We probably have more flash points [today], but we traded a smaller risk of a world-ending event for maybe a larger chance of nuclear use,” he said. Among 2020 candidates – and indeed the scientific community – there is unanimity in the view that climate change is real, manmade and poses an existential risk. There is, however, disagreement surrounding the cutoff points for action. Authors of the United Nations report that Beto O’Rourke seemed to be citing when he said the world had 12 years left to take action on climate change told the Associated Press that 2030 was used as a benchmark, not as a cutoff point for action. “The earth does not reach a cliff at 2030 or 2052,” one author told the AP. But “keep adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere and temperatures will continue to rise”. That said, climate scientists across the world have been urging the US and other nations to take immediate action on combatting climate change."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe drop in Arctic sea ice in the last years caused many to fret over a possible tipping point, after which melting would be unstoppable.
However, new findings from the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology show this is highly unlikely. What follows is the Press Release in English:

Hope for the Arctic sea ice
Recent finding show that there is no no such a tipping point for the loss of Arctic summer ice. Instead the ice area responds relative to the climatic conditions at hand. The ongoing loss of Arctic sea ice could slow down or even stop when global warming slows down or stops. Steffen Tietsche, lead author in the study published this by Geophysical Research Letters [1], said he was at first quite surprised by the findings:
‘The possible existence of a tipping point first appears to be completely logical: When the ice cover retreats, the sea water absorbs more sunlight and so it warms up even more, and more ice melts. Such a feedback in priciple leads to an amplification of the Arctic sea ice melt and thus make it independent of the prevailing climate conditions.’
The scientists examined the validity of this concept with a climate model. In this model they completely removed the Arctic ice cover at the beginning of summer in order to maximise the absorption of sunlight by the open water.
‘Indeed we expected that the Ocean would remain ice free after the modelled ice melt because the open water takes up more warmth in the summer,’ said Tietsche. But unexpectedly, the ice sheet always recovered in the model simulation within three years so that the conditions that prevailed before the modelled ice melt were again re-established. These results indicate that the condition of the sea ice is closely connected to the prevailing climate conditions, thus making a tipping point improbable.
The scientists discovered the process that allows the recovery of ice: During the winter, the ocean loses most of the heat absorbed during the summer. Becauseof the missing ice that otherwise would serve as an insulator, heat loss becomes very efficient as the open ocean is in direct contact with the cold atmosphere. In addition the very thin ice grows very quickly because it is more poorly insulated than thick ice. The heat that is given from the ocean through the thin ice then leads to a stronger thermal radiation by the atmosphere into space and also to a reduced heat transport from the south into the Arctic.

The combination of these two stabilizing feedbacks is stronger than the destabilizing feedback from the additional absorption of sunlight by exposed water in the summer time. The study by the Max Planck scientists confirms research conducted by US scientists using a much simpler model [2].
This model agreement of two completely different levels of complexity usually means that the results are reliable,’ says Jochem Marotzke, Director at the Max-Planck-Institute and co-author of the new study.
[Now comes the MPI religious confirmation of AGW belief – necessary for further funding]
The scientists emphasize that their findings do not question the dramatic loss of Arctic sea ice because of man-made climate change. ‘If we do not greatly slow down global warming, then the Arctic will be ice-free in the summertime in a few decades,’ says Tietsche. ‘Our research shows that the speed at which the sea ice is retreating is closely related to the rate of global warming. Our work does underscore, however, that we can still slow down and even stop the loss of Arctic sea ice.’ “
Summary:
Firstly, forget the scary tipping points. The laws of thermodynamics and heat transfer say it isn’t possible. The tipping point was the figment of alarmist scientists’ imaginations gone wild. That we pretty much knew already. Secondly, the temperatures in the Arctic govern the melting and freezing of the ice. If the globe cools naturally, then the ice will recover. And thirdly there’s no new data to show that CO2 is the cause of the recent Arctic melt. Remember, the last 30 years show the opposite in Antarctica.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Swiss online NZZ here  has a report on the peer-review process and the problems plaguing it. Peer-review has become a leading topic in science in Europe and all over the world. The NZZ starts off:
Irritated by multiple scandals over the last years, many scientists are up in arms over the peer-review of scientific articles and are hoping for improvement.
Many say there’s a need for reform.

Cartoon Source: http://medinfo.netbib.de/archives/2009/01/23/2975
Scientists say manipulation is as easy as pie.As a whole, the field of science is becoming overwhelmed by the flood of papers seeking publication. The NZZ writes that according to a Finnish study, already in 2006  1.35 million peer-reviewed papers were published, and the trend is accelerating.
And it is unclear whether the current large-scale peer-review process yields the correct, important results every time. Also publishers and peer-reviewers can make mistakes, as hanky panky like copying text and manipulating charts is especially easy in today’s computer age.
The NZZ does not name any particluar science field here, or anywhere else in the report. But for those familiar with climate science and the CRU e-mails, it sounds all too familiar.
The topic of peer-review has gained much importance over the years, as it’s the lifeblood of scientific careers. That’s one reason why the recent European Science Forum in Turin in early July was so jammed pack.
The NZZ asks: Is the current system the best we have?
Based on a 2009 study by Adrian Mulligan of Elsevier publishing, the NZZ reports that one third of the scientists replied with yes, one third with no, and the other third were undecided. The survey sampled 4000 scientists.

With those results one could reasonably assume that half are not really convinced by the peer-review process. That tells me it needs to be reformed. There are many problems with it. The NZZ mentions some of them.
For example, some scientists say that papers do not even get reviewed by experienced scientists, but are often passed down to younger, less experienced colleagues who don’t really know how to do it.
The NZZ writes about being able to reproduce results:
Increasingly, peer reviewers are no longer able to reproduce the results of studies on their own – because the time and effort simply would be too much. Philip Campbell of Nature brought up that point in Turin.
Campbell says errors will always get by peer-reviewers, and sometimes even outright fraud. But that’s rarely the case, as studies such as one from Daniele Fanelli of the University of Edinburgh 2009 in the journal PLoS ONE shows. NZZ writes:
According to the results, an average of 2% of scientists admitted to having made at least one falsification. And up to 34% admit to having committed a dubious act.
Plagiarism is another problem. Fortunately, plagiarism-recognition software such as CrossCheck help to detect plagiarism. The software is based on publication data-banks.
Diagram manipulation is detected using the algorithms in programs for graphic processing. Other offences committed include ghostwriting, including co-authors who did not take part in the study and salami publication.
In my view, the NZZ report places too much of the blame on the sheer volume of papers that need to be reviwed and on human nature, and completely ignores the political aspects that have corrupted the process.
But in the end, its conclusion is correct: Peer-review needs to be reformed, as for now there is no other alternative system available.
